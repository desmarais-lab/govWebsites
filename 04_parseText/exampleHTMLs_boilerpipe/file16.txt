The City of St. Louis Treasurer's Office will conduct a town hall meeting to give the public the chance to meet the vendors participating in the parking technology field tests in downtown and the Central West End.
The meeting will be June 24 at the Central Library in downtown. A meet and greet with the vendors will take place at 6 pm, with a presentation to begin at 7 pm. The companies participating in the town hall are: Xerox, Duncan Solutions, Aparc Systems, and a joint proposal submitted by T2 Systems, Inc., Republic Parking System and Digital Payment Technologies.
The parking technology field tests are part of an ongoing effort to modernize operations. The goal is to provide St. Louis with a cost-effective on-street parking system that allows people to use cash, credit cards and mobile phones to pay for parking.
The field test evaluation sites are located on 10th Street between Chestnut and Washington Avenue and at the corner of Broadway and Pine in downtown St. Louis and at Maryland and Euclid and Laclede and Euclid in the Central West End. The smart phone applications being tested are Parkmobile and Passport Parking.
"Public feedback is important as we bring the parking operations into the 21st century," said Tishaura O. Jones, Treasurer of the City of St. Louis. "This town hall gives everyone the chance to meet the vendors and share their thoughts on what a first class parking operation looks like for the city."
