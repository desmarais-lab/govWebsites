<p>A complaint was filed on June 22, 1982 with the Madison Equal Opportunities
Commission, alleging discrimination on the basis of race in regard to
employment. Said complaint was investigated by MEOC Investigator Mary Pierce and
an Initial Determination, dated October 18, 1982, was issued concluding that
probable cause existed to believe that discrimination had occurred or was
occurring as alleged.</p>
<p>Conciliation failed and/or was waived, and the matter was certified to
hearing. A public hearing was held commencing on August 2, 1983. Attorney Larry
E. Rubin of the <b>KEN HUR LEGAL CLINIC</b> appeared tin behalf of the
Complainant who also appeared in person; Attorney John Zawadsky of <b>MELLI,
SHIELS, WALKER, and PEASE, S. C.</b> appeared on behalf of the Respondent who
also appeared by employee-representative John Peckham. Based on the record of
the hearing and after consideration of any (timely-filed) written post-hearing
arguments submitted by the parties (a brief was submitted on behalf of the
Respondent, but none was submitted by the Complainant), the Examiner proposes
the following Recommended Decision:</p>
<p class="EOCHeadings">RECOMMENDED FINDINGS OF FACT</p>
<ol>
  <li>The Complainant, Elias Goldsberry, is an adult, black male residing in the
    State of Wisconsin.</li>
  <li>The Respondent, Chemlawn Corporation, is an employer doing business in the
    City of Madison, State of Wisconsin.</li>
  <li>The Complainant was hired by the Respondent for a &quot;part-time&quot;
    job as a truck helper to assist lawn specialists in providing lawn care
    services. &quot;Part-time&quot; employees worked approximately forty (40)
    hours per week, but were hired on a temporary basis, usually not to exceed
    ninety (90) days. &quot;Full-time&quot; employees were those employees hired
    on a permanent basis.</li>
  <li>The Complainant was told by the Respondent about the temporary nature of
    his employment at the time of his hire, and the Complainant was also
    informed that one or two more &quot;full-time&quot; lawn specialists
    positions might open in the near future. The Complainant expressed interest
    in a full-time opening,&quot; full-time&quot; referring (among other things)
    to a permanent position.</li>
  <li>The Complainant was also informed by the Respondent that he would earn
    $4.50 an hour to start as a truck helper, with a $0.50 per hour raise
    effective upon completion of his training. In response to a question by the
    Complainant, the Respondent informed him, during an interview preceding his
    hire, that a full-time lawn specialist would start at $255.00 per week.</li>
  <li>The Complainant began work for the Respondent on April 15, 1982.</li>
  <li>The Complainant was the only black employee ever hired by the Respondent
    through the time of his discharge on May 3, 1982 at the Madison branch.</li>
  <li>On April 23, 1982, the Complainant asked the Respondent's Office Manager,
    Peggy Gulan, for his pay check. He knew that another part-time employee,
    Chris Lewis, had received his check. Lewis, who was white, had been hired
    approximately a week before the Complainant.</li>
  <li>Gulan informed the Complainant that none of the truck helpers who had
    started the same week as the Complainant had yet received their check. The
    Complainant then became angry and shouted at Gulan. The Complainant then
    left the office.</li>
  <li>On April 28, 1982, the Respondent made a decision to hire Todd King, who
    was white, as a full-time lawn specialist. King had been working as a
    part-time truck helper. The Respondent also decided to give the Complainant
    and two other part-time truck helpers a $0.50 raise. Also, still two other
    truck helpers, who were both white, were not given a raise at this time.</li>
  <li>On April 29, 1982, Branch Manager Lange and Assistant Manager Peckham met
    with the Complainant to inform him of the raise. At that time, the
    Complainant said he thought he had been making $255.00 a week. Lange then
    told the Complainant that he (the Complainant) was mistaken, that he (the
    Complainant) was a truck helper, and that he had been told that he was
    making $4.50 an hour and if he worked out he would receive a raise to $5.00
    an hour. Lange also explained that $255.00 per week was paid to
    &quot;full-time&quot; lawn specialists. At the end of that conservation, the
    Complainant said that he guessed he knew that he was only being paid $4.50
    an hour.</li>
  <li>On April 30, 1982, the Complainant returned from working in the field and
    arrived at the office about 4:00 p.m. He came into the office and asked
    Julie Wittig, an office worker, for his check. Wittig gave the Complainant a
    check for the first week of his employment. The Complainant thought he had
    two checks coming and asked Wittig to look for the second one. The
    Complainant was talking in a loud voice, but was not shouting. Wittig looked
    again and told the Complainant there were no other checks for him.<br>
    A short while later, the Complainant came back and asked Wittig who had
    taken his time slip. Wittig said that she hadn't. The Complainant insisted
    that someone had taken his time slip. Wittig responded that it was probably
    there (by the time card machine). The Complainant said that he had already
    looked there and that somebody had taken his time slip. Wittig went over to
    the time card machine and found the time slip in the crevice between the
    payroll tray and the wall.</li>
  <li>The Complainant then went to Lange and Peckham's office. The door was open
    and the Complainant knocked on the door and then came into the office. The
    Complainant did not wait for Peckham to give him permission to enter.<br>
    As the Complainant came in, he closed the door. The Complainant then started
    to walk toward Peckham who was seated behind his desk. The Complainant was
    yelling at Peckham, questioning him on why he (the Complainant) did not
    receive his check. Peckham started to explain to the Complainant that the
    check (the second check) took two weeks to arrive. The Complainant had begun
    shouting and demanding his money (now).</li>
  <li>The Complainant continued to advance toward Peckham. As he advanced, he
    was shouting about his check and his money. Peckham began pushing his chair
    away from the Complainant as the Complainant was advancing. Peckham's chair
    hit his desk. The Complainant was towering over Peckham and Peckham stood
    up. The Complainant was now 6 inches from Peckham's face and continued to
    shout directly in Peckham's face.</li>
  <li>Peckham began to explain that it was already past 5:00 p.m. in Columbus
    (Ohio) where the Company's main accounting office was located. He indicated
    that he could not do anything for the Complainant. The Complainant
    nevertheless continued to demand his money and then asked if Peckham could
    take some money out of petty cash. Peckham responded that it was against
    company policy to take money from petty cash, but the Complainant renewed
    his demand. Peckham then promised the Complainant that he would try to get
    his check expedited. Finally, the Complainant shrugged his shoulders and
    left.</li>
  <li>Lange returned to the office later. At that time Peckham explained what
    had occurred between he and the Complainant regarding the Complainant's
    check. Peckham then recommended the Complainant's termination. Lange
    concurred in that recommendation.<br>
    Shortly thereafter, the Complainant returned to the Respondent's offices.
    Lange intercepted the Complainant as he entered and asked him to go outside.
    The Complainant and Lange then went outside. The Complainant and Lange had a
    conversation during which the Complainant became angry and began shouting.
    The Complainant accused Peckham and Lange of being liars and said that
    Peckham and Gulan's statements that the Complainant had engaged in verbal
    abuse were &quot;bullshit&quot;.<br>
    At the conclusion of the discussion, the Complainant said as he left,
    &quot;Your ass sucks wind, Lange. I'll see you in court.&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p class="EOCHeadings">RECOMMENDED CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</p>
<ol>
  <li>The Complainant is a member of the protected class of race within the
    meaning of Section 3.23, Madison General Ordinances.</li>
  <li>The Respondent is an employer doing business in the City of Madison within
    the meaning of Section 3.23, Madison General Ordinances.</li>
  <li>The Complainant was not discriminated against by the Respondent on the
    basis of the Complainant's race in regard to discharge from employment in
    violation of Section 3.23, Madison General Ordinances.</li>
</ol>
<p class="EOCHeadings">RECOMMENDED ORDER</p>
<p>That this case be and hereby is dismissed.</p>
<p class="EOCHeadings">MEMORANDUM DECISION</p>
<p>Essentially, the Complainant's version of the facts is not credible and is
certainly not sufficient to carry the Complainant's burden of proof.</p>
<p>The Respondent has raised certain objections which, in light of my decision
finding no discrimination, are not crucial to the outcome of the case. However,
I will discuss some of those objections after discussing the merits of the case.</p>
<p class="EOCHeadings">MEMORANDUM OPINION</p>
<p>I. MERITS OF THE CASE</p>
<p>Essentially, the Complainant <u>did not</u> carry his ultimate burden of
persuasion to prove that racially discriminatory reason(s) more likely motivated
the employer than the employer's articulated, non-discriminatory reason(s) or
that the employer's pro-offered reason(s) is unworthy of credence.<sup><a href="#f1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The Respondent's version of the facts, supported in various parts by up to
three witnesses, is on the whole found to be more credible than the
Complainant's version of the facts (supported solely by his own testimony).
Specifically, the Complainant denied ever having raised his voice during the
first paycheck incident (see Finding of Fact 9) and further denied manifesting
any intimidating behavior toward Peckham and having become angry at Lange (see
Findings of Fact 13 through 16). The Complainant's testimony is simply not
supported by the weight of the evidence on the record.</p>
<p>Finding the Respondent's version of the disputed facts to be credible, the
primary issue is whether the Complainant was nevertheless treated differently
from the manner in which non-black employees were or would have been treated in
regard to discharge. The only evidence in the record of an employee who had
received warnings prior to discharge was evidence regarding a white employee,
David Laubacher. Laubacher, a lawn specialist and carpet cleaning specialist for
the Respondent hired in June of 1981, had previously worked for a Chicago branch
and was considered by the Respondent to have had more than three years of
continuous employment<sup><a href="#f2">2</a></sup> at the time of his discharge in March of 1983.
Laubaeher was terminated after exhibiting unacceptable conduct on several
occasions, the most recent (prior to his termination) having been to verbally
attack a receptionist at Wisconsin Office Supply. Laubacher had been counseled
regarding earlier offenses prior to his termination.</p>
<p>The Respondent contends that Laubacher was a &quot;full-time&quot; or
permanent employee (as opposed to the Complainant who was considered
&quot;part-time&quot; or temporary) and was, therefore, subject to different
disciplinary rules requiring progressive discipline prior to termination. In
addition, the Respondent presented evidence of at least one white employee,
employed as a &quot;part-time&quot; truck helper (like the Complainant), who was
terminated without previous warning for a work-related offense(s).<sup><a href="#f3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>This case, then, is distinguishable from <u>Morgan v. Community Action
Commission</u>, MEOC #2642 (Examiner's Decision, 2/12/82). In Morgan I held that
the Madison Equal Opportunities Ordinance, while it may permit discharge without
a warning, will not tolerate discriminatory application of a warning (or
discharge) policy or practice.<sup><a href="#f4">4</a></sup> <u>Morgan</u> also involved the
discharge of a black employee over a paycheck dispute (although the facts in <u>Morgan</u>
are otherwise somewhat different than in this case). However, the Complainant in
<u>Morgan</u> carried his burden of persuasion to show that his discharge was
discriminatory by showing that (even if one believed the Respondent's version of
certain disputed facts) white employees who had committed more serious or
comparable offenses were discharged only after progressive discipline or after
having committed repeated violations or were not disciplined at all.</p>
<p>In the case at hand, the Complainant failed to show that he was treated
differently from non-black employees in respect to discharge. Further, the
Respondent, as discussed above, presented evidence that at least one other
&quot;part-time&quot; employee had been terminated without prior warning while
the Complainant presented no evidence that other &quot;part-time&quot; employees
had received warnings prior to termination.</p>
<p>And the Complainant presented no evidence to rebut the Respondent's
contention that Laubacher, as a &quot;full-time&quot; employee, was subject to a
different set of disciplinary rules or to otherwise show that his discharge was
discriminatory.<sup><a href="#f5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>II. PROCEDURAL MATTERS</p>
<p>While the various objections raised by the Respondent at different times
during the hearing need not all be addressed here, particularly in light of the
outcome of this case on the merits, I will address some specific points at this
time.</p>
<p>A. The Examiner's Discretion in Ruling on the Respondent's Motion to Dismiss
for (The Complainant's) Failure to Establish a <u>Prima Facie</u> Case of (Race)
Discrimination.</p>
<p>The Respondent, in Footnote 5 of its brief, argues that the Examiner erred in
not ruling on its motion, in the midst of hearing (after the Complainant rested)
to dismiss for failure to establish a <u>prima facie</u> case of (race)
discrimination. The Respondent cites <u>U. S. Postal Service Board of Governors
v. Aikens</u>, 103 S.Ct. 1478, 31 EPD 33,477 (1983). <u>Aikens</u> simply does <u>not</u>
support the Respondent's argument.<sup><a href="#f6">6</a></sup></p>
<p><u>Aikens</u> holds, instead, that where a judge (or Examiner) has allowed
all the evidence into the record (the Respondent's as well as the Complainant's
evidence), the court should then be concerned with whether or not the
Complainant has met his/her <u>ultimate</u> burden of persuasion to establish
that unlawful discrimination has occurred rather than with the Complainant's <u>interim</u>
burden of persuasion (to establish a <u>prima facie</u> case).</p>
<p>There is nothing in <u>Aikens</u> to buttress the Respondent's contention
that the Examiner could not take the Respondent's motion under advisement (the
effective equivalent of not ruling on the Respondent's motion) which allowed the
Examiner to consider further evidence. The Examiner virtually always has the
discretion to take interim motions of any kind under advisement.</p>
<p>B. The Examiner's Discretion to Call Witnesses</p>
<p>The Respondent objected to the Examiner having called Peckham (the
Respondent's employee-representative) to testify. The Respondent claimed, for
various reasons, that such action compromised the Examiner's neutrality.<sup><a href="#f7">7</a></sup></p>
<p>To the contrary, the Examiner finds that in an EOC administrative proceeding
the Examiner has the discretion, rising often to the standard of a duty, to call
witnesses (as well as to examine and cross-examine witnesses) in order to elicit
and to clarify testimony which (s)he deems necessary to the clear presentation
of the issues, regardless of whether any or all parties are represented by
counsel.</p>
<p>In the first place, <u>none</u> of the cases cited by the Respondent support
its contention that a trier of fact (the Examiner) compromises his/her
neutrality simply by calling a witness. Instead, all of the cases cited (both
state and federal) recognize the judge's (Examiner's) discretion to do so. Also,
the cases cited by the Respondent virtually all involved jury trials (mostly
criminal, some civil), all parties were presumably represented by counsel, and
the appellate courts urged caution by the trial judges in exercising the
discretion to call and/or examine witnesses because of the influence that the
trier of fact may have on the jury (by excessive questioning, improper use of
leading questions, prejudicial remarks, facial expressions, implied threats to
witnesses and so on). In addition, some of these cases expressed a concern that
attorneys would be reluctant to object to the judge's questions (particularly in
the presence of a jury).</p>
<p>Despite the concerns expressed in the cases cited by the Respondent, few were
reversed because a judge had called or questioned witnesses. Most were upheld,
and the majority support the following expression of the law on this point
stated in <u>U.S. v. Brandt</u> 196 F.2d 653:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A trial judge . . . is more than a mere &quot;moderator&quot;. . . but (s)he
  is decidedly not a &quot;prosecuting attorney&quot;. . . s(he) enjoys the
  prerogative, rising often to the standard of duty, of eliciting those facts
  s(he) deems necessary to clear presentation of the issues . . . to this end (s)he
  may call witnesses on his (her) own motion, adduce evidence, and . . . examine
  those who testify.<sup><a href="#f8">8</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Further, the Examiner in an administrative proceeding (such as an EOC
discrimination hearing) has even more discretion to call and/or examine
witnesses than a trial judge in a criminal or civil jury trial. As there is no
jury in these administrative proceedings, the concerns about influencing a jury
are eliminated.<sup><a href="#f9">9</a></sup> Additionally, the attorneys were specifically
advised prior to the commencement of the Examiner's questioning of Mr. Peckham
that they were free to make whatever objections they had (at any time during the
course of the questioning).<sup><a href="#f10">10</a></sup> Also, an administrative Examiner has
presumably developed special expertise in the particular area of the law related
to the case s/he hears and consequently is in at least as desirable position as
a judge to determine which issues need to be brought into the record in order to
make a fair and informed decision in a particular case.</p>
<p>Finally, the law is clear that a party who accuses an Examiner of bias is
left with the burden of proving such bias.<sup><a href="#f11">11</a></sup> The Respondent's only
claim appears to be that the Examiner was biased by calling a witness (Mr.
Peckham). Not even the Respondent's own citations back up its argument. The mere
calling (and examining) of a witness does not establish bias on the part of the
Examiner; rather it is within the Examiner's discretion (and in some instances,
duty). Further, the Respondent alleges nothing from the record regarding the
Examiner's conduct that would support a finding of bias. This is because, in
this Examiner's view, there is nothing in the record to support the Respondent's
allegations of bias. The Examiner simply acted within his discretion, in a fair
and impartial manner, in calling a witness to elicit facts he deemed necessary
to the clear presentation of issues in this case (and the Examiner would urge
the Respondent to read the law in this area with greater diligence before making
accusations of this nature in the future).</p>
<p>C. It Was Not Error to Deny the Respondent's Motions to Quash Examiner's
Exhibit 1 and Such Evidence Could Be Let In for Whatever Probative Value It Had</p>
<p>The Respondent objected to the introduction of Examiner's Exhibit 1 on the
grounds of relevance. A document prepared by the Respondent and regarding a
white employee who had been discharged only after several recurrences of
unsatisfactory behavior is surely relevant in a case where a black employee is
alleging disparate treatment after
being discharged without counseling or warning while the white employee had been
counseled.</p>
<p>(The Respondent did, however, adequately explain that Laubacher's employment
status as a &quot;full-time&quot; employee required that a different set of
disciplinary rules be applied than to the Complainant, who was a
&quot;part-time&quot; employee, and the Complainant failed to show this
explanation to be pretextual.)</p>
<p>D. The Respondent's Objections to the Admission of Examiner's Exhibit 1</p>
<p>The Respondent continues to object to the admission of Examiner's Exhibit One
on the grounds of authenticity. Yet, Atty. Zawadsky stated on the record that he
had no objection to the authenticity of the exhibits because he was going to
present them if it became necessary to present his case. This statement alone
not only clouds any continuing objection the Respondent may have as to
authenticity, but also casts doubt as to the validity of any of the Respondent's
additional objections regarding foundation for introduction (and receipt) and
scope.<sup><a href="#f12">12</a></sup> Given the outcome of the case, it serves no usefulness to
belabor each technical point at this time.</p>
<p>In closing, the Complainant's case on the merits was simply not persuasive
(and the weakness of the Respondent's various procedural objections are of
little consequence given the outcome on the merits).</p>

2. The Respondent did not consider, for its internal purposes, that an apparent
gap in Laubacher's employment was significant. Laubacher had, apparently, not
begun working in Madison immediately after he ceased working for the Respondent
in Chicago. The significance of being a (full-time) three-year employee,
according to Peckham's testimony, is that the regional manager had to be
informed of his termination. On page 17 of the Respondent's brief, it is stated
that &quot;termination of a full-time employee had to be documented to the
regional manager.&quot; This does not seem to be consistent with Peckham's
testimony, which is to the effect that full-time employees were entitled to
progressive discipline, but only (full-time) employees with three years or more
of service were required to have their termination documented to the regional
manager.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"><a name="f3"></a>3. Bob Johnson, a white truck helper, was terminated without prior warning
(or counseling) for leaving work without permission and refusing to wash trucks.
While this evidence is a little probative on the Respondent's behalf, it is more
probative that the Complainant did not present any evidence that any white
employees were treated differently (except Laubacher, for which the Respondent
had an adequate explanation).</font></p>
<p><font size="2"><a name="f4"></a>4. See also <u>McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transportation Company</u>, 427
U.S. 273 (1976).</font></p>
<p><font size="2"><a name="f5"></a>5. The Complainant attempted to show racial animus on the part of the
Respondent by alleging that the Respondent treated him in a discriminatory
manner (1) because he had a white &quot;girlfriend,&quot; (2) because he was
required to report to work at 6:00 a.m. when others were not, (3) because he was
not notified of a company party, and (4) because he was told to not park in the
parking lot (while other white employees allegedly did). The Respondent
addresses these issues at pp. 12-15 of its brief. Without adopting each and
every point of the Respondent's arguments, I do find that the evidence simply
failed to support any of these four suballegations in order to establish any
racial animus on the part of the Respondent (which may have been probative of
the discharge issue).</font></p>
<p><font size="2"><a name="f6"></a>6. In <u>Aikens</u>, a Federal District Court allowed all of the evidence
into the record (consequently, if any interim motion to dismiss were made, it
was denied or taken under advisement). A motion to dismiss was made after all
the evidence was in. In rendering its decision in the matter, the District Court
apparently ruled that the Complainant had failed to establish a <u>prima facie</u>
case. A federal Court of Appeals reversed, determining the District Court had
applied too stringent a standard to the Complainant regarding proving a <u>prima
facie</u> case.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">The U.S. Supreme Court reversed and remanded, stating that the lower courts
should not have been bogged down, once all the evidence had been let in, with
whether or not a <u>prima facie</u> case had been established. Rather, the
court(s) should simply decide the ultimate case (whether the Complainant had
carried the burden of proof on the discrimination issues). While the Supreme
Court appears to agree that no discrimination had occurred in <u>Aikens</u> the
case was remanded to assure that the law had been applied properly as the prima
facie case burden had been improperly analyzed).</font></p>
<p><font size="2">If on point at all, <u>Aikens</u> runs contra to the Respondent's assertion
that the Examiner essentially had no discretion to take its interim motion under
advisement and let all the evidence in before deciding.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"><a name="f7"></a>7. See Footnote 5 of the Respondent's brief where the Respondent states
various objections to the Examiner's having called Peckham (<u>none</u> of which
are supported by the case law, including that law cited by the Respondent).</font></p>
<p><font size="2"><a name="f8"></a>8. In addition to the fact that even the cases cited by the Respondent
support a judge's or Examiner's discretion to call and/or examine witnesses (<u>U.S.
v. Marzano</u>, 149 F. 2d 923, <u>U.S. v. Karnes</u>, 531 F. 2d 214, <u>U.S. v.
