# govWebsites

To-do for the next few days:

1. Make sure that the way I am currently filtering the Census data doesn't cause any problems. At the very least, MA and TX need to be 100% correct.
2. Clean up the messy code, .tex file, update makefile, etc.
3. Scrape all MA and TX .gov websites with Ruby package using ACI
