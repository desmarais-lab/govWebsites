Henderson, Nev. – The City of Henderson is set to install a storm drain conduit at the intersection of Center Street, Burkholder Boulevard and Major Avenue. Work will take place January 2-6 and the following lane restrictions and detours will be necessary to accommodate the project. 
• Burkholder Boulevard – traffic traveling west can only turn right or left onto Major Avenue. For traffic traveling east, the intersection will be closed and a detour will be provided at Collins.
• Major Avenue – traffic traveling north and south can cross the intersection and remain on Major or turn east onto Burkholder Boulevard. 
• Center Street – traffic traveling south can only turn right onto Burkholder Boulevard.
