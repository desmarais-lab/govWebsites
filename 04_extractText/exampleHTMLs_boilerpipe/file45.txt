Greater Madison Jazz Consortium debuts its new original music concert series at Madison’s Central Library this April with the first of four concerts by local jazz musicians, featuring pianist Paul Hastil - performing with guitarist Louka Patenaude, bassist Nick Moran, and drummer Michael Brenneis.
 
The InDIGenous series offers performances by local musicians as well as musicians from throughout the upper Midwest in an effort to build reciprocal relationships with presenters and creating new performance opportunities for local musicians elsewhere in the region.
 
All concerts are free and open to the public, include two sets of music, and a cash bar provided by Forequarter.
 
InDIGenous is funded by the Greater Madison Jazz Consortium, with support from WYOU, WORT, Isthmus, and Full Compass. For more info on InDIGenous and upcoming jazz events, go to http://www.madisonpubliclibrary.org/jazz
