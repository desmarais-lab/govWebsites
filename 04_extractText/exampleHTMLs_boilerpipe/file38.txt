Homan/Grand Trunk TIF
Designation: 1993    Terminated: 2012
At the time of its designation, the Homan/Grand Trunk TIF consisted of an unused rail yard and abandoned railroad right-of-ways. The TIF was designated to foster the site's redevelopment for viable industrial distribution facilities that contribute to job creation and business vitality within the Gage Park community. Additional priorities include the creation of off-street loading facilities, adequate parking for area workers, and adequate buffer areas and landscaping with adjacent land uses. TIF funds are targeted for site assembly and preparation, street and utility improvements, and related developer incentives.
