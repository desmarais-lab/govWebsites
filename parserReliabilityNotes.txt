index.html -- Everything works, contains a lot of website elements, the words in some which are separated by underscores rather than whitespaces.
index.html -- Did not get parsed at all. However, the site consists basically only of links (i.e. html alone is not enough), as well as a 'you are now leaving the website of..."
index.html -- Mostly works, website does not even display correctly with html. Language drop-down menu is messed up.
index.html -- Appears to be an xml file, and thus does not get parsed at all.
index.html -- Mostly works, but the whitespaces in the titles often come out as underscores.

index.html -- Everything works, but as usual, non-main text elements are separated by underscores.

HTML not being enough to display the whole website (i.e. because of Javascript, etc.) is a frequent problem. 2 of those sites do not get parsed at all. Also, a few of the sites are just forms without text. Furthermore, in all cases, website elements (as opposed to the main body text) are separated by underscores rather than whitespaces. However, the words in text bodies are correctly parsed in all cases.
