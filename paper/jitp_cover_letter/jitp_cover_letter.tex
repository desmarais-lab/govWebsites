We are very excited for the opportunity to have our manuscript entitled, ``Government Websites As Data:  A methodological pipeline with application to the websites of municipalities in the United States,'' considered for publication at {\em The Journal of Information Technology \& Politics}.  We introduce a novel methodological pipeline, along with statistical software that we have developed, for automatically scraping and processing substantive text from large sets of government websites. Our contribution lies in the fact that our methodology is capable of cutting through heterogeneous file types and site organizations to extract substantively meaningful and representative blocks of plain text. We illustrate this methodology with an application to a large sample of the websites of U.S. municipal governments, and find that the textual content of websites varies systematically with the partisanship of the mayor.

We have presented our work in the form of a Workbench Note. As JITP readers and contributors are likely to engage with research problems that involve the collection of website contents, we see JITP as an ideal outlet in which to publish our research. We appreciate your consideration of our work, and welcome feedback on our manuscript.

\closing{Sincerely,}
