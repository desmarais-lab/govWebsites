Executive Summary
FISCAL ENVIRONMENT
2012 Revenue Surprise
The fiscal position of the Consolidated City of Indianapolis, Marion County entering the 2013 budget cycle was substantially different than anticipated
when the 2012 budget was adopted due to two (2) significant revenue surprises ± a lower than expected property tax circuit breaker loss and a major
correction to local income tax distributions from the State.
Based on final 2012 property tax levies for all Marion County taxing units, as approved by the State Department of Local Government Finance
(DLGF), the property tax circuit breaker loss for all taxing units was 23% less than projected for the 2012 budget. This was due mainly to approved
2012 school district levies for debt service and capital projects being much lower than expected. As a result, the combined 2012 property tax collections
IRUWKH&RQVROLGDWHG&LW\¶V seven (7) property tax-supported operating funds are now estimated to be $9.7 million higher than budgeted.
As for local income tax revenue, a major revelation occurred in April 2012 when the State Office of Management & Budget (OMB) announced that
$207 million in local income tax collections, due to counties, had been mistakenly under-reported by the State Department of Revenue. As a result,
State distributions of local income tax to counties for all of 2011 and through April 2012 had been too low. For the Consolidated City, this error
corrections means that 2012 income tax revenue will be $46.6 million higher than budgeted ($17.7 million attributable to reporting errors that lowered
our 2011 actual revenue; $28.9M attributable to reporting errors affecting our 2012 expected revenue).
Together, these revenue surprises have re-established operating fund balances that were previously projected to be substantially depleted by the end of
2012. In fact, $30 million of the income tax error correction amount was deposited in our Rainy Day Fund. Furthermore, the income tax error
correction also revealed that our underlying local income base was a bit stronger than previously assumed. When adjusted for the error correction, the
Consolidated &LW\¶VQRUPDOL]HGORFDOLQFRPHWD[UHYHQXHGHFOLQHVLQFHWKH$281 million peak in 2010 is now $57 million (20% decline) instead of
an $85 million drop (31% decline) anticipated when the 2012 budget was adopted.
2013 Fiscal Conditions
Despite the good news of bolstered operating fund balances and a stronger income tax base, the Consolidated City still faces a very challenging fiscal
environment for 2013. Put in broader context, the $57 million drop in income tax revenue is equal to approximately 10% of our 2012 adopted general
operating fund budget of $568.6 million. Thus, we enter the 2013 budget season with an operating budget gap of $65 million (comparing 2013
projected base operating costs to 2013 projected baseline revenue).
Expectations for both property tax revenue and local income tax revenue are essentially flat for 2013. In fact, 2013 baseline revenue for both property
tax and local income tax are down slightly from the latest estimates for 2012 revenue (assuming no tax policy changes and after adjusting 2012 income
tax collections for the State reporting error correction). Baseline property tax revenue estimates are down because the reduced circuit breaker loss
surprise from 2012 is not expected to repeat. Baseline income tax revenue estimates are down because a balance in the Levy Freeze Local Income

1

Option Tax (LOIT) Stabilization Account (held by the County Treasurer for all government units in the county) will be exhausted in 2012. This means
distributions of Levy Freeze LOIT monies to all taxing units will be reduced in 2013. For the Consolidated City, the reduction will be $3.2 million.
Despite continued revenue weakness expected in 2013, there is reason for optimism that the Consolidated &LW\¶VILVFDOFRQGLWLRQZLOOcontinue to
improve in 2014 and beyond.
Future Revenue Outlook
The general outlook for growth in the Consolidated &LW\¶VWD[EDVHremains weak reflecting the sluggish state of the broader economy. In Indiana, there
is generally a two (2) year lag between economic events and the resulting impact on municipal income and property tax revenue. Thus, our tax revenue
for 2013 and 2014 will generally reflect local economic activity from 2011 and 2012.
This lag is due to structural DVSHFWVRI,QGLDQD¶VPXQLFLSDOILQDQFHODZV)RUSURSHUW\WD[UHYHQXHFKDQJHVLQWKHPDUNHWYDOXHRISURSHUW\WKDW
occurred in 2011 are captured in the tax assessments in 2012. Those 2012 tax assessments then define the property tax base for 2013 billings. For local
income tax revenue, earnings realized in 2011 are reported on tax returns filed with the State Department of Revenue in 2012. The 2012 income tax
filings then define the local income tax base for 2013 certified distributions to local government units.
Expectations for property tax revenue growth remain flat. Until broad based economic growth triggers an escalation in property values, we can expect
property tax revenue to remain stagnant. In the property tax cap era, when property value growth is stagnant, allowable levy growth authorized under
State law is offset by rising property tax circuit breaker credits.
However, there is one major bright spot for revenue. A unique and sharp uptick in our certified distribution of local income tax is expected in 2014,
approximately $20 million, unrelated to underlying economic activity. This uptick will be the result of resolving an income tax collection vs
distribution imbalance between the State and counties that occurred during the period of 2008 through 2010.
Over WKRVH\HDUVWKH6WDWH¶Vcertified income tax distributions to counties far exceeded the local income tax collections received by the State
Department of Revenue. This happened because the Great Recession produced a drop in income tax collections so sharp and rapid that the legal
mechanism in place for adjusting WKH6WDWH¶Vcertified distributions to counties could not keep pace. Thus, the State Treasury found itself in a position
where it was carrying a large negative balance in the clearing accounts used for processing local income tax collections and distributions to counties.
To correct this imbalance, in 2011 the State instituted a cap on local income tax distributions to counties. The cap holds the certified distribution to
each county level for 2012 and forward, until rising income tax collections offset WKHFRXQW\¶VQHJDWLYHFOHDULQJDFFRXQWEDODQFH
The subsequent local income tax reporting error and correction in 2011 and 2012, referenced above, certainly added an additional level of complexity
to process of determining the correct clearing account balances for each county. Those issues have now all been reconciled. We estimate that the
Marion County clearing account negative balance will be resolved in 2013; and thus, the cap on local income tax distributions lifted. This explains the
unusual $20 million uptick expected for the Consolidated &LW\¶VVKDUHof the 2014 certified local income distribution.

2

Beyond 2014, we expect local income tax revenue growth to return to a normal relationship to underlying economic activity, but lagged by two years as
explained above.

KEY FISCAL FEATURES

Department (IFD); and
9 $1 million reduction in IMPD and IFD overtime

In addition to seeking a reimbursement from TIF reserves, the Consolidated City is also releasing approximately $1.4 billion of allowable tax increment
assessed value (AV) to the general tax base for 2013. This represents more than 25% the total allowable tax increment capture. This action will
generate the combined benefits of: a) lowering total property taxpayer liability by over $15 million; and b) reducing the revenue loss due to property tax
caps by nearly $20 million for all taxing units across the county. Of this $20 million revenue impact, the Consolidated City will realize $8.6 more in
net property tax revenue than it would have otherwise.
This budget plan will also enable the Consolidated City to continue its investments in core information systems to modernize internal operations and
financial controls. This is an investment necessary to both support productivity gains essential to navigating lean times and prepare the City to continue
to excel over the long term.

With the advent of the property tax caps, this property tax subsidy has lost its original impact. It has morphed from being a primary tool for protecting
homeowners from rising property tax burdens to an ineffective program that no longer achieves its intended purpose.

options for addressing the fiscal imbalance in the Council-passed budget were limited. Ultimately, his decision was to strike a provision allocating
$31.7 million of County Option Income Tax (COIT) revenue to the County General Fund. The resulting effect of this action is that this money will be
held in abeyance by the County Treasurer, awaiting future guidance on when and where it is to be allocated. The underlying rationale for this veto
action is that withholding this approximately $32 million in 2013 would make it available to address the approximately $35 million budget gap in 2014.
It must be noted that this veto action reduces funds available for County agencies by about 14% in 2013, if the funds are not eventually released. It is

Strategic Fiscal Actions
In August 2011, the Consolidated City closed a deal transferring of its water and wastewater utility assets and debt to Citizens Energy Group (CEG).
CEG is a local public trust originally created, in 1887, to RZQDQGRSHUDWHWKH&LW\¶VQDWXUDOJDVVXSSO\DQGGLVWULEXWLRQDVVHWV7KLVunique structure
was devised to protect the citizens of Indianapolis from the twin perceived threats that access to natural gas energy might fall prey to the price
inefficiency of a private monopoly or the political patronage exposure of a government run monopoly.
The deal generated over $450 million in cash proceeds, putting Indianapolis in the enviable position of being able to upgrade its physical infrastructure
while many other municipalities across the nation continue to struggle. These proceeds will fund improvements to roads, bridges, sidewalks, and the
demolition and deconstruction of abandoned properties through Mayor Ballard's RebuildIndy program.
Mayor Ballard is committed to protecting RebuildIndy funds. Thus, no RebuildIndy funds were used in the 2012 operating budget nor are any
proposed for use to support the 2013 operating budget for the Consolidated City. Furthermore, $80 million of the proceeds were set aside in a new
)LVFDO6WDELOLW\)XQGWRPDLQWDLQWKH&LW\¶V$$$FUHGLWUDWLQJ7KLVPLOOLRQmay not be spent for any purpose until it is no longer necessary to
maintain our AAA rating; then, those funds must be transferred to the RebuildIndy Fund for future investment in infrastructure projects.
By year end, more than $270 million will have been invested to improve roads, bridges, sidewalks, or demolish abandoned properties in every part of
our city. In 2013 DQGEH\RQG0D\RU%DOODUG¶V5HEXLOG,QG\SURJUDPZLOOLQYHVWover $100 million dollars more in addressing remaining infrastructure
needs.
In a single stroke, this transaction positioned Indianapolis to be stronger both in physical assets and financial resilience. As a result, when a sustained
economic recovery does eventually take hold, Indianapolis will be poised to leap forward while many of our peers will have to first play catch up on
rebuilding their financial reserves and physical infrastructure base. However, we cannot be complacent because major issues still remain to align
permanent infrastructure funding with long-term reinvestment needs.

SPECIFIC BUDGET ELEMENTS
General Funds vs Dedicated Funds
The fund structure for municipal government is exceedingly complex. There are many, many distinct funds which comprise the overall fiscal structure
of the Consolidated City. In the face of this complexity, some simplifying assumptions are helpful to bring order and context to the fund inventory that
can appear overwhelming at first glance.
Most of the operating budget for the Consolidated City is funded by general tax revenue, both property tax and income tax. General funds are funds
which receive a substantial share of their revenue from taxes that have very broad flexibility.
Dedicated funds, on the other hand, are funds which receive revenue from taxes or non-tax sources that have very restricted legal uses. A more detailed
description of the fund structure of municipal government is provided elsewhere in this report.

100% Base Budget
SHWWLQJDVLGHWKHSRWHQWLDOHIIHFWVRIWKH0D\RU¶VYHWR action on County agency funds, the 2013 adopted budget sets funding for the general fund
supported County agencies and City departments at the proper level to fully support current operations (i.e. a 100% base budget). This means that
adjustments were made to the budget of each agency and department to: a) close known gaps between 2012 budgeted appropriations and current
operations, with a particular focus on public safety and criminal justice; and b) to fund rising fixed and semi-fixed costs (e.g. pension contributions;
health insurance; rent; internal service charges; multi-year contracts; fuel; etc). In total, the general tax-supported budgets for agencies and departments
were increased by $27 million (4.7%).
Key features of the adopted budget for public safety and criminal justice are:
9 6KHULII¶Vgeneral operating budget increased $7.6 million (8.4%) to close gaps in funding for their salaries and benefits, Jail II operating contract,
and arrestee medical costs;
9 IMPD general operating budget increased $9.8 million (5.5%) to close gaps in funding for rent, utilities, fuel/vehicle maintenance, and equipment
replacement;
9 IFD general operating budget increased $3.9 million (2.9%) to close gaps in funding for salaries and benefits;
9 funding for inmate and arrestee medical care and guardian ad litem services is consolidated into separate funds to highlight their significance and
isolate these expenses from the normal operating costs of the Sheriff and Superior Courts; and
9 the $2 million Crime Prevention Grant program will be continued.
Additional key features of the adopted budget for other general government functions are:
9 reduced Election Board budget by $2.6 million to reflect that 2013 is a non-election year;
9 increased Information Services Agency (ISA) internal charges by 16% to bring them into proper alignment with actual ISA costs (charges up by
$4.1 million while ISA budget is essentially flat);
9 continued capital investment in park grounds and facilities to further enhance these key public assets; and
9 the $1 million grant to the Indianapolis Arts Council will be continued.
Dedicated Fund Departments
There are four (4) City departments whose operations are funded completely or substantially from dedicated funds. The largest of these is the
Department of Public Works (DPW). The others are: Department of Metropolitan Development (DMD); Department of Code Enforcement (DCE); and
the Public Safety Communications (PSC) division within the Department of Public Safety (DPS). Because WKHVHGHSDUWPHQWVGRQ¶WUHFHLYHDQ\IOH[LEOH
income tax revenue, their budgets have generally not been directly impacted by the sharp downturn in income tax revenue since 2010 (with PSC as the
only exception). However, they each face other types of revenue challenges.
In this introduced budget, '3:¶V ability to deliver high quality snow and ice removal services this winter and necessary street and walkway repairs
next spring remains intact. Work will also continue, in earnest, on flood control improvements across the city in 2013. '3:¶Vroad and street
6

maintenance operations are heavily dependent on motor fuel tax and vehicle license fee revenue shared by the State. Both the economic downturn and
structural changes in the demand for motor fuel have caused this key revenue source to wane over the past decade. Thus, DPW must continue to strive
for savings and service level improvements in response to the weakness in this revenue stream. Fortunately, the RebuildIndy Fund has taken some
pressure RIIRI'3:¶Vtraditional dedicated transportation revenues. However, when the RebuildIndy Fund is exhausted, now projected for early in
2014, the pressure RQ'3:¶VGHGLFDWHGWUDQVSRUWDWLRQUHYHQXHVZLOOUHWXUQ
DMD is funded largely from federal grants and legally restricted tax and fee revenue. Though shielded from the sharp decline in local income tax,
DMD has suffered from a similarly dramatic tightening of federal grant funds, as the weak national economy and serious federal deficit concerns has
slowed the spigot of federal-aid support for local planning and economic development efforts. In response, the 2013 introduced budget includes a $1.5
million transfer from the City General Fund to maintain DMD at its current service level.
DCE will continue to operate at the level their dedicated, non-fungible revenue support. DCE charges fees only to those who use its service, freeing all
taxpayers of the burden of funding this department; so, its funding level depends more on the effectiveness of its operations than on the general tax
revenue climate of local government.
From a funding perspective, the PSC division is the most unique of the dedicated fund supported City departments. It does, in fact, receive a substantial
share of its revenue from the 1% COIT. While the PSC division is also eligible to receive E911 fee revenue, all of that revenue has been allocated to
IXQGWKH6KHULII¶Vemergency dispatch operations in 2013.
Because the method for allocating COIT revenue to PSC is uniquely prescribed by State law, this income tax revenue has legal characteristics more like
a dedicated funding source than a flexible, general funding source. Allocations RI&2,7UHYHQXHWR36&FRPH³RII-the-WRS´EHIRUHWKHUHPDLQLQJ
balance is distributed to all other HOLJLEOHJRYHUQPHQWDOXQLWVLQ0DULRQ&RXQW\7KXVWKH³RII-the-WRS´&2,7PRQLHVDOORFDWHGWR36&FDQQRWEH
shifted to other uses within the operating budget of the Consolidated City.
Because the PSC division is so dependent on local income tax revenue, its funding has suffered as a result of the sharp downturn in local income tax
distributions to Marion County since 2010. The 2013 adopted budget restores PSC funding to a more appropriate level. To accomplish this, the 2013
³RII-the-WRS´DOORcation was increased by 11% (nearly $1 million). This will enable the PSC division to proceed with an initiative to replace an aging
computer-aided dispatch (CAD) system.
Support for the Indianapolis/Marion County Public Library
Finally, the matter of funding for the Indianapolis/Marion County Public Library (IMCPL) has also been a growing concern over the past few years.
During the 2011 session of the Indiana General Assembly, municipal finance laws governing Marion County were changed to allow a portion of the
COIT revenue to be allocated to the IMCPL. The fact that local income tax revenue is currently stagnant makes the idea of adding new uses for these
scarce funds less appealing fiscally; however, with an eye on the long haul, adding the library to the COIT allocation formula is the right policy.

continued in the 2013 adopted budget, providing IMCPL with $169,016.

LOOKING FORWARD
The 2013 adopted budget for the Consolidated City once again sets forth a responsible fiscal plan by which agencies can continue serving all citizens of
Marion County, making Indianapolis a safe, livable city now and for decades to come. However, with the still unresolved structural deficit and the
0D\RU¶VYHWRDFWLRQPXFKXQFHUWDLQW\UHPDLQVA sharp $20 million rebound in local income tax revenues for the Consolidated City, anticipated in
2014, provides reason for optimism. However, serious fiscal challenges and decisions still lay ahead.
Based on the adopted budget, summarized in this report, the budget gap entering the 2014 budget cycle will potentially total $35 million. This estimate
recognizes that: a) a portion of the $65 million gap for 2013 is closed with the spend down of reserves; b) fixed and semi-fixed costs continue to rise;
and c) tax revenue growth will likely remain stagnant (aside from the unique $20 million income tax uptick in 2014).
To bridge this gap, it is imperative that we maintain some reserves and continue to find meaningful operational savings. The Office of Finance &
Management must seriously consider exercising its authority to invoke a management reserve requirement on department and agency budgets. Under
this authority, up to 5% (approximately $30 million) of the general fund appropriations may be withheld from budgets. Also, Mayor Ballad has tasked
the Office of Audit & Performance (OAP) to identify at least $15 million in savings from elimination of non-value added redundancies remaining
across the operations of all departments and agencies of the Consolidated City. For example, the Sheriff and the IMPD now engage separate vendors
for psychological testing of deputies and officers. Also, the Sheriff, Superior Courts, and County Prosecutor are exempted from working through the
central Human Resources Division of the Consolidated City.
Such work is the official charge of OAP by virtue of its authorizing code cite. Delivering on this savings goal will require the cooperation of all City
departments and County agencies, and is critical to managing the finances of the Consolidated City until a return of broad based economic growth starts
helping the local tax base recover.

Funds
The Indiana State Board of Accounts (SBOA) defines “fund” to
mean “cash or a group of accounts set aside for the purpose of
accounting for monies or other resources of general functions or
specific activities . . . in accordance with the system of accounts
prescribed by the State Board of Accounts or as required by statute”
(State Board of Accounts, Accounting and Uniform Compliance
Guidelines Manual for Cities and Towns, State of Indiana, reissued
2006).
Funds that the SBOA prescribes for use by cities include but are not
limited to, general funds, special revenue funds, debt services funds,
capital projects funds, internal service funds, and agency funds.
Funds included in the 2013 Adopted Budget represent those that
require appropriation by the City-County Council. Appropriation is
the authorization of the City-County Council by ordinance to make
disbursements or to incur obligations for specific purposes.
General Funds
General funds are funds which receive a substantial share of their
revenue from taxes that have very broad flexibility. For example, the
1% County Option Income Tax (COIT) distributions and the County
General Fund property tax levy may legally be used to fund any
governmental purpose.
The core general operating funds for the Consolidated City are:
County General Fund; Consolidated County General Fund (aka City
General Fund); Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department
(IMPD) General Fund; Indianapolis Fire Department (IFD) General
Fund; and Parks General Fund. Additionally, in 2013, there are six

(6) other funds that are also defined as general operating funds. They
are: Public Safety Income Tax Fund – County; Public Safety Income
Tax Fund – City; Personal Services Contingency Fund – County;
Personal Services Contingency Fund – City; Guardian Ad Litem
Fund; and Medical Care for Inmates Fund. What all of these funds
have in common is that they each will each receive a substantial
amount of flexible tax revenue in 2013. Thus, there is the ability to
reallocate the flexible revenue flowing to these funds across many
competing operational needs.
Dedicated Funds
Dedicated funds, on the other hand, are funds which receive revenue
from taxes or non-tax sources that have very restricted legal uses. A
more apt of a dedicated fund description is a fund that receives little
or no revenue from flexible tax revenue sources. Some examples are
the Parking Meter Fund and the Permits Fund. These are both
dedicated funds because their revenue sources have strictly limited
legal uses.
The Consolidated City also uses dedicated funds to account for the
proceeds of specific revenue sources (e.g., special revenue funds)
and/or for expenditures restricted to a specific purpose (e.g. debt
service funds; enterprise funds). Debt service funds (aka sinking
funds) are used to account for the accumulation of revenue for the
payment of long-term debt principal and interest.
Grant Funds
Finally, the Consolidated City also employs grant funds to collect
revenues and track expenditures for grant monies received from
other units of government.

Notes: This report excludes TIF debt service, TIF capital and other capital project funds. Those funds are not annually appropriated by the City-County Council.
Debt service funds for other special revenue (i.e. non-tax) bonds are also not included in this report.
December 31 Budgetary Fund Balance for City State and Federal Grants above is adjusted to approximate corrections to 2012 spending and/or revenue not yet posted in the accounting system when the budget was adopted.

Revenues
State law requires adoption of a balanced budget, which shall include
all anticipated revenues and expenses of every organizational unit
(with the exception of utilities). As such, all appropriations adopted
by the City-County Council must be fully supported by (1) revenue
that is legally eligible to support proposed expenses, and/or (2) fund
balance (essentially prior year, unencumbered revenue) that is legally
eligible to support the proposed expense.

The Consolidated City relies primarily on property and income taxes
to fund its operations. However, a significant amount of revenue is
derived from Fees and Charges as well as from Federal and State
Grants. The following pages provide more detailed information
about property tax rates, levies and districts as well as the various
types of income taxes, tax rates as well as the available uses of such
funds.

Property Tax
Citizens of the Consolidated City are subject to several overlapping
property tax districts which levy taxes for city and county general
purpose funds, as well as specific services. Taxpayer residing in
overlapping districts would be subject to the tax rates of each
applicable district.
Certified Levy (Gross Levy)
The total property tax levy for a taxing unit before the property tax
cap is considered. Referred to as “certified” because it is approved
by the State Department of Local Government Finance (DLGF).
DLGF approval is required to ensure that the levy amount is within
maximum levy limitations set by State law.
Net Levy
The expected property tax levy after deducting the property tax
circuit breaker credits attributable to the property tax caps.
Gross Assessed Value
The assessed value of a property before applying any eligible
property tax deductions or abatements (which lower the property’s
taxable assessed value). The property tax caps are set based on each
parcel’s gross assessed value.

Property Tax Cap (aka Circuit Breaker)
The property tax cap, also known as the “circuit breaker,” was
enacted by the Indiana General Assembly in 2008 and subsequently
amended into the Indiana Constitution. The cap guarantees that
property tax rates in overlapping districts cannot exceed a certain
capped percent of the parcel’s gross assessed value. The “circuit
breaker” amount represents property tax liability waived because it is
above the level allowed under the property tax caps. The property
tax caps are as follows:
1% - for Homestead property
2% - for other residential property and agricultural land
3% - for commercial and industrial property
Taxing Districts & Rates
The following pages show the taxing districts along with the Net
Assessed Values (NAV) of taxable property within those districts for
2013. The Tax Rate for a district is determined by the following
formula:
ܶܽ‫ ݁ݐܴܽݔ‬ൌ

‫ݕݒ݁ܮ݂݀݁݅݅ݐݎ݁ܥ‬
ܰ݁‫݁ݑ݈ܸܽ݀݁ݏݏ݁ݏݏܣݐ‬

Net Assessed Value (Taxable Assessed Value)
The taxable value of property after all eligible property tax
deductions and abatements are applied.

Property Taxes – Descriptions of Tax Districts
Marion County Tax District

Tax Rate (County): $0.3937 on each $100 of net assessed value
Tax Rate (Cons County): $0.1609 on each $100 of net assessed value

This district includes all taxable property within Marion County’s
borders. This is the tax district supporting the County General Fund,
the Property Reassessment Fund, the County Cumulative Capital
Fund, County Debt Service Funds, the Consolidated County Fund
(aka City General Fund), and some City General Obligation Debt
Service Funds. Revenues from this tax district support all of County
government and a portion of City government general operations and

which property owners in the excluded cities and town are not
required to contribute.

Indianapolis Fire Special Service District

Tax Rate: $0.3061 on each $100 of net assessed value

This taxing district includes most of the central and eastern portions
of the county with minimal western portions included. This
configuration reflects the consolidation of all township fire
departments with the Indianapolis Fire Department (IFD), except
Pike, Wayne, and Decatur townships. The district also excludes the
cities of Lawrence, Beech Grove, Southport, and the towns of
Cumberland and Homecroft. Tax revenues generated from this
district are deposited into the IFD General Fund and the IFD
Cumulative Fund, which provide funding for operating and capital
expenses of the IFD.
Indianapolis Solid Waste Special Service District

This district includes all taxable property within Marion County
borders, excluding the cities of Lawrence, Beech Grove and the town
of Speedway. Tax revenues from this district are deposited into the
Solid Waste Collection Fund, which provides funding for the
Department of Public Works (DPW) to perform trash collection and
solid waste removal services.

Indianapolis Police Special Service District

Income Tax
State law allows Indiana counties to impose a local income tax on
the State adjusted gross income of county taxpayers.
Also, counties may choose between several income tax options and
combinations. Each type of local income tax option is regulated by
specific rules and rate restrictions. Residents of Marion County are
subject to three interrelated income taxes in the form of the County
Option Income Tax (COIT), the Levy Freeze Local Option Income
Tax (LOIT), and the Public Safety Income Tax (PST).
This local income tax is collected by the State Department of
Revenue then distributed to counties based on the amount due to
each county on State income tax returns processed.
County Income Tax Council (CITC)
Local income tax is imposed or modified in a county by the action of
the CITC. In Marion County, the CITC is composed of the CityCounty Council and the fiscal body of each city or town that lies
either partially or entirely within the county. The other members of
the CITC are the Lawrence City Council, the Beech Grove City
Council, the Southport City Council, and the Speedway Town
Council.

County Option Income Tax (COIT)

Current Rate: 1.00% Maximum Rate: 1.00%

COIT revenue may be used for any lawful purpose of the
governmental unit.
Levy Freeze Local Option Income Tax (LOIT)
Current Rate: 0.27% Maximum Rate: 1.00%

An additional income tax rate may be imposed to generate revenue to
replace property tax levy growth. Thus, imposing this tax reflects a
policy choice to shift fiscal reliance from property tax to income tax,
not an overall tax increase.
Once imposed, this rate may neither be rescinded nor decreased.
Each year the CITC must hold at least one public meeting to discuss
whether or not Levy Freeze LOIT rate should be increased.
Public Safety Income Tax (PST)

Current Rate: 0.35% Maximum Rate: 0.50%

Because Marion County has imposed a Levy Freeze LOIT rate, State
law allows adoption of a PST rate. PST revenues may be used for
police and fire, including pensions, emergency services,
communications systems, jails and related facilities, and other items
related to public safety.

Voting representation on the CITC is based on each member unit’s
share of the total county population. In Marion County, the CityCounty Council holds over 90% of the voting representation on the
CITC.

Expenditures
Expenditure Categories (Characters)
In addition to the restrictions imposed by agencies/departments
regarding funding sources, agency spending is further restricted by
limiting the total funds available to support various spending
categories or “characters”. The Consolidated City employs five
separate characters to segregate spending. Each is described as
follows:

Personal Services (Character 1)
This category includes expenditures for salaries, wages and related
employee benefits provided for all Consolidated City employees.
Employee benefits include employer contributions to group health
and life insurance, pension benefits, unemployment compensation,
uniform allowance and similar benefits.

Materials and Supplies (Character 2)
This category includes articles and commodities that are consumed
or materially altered when used. Supplies include office supplies,
operating supplies, repair and maintenance supplies and other similar
items.

Other Services and Charges (Character 3)

Properties and Equipment (Character 4)
This category includes expenditures for the acquisition of, or
addition to assets such as land, infrastructure, buildings,
improvements other than buildings, as well as machinery and
equipment.

Internal Charges (Character 5)
This category includes internal charges such as expenditures for the
Mayor’s Action Center, the Office of Corporation Counsel and Fleet
Services.
If a department has a negative appropriation for Character 5, it
means that department is a provider of internal services and a net
recipient of internal charges.
This category exists for only City departments. Similar expenditures
from county agencies are reported as Character 3 instead. Since the
Information Services Agency (ISA) is a County agency, their
charges are not administered through Character 5. Both City
departments and County agencies pay ISA charges through
Character 3.

This category includes expenditures for services other than personal
services required by the Consolidated City either to carry out its
assigned functions or to fulfill moral or legal obligations. Other
Services and Charges includes professional services, communication
and transportation, printing and advertising, insurance (excluding
group health, life and self-insurance), utility expenditures, contracted
repairs and maintenance, rentals, debt service expenditures for
principal and interest payments as well as long-term debt.

Agency Budget Summaries
The Agency Budget Summaries section:
1) provides an operational overview of each of the county agencies
and city departments;
2) details the funding sources that will fund each
agency/department; and
3) outlines how those agencies/departments intend to spend those
funds by expenditure category or “character”.

Sources
The “Sources” listed for each agency/department budget represents
either a single or a collection of funding sources available to an
agency/department (See the Funds section for further explanation).

Expenditures
Agencies and departments are restricted in how they can use the
funds available to them. The Consolidated City employs five
separate expenditure “Characters” to categorize these uses (See the
Expenditures section for explanation of these characters).

Final vs. Adopted vs. Introduced
For the purpose of comparison, each summary shows recent
historical data for agency/department budgets. The following
explains the terminology used in these comparisons.
Budget Introduced shows the amounts budgeted for each
agency/department as determined by agency/department finance
officers and the Office of Finance and Management. This is the
budget introduced by the Mayor to the City-County Council for
amendment and eventual adoption.
Budget Adopted shows the amounts budgeted for each
agency/department as adopted by the City-County Council in
October of the preceding fiscal year.
Actual Final shows the final expenditures and encumbrances for
each department and agency for the fiscal year.

DPS ADMINISTRATION
Introduction
The City of Indianapolis Department of Public Safety (DPS) will remain a
national model leveraging the unique strengths of the Police, Fire,
Homeland Security, Animal Care and Control, and Communications

Divisions as an integrated department. DPS will deliver the highest quality
of public safety services in a fiscally effective manner to secure the Greater
Indianapolis area by preventing, preparing for, responding to, and
recovering from routine emergencies and large-scales incidents. The
Administration unit of DPS provides coordination and leadership for the
agencies within DPS.

Structure
The Department of Public Safety comprises five integrated divisions as well
as the Citizens Police Complaint Office (CPCO). The Indianapolis
Metropolitan Police Department, Indianapolis Fire Department, Division of
Homeland Security, Animal Care and Control, and Public Safety
Communications operate within one department and share resources in
innovative ways. This structure increases operational effectiveness by
leveraging the strengths of each division to provide public safety services to
the City of Indianapolis/Marion County. Each of the divisions has their
own operational goals and unique personalities.

The Department of Public Safety was created by Section 251 of the revised
municipal code. CPCO, independent of the Indianapolis Metropolitan
Police Department, was created by city ordinance. The CPCO affords
citizens of the Consolidated City of Indianapolis Marion County who
believe they have been treated improperly by an IMPD officer the
opportunity to have his or her complaint(s) both heard and investigated.

HOMELAND SECURITY
Introduction
The Division leads an integrated Department of Public Safety effort to
secure, prevent, prepare, respond and ensure resiliency from natural or
human-made threats and hazards to the city, and to sustain a confident
public.

The Division is also responsible for preparing plans and managing the
safety and security of special events when anticipated requirements exceed
the capability of the concerned geographic area.
The Division of Homeland Security was created by Section 251 of the
revised Municipal Code.

Structure
The Division was formed to unify divisions within the Department of Public
Safety to create the capacity to deal with terrorist attacks, major disasters,
planning and managing special events, and other emergencies. By
embracing a single set of guiding principles, from the Director of Public
Safety to the frontline employee, we have created a single division working
to secure the City of Indianapolis/Marion County.

The Division does not operate in a vacuum. Other Federal, State, and local
institutions participate actively in the Division’s efforts to disrupt terrorist
activities, pre-planning and managing special events, and in the preparation
for and response to major disasters, as do our private and non-profit sectors
and international partners. We will continue to work cooperatively to ensure
that all of the instruments of local power – including leadership, specialized
technical expertise, research, and development investments – are brought to
bear on the challenges we face in a coordinated and unified manner.

MARION COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT
Introduction
The Marion County Superior Court comprises 36 elected judges, 40
commissioners and magistrates, and over 750 staff employees. The Court is
structured into 4 divisions - Civil, Criminal, Juvenile, and Probate. In
addition, there are a number of departments within the Court, including
Probation, Jury Pool, Juvenile Detention Center, Information Technology,
and Family Court.

The Court is structured internally with an Executive Committee of four
judges elected by all Superior Court judges for terms of two years that
oversees the general policy and management of the Court. The Criminal
and Civil Terms have a Chair and each department has a Supervising Judge
appointed by the Executive Committee.

Structure
Court Division
The 36 courts of the Courts Division handle more than 50,000 civil cases
and more than 40,000 criminal cases. Some courts are specialty courts such
as domestic violence, drug, mental health, environmental, and traffic. In
addition, the courts manage programs such as re-entry and community work
crews.
Probation Department
The Probation Department comprises two divisions: adult and juvenile. Its
mission is to enhance community safety by enforcing court orders while
striving to change lives. Probation assists in relieving jail bed concerns
through both pre-trial and probation services. The Juvenile Division
continues to implement strategies endorsed by the Juvenile Detention
Alternative Initiative which has resulted in a substantial reduction in the
number of juveniles having to be held in the Juvenile Detention Center.

Administrative Division
The Administrative Division manages the overall operation of the Courts
including human resources, finance, payroll, facilities management,
procurement, technology, fleet, and staff training.
Juvenile Detention Division
The Marion County Juvenile Detention Center (MCJDC) is a maximum
security holding facility for detained youth. The MCJDC maintains youth,
ages 11-18 years, in a safe and secure environment while allowing
continuity of services. Each youth detained within the MCJDC will
continue their education; continue their mental health and basic health
exercises; and increase healthy social skill-building processes. We are
committed to providing a safe and secure Juvenile Detention Center, while
providing practical, effective, and high-quality services to the youth within
the MCJDC.

MARION COUNTY PROSECUTOR
Introduction
The Marion County Prosecutor’s Office is dedicated to holding criminals
accountable for their actions, preserving the rights of victims and
continually seeking justice, all while maintaining the highest of ethical
standards.

Structure
Major Case
Handles major felony cases, including homicides. Victim Advocates are
assigned to each of these courts, who have the responsibility of notifying
victims of actions taken by the court, court appearances, plea agreements
and trials. The Major Case Division has units dedicated to the prosecution
of sexually based offenses, arson, vice and human trafficking.
Strike
This division is responsible for three (3) areas of crime – drugs, guns and
gangs. Vigorous prosecution of these crimes is essential to the safety of the
community. The Strike Team partners with various police teams to assist in
investigations, arrests, charging decisions and the ultimate presentation of
the case to the court.
Community Prosecution
Community prosecutors are assigned to the various police districts and
special areas. These prosecutors work closely with district commanders and
detectives to develop strategies to protect and defend the communities
served by the individual police districts. Community prosecutors engage in
community outreach programs to bring the criminal justice system to as
many Marion County residents as possible.
Juvenile
Files and prosecutes charges against children 17 years of age and younger.
There are exceptions for more serious crimes that are handled by the adult
courts. This division processes all cases from truancy to armed robbery.
Domestic Violence
Prosecutes all cases involving harmful physical contact, property damage,
threats and violation of court orders that occur between current or former
spouses, family members or those who have or previously had a significant
personal relationship.

D-Felony/Misdemeanor
Handles the prosecution of all misdemeanor and Class D felony criminal
cases. Typical cases include driving while intoxicated, theft, shoplifting,
battery, prostitution, vandalism, moving traffic violations and trespassing.
This division handles more criminal cases than all other divisions
combined.
Grand Jury
For cases involving white collar crime, public corruption, tax evasion and
other longer term investigations, the Prosecutor has a staff of investigators
and lawyers dedicated to the collection of evidence. If criminal activity is
suspected, the evidence is presented to a Grand Jury composed of six (6)
citizens of Marion County that listen to the evidence and determine if
criminal charges are filed.
Criminal Charging
Police agencies present cases to this division for review. Deputy
prosecutors determine what charges are to be brought and what additional
investigation is necessary. The Prosecutor has complete discretion to file
charges, not file charges and which charges are to be filed.
Special Assignments
Currently this division includes a forfeiture unit that seizes property used in
criminal enterprises, a prosecutor training unit that offers in-service training
to deputy prosecutors, a high tech unit that investigates the use of

MARION COUNTY PROSECUTOR– CHILD SUPPORT DIVISION
Introduction
The Child Support Division of the Marion County Prosecutor’s Office
provides a wide range of services to parents who need child support
establishment, enforcement, or modification.

Services are provided and authorized through the federal Title IV-D
program and through a cooperative agreement with the Indiana Child
Support Bureau. Services are provided at the downtown office, as well as
branch offices located at Flanner House, Center Township Trustee’s Office,
Wayne Township Trustee’s Office, and the Morris Settles Township Center.

Structure
Legal
Deputy prosecutors are responsible for the review, approval, and
maintenance of the cases assigned to the Child Support Division. These
cases include paternity establishment, petitions for child support, contempt
cases, modifications, medical support, interstate cases, and many additional
issues related to child support. Deputy prosecutors are assigned to sixteen
(16) regular weekly dockets and are assigned to additional hearings as
scheduled by the courts. Deputy prosecutors are aided by two attorney
assistants who work with administrative issues and many other tasks.
Paternity
Staff in this section prepare cases for court, including pleadings, exhibits,
and genetic testing. These cases often are based upon paternity affidavits
executed by the parents and sometimes include interstate cases.
Litigation
Staff provides support for deputy prosecutors, including preparing cases for
thirteen (13) dockets per week, as well as a number of additional court
hearings. Additional services are provided through this section, including
mediation services and the Parents That Work program.
Interstate
A significant number of cases involve parents and children living in other
states. This section is responsible for coordinating communication and
services across state lines, including paternity establishment, medical
support, child support order establishment and enforcement, and
modifications of child support orders.

Intake
In-person interaction with parents is the primary function of this group. In
addition to seeing 100 appointments in an average week, staff meets with
another 90 parents per week as walk-ins. Primary duties include initial case
creation, document preparation, and preparing cases for attorney review.
Branch
Intake functions are also available in the community, allowing parents the
opportunity to obtain services without having to travel downtown. Duties at
the branch locations are substantially the same as the intake division
previously listed.
Internal Services
Staff assigned to this section provide support services to other Child
Support Division employees. These include maintenance of files,
calculating balances on child support accounts, sending income withholding
orders, and working special reports.
Solution Center
Calls to the Child Support Division’s general access number average about
12,500 per month. Staff assigned to this division provide general
information, schedule appointments, assist in coordinating child support
services to callers.

MARION COUNTY COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS
Vision and Mission Statements
Vision
To provide the citizens of Marion County a safer community.

Mission
To enhance public safety by raising offender accountability through the use
of evidence based practices and interventions.

Structure
Home Detention
The electronic equipment used for client monitoring includes active radio
frequency for typical home detention clients as well as global positioning
satellite equipment for high risk offenders, including domestic violence
offenders who are on home detention. Community Corrections also offers
electronic alcohol monitoring equipment. Offenders may be placed on any
combination of Home Detention, GPS, and Alcohol Monitoring. All
offenders under supervision have a variety of programming available.
Community Corrections utilizes the Indiana Risk Assessment System
(IRAS) to assess the risk of reoffending and services needed for all clients
under supervision. Based on overall risk score and identified criminogenic
needs, clients may be placed into the following evidence based programs
presented by trained facilitators: Parenting, Anger Management, Thinking
For a Change, Substance Abuse Treatment, as well as Job Readiness
workshops and GED/ABE. Mental health programming is also available
for those mentally ill offenders who might otherwise have been incarcerated
at the local or the state levels. MCCC has an Addictions Intervention
Component which focuses on addictions issues.

Work Release
In October 2007, the agency opened the Duvall Residential Center which
provides services for male work release offenders and has capacity for up to
350 persons. All residents of Duvall are eligible for the same programming
opportunities as electronic monitoring offenders.
Through contracts with service providers, we are able to serve offenders at
3 other locations. Volunteers of America (VOA) currently provides a total
of 90 beds for male offenders split among General Population, Community
Transition Program, and the Mental Health Component at Brandon Hall.
VOA also operates the Theodora House, which is a residential facility for
60 female offenders. In addition, the Craine House provides the
opportunity for 4 women with pre-school aged children to serve their
sentence in the community while living with their children.

enhancing public safety, improving access to education and advocating for
jobs for Marion County residents. The Council also will continue working
to conduct more effective, efficient and transparent local government
through citizen input, research, and debate of the issues affecting our
community, as well as to recognize and honor distinguished groups and
citizens.

Structure
Counseling
The Counseling Section provides legal advice to city and county officials,
appointees, and employees when acting in their official capacities. The
Counseling Section’s services include the preparation and negotiation of
contracts, ethics training, and human resources and employment counseling.

Opportunity Section. OCC ensures claimants and respondents are fairly
treated and claims are promptly reviewed and resolved. The Section does
outreach to inform the residents and taxpayers of its services.

available to the public through live online streaming of both channels and
via video-on-demand archives. Online services are accessed through the
indy.gov website.

The Channel 16 production staff also provides in-kind services to numerous
city and county agencies, such as poll worker training for primary and

MARION COUNTY ASSESSOR
Introduction
The Marion County Assessor’s main goal is to ensure the accuracy of
property tax assessments. Each property owner pays a fair share of local
government expenses based on the value of the property owned. The
County Assessor is responsible for determining the fair market value of
each property in the county. In addition, the County Assessor processes

inheritance tax returns and determines whether taxpayers are entitled to
charitable and non-profit property tax exemptions. Any time a taxpayer
wishes to appeal an assessment decision, the appeal goes through the
Property Tax Assessment Board of Appeals (PTABOA) hearing process
administered by the County Assessor.

Structure
Assessment Division
The Assessment Division assesses all real and business property throughout
the county. This division coordinates the efforts of field personnel, audit
staffs, and valuation experts to perform all phases of the assessment process
in accordance with International Association of Assessing Officers
standards. The division is further divided into functional areas separately
covering commercial, industrial, and residential properties, and reviewing
taxpayers' reports on business personal property. The division has four
satellite offices offering taxpayers a convenient place to obtain residential
assessment information and services.

Data Analysis Division
The Data Analysis Division collects, manages, and analyzes the large
amounts of data needed for both efficient and modern assessment results. It
also creates satellite-coordinated mapping and connects assessment data to
each property geographically. Moreover, the division manages ownership
changes and records as well as maps changes in the property sizes. The
division is responsible for the sales disclosure process which collects,
reviews, and validates all property sales in the county. Finally, the division
organizes this enormous quantity of data into reports and statistics, which is
useful to the Assessment Division and to other government agencies, and is
available for dissemination to citizens over the Internet.

Administration Division
The Administration Division is responsible for budget creation and
monitoring, payroll, human resources administration, facilities
management, procurement, education administration, process improvement,
as well as document management and retention. Further, it administers the
hearing process of the PTABOA and the review of property tax exemption
applications for charities and non-profits. Finally, this division also
conducts the auditing and processing of inheritance tax returns.

MARION COUNTY SURVEYOR
Introduction
Marion County Surveyor's Office was established by the Indiana
Constitution in 1851. General Land Office surveys in what is now Marion
County began in 1819. Marion County is part of the rectangular survey
system (Public Land System), which divides the land into sections that are
one square mile. All real estate boundaries in Marion County can be traced
back to the Public Land System. Statute law requires the Surveyor to

recheck at least five percent of the section corners each year, there are over
2000 corners. The Marion County Surveyor’s Office maintains a Legal
Survey Record Book and a Corner Record Book. No fee is charged for
surveying services provided to any city, county and other governmental
agencies.

Structure
Surveying
In the field, the staff performs the precise measurements of Section Corners
and ties, per Indiana Code and replacing said monuments as necessary. We
monitor the Eagle Creek Dam for horizontal and vertical movement as well
as performing vital research within the office.
Information Technology
Information Technology supports the needs of the Surveyor’s Office. This
area compiles the data surveyors collect in the field by use of AutoCAD and
GIS software. Further, that data along with both the corner history and
drawing (which this department provides) is posted onto the county’s
website. We collect and quality check all measurements to ensure accurate,
reliable information is provided.

Preservation
Preservation is as much a part of the surveyor’s office as surveying and
technology. We believe in the importance of preserving our past for the
future generations. Understanding the necessity of creating legible
electronic copies of the records, maps, surveys and plats housed in the
surveyor’s office to ensure that they will be easily accessible for years to
come. By concentrating on this now we have been able to scan or have
scanned already deteriorating documents.

Having a greater reliance on new technology has helped the Surveyor’s
office to build a solid fiscal commitment to provide government and private
sector agencies and companies timely, accurate and useful information,
while helping us and these agencies and companies save taxpayers money
and time. Finally, these advancements in technology have enabled us to
fulfill our legal obligation for the completion of the Alcohol & Tobacco
Commission’s Verification of Business Location forms.

Debt Service
The Consolidated City carries different types of debt associated with
various programs and services. This debt takes on two forms: (1)
general obligation debt, which is supported by a pledge of the full
faith and credit of the Consolidated City and is usually funded by tax
revenue, and (2) special revenue debt, which is supported by a
pledge of a specific revenue stream.

Special Revenue Debt
Special revenue debt is mostly associated with Tax Increment
Financing (TIF) districts throughout Marion County. This debt is
supported through property tax increment capture. This financing
tool is used to develop and grow various communities and
neighborhoods that otherwise would have little growth potential.

Generally, the revenue stream pledged for special revenue debt is a
fee or other non-tax revenue. In the case of debt funded by tax
increment financing (TIF), tax increment revenue captured is
segregated from the regular property tax revenue of the Consolidated
City.

TIF funds, including debt service for TIF bonds, are not appropriated
by the City-County Council. In Marion County, the Metropolitan
Development Commission (MDC) serves as the fiscal body for TIF
funds.

The Consolidated City of Indianapolis, Marion County takes pride
and care in maintaining its AAA (stable) credit rating for its general
obligation debt.
General Obligation Debt
Most of the Consolidated City’s general obligation debt is related to
transportation, parks, and emergency communications infrastructure.
Other general obligation debt is related to police and fire pension
costs as well as redevelopment efforts throughout the Consolidated
City.

Other special revenue debt includes economic development bonds
which are typically supported by a revenue stream generated by a
specific investment. An example would be a bond issued to finance a
parking garage with the parking fees pledged to pay the debt service.
Another example would be financing stormwater projects,
undertaken by the Consolidated City to address flood control
problems, with stormwater fees pledged to paying the debt service.
TIF debt service and other special revenue debt service is not
included in tables presented in this report, but is available separately.

Debt service payments for general obligation debt are typically
funded entirely, or in part, with tax revenue. Only tax-supported debt
service is included in tables presented in this report.

Pension Trust Funds
Police and Fire Pension Trust Funds account for the payment of
pension benefits to police officers and firefighters hired prior to 1977.
All associated expenditures made from the Police and Fire Pension
Trust Funds are reimbursed by the State.

More information on PERF and Police and Fire pension plans can be
found on pages 83-91 of the Notes to Financial Statements section of
the December 31, 2011 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report
(CAFR) for the City of Indianapolis.

The most recent pension plan, the 1977 Police and Firefighters
Pension and Disability Fund pension plan, is administered by the
Indiana Public Retirement System (INPRS), which is appropriated and
expensed as part of the Department of Public Safety’s (DPS’)
Character One appropriations from the IMPD and IFD General Funds
for the respective divisions.
