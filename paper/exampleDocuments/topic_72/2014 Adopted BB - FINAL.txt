Funds
The Indiana State Board of Accounts (SBOA) defines “fund” to
mean “cash or a group of accounts set aside for the purpose of
accounting for monies or other resources of general functions or
specific activities . . . in accordance with the system of accounts
prescribed by the State Board of Accounts or as required by statute”
(State Board of Accounts, Accounting and Uniform Compliance
Guidelines Manual for Cities and Towns, State of Indiana, reissued
2006).

Fund; Parks General Fund; Public Safety Income Tax Fund –
County; Public Safety Income Tax Fund – City; Personal Services
Contingency Fund – County; Personal Services Contingency Fund –
City; Guardian Ad Litem Fund; and Medical Care for Inmates Fund.
What all of these funds have in common is that they each will each
receive a substantial amount of flexible tax revenue. Thus, there is
the ability to reallocate the flexible revenue flowing to these funds
across many competing operational needs.

Funds that the SBOA prescribes for use by cities include but are not
limited to, general funds, special revenue funds, debt services funds,
capital projects funds, internal service funds, and agency funds.
Funds included in the 2014 Adopted Budget represent those that
require appropriation by the City-County Council. Appropriation is
the authorization of the City-County Council by ordinance to make
disbursements or to incur obligations for specific purposes.

Dedicated Funds
Dedicated funds, on the other hand, are funds which receive revenue
from taxes or non-tax sources that have very restricted legal uses. A
more apt of a dedicated fund description is a fund that receives little
or no revenue from flexible tax revenue sources. Some examples are
the Parking Meter Fund and the Permits Fund. These are both
dedicated funds because their revenue sources have strictly limited
legal uses.

General Funds
General funds are funds which receive a substantial share of their
revenue from taxes that have very broad flexibility. For example, the
1% County Option Income Tax (COIT) distributions and the County
General Fund property tax levy may legally be used to fund any
governmental purpose.

The Consolidated City also uses dedicated funds to account for the
proceeds of specific revenue sources (e.g., special revenue funds)
and/or for expenditures restricted to a specific purpose (e.g. debt
service funds; enterprise funds). Debt service funds (aka sinking
funds) are used to account for the accumulation of revenue for the
payment of long-term debt principal and interest.

The core general operating funds for the Consolidated City are:
County General Fund; Consolidated County General Fund (aka City
General Fund); Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department
(IMPD) General Fund; Indianapolis Fire Department (IFD) General

Grant Funds
Finally, the Consolidated City also employs grant funds to collect
revenues and track expenditures for grant monies received from
other units of government.

This report excludes TIF debt service, TIF capital and other capital project funds. Those funds are not annually appropriated by the City-County Council.
Debt service funds for other special revenue (i.e. non-tax) bonds are also not included in this report.

Revenues
State law requires adoption of a balanced budget, which shall include
all anticipated revenues and expenses of every organizational unit
(with the exception of utilities). As such, all appropriations adopted
by the City-County Council must be fully supported by (1) revenue
that is legally eligible to support proposed expenses, and/or (2) fund
balance (essentially prior year, unencumbered revenue) that is legally
eligible to support the proposed expense.

The Consolidated City relies primarily on property and income taxes
to fund its operations. However, a significant amount of revenue is
derived from Fees and Charges as well as from Federal and State
Grants. The following pages provide more detailed information
about property tax rates, levies and districts as well as the various
types of income taxes, tax rates as well as the available uses of such
funds.

Property Tax
Citizens of the Consolidated City are subject to several overlapping
property tax districts which levy taxes for city and county general
purpose funds, as well as specific services. Taxpayers residing in
overlapping districts would be subject to the tax rates of each
applicable district.
Certified Levy (Gross Levy)
The total property tax levy for a taxing unit before the property tax
cap is considered. Referred to as “certified” because it is approved
by the State Department of Local Government Finance (DLGF).
DLGF approval is required to ensure that the levy amount is within
maximum levy limitations set by State law.
Net Levy
The expected property tax levy after deducting the property tax
circuit breaker credits attributable to the property tax caps.
Gross Assessed Value
The assessed value of a property before applying any eligible
property tax deductions or abatements (which lower the property’s
taxable assessed value). The property tax caps are set based on each
parcel’s gross assessed value.
Net Assessed Value (Taxable Assessed Value)
The taxable value of property after all eligible property tax
deductions and abatements are applied.

Property Tax Cap (aka Circuit Breaker)
The property tax cap, also known as the “circuit breaker,” was
enacted by the Indiana General Assembly in 2008 and subsequently
amended into the Indiana Constitution. The cap guarantees that
property tax rates in overlapping districts cannot exceed a certain
capped percent of the parcel’s gross assessed value. The “circuit
breaker” amount represents property tax liability waived because it is
above the level allowed under the property tax caps. The property
tax caps are as follows:
1% - for Homestead property
2% - for other residential property and agricultural land
3% - for commercial and industrial property
Taxing Districts & Rates
The following pages show the taxing districts along with the Net
Assessed Values (NAV) of taxable property within those districts for
pay year 2014. The Tax Rate for a district is determined by the
following formula:

Income Tax
State law allows Indiana counties to impose a local income tax on
the State adjusted gross income of county taxpayers.
Also, counties may choose between several income tax options and
combinations. Each type of local income tax option is regulated by
specific rules and rate restrictions. Residents of Marion County are
subject to three interrelated income taxes in the form of the County
Option Income Tax (COIT), the Levy Freeze Local Option Income
Tax (LOIT), and the Public Safety Income Tax (PST).
This local income tax is collected by the State Department of
Revenue then distributed to counties based on the amount due to
each county on State income tax returns processed.
County Income Tax Council (CITC)
Local income tax is imposed or modified in a county by the action of
the CITC. In Marion County, the CITC is composed of the CityCounty Council and the fiscal body of each city or town that lies
either partially or entirely within the county. The other members of
the CITC are the Lawrence City Council, the Beech Grove City
Council, the Southport City Council, and the Speedway Town
Council.
Voting representation on the CITC is based on each member unit’s
share of the total county population. In Marion County, the CityCounty Council holds over 90% of the voting representation on the
CITC.

County Option Income Tax (COIT)
Current Rate: 1.00% Maximum Rate: 1.00%

COIT revenue may be used for any lawful purpose of the
governmental unit.
Levy Freeze Local Option Income Tax (LOIT)
Current Rate: 0.27% Maximum Rate: 1.00%

An additional income tax rate may be imposed to generate revenue to
replace property tax levy growth. Thus, imposing this tax reflects a
policy choice to shift fiscal reliance from property tax to income tax,
not an overall tax increase.
Once imposed, this rate may neither be rescinded nor decreased.
Each year the CITC must hold at least one public meeting to discuss
whether or not Levy Freeze LOIT rate should be increased.
Public Safety Income Tax (PST)
Current Rate: 0.35% Maximum Rate: 0.50%

Because Marion County has imposed a Levy Freeze LOIT rate, State
law allows adoption of a PST rate. PST revenues may be used for
police and fire, including pensions, emergency services,
communications systems, jails and related facilities, and other items
related to public safety.

Expenditures
Expenditure Categories (Characters)
In addition to the restrictions imposed by agencies/departments
regarding funding sources, agency spending is further restricted by
limiting the total funds available to support various spending
categories or “characters”. The Consolidated City employs five
separate characters to segregate spending. Each is described as
follows:

Properties and Equipment (Character 4)
This category includes expenditures for the acquisition of, or
addition to assets such as land, infrastructure, buildings,
improvements other than buildings, as well as machinery and
equipment.

Internal Charges (Character 5)
Personal Services (Character 1)
This category includes expenditures for salaries, wages and related
employee benefits provided for all Consolidated City employees.
Employee benefits include employer contributions to group health
and life insurance, pension benefits, unemployment compensation,
uniform allowance and similar benefits.

This category includes internal charges such as expenditures for the
Mayor’s Action Center, the Office of Corporation Counsel and Fleet
Services.
If a department has a negative appropriation for Character 5, it
means that department is a provider of internal services and a net
recipient of internal charges.

Materials and Supplies (Character 2)
This category includes articles and commodities that are consumed
or materially altered when used. Supplies include office supplies,
operating supplies, repair and maintenance supplies and other similar
items.

Other Services and Charges (Character 3)
This category includes expenditures for services other than personal
services required by the Consolidated City either to carry out its
assigned functions or to fulfill moral or legal obligations. Other
Services and Charges includes professional services, communication
and transportation, printing and advertising, insurance (excluding
group health, life and self-insurance), utility expenditures, contracted
repairs and maintenance, rentals, debt service expenditures for
principal and interest payments as well as long-term debt.

This category exists for only City departments. Similar expenditures
from county agencies are reported as Character 3 instead. Since the
Information Services Agency (ISA) is a County agency, their
charges are not administered through Character 5. Both City
departments and County agencies pay ISA charges through
Character 3.

Agency Budget Summaries
The Agency Budget Summaries section:
1) provides an operational overview of each of the county agencies
and city departments;
2) details the funding sources that will fund each
agency/department; and
3) outlines how those agencies/departments intend to spend those
funds by expenditure category or “character”.

Final vs. Revised vs. Introduced vs. Adopted
For the purpose of comparison, each summary shows recent
historical data for agency/department budgets. The following
explains the terminology used in these comparisons.
Budget Adopted shows the amounts budgeted for each
agency/department as adopted by the City-County Council in
October of the preceding fiscal year.

Sources
The “Sources” listed for each agency/department budget represents
either a single or a collection of funding sources available to an
agency/department (See the Funds section for further explanation).

Expenditures

Budget Introduced shows the amounts budgeted for each
agency/department as determined by agency/department finance
officers and the Office of Finance and Management. This is the
budget introduced by the Mayor to the City-County Council for
amendment and eventual adoption.

Agencies and departments are restricted in how they can use the
funds available to them. The Consolidated City employs five
separate expenditure “Characters” to categorize these uses (See the
Expenditures section for explanation of these characters).

Budget Revised shows the budget as amended through fiscal
ordinances approved by the City-County Council throughout the
fiscal year
Actual Final shows the final expenditures and encumbrances for

DPS ADMINISTRATION
Introduction
The City of Indianapolis Department of Public Safety (DPS) will remain a national model leveraging the unique strengths of the Police, Fire, Homeland Security,
Animal Care and Control, and Communications Divisions as an integrated department. DPS will deliver the highest quality of public safety services in a fiscally
effective manner to secure the Greater Indianapolis area by preventing, preparing for, responding to, and recovering from routine emergencies and large-scales
incidents. The Administration unit of DPS provides coordination and leadership for the agencies within DPS.
.
Structure
The Department of Public Safety comprises five integrated divisions as well as the Citizens Police Complaint Office (CPCO) and the Mayor’s Office of Re-Entry.
The Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department, Indianapolis Fire Department, Division of Homeland Security, Animal Care and Control, and Public Safety
Communications operate within one department and share resources in innovative ways. This structure increases operational effectiveness by leveraging the
strengths of each division to provide public safety services to the City of Indianapolis/Marion County. Each of the divisions has their own operational goals and
unique personalities. The Department of Public Safety was created by Section 251 of the revised municipal code. CPCO, independent of the Indianapolis
Metropolitan Police Department, was created by city ordinance. The CPCO affords citizens of the Consolidated City of Indianapolis Marion County who believe
they have been treated improperly by an IMPD officer the opportunity to have his or her complaint(s) both heard and investigated. Mayor Gregory Ballard
established the Office of Re-Entry to develop collaborative partnerships among government, businesses, faith-based organizations, and community members to
leverage resources, to ensure sustainability by enhancing crime prevention strategies, and evaluating outcomes based on data collection and quality of life
enhancement, for ex-offenders and the community.

DIVISION OF HOMELAND SECURITY
Introduction
The Division leads an integrated Department of Public Safety effort to secure, prevent, prepare, respond, investigate, and ensure resiliency from natural or humanmade threats and hazards to the city, and to sustain a confident public. The Division is also responsible for preparing plans and managing the safety and security of
special events when anticipated requirements exceed the capability of the concerned geographic area. The Division of Homeland Security was created by Section
251 of the revised Municipal Code.
Structure
The Division was formed to unify divisions within the Department of Public Safety to create the capacity to deal with terrorist attacks, major disasters, planning and
managing special events, and other emergencies. By embracing a single set of guiding principles, from the Director of Public Safety to the frontline employee, we
have created a single division working to secure the City of Indianapolis/Marion County.
The Division does not operate in a vacuum. Other Federal, State, and local institutions participate actively in the Division’s efforts to work within the intelligence
community, investigate, disrupt terrorist activities, pre-planning and managing special events, and in the preparation for and response to major disasters, as do our
private and non-profit sectors and international partners. We will continue to work cooperatively to ensure that all of the instruments of local power – including
leadership, specialized technical expertise, research, and development investments – are brought to bear on the challenges we face in a coordinated and unified
manner.

MARION COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT
Introduction
The Marion County Superior Court comprises 36 elected judges, 39 commissioners and magistrates, and over 690 staff employees. The Court is structured into 4
divisions - Civil, Criminal, Juvenile, and Probate. In addition, there are a number of departments within the Court, including Probation, Jury Pool, Juvenile
Detention Center, Information Technology, and Family Court.
The Court is structured internally with an Executive Committee consisting of four judges elected by all Superior Court judges for terms of two (2) years. The
Executive Committee oversees the general policy and management of the Court. The Criminal and Civil Terms select a Chair from within their respective judicial
members and each department/division has a Supervising Judge appointed by the Executive Committee
Structure
Court Division
The 36 courts of the Court Division handle more than 50,000 civil cases and
more than 40,000 criminal cases each year. Some courts are specialty and/or
problem solving courts such as domestic violence, drug, mental health,
community, environmental, and traffic. The Traffic Division in particular
handles over 120,000 cases each year. In addition, the courts manage
programs such as re-entry and community work crews.
Probation Department
The Probation Department comprises two divisions: adult and juvenile. Its
mission is to enhance community safety by enforcing court orders while
striving to change lives. Probation assists in relieving jail bed concerns
through both pre-trial and probation services. The Juvenile Division continues
to implement strategies endorsed by the Juvenile Detention Alternative
Initiative which has resulted in a substantial reduction in the number of
juveniles being detained in the Juvenile Detention Center.

Administrative Division
The Administrative Division manages and supports the overall operation of
the Courts including human resources, finance, payroll, facilities
management, procurement, information technology, fleet, and staff training.
Juvenile Detention Division
The Marion County Juvenile Detention Center (MCJDC) is a maximum
security holding facility for detained youth. The MCJDC maintains youth,
ages 11-18 years, in a safe and secure environment while allowing continuity
of services. Each youth detained within the MCJDC will attend school,
participate in mental health and basic health exercises, and increase healthy
social skill-building processes. The Marion Superior Court is committed to
providing a safe and secure Juvenile Detention Center while providing
practical, effective, and high-quality living and learning services to youth

MARION COUNTY PROSECUTOR
Introduction
The Marion County Prosecutor’s Office seeks to place public safety as the number one priority and responsibility of government. We are dedicated to holding
criminals accountable for their actions, preserving the rights of victims and continually seeking justice, all while maintaining the highest of ethical standards.
Structure
Criminal Charging Division
Police agencies present cases to this division for criminal charging
determinations. Deputy prosecutors determine what charges are to be filed in
each case, or if additional investigation is necessary.

Special Victims Team
This area of the office includes cases involving sex crimes and domestic
violence. It also handles cases of child abuse and leads the office’s efforts
and collaboration with the Julian Center.

Major Case Division
The Major Case Division handles major felony cases, including homicides.
Victim Advocates are assigned to each of these courts to ensure that victims
are notified of actions taken by the court and that they receive guidance and
support throughout the criminal justice process. Within the Major Case
Division, a Special Crimes Team includes prosecutors dedicated to human
trafficking, arson and unemployment insurance fraud.

Community Prosecution Division
Community prosecutors are assigned to the police districts and special areas.
These prosecutors work closely with district commanders and detectives to
develop strategies to protect and defend the communities served by the
respective police districts. Community prosecutors also encourage
community participation in public safety and crime prevention, engaging
residents in problem solving and establishing and maintaining partnerships.

Grand Jury Division
For cases involving white collar crime, public corruption, tax evasion and
other long term investigations, the Prosecutor has a staff of investigators and
lawyers dedicated to the collection of evidence and prosecution of these
cases. If criminal activity is suspected, the evidence is presented to a Grand
Jury composed of six citizens of Marion County who are presented with the
evidence and determine if criminal charges are filed. Currently, investigators
assigned to the Grand Jury Division represent detectives from the
Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department, Marion County Sheriff’s
Department, and Indiana State Police.

Juvenile Division
This division is responsible for filing and prosecuting acts of delinquency by
children 17 years of age and younger, including truancy cases. In certain
cases, more serious crimes can be directly filed to the adult criminal courts.

Strike Team
This division is responsible for three (3) areas of crime – drugs, guns and
gangs. Vigorous prosecution of these crimes is essential to the safety of the
community. The Strike Team partners with various police departments
throughout the county to assist in investigations, arrests, charging decisions
and the presentation of the case to the court.

Correction Division
This division responds to all requests for post-conviction relief and for
sentence modifications. This division also handles all requests for
expungement of arrests and convictions and the sealing of criminal records.

D-Felony/Misdemeanor Division
This division handles the prosecution of misdemeanor and Class D Felony
criminal cases. Cases include operating a vehicle while intoxicated, moving
traffic violations, theft, shoplifting, battery, vandalism, and trespassing. This
division handles more criminal cases than all other divisions combined.

MARION COUNTY PROSECUTOR– CHILD SUPPORT DIVISION
Introduction
The Child Support Division of the Marion County Prosecutor’s Office provides a wide range of services to parents who need child support establishment,
enforcement, or modification. Services are provided and authorized through the federal Title IV-D program and through a cooperative agreement with the Indiana
Child Support Bureau. Services are provided at the downtown office, as well as branch offices located at Flanner House, Center Township Trustee’s Office, Wayne
Township Trustee’s Office, and the Morris Settles Township Center.
Structure
Legal
Deputy prosecutors are responsible for the review, approval, and maintenance
of the cases assigned to the Child Support Division. These cases include
paternity establishment, petitions for child support, contempt cases,
modifications, medical support, interstate cases, and many additional issues
related to child support. Deputy prosecutors are assigned to sixteen (16)
regular weekly dockets and are assigned to additional hearings as scheduled
by the courts. Deputy prosecutors are aided by an attorney assistant who
works with administrative issues and other tasks.
Paternity
Staff in this section prepare cases for court, including pleadings, exhibits, and
genetic testing. These cases often are based upon paternity affidavits
executed by the parents and sometimes include interstate cases.
Litigation
Staff provides support for deputy prosecutors, including preparing cases for
thirteen (13) dockets per week, as well as a number of additional court
hearings. Additional services are provided through this section, including

states. This section is responsible for coordinating communication and
services across state lines, including paternity establishment, medical support,
child support order establishment and enforcement, and modifications of
child support orders.

In-person interaction with parents is the primary function of this group. In
addition to seeing 100 appointments in an average week, staff meets with
another 90 parents per week as walk-ins. Primary duties include initial case
creation, document preparation, and preparing cases for attorney review.
Branch
Intake functions are also available in the community, allowing parents the
opportunity to obtain services without having to travel downtown. Duties at
the branch locations are substantially the same as the intake division
previously listed.

Staff assigned to this section provide support services to other Child Support
Division employees. These include maintenance of files, calculating balances
on child support accounts, sending income withholding orders, and working

MARION COUNTY COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS
Vision and Mission Statements
Vision
To provide the citizens of Marion County a safer community.

Mission
To enhance public safety by raising offender accountability through the use
of evidence based practices and interventions.

Structure
Home Detention
The electronic equipment used for client monitoring includes active radio
frequency for typical home detention clients as well as global positioning
satellite equipment for high risk offenders, including domestic violence
offenders who are on home detention. Community Corrections also offers
electronic alcohol monitoring equipment. Offenders may be placed on any
combination of Home Detention, GPS, and Alcohol Monitoring. All
offenders under supervision have a variety of programming available.
Community Corrections utilizes the Indiana Risk Assessment System (IRAS)
to assess the risk of reoffending and services needed for all clients under
supervision. Based on overall risk score and identified criminogenic needs,
clients may be placed into the following evidence based programs presented
by trained facilitators: Parenting, Anger Management, Thinking For a
Change, Substance Abuse Treatment, as well as Job Readiness workshops
and GED/ABE. Mental health programming is also available for those
mentally ill offenders who might otherwise have been incarcerated at the
local or the state levels. MCCC has an Addictions Intervention Component
which focuses on addictions issues.

Work Release
In October 2007, the agency opened the Duvall Residential Center which
provides services for male work release offenders and has capacity for up to
350 persons. All residents of Duvall are eligible for the same programming
opportunities as electronic monitoring offenders.
Through contracts with service providers, we are able to serve offenders at 3

MARION COUNTY CORONER
Introduction
The Marion County Coroner's Office serves the needs of the families of those who die in Marion County as well as the needs of other agencies involved in the
investigation of unusual, unexpected, and unexplained deaths. The office provides, in a timely manner, an accurate completion of the Coroner's Verdict and Death
Certificates. With regard to all such matters, the Coroner’s Office provides public education, support, compassion and confidentiality. All personnel strive to
maintain the highest level of integrity while serving the needs of Marion County citizens.
Structure
Administrative Division
Under the direct supervision of the Chief Deputy, the Administrative Division
works with the families, the law enforcement agencies, and the public to
ensure that public information is shared and general inquiries are addressed in
a timely manner.
Pathology Division
The Pathology Division comprises a contracted Forensic Pathology group, an
Indiana University School of Medicine Forensic Fellow, and countyemployed Forensic Autopsy Assistants. Forensic Autopsies are performed by
board certified Forensic Pathologists, in accordance with the National
Association of Medical Examiner (NAME) Standards. These standards are
used as a guide to determine the cause and manner of death following the
initial investigation.

Investigations Division
Under direct supervision of the Chief Deputy Coroner, appointed Deputy
Coroners conduct various death investigations. About 3,000 deaths are
reported to the Marion County Coroner's Office annually, each of which is
examined by the Deputy Coroners to determine which warrant further
investigation. In over a thousand of these cases, the bodies of the decedents
are transported into the facility for forensic examination. Deputy Coroners are
certified by the Indiana State Coroner's Training Board. All investigators
who have been employed for more than one year become certified
Medicolegal Death investigators, a designation recognized by the State of
Indiana.

DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS
Introduction
The Indianapolis Department of Public Works (DPW) aims to improve residents’ quality of life through multi-modal connectivity, green space, capital
improvements, universal accessibility, and collaborative public and private partnerships. DPW builds and maintains public infrastructure, park land, manages solid
waste collection and the city’s entire fleet—striving always to provide effective, efficient customer service to citizens and visitors to Indianapolis, Marion County
and ensuring a healthy, safe, and natural environment.
Structure
Leadership:
DPW is led by a director appointed by the mayor. The director is supported
directly by a chief of staff. Under DPW leadership are several offices that
can be organized into four main divisions: Policy and Planning, Engineering,
Fleet Services, and Operations. These four divisions are not rigid: On a dayto-day basis, they merge to solve problems and increase livability across the
City and Marion County.
Policy and Planning
The Policy and Planning division works cooperatively to manage the
administration of the entire department, as directed by DPW leadership. This
division includes finance, the city-county council liaison, communications,
the Office of Sustainability, and the Office of Disability Affairs. While the
Office of Sustainability and the Office of Disability Affairs are housed within
DPW and report to the DPW director, they oversee livability and ADA issues
for the entire City and County. The offices within Policy and Planning work
closely with DPW leadership as well as deputy directors and administrators in
Engineering, Operations and Fleet Services to ensure policies are developed
and implemented with fidelity, efficiency and quality.
Operations:
The Operations division is responsible for solid waste collection and disposal;
maintenance of streets, traffic systems, levees, dams as well as park facilities
and grounds; forestry work; and snow and ice removal from City streets. This
division is comprised of both union and non-union employees. The work
performed in DPW’s Operations division requires highly skilled, dedicated
staff; for that reason, DPW safety and training are housed in this division, as
well.

Engineering Division
The Engineering division plans, designs, constructs, and maintains all streets,
sewers, roads, bridges, multi-modal paths, trails, parks, green spaces, and
thoroughfares. It is also responsible for access control, traffic control and
lights for these assets. Furthermore, the Engineering division manages the
development of studies, inventories, programs and projects—and manages all
contracts related to transportation and storm water infrastructure. In 2013,
DPW’s Engineering division welcomed staff from Indy Parks and now
oversees parks capital development and land stewardship activities.
Engineering—in collaboration with Operations and Fleet Services—works to
directly implement the vision of DPW and City leadership.
Fleet Services
The Fleet Services division is responsible for the maintenance, fueling,
monitoring and repair of all vehicles and other City-owned equipment—
including public safety vehicles—and the operation of a municipal garage.
Further, Fleet Services maintains and supplies fuel for vehicles and
equipment owned by several other governmental agencies on a contractual
basis. Like Operations, the Fleet Services division includes union and nonunion employees. \

OFFICE OF MINORITY & WOMEN BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT
Introduction
The Office of Minority &Women Business Development works to enhance
the City’s growth and economic stability through promotion of contracting
and procurement opportunities for MBE/WBE/VBE/DOBEs

Through community outreach, special events and programs such as startup
consulting and certification services, the DMWBD is an active partner to all
City of Indianapolis certified MBE/WBE/VBE/DOBEs.

Structure
Certification
MBE, WBE, VBE and DOBEs must be certified with the City through the
DMWBD. The DMWBD must verify that they meet the requirements of the
certification program. Recently implemented was the disability-owned
business enterprise program (DOBE). This program will be similar to the
MWBE certification process but the Office of Disability Affairs will process
the disability approval portion of the applicant and then the business entity
information will then be processed by the DMWBD.
Business Development
The DMWBD acts as a resource center for MBE, WBE, VBE and DOBEs
and provides programing that assist with growth and development of
companies, through outreach events, and educational workshops.
Compliance
DMWBD is responsible for reviewing all contracts, and the tracking of MBE,
WBE, VBE and DOBE participation on all contracts. DMWBD monitors
contracts to ensure the participation goals are being met.

Diversity Program
Recognize businesses and organizations that encourage, embrace, and
celebrate differences that foster a better place in which to live, work, and raise
a family.
The DMWBD is responsible for the Mayor’s Celebration of Diversity Award
luncheon, and working with the Indiana Black Expo on the Summer
Celebration, and the Circle City Classic event.
Budget change
Prior to the DMWBD budget being moved from the Mayor’s budget, we had
$8,000 in character three to be used for consulting services. Since that time
we have cut 2 FTE positions to meet budget cut requirements. These cuts
resulted in a significant decrease of business development and outreach to the
community, but resulted in savings of over $30k in character one for the
department. $22k, the remaining balance in character one from the FTE
position cuts was moved into character three for use in consulting services to
focus on contract compliance, and work force development. The total budget
line item is $30k.

MARION COUNTY ASSESSOR
Introduction
The Marion County Assessor’s main goal is to ensure the accuracy of property tax assessments. Each property owner pays a fair share of local government expenses
based on the value of the property owned. The County Assessor is responsible for determining the fair market value of each property in the county. In addition, the
County Assessor processes Inheritance Tax returns and determines whether taxpayers are entitled to inheritance tax returns and determines whether taxpayers are
entitled to charitable and non-profit property tax exemptions. Any time a taxpayer wishes to appeal an assessment decision, the appeal goes through the Property
Tax Assessment Board of Appeals (PTABOA) hearing process administered by the County Assessor.
Structure
Assessment Division
The Assessment Division assesses all real and business property throughout
the county. This division coordinates the efforts of field personnel, audit
staffs, and valuation experts to perform all phases of the assessment process
in accordance with International Association of Assessing Officers standards.
The division is further divided into functional areas separately covering
commercial, industrial, and residential properties, and reviewing taxpayers'
reports on business personal property. The division has four satellite offices
offering taxpayers a convenient place to obtain residential assessment
information and services.
Administration Division
The Administration Division is responsible for budget creation and
monitoring, payroll, human resources administration, facilities management,
procurement, education administration, process improvement, as well as
document management and retention. Further, it administers the hearing
process of the PTABOA and the review of property tax exemption
applications for charities and non-profits. Finally, this division also conducts
the auditing and processing of inheritance tax returns.

Data Analysis Division
The Data Analysis Division collects, manages, and analyzes the large
amounts of data needed for both efficient and modern assessment results. It
also creates satellite-coordinated mapping and connects assessment data to
each property geographically. Moreover, the division manages ownership
changes and records as well as maps changes in the property sizes. The
division is responsible for the sales disclosure process which collects,
reviews, and validates all property sales in the county. Finally, the division
organizes this enormous quantity of data into reports and statistics, which is
useful to the Assessment Division and to other government agencies, and is
available for dissemination to citizens over the Internet.

MARION COUNTY SURVEYOR
Introduction
Marion County Surveyor's Office was established by the Indiana Constitution in 1851. General Land Office surveys in what is now Marion County began in 1819.
Marion County is part of the rectangular survey system (Public Land System), which divides the land into sections that are one square mile. All real estate
boundaries in Marion County can be traced back to the Public Land System. Statute law requires the Surveyor to recheck at least five percent of the section corners
each year, there are over 2300 corners. The Marion County Surveyor’s Office maintains a Legal Survey Record Book and a Corner Record Book. No fee is charged
for surveying services provided to any city, county and other governmental agencies.
Structure
Surveying
In the field, the staff performs the precise measurements of Section Corners
and ties, per Indiana Code and replacing said monuments as necessary. We
monitor the Eagle Creek Dam for horizontal and vertical movement as well as
performing vital research within the office.
Information Technology
Information Technology supports the needs of the Surveyor’s Office. This
area compiles the data surveyors collect in the field by use of AutoCAD and
GIS software. Further, that data along with both the corner history and
drawing (which this department provides) is posted onto the county’s website.
We collect and quality check all measurements to ensure accurate, reliable
information is provided.
Having a greater reliance on new technology has helped the Surveyor’s office
to build a solid fiscal commitment to provide government and private sector
agencies and companies timely, accurate and useful information, while
helping us and these agencies and companies save taxpayers money and time.
Finally, these advancements in technology have enabled us to fulfill our legal
obligation for the completion of the Alcohol & Tobacco Commission’s
Verification of Business Location forms.

Preservation
Preservation is as much a part of the surveyor’s office as surveying and
technology. We believe in the importance of preserving our past for the
future generations. Understanding the necessity of creating legible electronic
copies of the records, maps, surveys and plats housed in the surveyor’s office
to ensure that they will be easily accessible for years to come. By
concentrating on this now we have been able to scan or have scanned already
deteriorating documents.

DEBT SERVICE
The Consolidated City carries different types of debt associated with
various programs and services. This debt takes on two forms: (1)
general obligation debt, which is supported by a pledge of the full faith
and credit of the Consolidated City and is usually funded by tax
revenue, and (2) special revenue debt, which is supported by a pledge
of a specific revenue stream.

Special Revenue Debt
Special revenue debt is mostly associated with Tax Increment
Financing (TIF) districts throughout Marion County. This debt is
supported through property tax increment capture. This financing tool
is used to develop and grow various communities and neighborhoods
that otherwise would have little growth potential.

Generally, the revenue stream pledged for special revenue debt is a fee
or other non-tax revenue. In the case of debt funded by tax increment
financing (TIF), tax increment revenue captured is segregated from the
regular property tax revenue of the Consolidated City.

TIF funds, including debt service for TIF bonds, are not appropriated
by the City-County Council. In Marion County, the Metropolitan
Development Commission (MDC) serves as the fiscal body for TIF
funds.

The Consolidated City of Indianapolis, Marion County takes pride and
care in maintaining its AAA (stable) credit rating for its general
obligation debt.

Other special revenue debt includes economic development bonds
which are typically supported by a revenue stream generated by a
specific investment. An example would be a bond issued to finance a
parking garage with the parking fees pledged to pay the debt service.
Another example would be financing stormwater projects, undertaken
by the Consolidated City to address flood control problems, with
stormwater fees pledged to paying the debt service.

General Obligation Debt
Most of the Consolidated City’s general obligation debt is related to
transportation, parks, and emergency communications infrastructure.
Other general obligation debt is related to police and fire pension costs
as well as redevelopment efforts throughout the Consolidated City.
Debt service payments for general obligation debt are typically funded
entirely, or in part, with tax revenue. Only tax-supported debt service
is included in tables presented in this report.

TIF debt service and other special revenue debt service is not included
in tables presented in this report, but is available separately.
