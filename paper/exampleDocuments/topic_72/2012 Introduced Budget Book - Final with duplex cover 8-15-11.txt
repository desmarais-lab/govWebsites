August 15, 2011
To the Members of the Indianapolis City County Council,
It is my distinct honor to present the 2012 Budget for the Consolidated City of Indianapolis, Marion County. This balanced budget proposal funds
the critical operations of government, protects taxpayers and sets Indianapolis on a strong fiscal course during uncertain economic times.
The budget presented within the following pages is a responsible plan that includes no tax increases, no borrowing, and is fully funded. It maintains
the strong fiscal position of Indianapolis and preserves our place as a low tax and attractive place for people to work, live, and raise a family.
Due to the effects of property tax caps, which I strongly support, and the national economic downturn, our tax revenue continues to decline. Thus, it
is imperative that city government continue to find savings and improve processes. This maintains the our commitment to public safety by holding
funding level for public safety and criminal justice functions while reducing spending by 6% percent for all other agencies. It calls for no layoffs in
the ranks of our police and firefighters and honors their contractual pay raise in 2012.
The world is watching as the weight of deficit spending exacts a heavy toll in Washington, D.C. and in capitols across Europe. Indianapolis will not
follow their lead. We will do as Hoosiers have always done and make the difficult choices to live within our means.
I welcome your review, and I look forward to fruitful discussions about this budget.
Sincerely,

Gregory A. Ballard
Mayor
City of Indianapolis

Executive Summary
Fiscal Circumstances
The 2012 budget for the Consolidated City of Indianapolis, Marion County poses an interesting challenge: how to navigate a sharp and sustained
downturn in revenues without derailing the City from the path of progress upon which it is set. This proposed budget arrives at the confluence of
three daunting fiscal challenges facing our City and municipalities across the State and the nation. Our 2012 revenues will reflect the depths of the
Great Recession of 2010. State laws defining both the distribution of local income taxes and calculation of local property taxes result in a two year
lag between economic events and municipal government revenue impacts. Consequently, projected 2012 income tax revenues for the Consolidated
City are down $85 million from their peak in 2010 (a drop of more than 30%).
This sharp income tax decline, which hit heavily in 2011, depleted the operating reserves the City had thoughtfully built up in 2008, 2009, and
2010. This contributes further to our 2012 fiscal challenges.
The upward trajectory of fixed costs such as contractual raises, health insurance coverage, municipal pension benefits, and fuel completes a triad
of fiscal factors converging in 2012. Together these three factors, along with some essential non-recurring additional costs, define a $64 million
fiscal challenge for the City of Indianapolis in 2012. Yet despite similar circumstances undermining the desires and goals of municipalities across
the country, there remains much reason for optimism here.
Key Financial Features
This 2012 proposed budget offers a roadmap through a difficult fiscal time, without putting at risk the key foundational principles upon which the
City’s continued success is based. It leaves the City poised to excel, regionally and nationally, in the post-recession environment that will
inevitably come.
This budget’s four key features are: 1) it does not increase the tax burden on a recovering local economy; 2) is does not increase the City’s general
debt burden which would mitigate the opportunities for future investments; 3) it does make generational investments in repairing the City’s critical
physical infrastructure; and 4) it does maintain high level commitments to protecting the public’s safety.
Beyond these core features, the 2012 budget will allow the City to continue its aggressive and successful efforts in new business development and
attraction; to elevate its international stature; and to innovate in education to make Indianapolis a city of choice for young families.

1

To navigate this path successfully, we must thoughtfully use the limited resources provided by the City’s taxpayers. To keep the City on track, the
2012 budget plan is built on these key financial features:
9 seeking a reimbursement of not more than $40 million from the Downtown tax increment financing district (TIF) for past city infrastructure
improvements expenses benefiting the Downtown TIF;
9 seeking a reimbursement of up to $4 million from the Indianapolis Capital Improvements Board (CIB) for extraordinary public safety costs
related to the 2012 Super Bowl; and,
9 requiring all non-public safety and criminal justice departments and agencies to spend grudgingly and find cost saving process improvements
to yield $20M in base budget savings.
In addition to seeking reimbursement from the Downtown TIF, this budget also releases approximately $170 million of tax increment assessed
value (AV) to the general tax base for 2012. This action will benefit all taxing units across the county.
This financial plan will also enable the City to continue its investments in core information systems to modernize internal operations and financial
controls. This is an investment necessary to both support productivity gains essential to navigating lean times and prepare the City to continue to
excel over the long term.
Notably, the $425 million in cash proceeds provided by the transfer of the water and wastewater utilities to Citizens Energy Group puts the City in
the enviable position of being able to invest in its physical infrastructure while many other municipalities across the nation continue to struggle.
The proceeds from the transfer will fund improvements to roads, bridges, sidewalks, and the demolition and deconstruction of abandoned
properties through Mayor Ballard's RebuildIndy program.
Mayor Ballard is protecting RebuildIndy funds from being used for general government programs. Thus, no RebuildIndy funds are being used in
2012 operating budget. Additionally, $80 million is set aside for a new Fiscal Stability Fund to maintain the City’s AAA credit rating. This $80
million will not be spent for any purpose until they are no longer necessary to maintain our AAA rating; then, those funds will be returned to the
RebuildIndy Fund for investment in infrastructure projects.
To date, more than $140 million has been invested to improve roads, bridges, and sidewalks in every part of our City. By year-end, another $40
million will be invested for these purposes and the demolition and deconstruction of hundreds of abandoned properties. In 2012 and beyond,
Mayor Ballard’s RebuildIndy program will invest more than $200 million dollars over the next few years.
Specific Budget Elements
With this budget the City’s ability to deliver high quality snow and ice removal services this winter and required street and walkway repairs next
spring remains intact. Work will also continue, in earnest, on flood control improvements across the City in 2012. Curbside recycling is being
added to the standard trash removal services, in selected neighborhoods, with a goal of expanding it countywide. Because the Department of

2

Public Works (DPW) is not funded with income taxes, their 2012 budget need not be adjusted in response to the downturn in that revenue stream.
That said, the City will continue to strive for savings and service level improvements within DPW.
The same is true for the Department of Code Enforcement (DCE). It will continue to operate at the level their dedicated, non-fungible revenues
support. DCE charges fees only to those who use its service, freeing all taxpayers of the burden of funding this department; so, its funding level
depends more on the effectiveness of its operations than on the general tax revenue climate of local government.
For the general tax-supported County agencies and City departments, this budget demands active and effective management. The core public
safety and criminal justices agencies, which account for about 85% of the general fund budget, are each funded at or near 100% of their 2011
appropriation level. This can be accomplished only because of an affirmative decision to focus additional resources received from the Downtown
TIF and the CIB on the City’s core public safety and criminal justice responsibilities. The agencies and departments in this group are: the
Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department (IMPD); the Indianapolis Fire Department (IFD); Department of Homeland Security (DHS); Animal
Care & Control (ACC); the Marion County Sheriff Department (MCSD); the Superior & Circuit Courts; the Marion County Prosecutor Office
(MCPO); the Public Defender Agency; Forensic Services; and Community Corrections.
Additional key features of the proposed funding for public safety and criminal justice are:
9 1% contractual salary increases for police officers, firefighters, park rangers, and public safety officers will be honored; and
9 the City’s $2 million Crime Prevention Grant program will be continued.
For the other tax-supported general government functions, 2012 funding is about 94% of 2011 appropriation levels. The proposed budgets for
these other departments and agencies fully reflect the impact of the downturn in tax revenues. The City departments in this group are: the Mayor’s
Office; the City-County Council Office; the Public Safety Director’s Office; the Parks Department; Channel 16; and the other administrative
functions of city government. The County agencies in the group are: the Auditor’s Office; the Assessor’s Office, the Clerk’s Office and Election
Board/Voter Registration, the Coroner’s Office; ; the Recorder’s Office, the Surveyor’s Office, the Treasurer’s Office; and Cooperative Extension
Services.
Additional key features of the proposed funding for these other general government functions are:
9 continued capital investment in park grounds and facilities to further enhance these key public assets; and
9 the City’s $1 million grant to the Indianapolis Arts Council will be continued.
Finally, the matter of funding for the Indianapolis/Marion County Public Library (IMCPL) has also been a growing concern over the past few
years. During the recently concluded 2011 session of the Indiana General Assembly, municipal finance laws governing Marion County were
changed to allow a portion of the County Option Income Tax (COIT) to be allocated to the IMCPL. The fact that COIT revenues are currently in
decline makes the idea of adding new uses for these scarce funds less appealing fiscally in 2012; however, with an eye on the long haul, adding the

3

library to the COIT is the right policy. This budget sets an allocation of COIT for IMCPL at 1/10% of the county total or $149,702 in 2012. If
adopted, this will position the IMCPL to share in the future economic growth of the City in ways that their property tax levy does not provide.

The Budget Process
Even in tight times, the typical budgeting process in government is focused on the allocation of incremental resources (i.e. seeking highest and best
use for the additional funds available). Given the fiscal circumstances outlined above, the budget development process for 2012 followed an
atypical path. Though for the past three years, it could be said that the City’s budget process has been in an atypical cycle. Appropriation
reductions have been demanded each cycle to address a projected deficit inherited in 2008 and then in response to the new property tax caps that
reduced property tax revenues sharply beginning in 2009.
With tax revenues continuing a downward trajectory in 2012, the budget instructions issued in May directed all agencies and departments to assess
the impacts of executing their missions in 2012 with 5% less funding than provided in 2011. This was done in preparation for tax revenue
estimates that were not to be finalized until early August. Thus, agency and department budget submissions did not represent an unfettered
estimate of their 2012 operational funding requests. Rather, they were a tool to require early assessments of continued operational changes that
might be necessary in 2012 with less funding. After a decision to seek reimbursement from the Downtown TIF was settled on, only then were
final funding levels able to be set for each agency and department.
The process of setting agency and department budgets was much more than an exercise in reducing appropriations proportionally to match
available funds. Not only was the decision made to set differential funding levels for public safety and criminal justice operations, but a serious
effort was made to account for the unique effects of fixed operating cost increases on individual agency and department budgets. Finally, nonrecurring unusual costs for 2012 were factored in where appropriate. As a result, many budgets may not appear to fit neatly into either the 100%
funding or the 94% funding category at first glance. Changes to the allocation of internal chargebacks for information technology and legal
services play a large role in these adjustments. To accommodate all of this, base budgets were calculated for each agency and department.
Reductions in response to declining revenues were made to the base budgets, then some funding was restored to each budget to reflect individual
changes in fixed costs and internal chargebacks. Thus, shifts in internal cost allocations, corrections of past budget errors, and non-recurring items
were all accounted for appropriately.
Looking Ahead
Despite challenging financial times, the 2012 budget for the City and County once again sets forth a responsible plan by which agencies can
continue serving all citizens of Marion County, making Indianapolis a safe, livable city now and for decades to come. With a sharp rebound in
local income tax revenues anticipated in 2014, positioning the City for continued success from that point forward was paramount to the budget
decisions made in 2012.
