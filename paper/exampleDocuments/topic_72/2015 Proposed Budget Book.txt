Gregory A. Ballard, Mayor

2015 Proposed Budget

Presented to the Indianapolis-Marion County City County Council 8.18.2014

for the Consolidated City of Indianapolis, Marion County

s

To the Members of the Indianapolis City-County Council,
It is my distinct honor to present the 2015 Budget for the Consolidated City of Indianapolis, Marion County. In the pages that follow you will find a
budget that is balanced and honors our commitment to fund the critical functions of municipal government in the 12th largest city in the United
States. It is funded and fiscally responsible. It will ensure that Indianapolis remains one of the largest cities in America that holds a AAA rating
from the major ratings agencies.
During my announcement on July 30, 2014, I laid out a comprehensive plan to support early education opportunities for at-risk children, increase
support to our men and women of the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department through additional officers over the next 4 years, and fund
criminal justice services that will engage in reducing crime in Indianapolis. While the budget proposal included in this document is a “maintenance”
budget, I encourage the Council to act on the elimination of the local homestead credit and to increase the public safety income tax to create the
funding for the programs listed above and allocate those funds during the 2015 fiscal year in a transparent and effective manner.
This proposed budget recognizes the ongoing fiscal challenges faced by many cities due to a lagging national economic recovery. The budget
maintains Indianapolis’s strong fiscal position and contains a holistic approach to making Indianapolis a safer place to live, work, and raise a family.
I welcome your review, and I look forward to the forthcoming discussions about this budget.
Sincerely,

Gregory A. Ballard
Mayor

Executive Summary
The proposed 2015 budget for the Consolidated City of Indianapolis, Marion County is a balanced budget that signifies the goals and
priorities of the Administration while accurately accounting for revenues and expenditures for the upcoming fiscal year. Maintaining
positive fund balances, protecting the Fiscal Stability Fund, and holding the line on spending were key focus points when developing the
2015 budget. Even while major revenue sources like income taxes and property taxes are expected to increase for 2015, those funds must
be used to support current essential services and maintain healthy fund balances rather than drive increases in spending.
On July 30, 2014 Mayor Ballard presented his Early Education and Public Safety Initiative which focuses on improving early education
access in Indianapolis for at-risk youth, hiring an additional 280 police officers over 4 years, and increasing financial support for the
criminal justice system. Specifically the Initiative calls for $5 million per year in public matching funds to expand early education
programs for at-risk youth, $4 million for 40 additional police officers beyond the 50 new officers planned for 2015, and up to $10 million
for criminal justice agencies and departments. Funding for these programs and additional officers comes from the elimination of the local
homestead credit and an increase in the public safety income tax.
The 2015 Proposed Budget is a “maintenance” budget that provides for minimal increases in spending; specifically adjustments for state
mandated pay increases, contractual pay increases, information technology, and legal costs. While the Mayor’s plan calls for increased
revenue to support the early education expansion, more police officers, and greater investment in criminal justice services, this budget does
not reflect those changes at this time. As the vote to eliminate the local homestead credit and increase the public safety tax will occur after
the presentation of the 2015 Proposed Budget, including those expenditures would be premature. However, the Mayor urges the Council
to pass a 2015 “Base Plus” budget in October of this year, and then allocate those funds in 2015 in a transparent manner that will provide
for public input and focused discussions.
At the start of 2014, the budget faced an operating shortfall of $37 million within the city and county’s tax supported funds. Based on these
projections, the Office of Finance and Management (OFM) adopted a 3.5% management reserve on all funds to set aside resources in the
event overall revenues fluctuated during the year. OFM is pleased to report that all city and county agencies, departments, separately
elected officials and separate branches of government participated in the management reserve exercise.
Of the total management reserve, roughly $23 million was set aside in the city and county’s tax supported funds. Through 2014, income
taxes have remained stable and will continue on target for the remainder of the year. For property taxes, the city and county expect
additional revenue due to the elimination of nearly 35,000 local homestead deductions from fraudulent homestead deduction filings. This
action could result in approximately $30 million of additional one-time property tax revenues in 2014 for operating funds.

OFM projects that a large portion of the management reserve will be released along with some additional appropriations based on
discussions with city and county agencies, departments, separately elected officials, and separate branches of government. In addition,
miscellaneous revenues for the tax supported funds are projected to fall below budget by $2 million. However, with additional one-time
property tax revenue of $30 million and some management reserve held back, OFM projects the city and county’s tax supported funds will
end 2014 with approximately $83.5 million in fund balance.
While difficult decisions have, and will be made, to close the operating deficit and maintain positive fund balances, the 2015 budget
continues investment in public safety, infrastructure, and neighborhood development.
Police and fire funding will be increased in 2015 to account for contractual pay increases recently negotiated with the police and fire
unions. Both police and fire departments will continue to find efficiencies within their operations to maintain the level of services
currently provided. The budget continues to support the Mayor’s plan to provide additional officers on the street through improved
allocation of resources and a recruit class in 2015. The budget includes funding for police and fire operations related to contractual pay
increases from 2014 and for 2015. The IMPD General Fund budget will increase by $4.6 million in 2015 to support 50 new recruits to
replace retiring officers in 2015, 80 officers hired in 2014, and contractual pay increases from 2014 and 2015. For IFD, the IFD General
Fund budget will increase by $6.9 million which includes a new recruit class of 20 firefighters to reduce high overtime costs and supports
contractual pay increases from 2014 and 2015. IFD will continue to examine its operations and opportunities for consolidation in order to
create savings in the future.
Funding for criminal justice services such as the Public Defender, the Marion County Superior Courts, the Prosecutor, and other agencies
will remain relatively flat from 2014 to 2015. An increase of $3 million from the County General and Public Safety Income Tax fund is
included for state mandated pay increases for probation officers and public defenders, contractual pay increases for Sheriff’s Deputies, and
contractual costs related to 911 emergency dispatch operations. The city and county are aware of the recent changes by the Indiana
General Assembly with regards to House Enrolled Act 1006-2013 (HEA-1006) and how it may impact the Marion County criminal justice
system. While the full impact of HEA-1006 has not been realized, adjusting budgets in the future to address the impact may be necessary.
For Community Corrections, the budget funds 4 additional caseworkers to address home visitation requirements and remain in compliance
with the Indiana Department of Corrections. Finally, the 2015 budget will fund the Crime Prevention Grant at $2 million, providing
opportunities for not-for-profit groups that wish to engage the community in ways to reduce crime and improve their neighborhoods.
Infrastructure improvements and upgrades continue to be a primary focus of the Administration and are reflected in the 2015 budget.
Support for the Rebuild Indy program will continue with an investment of $7.3 million in 2015 from proceeds related to the sale of water
and waste water facilities to the Citizen’s Energy Group. The $7.3 million figure represents the final amount of funds available from the
RebuildIndy Fund. The budget will utilize the Parking Meter fund in 2015 to make infrastructure and capital improvements in the amount
of $6 million in and around parking meter areas. For 2015, the Transportation General fund will provide a loan repayment to the Fiscal

2

3
Stability Fund of $8 million as part of an agreement with the City-County Council. In order to pay the loan and maintain a positive fund
balance, a reduction of $8 million in Transportation General capital projects is necessary.
The City will continue its investment in park facilities and maintenance during 2015, ensuring parks are well maintained and capital
improvements are made throughout the year. Finally, continued improvements and upgrades related to storm water infrastructure will
maintain funding in 2015 compared to 2014, bringing total investment (local and federal support) in the city and county’s infrastructure to
$51 million in 2015.
Neighborhoods are one of the main reasons why Indianapolis and Marion County continues to be a city people want to live, work, and be
part of now and in the future. Beyond funding police, fire, and infrastructure services, this budget continues to fund the important work
provided by the Department of Metropolitan Development (DMD), the Department of Code Enforcement (DCE), and the Department of
Parks and Recreation (DPR). The Administration, through the 2015 budget, continues to highlight the need for neighborhood planning and
development to ensure we are building a long term vision for the city and its residents. Additional funding is provided in the 2015 budget
for DMD to manage and operate city owned assets, increase redevelopment efforts, and update and manage zoning changes made in 2014.
The DCE, a self-sufficient operation, will increase funding in 2015 to support a new illegal dumping program and the shift of managing
the Unsafe Building Program from DMD. Our parks continue to play a vital role in and around neighborhoods throughout the city and
county. This budget continues to fund park operations, maintenance, and capital investment in park’s facilities. In addition, Parks will
fund increases for lifeguards to ensure pools continue to stay open in 2015 during the summer time period. Finally, the Arts Grant will
continue to be funded at $1 million as part of the 2015 budget.
Beyond specific agency changes, the budget includes changes to the city and county sponsored health insurance by moving to a full
Consumer Driven Health Plan for 2015. While the city’s share of health insurance costs will rise in 2015, the long term impact of moving
to an all Consumer Driven Health Plan will allow for lower cost adjustments in future years. Potential health insurance costs in the future
could increase from 7% to 10% annually, hence the need to invest in a long term approach to health insurance plans. Agencies and
departments continue to evaluate contracts that could be renegotiated and OFM continues to hold Strategic Hiring Committee meeting to
manage headcount. For 2015, the Information Services Agency (ISA) will make capital investments of nearly $2.4 million to improve
information technology infrastructure and operations. In addition, ISA will invest in training programs and materials to ensure employees
working in the enterprise resource planning tool, Peoplesoft, have the appropriate knowledge and skills that will create operational
efficiencies within agencies that provide enterprise-wide functions.
Expenditures are only one side of the equation when developing a balanced budget, thus revenue plays an equally, if not more important
role, to balancing the budget and funding public safety.
As noted earlier, this budget includes the impact of eliminating nearly 35,000 fraudulent homestead deductions, which will increase the
assessed value of Marion County property by an estimated $2 billion. The homestead deduction verification program allowed not only the

city and county to benefit, but all Marion County taxing units by providing more property tax income in 2014 than originally anticipated.
Even while the amount of property tax revenue will be significantly higher in 2014 than originally budgeted, 2015 estimated property tax
revenue will provide for higher property tax revenue than originally budgeted in 2014. This is due to a higher assessed value in 2015
resulting in lower property tax rates and thus lowering the impact of the property tax caps (less circuit breaker impact). For 2014, the city
and county adopted $306 million in total property tax funds; however due to the homestead deduction verification program, the projected
property tax revenues for the city and county are $318 million, an increase of approximately $12 million in 2015.
Due to higher fund balances in some of the debt service funds; the budget reduces the amount of property tax levy necessary to fund debt
service payments. In 2014, the city and county budgeted nearly $30 million in property tax revenue to support debt service payments. For
2015, the amount of property tax revenue necessary to support debt service payments is $24 million, a reduction of $6 million in property
taxes paid to support debt service.
Finally, as Indiana and Marion County slowly emerge from one of the worst financial crises in the last 80 years, we are seeing an increase
in the overall income tax revenue generated by Marion County residents. In 2014, the city and county received $238 million in income tax
revenue distributions which support public safety, criminal justice, and public safety communications. For 2015, the state is expected to
increase the income tax revenue distribution by $17 million. While this increase is helpful, it certainly does not discharge the city and
county from holding the line on spending and improving our financial position.
The Administration’s goal is to keep the tax supported fund balance at or above 10% of the annual expenditures from tax supported funds,
which is $78 million in 2015. Based on the 2015 proposed budget, the fund balance for tax supported funds will end at approximately $55
million. This figure does not include the $73 million that is held in the Fiscal Stability Fund nor other dedicated, federal, or state funds.
The Office of Finance and Management (OFM) projects that if normal underspending occurs in 2014 and property tax collections are
100% in 2014 and 2015, the $55 million projected balance will increase.
The 2015 budget focuses on the goals of the Administration, continues to support vital services that make the Consolidated City of
Indianapolis, Marion County a great place to live, and maintains the Administration’s commitment to fiscal stability and long term
financial planning. This balanced budget has been accomplished through tough decisions regarding spending, finding innovate ways to
provide services, creating efficiencies where possible, and identifying revenues that directly benefit public safety. While challenges lay
ahead, the financial plan presented in this budget continues to serve all citizens of Marion County and makes Indianapolis a great city to
live, work, and raise a family.

Funds
The Indiana State Board of Accounts (SBOA) defines “fund” to
mean “cash or a group of accounts set aside for the purpose of
accounting for monies or other resources of general functions or
specific activities . . . in accordance with the system of accounts
prescribed by the State Board of Accounts or as required by statute”
(State Board of Accounts, Accounting and Uniform Compliance
Guidelines Manual for Cities and Towns, State of Indiana, reissued
2006).

Fund; Parks General Fund; Public Safety Income Tax Fund –
County; Public Safety Income Tax Fund – City; Personal Services
Contingency Fund – County; Personal Services Contingency Fund –
City; Guardian Ad Litem Fund; and Medical Care for Inmates Fund.
What all of these funds have in common is that they each will each
receive a substantial amount of flexible tax revenue. Thus, there is
the ability to reallocate the flexible revenue flowing to these funds
across many competing operational needs.

Funds that the SBOA prescribes for use by cities include but are not
limited to, general funds, special revenue funds, debt services funds,
capital projects funds, internal service funds, and agency funds.
Funds included in the 2015 Introduced Budget represent those that
require appropriation by the City-County Council. Appropriation is
the authorization of the City-County Council by ordinance to make
disbursements or to incur obligations for specific purposes.

Dedicated Funds
Dedicated funds, on the other hand, are funds which receive revenue
from taxes or non-tax sources that have very restricted legal uses. A
more apt of a dedicated fund description is a fund that receives little
or no revenue from flexible tax revenue sources. Some examples are
the Parking Meter Fund and the Permits Fund. These are both
dedicated funds because their revenue sources have strictly limited
legal uses.

General Funds
General funds are funds which receive a substantial share of their
revenue from taxes that have very broad flexibility. For example, the
1% County Option Income Tax (COIT) distributions and the County
General Fund property tax levy may legally be used to fund any
governmental purpose.

The Consolidated City also uses dedicated funds to account for the
proceeds of specific revenue sources (e.g., special revenue funds)
and/or for expenditures restricted to a specific purpose (e.g. debt
service funds; enterprise funds). Debt service funds (aka sinking
funds) are used to account for the accumulation of revenue for the
payment of long-term debt principal and interest.

The core general operating funds for the Consolidated City are:
County General Fund; Consolidated County General Fund (aka City
General Fund); Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department
(IMPD) General Fund; Indianapolis Fire Department (IFD) General

Grant Funds
Finally, the Consolidated City also employs grant funds to collect
revenues and track expenditures for grant monies received from
other units of government.

Revenues
State law requires adoption of a balanced budget, which shall include
all anticipated revenues and expenses of every organizational unit
(with the exception of utilities). As such, all appropriations adopted
by the City-County Council must be fully supported by (1) revenue
that is legally eligible to support proposed expenses, and/or (2) fund
balance (essentially prior year, unencumbered revenue) that is legally
eligible to support the proposed expense.

The Consolidated City relies primarily on property and income taxes
to fund its operations. However, a significant amount of revenue is
derived from Fees and Charges as well as from Federal and State
Grants. The following pages provide more detailed information
about property tax rates, levies and districts as well as the various
types of income taxes, tax rates as well as the available uses of such
funds.

Property Tax
Citizens of the Consolidated City are subject to several overlapping
property tax districts which levy taxes for city and county general
purpose funds, as well as specific services. Taxpayers residing in
overlapping districts would be subject to the tax rates of each
applicable district.
Certified Levy (Gross Levy)
The total property tax levy for a taxing unit before the property tax
cap is considered. Referred to as “certified” because it is approved
by the State Department of Local Government Finance (DLGF).
DLGF approval is required to ensure that the levy amount is within
maximum levy limitations set by State law.
Net Levy
The expected property tax levy after deducting the property tax
circuit breaker credits attributable to the property tax caps.
Gross Assessed Value
The assessed value of a property before applying any eligible
property tax deductions or abatements (which lower the property’s
taxable assessed value). The property tax caps are set based on each
parcel’s gross assessed value.
Net Assessed Value (Taxable Assessed Value)
The taxable value of property after all eligible property tax
deductions and abatements are applied.

Property Tax Cap (aka Circuit Breaker)
The property tax cap, also known as the “circuit breaker,” was
enacted by the Indiana General Assembly in 2008 and subsequently
amended into the Indiana Constitution. The cap guarantees that
property tax rates in overlapping districts cannot exceed a certain
capped percent of the parcel’s gross assessed value. The “circuit
breaker” amount represents property tax liability waived because it is
above the level allowed under the property tax caps. The property
tax caps are as follows:
1% - for Homestead property
2% - for other residential property and agricultural land
3% - for commercial and industrial property
Taxing Districts & Rates
The following pages show the taxing districts along with the Net
Assessed Values (NAV) of taxable property within those districts for
pay year 2015. The Tax Rate for a district is determined by the
following formula:

Income Tax
State law allows Indiana counties to impose a local income tax on
the State adjusted gross income of county taxpayers.
Also, counties may choose between several income tax options and
combinations. Each type of local income tax option is regulated by
specific rules and rate restrictions. Residents of Marion County are
subject to three interrelated income taxes in the form of the County
Option Income Tax (COIT), the Levy Freeze Local Option Income
Tax (LOIT), and the Public Safety Income Tax (PST).
This local income tax is collected by the State Department of
Revenue then distributed to counties based on the amount due to
each county on State income tax returns processed.
County Income Tax Council (CITC)
Local income tax is imposed or modified in a county by the action of
the CITC. In Marion County, the CITC is composed of the CityCounty Council and the fiscal body of each city or town that lies
either partially or entirely within the county. The other members of
the CITC are the Lawrence City Council, the Beech Grove City
Council, the Southport City Council, and the Speedway Town
Council.
Voting representation on the CITC is based on each member unit’s
share of the total county population. In Marion County, the CityCounty Council holds over 90% of the voting representation on the
CITC.

County Option Income Tax (COIT)
Current Rate: 1.00% Maximum Rate: 1.00%

COIT revenue may be used for any lawful purpose of the
governmental unit.
Levy Freeze Local Option Income Tax (LOIT)
Current Rate: 0.27% Maximum Rate: 1.00%

An additional income tax rate may be imposed to generate revenue to
replace property tax levy growth. Thus, imposing this tax reflects a
policy choice to shift fiscal reliance from property tax to income tax,
not an overall tax increase.
Once imposed, this rate may neither be rescinded nor decreased.
Each year the CITC must hold at least one public meeting to discuss
whether or not Levy Freeze LOIT rate should be increased.
Public Safety Income Tax (PST)
Current Rate: 0.35% Maximum Rate: 0.50%

Because Marion County has imposed a Levy Freeze LOIT rate, State
law allows adoption of a PST rate. PST revenues may be used for
police and fire, including pensions, emergency services,
communications systems, jails and related facilities, and other items
related to public safety.

Expenditures
Expenditure Categories (Characters)
In addition to the restrictions imposed by agencies/departments
regarding funding sources, agency spending is further restricted by
limiting the total funds available to support various spending
categories or “characters”. The Consolidated City employs five
separate characters to segregate spending. Each is described as
follows:

Properties and Equipment (Character 4)
This category includes expenditures for the acquisition of, or
addition to assets such as land, infrastructure, buildings,
improvements other than buildings, as well as machinery and
equipment.

Internal Charges (Character 5)
Personal Services (Character 1)
This category includes expenditures for salaries, wages and related
employee benefits provided for all Consolidated City employees.
Employee benefits include employer contributions to group health
and life insurance, pension benefits, unemployment compensation,
uniform allowance and similar benefits.

This category includes internal charges such as expenditures for the
Mayor’s Action Center, the Office of Corporation Counsel and Fleet
Services.
If a department has a negative appropriation for Character 5, it
means that department is a provider of internal services and a net
recipient of internal charges.

Materials and Supplies (Character 2)
This category includes articles and commodities that are consumed
or materially altered when used. Supplies include office supplies,
operating supplies, repair and maintenance supplies and other similar
items.

Other Services and Charges (Character 3)
This category includes expenditures for services other than personal
services required by the Consolidated City either to carry out its
assigned functions or to fulfill moral or legal obligations. Other
Services and Charges includes professional services, communication
and transportation, printing and advertising, insurance (excluding
group health, life and self-insurance), utility expenditures, contracted
repairs and maintenance, rentals, debt service expenditures for
principal and interest payments as well as long-term debt.

This category exists for only City departments. Similar expenditures
from county agencies are reported as Character 3 instead. Since the
Information Services Agency (ISA) is a County agency, their
charges are not administered through Character 5. Both City
departments and County agencies pay ISA charges through
Character 3.

DPS ADMINISTRATION
Introduction
The City of Indianapolis Department of Public Safety (DPS) will remain a national model leveraging the unique strengths of the Police, Fire, Homeland Security,
Animal Care and Control, and Communications Divisions as an integrated department. DPS will deliver the highest quality of public safety services in a fiscally
effective manner to secure the Greater Indianapolis area by preventing, preparing for, responding to, and recovering from routine emergencies and large-scales
incidents. The Administration unit of DPS provides coordination and leadership for the agencies within DPS.
Structure
The Department of Public Safety comprises five integrated divisions as well as the Citizens Police Complaint Office (CPCO) and the Mayor’s Office of Re-Entry.
The Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department, Indianapolis Fire Department, Division of Homeland Security, Animal Care and Control, and Public Safety
Communications operate within one department and share resources in innovative ways. This structure increases operational effectiveness by leveraging the
strengths of each division to provide public safety services to the City of Indianapolis/Marion County. Each of the divisions has their own operational goals and
unique personalities. The Department of Public Safety was created by Section 251 of the revised municipal code. CPCO, independent of the Indianapolis
Metropolitan Police Department, was created by city ordinance. The CPCO affords citizens of the Consolidated City of Indianapolis Marion County who believe
they have been treated improperly by an IMPD officer the opportunity to have his or her complaint(s) both heard and investigated. Mayor Gregory Ballard
established the Office of Re-Entry to develop collaborative partnerships among government, businesses, faith-based organizations, and community members to
leverage resources, to ensure sustainability by enhancing crime prevention strategies, and evaluating outcomes based on data collection and quality of life
enhancement, for ex-offenders and the community.

DIVISION OF HOMELAND SECURITY
Introduction
The Division leads an integrated Department of Public Safety effort to secure, prevent, prepare, respond, investigate, and ensure resiliency from natural or humanmade threats and hazards to the city, and to sustain a confident public. The Division is also responsible for preparing plans and managing the safety and security of
special events when anticipated requirements exceed the capability of the concerned geographic area. The Division of Homeland Security was created by Section
251 of the revised Municipal Code.
Structure
The Division was formed to unify divisions within the Department of Public Safety to create the capacity to deal with terrorist attacks, major disasters, planning and
managing special events, and other emergencies. By embracing a single set of guiding principles, from the Director of Public Safety to the frontline employee, we
have created a single division working to secure the City of Indianapolis/Marion County.
The Division does not operate in a vacuum. Other Federal, State, and local institutions participate actively in the Division’s efforts to work within the intelligence
community, investigate, disrupt terrorist activities, pre-planning and managing special events, and in the preparation for and response to major disasters, as do our
private and non-profit sectors and international partners. We will continue to work cooperatively to ensure that all of the instruments of local power – including
leadership, specialized technical expertise, research, and development investments – are brought to bear on the challenges we face in a coordinated and unified
manner.

divisions - Civil, Criminal, Juvenile, and Probate. Additionally, Probation, Juvenile Detention Center, and Court Administration all function as independent
departments/divisions under the purview of the Court. The Court is governed by an Executive Committee consisting of four judges elected by their peers for terms
of two years. The Executive Committee oversees the general policy and management of the Court.
Structure
Court Division
The thirty-six courts of the Court Division handle more than 50,000 civil
cases and more than 40,000 criminal cases each year. Some courts are
designated problem solving courts such as domestic violence, drug,
community, and traffic. In addition, the Traffic Division handles over
120,000 cases each year.
The Criminal and Civil Term Committees select a Chair bi-annually from
within their respective judicial members to address issues specific to their
respective courts. The General Term meets monthly to provide a forum for
review of issues.
Probation Department
The Probation Department is comprised of the adult and juvenile divisions.
Its mission is to enhance community safety through enforcement of court
orders while striving to empower individuals and change lives. Probation
assists in relieving jail bed concerns through both pre-trial and probation
services. More than 11,000 adults and 2,000 juveniles were serviced by the
probation department in 2013. The department has embraced the role of
evidenced based practices in their daily operations focused on the initiatives
that are proven through research to impact recidivism. The Juvenile Division
continues to implement strategies endorsed by the Juvenile Detention
Alternative Initiative resulting in a substantial reduction in the number of
juveniles being detained in the Juvenile Detention Center. A presiding judge
for Probation is appointed by the Executive Committee every two years.

Court Administration
Court Administration manages and supports the overall operation of the Court
including human resources, finance, payroll, facilities management, juror
services, procurement, information technology, fleet, and staff training.
Juvenile Detention Division
The Marion County Juvenile Detention Center (MCJDC) is a maximum
security holding facility for detained youth. The MCJDC maintains youth,
ages 11-18 years, in a safe and secure environment while allowing continuity
of services. Each youth detained attends school, participates in mental health
and basic health exercises, and increases healthy social skill-building
processes. The Marion Superior Court is committed to providing a safe and
secure Juvenile Detention Center while providing practical, effective, and
high-quality living and learning services to youth. A presiding judge for
Detention is appointed by the Executive Committee every two years.

MARION COUNTY PROSECUTOR
Introduction
The Marion County Prosecutor’s Office seeks to place public safety as the number one priority and responsibility of government. We are dedicated to holding
criminals accountable for their actions, preserving the rights of victims and continually seeking justice, all while maintaining the highest of ethical standards.
Structure
Criminal Charging Division
Police agencies present cases to this division for criminal charging
determinations. Deputy prosecutors determine what charges are to be filed in
each case, or if additional investigation is necessary.

Special Victims Team
This area of the office includes cases involving sex crimes and domestic
violence. It also handles cases of child abuse and leads the office’s efforts
and collaboration with the Julian Center.

Major Case Division
The Major Case Division handles major felony cases, including homicides.
Victim Advocates are assigned to each of these courts to ensure that victims
are notified of actions taken by the court and that they receive guidance and
support throughout the criminal justice process. Within the Major Case
Division, a Special Crimes Team includes prosecutors dedicated to human
trafficking, arson and unemployment insurance fraud.

Community Prosecution Division
Community prosecutors are assigned to the police districts and special areas.
These prosecutors work closely with district commanders and detectives to
develop strategies to protect and defend the communities served by the
respective police districts. Community prosecutors also encourage
community participation in public safety and crime prevention, engaging
residents in problem solving and establishing and maintaining partnerships.

Grand Jury Division
For cases involving white collar crime, public corruption, tax evasion and
other long term investigations, the Prosecutor has a staff of investigators and
lawyers dedicated to the collection of evidence and prosecution of these
cases. If criminal activity is suspected, the evidence is presented to a Grand
Jury composed of six citizens of Marion County who are presented with the
evidence and determine if criminal charges are filed. Currently, investigators
assigned to the Grand Jury Division represent detectives from the
Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department, Marion County Sheriff’s
Department, and Indiana State Police.

Juvenile Division
This division is responsible for filing and prosecuting acts of delinquency by
children 17 years of age and younger, including truancy cases. In certain
cases, more serious crimes can be directly filed to the adult criminal courts.

Strike Team
This division is responsible for three (3) areas of crime – drugs, guns and
gangs. Vigorous prosecution of these crimes is essential to the safety of the
community. The Strike Team partners with various police departments
throughout the county to assist in investigations, arrests, charging decisions
and the presentation of the case to the court.

Correction Division
This division responds to all requests for post-conviction relief and for
sentence modifications. This division also handles all requests for
expungement of arrests and convictions and the sealing of criminal records.

D-Felony/Misdemeanor Division
This division handles the prosecution of misdemeanor and Class D Felony
criminal cases. Cases include operating a vehicle while intoxicated, moving
traffic violations, theft, shoplifting, battery, vandalism, and trespassing. This
division handles more criminal cases than all other divisions combined.

MARION COUNTY COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS
Vision and Mission Statements
Vision
To provide the citizens of Marion County a safer community.

Mission
To enhance public safety by raising offender accountability through the use
of evidence based practices and interventions.

Structure
Home Detention
The electronic equipment used for client monitoring includes active radio
frequency for typical home detention clients as well as global positioning
satellite equipment for high risk offenders, including domestic violence
offenders who are on home detention. Community Corrections also offers
electronic alcohol monitoring equipment. Offenders may be placed on any
combination of Home Detention, GPS, and Alcohol Monitoring. All
offenders under supervision have a variety of programming available.
Community Corrections utilizes the Indiana Risk Assessment System (IRAS)
to assess the risk of reoffending and services needed for all clients under
supervision. Based on overall risk score and identified criminogenic needs,
clients may be placed into the following evidence based programs presented
by trained facilitators: Parenting, Anger Management, Thinking For a
Change, Substance Abuse Treatment, as well as Job Readiness workshops
and GED/ABE. Mental health programming is also available for those
mentally ill offenders who might otherwise have been incarcerated at the
local or the state levels. MCCC has an Addictions Intervention Component
which focuses on addictions issues.

Work Release
In October 2007, the agency opened the Duvall Residential Center which
provides services for male work release offenders and has capacity for up to
350 residents. All residents of Duvall are eligible for the same programming
opportunities as electronic monitoring offenders.
Through contracts with service providers, we are able to serve offenders at 3
other locations. Volunteers of America (VOA) currently provides a total of
60 beds for female offenders split among General Population, Community
Transition Program, and the Mental Health Component at Theodora House.
In addition, the Craine House provides the opportunity for 4 women with preschool aged children to serve their sentence in the community while living
with their children.

DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS
Introduction
The Indianapolis Department of Public Works (DPW) aims to improve residents’ quality of life through multi-modal connectivity, green space, capital
improvements, universal accessibility, and collaborative public and private partnerships. DPW builds and maintains public infrastructure, park land, manages solid
waste collection and the city’s entire fleet—striving always to provide effective, efficient customer service to citizens and visitors to Indianapolis, Marion County
and ensuring a healthy, safe, and natural environment.
Structure
Leadership:
DPW is led by a director appointed by the mayor. The director is supported
directly by a chief of staff. Under DPW leadership are several offices that
can be organized into four main divisions: Policy and Planning, Engineering,
Fleet Services, and Operations. These four divisions are not rigid: On a dayto-day basis, they merge to solve problems and increase livability across the
City and Marion County.
Policy and Planning
The Policy and Planning division works cooperatively to manage the
administration of the entire department, as directed by DPW leadership. This
division includes finance, the city-county council liaison, communications,
the Office of Sustainability, and the Office of Disability Affairs. While the
Office of Sustainability and the Office of Disability Affairs are housed within
DPW and report to the DPW director, they oversee livability and ADA issues
for the entire City and County. The offices within Policy and Planning work
closely with DPW leadership as well as deputy directors and administrators in
Engineering, Operations, and Fleet Services to ensure policies are developed
and implemented with fidelity, efficiency, and quality.
Operations:
The Operations division is responsible for solid waste collection and disposal;
maintenance of streets, traffic systems, levees, dams, as well as park facilities
and grounds; forestry work; and snow and ice removal from City streets. This
division is comprised of both union and non-union employees. The work
performed in DPW’s Operations division requires highly skilled, dedicated
staff; for that reason, DPW safety and training are housed in this division, as
well.

Engineering Division
The Engineering division plans, designs, constructs, and maintains all streets,
sewers, roads, bridges, multi-modal paths, trails, parks, green spaces, and
thoroughfares. It is also responsible for access control, traffic control, and
lights for these assets. Furthermore, the Engineering division manages the
development of studies, inventories, programs, and projects—and manages all
contracts related to transportation and storm water infrastructure. In 2013,
DPW’s Engineering division welcomed staff from Indy Parks and now
oversees parks capital development and land stewardship activities.
Engineering—in collaboration with Operations and Fleet Services—works to
directly implement the vision of DPW and City leadership.
Fleet Services
The Fleet Services division is responsible for the maintenance, fueling,
monitoring and repair of all vehicles and other City-owned equipment—
including public safety vehicles—and the operation of a municipal garage.
Further, Fleet Services maintains and supplies fuel for vehicles and
equipment owned by several other governmental agencies on a contractual
basis. Like Operations, the Fleet Services division includes union and nonunion employees.

Introduction
The Office of Minority &Women Business Development works to enhance
the City’s growth and economic stability through promotion of contracting
and procurement opportunities for MBE/WBE/VBE/DOBEs

Through community outreach, special events and programs such as startup
consulting and certification services, the DMWBD is an active partner to all
City of Indianapolis certified MBE/WBE/VBE/DOBEs.

Structure
Certification
MBE, WBE, VBE and DOBEs must be certified with the City through the
DMWBD. The DMWBD must verify that they meet the requirements of the
certification program. Recently implemented was the disability-owned
business enterprise program (DOBE). This program will be similar to the
MWBE certification process but the Office of Disability Affairs will process
the disability approval portion of the applicant and then the business entity
information will then be processed by the DMWBD.
Business Development
The DMWBD acts as a resource center for MBE, WBE, VBE and DOBEs
and provides programing that assist with growth and development of
companies, through outreach events, and educational workshops.
Compliance
DMWBD is responsible for reviewing all contracts, and the tracking of MBE,
WBE, VBE and DOBE participation on all contracts. DMWBD monitors
contracts to ensure the participation goals are being met.

Diversity Program
Recognize businesses and organizations that encourage, embrace, and
celebrate differences that foster a better place in which to live, work, and raise
a family.
The DMWBD is responsible for the Mayor’s Celebration of Diversity Award
luncheon, and working with the Indiana Black Expo on the Summer
Celebration, and the Circle City Classic event.
Budget change
Prior to the DMWBD budget being moved from the Mayor’s budget, we had
$8,000 in character three to be used for consulting services. Since that time
we have cut 2 FTE positions to meet budget cut requirements. These cuts
resulted in a significant decrease of business development and outreach to the
community, but resulted in savings of over $30k in character one for the
department. $22k, the remaining balance in character one from the FTE
position cuts was moved into character three for use in consulting services to
focus on contract compliance, and work force development. The total budget
line item is $30k.

MARION COUNTY ASSESSOR
Introduction
The Marion County Assessor’s main goal is to ensure the accuracy of property tax assessments. Each property owner pays a fair share of local government expenses
based on the value of the property owned. The County Assessor is responsible for determining the fair market value of each property in the county. In addition, the
County Assessor processes Inheritance Tax returns and determines whether taxpayers are entitled to inheritance tax returns and determines whether taxpayers are
entitled to charitable and non-profit property tax exemptions. Any time a taxpayer wishes to appeal an assessment decision, the appeal goes through the Property
Tax Assessment Board of Appeals (PTABOA) hearing process administered by the County Assessor.
Structure
Assessment Division
The Assessment Division assesses all real and business property throughout
the county. This division coordinates the efforts of field personnel, audit
staffs, and valuation experts to perform all phases of the assessment process
in accordance with International Association of Assessing Officers standards.
The division is further divided into functional areas separately covering
commercial, industrial, and residential properties, and reviewing taxpayers'
reports on business personal property. The division has four satellite offices
offering taxpayers a convenient place to obtain residential assessment
information and services.
Administration Division
The Administration Division is responsible for budget creation and
monitoring, payroll, human resources administration, facilities management,
procurement, education administration, process improvement, as well as
document management and retention. Further, it administers the hearing
process of the PTABOA and the review of property tax exemption
applications for charities and non-profits. Finally, this division also conducts
the auditing and processing of inheritance tax returns.

Data Analysis Division
The Data Analysis Division collects, manages, and analyzes the large
amounts of data needed for both efficient and modern assessment results. It
also creates satellite-coordinated mapping and connects assessment data to
each property geographically. Moreover, the division manages ownership
changes and records as well as maps changes in the property sizes. The
division is responsible for the sales disclosure process which collects,
reviews, and validates all property sales in the county. Finally, the division
organizes this enormous quantity of data into reports and statistics, which is
useful to the Assessment Division and to other government agencies, and is
available for dissemination to citizens over the Internet.

MARION COUNTY SURVEYOR
Introduction
Marion County Surveyor's Office was established by the Indiana Constitution in 1851. General Land Office surveys in what is now Marion County began in 1819.
Marion County is part of the rectangular survey system (Public Land System), which divides the land into sections that are one square mile. All real estate
boundaries in Marion County can be traced back to the Public Land System. Statute law requires the Surveyor to recheck at least five percent of the section corners
each year, there are over 2300 corners. The Marion County Surveyor’s Office maintains a Legal Survey Record Book and a Corner Record Book. No fee is charged
for surveying services provided to any city, county and other governmental agencies.
Structure
The Marion County Surveyor's Office has three areas of focus, each with their own operational goals and activities while being unified by a common vision.
Surveying
In the field, the staff performs the precise measurements of Section Corners
and ties, per Indiana Code and replacing said monuments as necessary. We
monitor the Eagle Creek Dam for horizontal and vertical movement as well as
performing vital research within the office.
Information Technology
Information Technology supports the needs of the Surveyor’s Office. This
area compiles the data surveyors collect in the field by use of AutoCAD and
GIS software. Further, that data along with both the corner history and
drawing (which this department provides) is posted onto the county’s website.
We collect and quality check all measurements to ensure accurate, reliable
information is provided.
Having a greater reliance on new technology has helped the Surveyor’s
Office to build a solid fiscal commitment to provide government and private
sector agencies and companies timely, accurate and useful information, while
helping us and these agencies and companies save taxpayers money and time.
Finally, these advancements in technology have enabled us to fulfill our legal
obligation for the completion of the Alcohol & Tobacco Commission’s
Verification of Business Location forms.

Preservation
Preservation is as much a part of the Surveyor’s Office as surveying and
technology. We believe in the importance of preserving our past for the
future generations. Understanding the necessity of creating legible electronic
copies of the records, maps, surveys and plats housed in the Surveyor’s
Office to ensure that they will be easily accessible for years to come. By
concentrating on this now we have been able to scan or have scanned already
deteriorating documents.

Debt Service
The Consolidated City carries different types of debt associated with
various programs and services. This debt takes on two forms: (1)
general obligation debt, which is supported by a pledge of the full
faith and credit of the Consolidated City and is usually funded by tax
revenue, and (2) special revenue debt, which is supported by a
pledge of a specific revenue stream.

Special Revenue Debt
Special revenue debt is mostly associated with Tax Increment
Financing (TIF) districts throughout Marion County. This debt is
supported through property tax increment capture. This financing
tool is used to develop and grow various communities and
neighborhoods that otherwise would have little growth potential.

Generally, the revenue stream pledged for special revenue debt is a
fee or other non-tax revenue. In the case of debt funded by tax
increment financing (TIF), tax increment revenue captured is
segregated from the regular property tax revenue of the Consolidated
City.

TIF funds, including debt service for TIF bonds, are not appropriated
by the City-County Council. In Marion County, the Metropolitan
Development Commission (MDC) serves as the fiscal body for TIF
funds.

The Consolidated City of Indianapolis, Marion County takes pride
and care in maintaining its AAA (stable) credit rating for its general
obligation debt.
General Obligation Debt
Most of the Consolidated City’s general obligation debt is related to
transportation, parks, and emergency communications infrastructure.
Other general obligation debt is related to police and fire pension
costs as well as redevelopment efforts throughout the Consolidated
City.
Debt service payments for general obligation debt are typically
funded entirely, or in part, with tax revenue. Only tax-supported debt
service is included in tables presented in this report.

Other special revenue debt includes economic development bonds
which are typically supported by a revenue stream generated by a
specific investment. An example would be a bond issued to finance a
parking garage with the parking fees pledged to pay the debt service.
Another example would be financing stormwater projects,
undertaken by the Consolidated City to address flood control
problems, with stormwater fees pledged to paying the debt service.
TIF debt service and other special revenue debt service is not
included in tables presented in this report, but is available separately.
