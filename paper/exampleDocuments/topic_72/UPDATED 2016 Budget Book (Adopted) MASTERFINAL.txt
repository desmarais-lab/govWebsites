Funds
The Indiana State Board of Accounts (SBOA) defines “fund” to
mean “cash or a group of accounts set aside for the purpose of
accounting for monies or other resources of general functions or
specific activities . . . in accordance with the system of accounts
prescribed by the State Board of Accounts or as required by statute”
(State Board of Accounts, Accounting and Uniform Compliance
Guidelines Manual for Cities and Towns, State of Indiana, reissued
2006).

Fund; Parks General Fund; Public Safety Income Tax Fund –
County; Public Safety Income Tax Fund – City; Personal Services
Contingency Fund – County; Personal Services Contingency Fund –
City; Guardian Ad Litem Fund; and Medical Care for Inmates Fund.
What all of these funds have in common is that they each will each
receive a substantial amount of flexible tax revenue. Thus, there is
the ability to reallocate the flexible revenue flowing to these funds
across many competing operational needs.

Funds that the SBOA prescribes for use by cities include but are not
limited to, general funds, special revenue funds, debt services funds,
capital projects funds, internal service funds, and agency funds.
Funds included in the 2016 Introduced Budget represent those that
require appropriation by the City-County Council. Appropriation is
the authorization of the City-County Council by ordinance to make
disbursements or to incur obligations for specific purposes.

Dedicated Funds
Dedicated funds, on the other hand, are funds which receive revenue
from taxes or non-tax sources that have very restricted legal uses. A
more apt of a dedicated fund description is a fund that receives little
or no revenue from flexible tax revenue sources. Some examples are
the Parking Meter Fund and the Permits Fund. These are both
dedicated funds because their revenue sources have strictly limited
legal uses.

General Funds
General funds are funds which receive a substantial share of their
revenue from taxes that have very broad flexibility. For example, the
1% County Option Income Tax (COIT) distributions and the County
General Fund property tax levy may legally be used to fund any
governmental purpose.

The Consolidated City also uses dedicated funds to account for the
proceeds of specific revenue sources (e.g., special revenue funds)
and/or for expenditures restricted to a specific purpose (e.g. debt
service funds; enterprise funds). Debt service funds (aka sinking
funds) are used to account for the accumulation of revenue for the
payment of long-term debt principal and interest.

The core general operating funds for the Consolidated City are:
County General Fund; Consolidated County General Fund (aka City
General Fund); Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department
(IMPD) General Fund; Indianapolis Fire Department (IFD) General

Grant Funds
Finally, the Consolidated City also employs grant funds to collect
revenues and track expenditures for grant monies received from
other units of government.

Revenues
State law requires adoption of a balanced budget, which shall include
all anticipated revenues and expenses of every organizational unit
(with the exception of utilities). As such, all appropriations adopted
by the City-County Council must be fully supported by (1) revenue
that is legally eligible to support proposed expenses, and/or (2) fund
balance (essentially prior year, unencumbered revenue) that is legally
eligible to support the proposed expense.

The Consolidated City relies primarily on property and income taxes
to fund its operations. However, a significant amount of revenue is
derived from Fees and Charges as well as from Federal and State
Grants. The following pages provide more detailed information
about property tax rates, levies and districts as well as the various
types of income taxes, tax rates as well as the available uses of such
funds.

Property Tax
Citizens of the Consolidated City are subject to several overlapping
property tax districts which levy taxes for city and county general
purpose funds, as well as specific services. Taxpayers residing in
overlapping districts would be subject to the tax rates of each
applicable district.
Certified Levy (Gross Levy)
The total property tax levy for a taxing unit before the property tax
cap is considered. Referred to as “certified” because it is approved
by the State Department of Local Government Finance (DLGF).
DLGF approval is required to ensure that the levy amount is within
maximum levy limitations set by State law.
Net Levy
The expected property tax levy after deducting the property tax
circuit breaker credits attributable to the property tax caps.
Gross Assessed Value
The assessed value of a property before applying any eligible
property tax deductions or abatements (which lower the property’s
taxable assessed value). The property tax caps are set based on each
parcel’s gross assessed value.
Net Assessed Value (Taxable Assessed Value)
The taxable value of property after all eligible property tax
deductions and abatements are applied.

Property Tax Cap (aka Circuit Breaker)
The property tax cap, also known as the “circuit breaker,” was
enacted by the Indiana General Assembly in 2008 and subsequently
amended into the Indiana Constitution. The cap guarantees that
property tax rates in overlapping districts cannot exceed a certain
capped percent of the parcel’s gross assessed value. The “circuit
breaker” amount represents property tax liability waived because it is
above the level allowed under the property tax caps. The property
tax caps are as follows:
1% - for Homestead property
2% - for other residential property and agricultural land
3% - for commercial and industrial property
Taxing Districts & Rates
The following pages show the taxing districts along with the Net
Assessed Values (NAV) of taxable property within those districts
for pay year 2016. The Tax Rate for a district is determined by the
following formula:

Income Tax
State law allows Indiana counties to impose a local income tax on
the State adjusted gross income of county taxpayers.
Also, counties may choose between several income tax options and
combinations. Each type of local income tax option is regulated by
specific rules and rate restrictions. Residents of Marion County are
subject to three interrelated income taxes in the form of the County
Option Income Tax (COIT), the Levy Freeze Local Option Income
Tax (LOIT), and the Public Safety Income Tax (PST).
This local income tax is collected by the State Department of
Revenue then distributed to counties based on the amount due to
each county on State income tax returns processed.
County Income Tax Council (CITC)
Local income tax is imposed or modified in a county by the action of
the CITC. In Marion County, the CITC is composed of the CityCounty Council and the fiscal body of each city or town that lies
either partially or entirely within the county. The other members of
the CITC are the Lawrence City Council, the Beech Grove City
Council, the Southport City Council, and the Speedway Town
Council.
Voting representation on the CITC is based on each member unit’s
share of the total county population. In Marion County, the CityCounty Council holds over 90% of the voting representation on the
CITC.

County Option Income Tax (COIT)
Current Rate: 1.00% Maximum Rate: 1.00%

COIT revenue may be used for any lawful purpose of the
governmental unit.
Levy Freeze Local Option Income Tax (LOIT)
Current Rate: 0.27% Maximum Rate: 1.00%

An additional income tax rate may be imposed to generate revenue to
replace property tax levy growth. Thus, imposing this tax reflects a
policy choice to shift fiscal reliance from property tax to income tax,
not an overall tax increase.
Once imposed, this rate may neither be rescinded nor decreased.
Each year the CITC must hold at least one public meeting to discuss
whether or not Levy Freeze LOIT rate should be increased.
Public Safety Income Tax (PST)
Current Rate: 0.50% Maximum Rate: 0.50%

Because Marion County has imposed a Levy Freeze LOIT rate, State
law allows adoption of a PST rate. PST revenues may be used for
police and fire, including pensions, emergency services,
communications systems, jails and related facilities, and other items
related to public safety.

Expenditures
Expenditure Categories (Characters)
In addition to the restrictions imposed by agencies/departments
regarding funding sources, agency spending is further restricted by
limiting the total funds available to support various spending
categories or “characters”. The Consolidated City employs five
separate characters to segregate spending. Each is described as
follows:

Properties and Equipment (Character 4)
This category includes expenditures for the acquisition of, or
addition to assets such as land, infrastructure, buildings,
improvements other than buildings, as well as machinery and
equipment.

Internal Charges (Character 5)
Personal Services (Character 1)
This category includes expenditures for salaries, wages and related
employee benefits provided for all Consolidated City employees.
Employee benefits include employer contributions to group health
and life insurance, pension benefits, unemployment compensation,
uniform allowance and similar benefits.

This category includes internal charges such as expenditures for the
Mayor’s Action Center, the Office of Corporation Counsel and Fleet
Services.
If a department has a negative appropriation for Character 5, it
means that department is a provider of internal services and a net
recipient of internal charges.

Materials and Supplies (Character 2)
This category includes articles and commodities that are consumed
or materially altered when used. Supplies include office supplies,
operating supplies, repair and maintenance supplies and other similar
items.

Other Services and Charges (Character 3)

This category exists for only City departments. Similar expenditures
from county agencies are reported as Character 3 instead. Since the
Information Services Agency (ISA) is a County agency, their
charges are not administered through Character 5. Both City
departments and County agencies pay ISA charges through
Character 3.

This category includes expenditures for services other than personal
services required by the Consolidated City either to carry out its
assigned functions or to fulfill moral or legal obligations. Other
Services and Charges includes professional services, communication
and transportation, printing and advertising, insurance (excluding
group health, life and self-insurance), utility expenditures, contracted
repairs and maintenance, rentals, debt service expenditures for
principal and interest payments as well as long-term debt.

1) provides an operational overview of each of the county agencies
and city departments;
2) details the funding sources that will fund each
agency/department; and
3) outlines how those agencies/departments intend to spend those
funds by expenditure category or “character”.

Sources
The “Sources” listed for each agency/department budget represents
either a single or a collection of funding sources available to an

For the purpose of comparison, each summary shows recent
historical data for agency/department budgets. The following
explains the terminology used in these comparisons.
Budget Introduced shows the amounts budgeted for each
agency/department as determined by agency/department finance
officers and the Office of Finance and Management. This is the
budget introduced by the Mayor to the City-County Council for
amendment and eventual adoption.

DPS ADMINISTRATION
Introduction
The City of Indianapolis Department of Public Safety (DPS) will remain a national model leveraging the unique strengths of the Police, Fire, Homeland Security,
Animal Care and Control, and Communications Divisions as an integrated department. DPS will deliver the highest quality of public safety services in a fiscally
effective manner to secure the Greater Indianapolis area by preventing, preparing for, responding to, and recovering from routine emergencies and large-scales
incidents. The Administration unit of DPS provides coordination and leadership for the agencies within DPS.
Structure
The Department of Public Safety comprises five integrated divisions as well as the Citizens Police Complaint Office (CPCO) and the Mayor’s Office of Re-Entry.
The Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department, Indianapolis Fire Department, Division of Homeland Security, Animal Care and Control, and Public Safety
Communications operate within one department and share resources in innovative ways. This structure increases operational effectiveness by leveraging the
strengths of each division to provide public safety services to the City of Indianapolis/Marion County. Each of the divisions has their own operational goals and
unique personalities. The Department of Public Safety was created by Section 251 of the revised municipal code. CPCO, independent of the Indianapolis
Metropolitan Police Department, was created by city ordinance. The CPCO affords citizens of the Consolidated City of Indianapolis Marion County who believe
they have been treated improperly by an IMPD officer the opportunity to have his or her complaint(s) both heard and investigated. Mayor Gregory Ballard
established the Office of Re-Entry to develop collaborative partnerships among government, businesses, faith-based organizations, and community members to
leverage resources, to ensure sustainability by enhancing crime prevention strategies, and evaluating outcomes based on data collection and quality of life
enhancement, for ex-offenders and the community.

DIVISION OF HOMELAND SECURITY
Introduction
The Division leads an integrated Department of Public Safety effort to secure, prevent, prepare, respond, investigate, and ensure resiliency from natural or humanmade threats and hazards to the city, and to sustain a confident public. The Division is also responsible for preparing plans and managing the safety and security of
special events when anticipated requirements exceed the capability of the concerned geographic area. The Division of Homeland Security was created by Section
251 of the revised Municipal Code.
Structure
The Division was formed to unify divisions within the Department of Public Safety to create the capacity to deal with terrorist attacks, major disasters, planning and
managing special events, and other emergencies. By embracing a single set of guiding principles, from the Director of Public Safety to the frontline employee, we
have created a single division working to secure the City of Indianapolis/Marion County.
The Division does not operate in a vacuum. Other Federal, State, and local institutions participate actively in the Division’s efforts to work within the intelligence
community, investigate, disrupt terrorist activities, pre-planning and managing special events, and in the preparation for and response to major disasters, as do our
private and non-profit sectors and international partners. We will continue to work cooperatively to ensure that all of the instruments of local power – including
leadership, specialized technical expertise, research, and development investments – are brought to bear on the challenges we face in a coordinated and unified
manner.

MARION COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT
Introduction
The Marion County Superior Court is comprised of 36 elected judges, 39 commissioners and magistrates and over 700 employees. The Court is structured into four
divisions; Civil, Criminal, Juvenile, and Probate. Additionally, Probation, Juvenile Detention Center, and Court Administration all function as independent
departments/divisions under the purview of the court.
The Court is structured internally with an Executive Committee consisting of four judges elected by all Superior Court judges for two year terms. The Executive
Committee oversees the general policy and management of the Court. The Criminal and Civil Terms each have a chair who is appointed by the Executive
Committee to serve a two-year term. Specific departments also have Advisory Judges who provide policy input regarding the respective department.

Structure
Court
The 36 courts of the Court Division handle more than 45,000 civil cases and
more than 50,000 criminal cases each year. Some courts are specialty and/or
problem solving courts such as domestic violence, drug, mental health, and
traffic. The Traffic Division handles over 70,000 cases each year.
Probation Department
The Probation Department is comprised of two divisions: adult and juvenile.
Its mission is to enhance community safety by enforcing court orders while
striving to change lives. Probation assists in relieving jail bed concerns
through both pre-trial and post-adjudication services. The Juvenile Division
continues to implement strategies endorsed by the Juvenile Detention
Alternative Initiative which has resulted in a substantial reduction in the
number of juveniles being detained in the Juvenile Detention Center.

Court Administration
Court Administration manages and supports the overall operation of the
Courts including human resources, finance, payroll, facilities management,
procurement, information technology, fleet, and staff training.
Juvenile Detention
The Marion County Juvenile Detention Center (MCJDC) is a secured
detention facility for detained youth. The MCJDC maintains youth, ages 1118 years, in a safe and secure environment while allowing continuity of
services. Each youth detained within the MCJDC attends school, receives
medical and dental care, participates in mental health and basic health
exercises and learns basic life skills. The Marion Superior Court is
committed to providing a safe and secure Juvenile Detention Center while
providing practical, effective, and high-quality living and learning services
for the detained youth.

MARION COUNTY PROSECUTOR
Introduction
The Marion County Prosecutor’s Office seeks to place public safety as the number one priority and responsibility of government. We are dedicated to holding
criminals accountable for their actions, preserving the rights of victims and continually seeking justice, all while maintaining the highest of ethical standards.

Structure
Criminal Charging Division
Law enforcement agencies present cases to this division for criminal
charging determinations. Deputy prosecutors determine what charges are to
be filed in each case, or if additional investigation is necessary.

Special Victims Team
This division of the office includes cases involving sex crimes, domestic
violence and child abuse. It also collaborates with the Julian Center and
Child Advocacy Center.

Major Case Division
The Major Case Division handles major felony cases, including homicides.
Victim Advocates are assigned to each of these courts to ensure that victims
are notified of actions taken by the court and that they receive guidance and
support throughout the criminal justice process. Within the Major Case
Division, a Special Crimes Team includes prosecutors dedicated to human
trafficking, arson and unemployment insurance fraud.

Community Prosecution Division
Community prosecutors are assigned to police districts and special areas.
These prosecutors work closely with district commanders and detectives to
develop strategies tailored to the communities they serve. Community
prosecutors encourage community participation in public safety and crime
prevention, engaging residents in problem solving and establishing and
maintaining partnerships.

Grand Jury Division
Investigators assigned to the MCPO conduct long-term investigations in
cases involving white collar crime, public corruption and tax evasion. If
criminal activity is suspected, the evidence is presented to a Grand Jury
composed of six citizens of Marion County to determine if criminal charges
are filed.

Juvenile Division
This division is responsible for filing and prosecuting acts of delinquency
by children 17 years of age and younger, including truancy cases. In certain
cases, more serious crimes can be directly filed to the adult criminal court.

Strike Team
The Strike Team focuses on three (3) areas of crime – drugs, guns and
gangs. The Strike Team partners with various police departments and state
and federal agencies throughout the county to assist in investigations,
arrests, charging decisions and the presentation of the case to the court.
Forfeiture Division
Through partnerships with state and federal law enforcement agencies, the
Forfeiture Division strives to reduce the profitability of crime by seizing the
proceeds of criminal activity as allowed by state law. This goal is
accomplished by filing proceedings in civil courts whereby a judge may
determine that property owned by a defendant is subject to forfeiture.

Level 6 Felony/Misdemeanor Division
This division handles the prosecution of misdemeanor and Level 6 Felony
criminal cases. Cases include operating a vehicle while intoxicated, moving
traffic violations, theft, battery, resisting law enforcement, carrying a
handgun without a license and trespassing. This division handles more
criminal cases than all other divisions combined.
Correction Division
This division responds to all requests for post-conviction relief and for
sentence modifications. This division also handles all requests for
expungement of arrests and convictions and the sealing of criminal records.

MARION COUNTY CORONER
Introduction
The Marion County Coroner's Office serves the needs of the families of those who die in Marion County as well as the needs of other agencies involved in the
investigation of unusual, unexpected and unexplained deaths. The office provides an accurate completion of the Coroner's Verdict and Death Certificates. With
regard to all such matters, the Coroner’s Office provides public education, support, compassion and confidentiality. All personnel strive to maintain the highest level
of integrity while serving the needs of Marion County citizens.
Structure
Administrative Division
Under the direct supervision of the Chief Deputy, the Administrative Division
works with the families, law enforcement agencies and the public to ensure
that public information is shared and general inquiries are addressed in a
timely manner.
Pathology Division
The Pathology Division comprises a contracted Forensic Pathology group, an
Indiana University School of Medicine Forensic Fellow and county-employed
Forensic Autopsy Assistants. Forensic Autopsies are performed by board
certified Forensic Pathologists, in accordance with the National Association
of Medical Examiner (NAME) Standards. These standards are used as a
guide to determine the cause and manner of death following the initial
investigation.

Investigations Division
Under direct supervision of the Chief Deputy Coroner, appointed Deputy
Coroners conduct various death investigations. About 3,000 deaths are
reported to the Marion County Coroner's Office annually, each of which is
examined by the Deputy Coroners to determine which warrant further
investigation. In over a thousand of these cases, the bodies of the decedents
are transported into the facility for forensic examination. Deputy Coroners are
certified by the Indiana State Coroner's Training Board. All investigators
who have been employed for more than one year become certified Medicolegal Death investigators, a designation recognized by the State of Indiana.

DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS
Introduction
The Indianapolis Department of Public Works (DPW) aims to improve residents’ quality of life through multi-modal connectivity, green space, capital improvements,
universal accessibility, and collaborative public and private partnerships. DPW builds and maintains public infrastructure, park land, manages solid waste collection and
the city’s entire fleet—striving always to provide effective, efficient customer service to citizens and visitors to Indianapolis, Marion County and ensuring a healthy,
safe, and natural environment.

Structure
Leadership
DPW is led by a director appointed by the mayor. The director is supported
directly by a chief of staff. Under DPW leadership are several offices that can
be organized into four main divisions: Policy and Planning, Engineering, Fleet
Services, and Operations. These four divisions are not rigid: On a day-to-day
basis, they merge to solve problems and increase livability across the City and
Marion County.
Policy and Planning
The Policy and Planning division works cooperatively to manage the
administration of the entire department, as directed by DPW leadership. This
division includes finance, the city-county council liaison, communications, the
Office of Sustainability, and the Office of Disability Affairs. While the Office of
Sustainability and the Office of Disability Affairs are housed within DPW and
report to the DPW director, they oversee livability and ADA issues for the entire
City and County. The offices within Policy and Planning work closely with
DPW leadership as well as deputy directors and administrators in Engineering,
Operations, and Fleet Services to ensure policies are developed and
implemented with fidelity, efficiency, and quality.
Operations:
The Operations division is responsible for solid waste collection and disposal;
maintenance of streets, traffic systems, levees, dams, as well as park facilities
and grounds; forestry work; and snow and ice removal from City streets. This
division is comprised of both union and non-union employees. The work
performed in DPW’s Operations division requires highly skilled, dedicated staff;
for that reason, DPW safety and training are housed in this division, as well.

Engineering Division
The Engineering division plans, designs, constructs, and maintains all streets,
storm water systems, roads, bridges, multi-modal paths, trails, parks, green
spaces, and thoroughfares. It is also responsible for access control, traffic
control, and lights for these assets. Furthermore, the Engineering division
manages the development of studies, inventories, programs, and projects—and
manages all contracts related to transportation and storm water infrastructure.
DPW’s Engineering division oversees parks capital development and land
stewardship activities as well. Engineering—in collaboration with Operations
and Fleet Services—works to directly implement the vision of DPW and City
leadership.
Fleet Services
The Fleet Services division is responsible for the maintenance, fueling,
monitoring, and repair of all vehicles and other City-owned equipment—
including public safety vehicles—and the operation of a municipal garage.
Further, Fleet Services maintains and supplies fuel for vehicles and equipment
owned by several other governmental agencies on a contractual basis. Like
Operations, the Fleet Services division includes union and non-union
employees.

Through community outreach, special events and programs such as startup consulting and certification services, the Office of Minority & Women Business
Development is an active partner to all City of Indianapolis certified MBE/WBE/VBE/DOBEs.
Structure
Certification

better calculated M/W/V/DOBE participation reports for City and County
agencies.

The OMWBD acts as a resource center for MBE, WBE, VBE and DOBEs
and provides programing that assists with the growth and development of
companies, through outreach events, and educational workshops.

WBE, VBE and DOBE participation on all contracts. DMWBD monitors
contracts to ensure the participation goals are being met.
Diversity Program

celebrate differences that foster a better place in which to live, work and raise
a family.
The Office of Minority & Women Business Development is responsible for
the Mayor’s Celebration of Diversity Awards luncheon, the Martin Luther
King Holiday Celebration, Major Taylor “Your Life Matters” Bike Ride and
the “Your Life Matters” Campaign; and working with the Indiana Black Expo

Office of Audit and Performance
Introduction
The overall mission of the City-County Office of Audit and Performance is to assure the Mayor, the Marion County elected officials, the City-County
Council, and the citizens of the Consolidated City of Indianapolis, Marion County that operations within city departments and county agencies have effective
accounting and administrative controls. The Office of Audit and Performance operates independently to appraise and to report the effectiveness of the
management and of the financial controls of all city departments and county agencies. Furthermore, the Office of Audit and Performance conducts
performance audits, process improvement projects, follow-up reviews and other special projects as well as responds to management requests.
Structure
The Office of Audit and Performance comprises three functioning areas, each with their own operational goals and activities by a common vision.
Financial Audit
The Financial Audit area assists the Controller’s Office with the
Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) as well as providing
financial audit assistance to other City-County agencies. The Office of
Audit and Performance conducts financial maintenance on monetary
transactions and provides assistance to external auditors in their
examinations of City and of County financial statements and of federal
program administration.

Performance Audit
This area audits various process and program functions within City and
County agencies. Performance audits can vary between department and
agencies, but the goal is to provide objective analysis of processes and
programs to ensure they are functioning properly and efficiently as well
as to identify fraud and abuse.

LEAN Six Sigma
This area is the core Six Sigma group within the Consolidated City of
Indianapolis, Marion County local government. Audit and Performance
staff members are Lean Six Sigma certified and have conducted various
process improvement projects. The staff also conducts Lean Six Sigma
training for the enterprise. In addition, the Office of Audit and Performance
manages IndyStat performance measures.

Budget Justification
1.) The Office of Audit and Performance is maintaining its 2015 approved budget limits for 2016. There has been a slight increase in character one, due partly to
the anticipated 8% increase in health insurance cost for the enterprise.
2.) The majority of OAP’s expenses is in character one, which covers taxes, health insurance and wellness.
3.) We must maintain a reserve in Character 3 for the pursuit of outside consulting to investigate fraud, when needed. We also must obtain essential advanced
training for our Auditors and Sigma professionals. OAP takes advantage of local/online free Continuing Professional Education (CPE) training. The nature of our
role in the enterprise depends on the staff maintaining a high level of proficiency in auditing and process improvement skills. Furthering the staff’s knowledge of
new skills, market trends and best practices increases the value to the organization and is a critical expenditure to the Office of Audit and Performance’s budget.

MARION COUNTY AUDITOR
Introduction
The Office of the Marion County Auditor is established by the Indiana State Constitution, and strict adherence to the laws of the State of Indiana is of prime importance. The
Auditor is responsible for processing all tax deductions, abatements, and tax sale functions; for processing payroll for all City and County employees; for administering all
accounts payable and accounts receivable functions for all City and County agencies and departments; for providing information for the annual financial report; for monitoring
County grants; and for distributing over one billion dollars per year to the various taxing units of the City of Indianapolis and Marion County.

Structure
Administration Division
The Division of Administration provides customer service direction; executes
contracts; handles purchasing and procurement; develops and monitors budgets;
drafts and comments on legislation affecting Marion County; and certifies
documents in accordance with State law.

Payroll Division
The Payroll Division processes payroll; updates employee information on the
payroll and benefits systems; adheres to the Indiana new hiring reporting
requirements; processes payroll deductions; provides support and direction to
agency payroll clerks; and ensures adherence to State and local laws regarding
payroll for all City and County agencies and departments.

Settlement Division
The Settlement Division provides advances and semi-annual distribution of
collected taxes to all Marion County taxing units; validates tax distribution, tax levy,
and capital projects documents requiring Auditor certification; and serves as a
"check & balance" between Controller and Treasurer.

County-Wide Programs (formerly County Administrator)
The Marion County Auditor also manages various county-wide insurance programs,
including automobile, fire and property, money and security, and workers’
compensation. In this capacity, the Auditor serves as a fiscal agent and administers
funds for various entities throughout Marion County, including Noble of Indiana,
the Indiana State Fair Board and State-certified community mental health centers.
Further, adult safekeeping and State institutional expenses for County residents also
are paid out of the Auditor's budget.

Accounting Division
The Accounting Division provides accounts payable, accounts receivable and other
accounting functions; monitors payments for budget and policy compliance;
provides information for the annual financial report; and provides financial direction
for all City and County entities. The Division also synchronizes activities with the
Office of Finance and Management.

Real Estate Division
The Real Estate Division provides customer service for Marion County residents,
processing all tax deductions, abatements, tax bill corrections, and refunds. The
Division administers all noticing requirements, redemptions and refunds for the tax
sale, as well as investigates homestead deduction fraud. The Division also
synchronizes activities with the Assessor’s, Recorder’s and Treasurer’s Office.

Budget Justification
The Marion County Auditor’s offices will reduce the impact to the general fund by moving certain real estate-related personnel expenses (character one) and tax sale–related
costs to the ineligible deduction fund (homestead verification fund), beginning in 2015 and again in the 2016 expense budget, for a total shift in funding sources of more than
$1.3M. The ineligible deduction fund will be additionally replenished in 2016 by transferring duties currently performed under a multi-million dollar service contract back inhouse and eliminating the associated collection fees. The Auditor’s office will incur an increase in postage expense as the federal postage rate increased in July of 2015. However,
the Auditor will be focusing on savings through a paperless environment by scanning deduction forms and reducing the expense of storage. Further saving will be accomplished
by allowing all deduction forms to be completed, received and stored digitally. We will further realize a significant change in all department expenses by reorganization of
duties, installing scanning equipment and software, streamlining processes, as well as digitizing documents office-wide.

MARION COUNTY ASSESSOR
Introduction
The Marion County Assessor’s main goal is to ensure the accuracy of property tax assessments. Each property owner pays a fair share of local government expenses
based on the value of the property owned. The County Assessor is responsible for determining the fair market value of each property in the county. In addition, the
County Assessor processes Inheritance Tax returns and determines whether taxpayers are entitled to inheritance tax returns and charitable and non-profit property tax
exemptions. Any time a taxpayer wishes to appeal an assessment decision, the appeal goes through the Property Tax Assessment Board of Appeals (PTABOA)
hearing process administered by the County Assessor.
Structure
Assessment Division
The Assessment Division assesses all real and business property throughout
the county. This division coordinates the efforts of field personnel, audit
staffs and valuation experts to perform all phases of the assessment process in
accordance with International Association of Assessing Officers standards.
The division is further divided into functional areas separately covering
commercial, industrial, and residential properties, and reviewing taxpayers'
reports on business personal property. The division has three satellite offices
offering taxpayers convenient places to obtain residential assessment
information and services.
Administration Division
The Administration Division is responsible for budget creation and
monitoring, payroll, human resources administration, facilities management,
procurement, education administration, process improvement, as well as
document management and retention. Further, it administers the hearing
process of the PTABOA and the review of property tax exemption
applications for charities and non-profits. Finally, this division also conducts
the auditing and processing of inheritance tax returns.

Data Analysis Division
The Data Analysis Division collects, manages and analyzes the large amounts
of data needed for both efficient and modern assessment results. It also
creates satellite-coordinated mapping and connects assessment data to each
property geographically. Moreover, the division manages ownership changes
and records as well as parcel map changes. The division is responsible for the
sales disclosure process which collects, reviews and validates all property
sales in the county. Finally, the division organizes this enormous quantity of
data into reports and statistics, which is useful to the Assessment Division and
to other government agencies, and is available for dissemination to citizens
over the Internet.

MARION COUNTY RECORDER
Introduction
The Marion County Recorder’s Office maintains permanent public records involving a wide variety of instruments, including documents related to real estate,
personal property, mortgages, liens, leases, subdivision plats, military discharges, and personal bonds. Generally, these instruments are recorded either for giving
legal public notice of their existence or for safekeeping and future reference.
Structure
The Recorder’s Office reorganized its staff in June 2015 to provide more efficient and effective customer service.

Recording and Records Management
The Recorder’s Office accepts documents in person, by mail or electronically;
examines, records, scans, indexes, and makes accessible to the public
important real estate documents.
The office continues to seek innovative and technological advances to
enhance service delivery and reduce costs. Electronic recording continues to
increase with nearly 50% of all documents submitted as such. Later this year,
an electronic document router will be implemented to supplement the
electronic recording process and provide customers the ability to receive an
electronic copy of their recorded documents.

The Recorder’s Office manages and maintains records dating from 1822.
Copies of recorded documents are available to the public using paper copies,
microfilm and digital images. Recorded documents are accessible within the
office using public service terminals or online through subscription and free
single-use search engines.
Records from March 1964 through the present are maintained both digitally
and on microfilm. The office is undertaking a project to replace deteriorating
microfilm and digitize records prior to 1964. When completed, all of the
records held by the Recorder’s Office will be available and searchable online,
allowing greater access for the public.

MARION COUNTY SURVEYOR
Introduction
The Marion County Surveyor's Office was established by the Indiana Constitution in 1851. General Land Office surveys in what is now Marion County began in
1819. Marion County is part of the rectangular survey system (Public Land System), which divides the land into sections that are one square mile. All real estate
boundaries in Marion County can be traced back to the Public Land System. Statute law requires the Surveyor to recheck at least five percent of the section corners
each year, there are nearly 2400 corners. The Marion County Surveyor’s Office maintains a Legal Survey Record Book and a Corner Record Book. No fee is
charged for surveying services provided to any city, county and other governmental agencies.
Structure
The Marion County Surveyor's Office has three areas of focus, each with their own operational goals and activities while being unified by a common vision.
Surveying
In the field, the staff performs the precise measurements of Section Corners
and ties, per Indiana Code and replacing said monuments as necessary. We
monitor the Eagle Creek Dam for horizontal and vertical movement as well as
performing vital research within the office.
Information Technology
Information Technology supports the needs of the Surveyor’s Office. This
area compiles the data surveyors collect in the field by use of AutoCAD and
GIS software. Further, that data along with both the corner history and
drawing (which this department provides) is posted onto the county’s website.
We collect and quality-check all measurements to ensure accurate, reliable
information is provided.
Having a greater reliance on new technology has helped the Surveyor’s office
to build a solid fiscal commitment to provide government and private sector
agencies and companies timely, accurate and useful information, while
helping us and these agencies and companies save taxpayers’ money and
time. Finally, these advancements in technology have enabled us to fulfill
our legal obligation for the completion of the Alcohol & Tobacco
Commission’s Verification of Business Location forms.

Preservation
Preservation is as much a part of the Surveyor’s Office as surveying and
technology. We believe in the importance of preserving our past for the
future generations. Understanding the necessity of creating legible electronic
copies of the records, maps, surveys and plats housed in the Surveyor’s
Office, we work to ensure that they will be easily accessible for years to
come. By concentrating on this now we have been able to scan or have
scanned already deteriorating documents.
Copies of recorded documents are available to the public using paper copies,
microfilm and digital images. Recorded documents are accessible within the
office using public service terminals or online through subscription and free
single-use search engines.
Records from March 1964 through the present are maintained both digitally
and on microfilm. The office is undertaking a project to replace deteriorating
microfilm and digitize records prior to 1964. When completed, all of the
records held by the Recorder’s Office will be available and searchable online,
allowing greater access for the public.

Debt Service
The Consolidated City carries different types of debt associated with
various programs and services. This debt takes on two forms: (1)
general obligation debt, which is supported by a pledge of the full
faith and credit of the Consolidated City and is usually funded by tax
revenue, and (2) special revenue debt, which is supported by a
pledge of a specific revenue stream.

Special Revenue Debt
Special revenue debt is mostly associated with Tax Increment
Financing (TIF) districts throughout Marion County. This debt is
supported through property tax increment capture. This financing
tool is used to develop and grow various communities and
neighborhoods that otherwise would have little growth potential.

Generally, the revenue stream pledged for special revenue debt is a
fee or other non-tax revenue. In the case of debt funded by tax
increment financing (TIF), tax increment revenue captured is
segregated from the regular property tax revenue of the Consolidated
City.

TIF funds, including debt service for TIF bonds, are not appropriated
by the City-County Council. In Marion County, the Metropolitan
Development Commission (MDC) serves as the fiscal body for TIF
funds.

The Consolidated City of Indianapolis, Marion County takes pride
and care in maintaining its AAA (stable) credit rating for its general
obligation debt.
General Obligation Debt
Most of the Consolidated City’s general obligation debt is related to
transportation, parks, and emergency communications infrastructure.
Other general obligation debt is related to police and fire pension
costs as well as redevelopment efforts throughout the Consolidated
City.
Debt service payments for general obligation debt are typically
funded entirely, or in part, with tax revenue. Only tax-supported debt
service is included in tables presented in this report.

Other special revenue debt includes economic development bonds
which are typically supported by a revenue stream generated by a
specific investment. An example would be a bond issued to finance a
parking garage with the parking fees pledged to pay the debt service.
Another example would be financing stormwater projects,
undertaken by the Consolidated City to address flood control
problems, with stormwater fees pledged to paying the debt service.
TIF debt service and other special revenue debt service is not
included in tables presented in this report, but is available separately.

Pension Trust Funds
Police and Fire Pension Trust Funds account for the payment of
pension benefits to police officers and firefighters hired prior to 1977.
All associated expenditures made from the Police and Fire Pension
Trust Funds are reimbursed by the State.
The most recent pension plan, the 1977 Police and Firefighters
Pension and Disability Fund pension plan, is administered by the
Indiana Public Retirement System (INPRS), which is appropriated and
expensed as part of the Department of Public Safety’s (DPS’)
Character One appropriations from the IMPD and IFD General Funds
for the respective divisions.

More information on PERF and Police and Fire pension plans can be
found on pages 62-66 of the Notes to Financial Statements section of
