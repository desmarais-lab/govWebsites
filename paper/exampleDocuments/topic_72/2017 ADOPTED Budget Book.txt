Funds
The Indiana State Board of Accounts (SBOA) defines “fund” to
mean “cash or a group of accounts set aside for the purpose of
accounting for monies or other resources of general functions or
specific activities . . . in accordance with the system of accounts
prescribed by the State Board of Accounts or as required by statute”
(State Board of Accounts, Accounting and Uniform Compliance
Guidelines Manual for Cities and Towns, State of Indiana, reissued
2006).

Fund; Parks General Fund; Public Safety Income Tax Fund –
County; Public Safety Income Tax Fund – City; Personal Services
Contingency Fund – County; Personal Services Contingency Fund –
City; Guardian Ad Litem Fund; and Medical Care for Inmates Fund.
What all of these funds have in common is that they each will each
receive a substantial amount of flexible tax revenue. Thus, there is
the ability to reallocate the flexible revenue flowing to these funds
across many competing operational needs.

Funds that the SBOA prescribes for use by cities include but are not
limited to, general funds, special revenue funds, debt services funds,
capital projects funds, internal service funds, and agency funds.
Funds included in the 2017 Introduced Budget represent those that
require appropriation by the City-County Council. Appropriation is
the authorization of the City-County Council by ordinance to make
disbursements or to incur obligations for specific purposes.

Dedicated Funds
Dedicated funds, on the other hand, are funds which receive revenue
from taxes or non-tax sources that have very restricted legal uses. A
more apt of a dedicated fund description is a fund that receives little
or no revenue from flexible tax revenue sources. Some examples are
the Parking Meter Fund and the Permits Fund. These are both
dedicated funds because their revenue sources have strictly limited
legal uses.

General Funds
General funds are funds which receive a substantial share of their
revenue from taxes that have very broad flexibility. For example,
the County Option Income Tax (COIT) distributions and the County
General Fund property tax levy may legally be used to fund any
governmental purpose.

The Consolidated City also uses dedicated funds to account for the
proceeds of specific revenue sources (e.g., special revenue funds)
and/or for expenditures restricted to a specific purpose (e.g. debt
service funds; enterprise funds). Debt service funds (aka sinking
funds) are used to account for the accumulation of revenue for the
payment of long-term debt principal and interest.

The core general operating funds for the Consolidated City are:
County General Fund; Consolidated County General Fund (aka City
General Fund); Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department
(IMPD) General Fund; Indianapolis Fire Department (IFD) General

Grant Funds
Finally, the Consolidated City also employs grant funds to collect
revenues and track expenditures for grant monies received from
other units of government.

Revenues
State law requires adoption of a balanced budget, which shall include
all anticipated revenues and expenses of every organizational unit
(with the exception of utilities). As such, all appropriations adopted
by the City-County Council must be fully supported by (1) revenue
that is legally eligible to support proposed expenses, and/or (2) fund
balance (essentially prior year, unencumbered revenue) that is legally
eligible to support the proposed expense.

The Consolidated City relies primarily on property and income taxes
to fund its operations. However, a significant amount of revenue is
derived from Fees and Charges as well as from Federal and State
Grants. The following pages provide more detailed information
about property tax rates, levies and districts as well as the various
types of income taxes, tax rates as well as the available uses of such
funds.

Property Tax
Citizens of the Consolidated City are subject to several overlapping
property tax districts which levy taxes for city and county general
purpose funds, as well as specific services. Taxpayers residing in
overlapping districts would be subject to the tax rates of each
applicable district.
Certified Levy (Gross Levy)
The total property tax levy for a taxing unit before the property tax
cap is considered. Referred to as “certified” because it is approved
by the State Department of Local Government Finance (DLGF).
DLGF approval is required to ensure that the levy amount is within
maximum levy limitations set by State law.
Net Levy
The expected property tax levy after deducting the property tax
circuit breaker credits attributable to the property tax caps.
Gross Assessed Value
The assessed value of a property before applying any eligible
property tax deductions or abatements (which lower the property’s
taxable assessed value). The property tax caps are set based on each
parcel’s gross assessed value.
Net Assessed Value (Taxable Assessed Value)
The taxable value of property after all eligible property tax
deductions and abatements are applied.

Property Tax Cap (aka Circuit Breaker)
The property tax cap, also known as the “circuit breaker,” was
enacted by the Indiana General Assembly in 2008 and subsequently
amended into the Indiana Constitution. The cap guarantees that
property tax rates in overlapping districts cannot exceed a certain
capped percent of the parcel’s gross assessed value. The “circuit
breaker” amount represents property tax liability waived because it is
above the level allowed under the property tax caps. The property
tax caps are as follows:
1% - for Homestead property
2% - for other residential property and agricultural land
3% - for commercial and industrial property
Taxing Districts & Rates
The following pages show the taxing districts along with the Net
Assessed Values (NAV) of taxable property within those districts
for pay year 2016. The Tax Rate for a district is determined by the

Income Tax
State law allows Indiana counties to impose a local income tax on
the State adjusted gross income of county taxpayers.

Expenditure Rate (Maximum Rate of 2.75%)
•

CAGIT/COIT - Current Rate: .9493% Maximum Rate: 1.00%
o COIT revenue may be used for any lawful purpose of

the governmental unit.
Recent legislation provided a transition from the county adjusted
gross income tax (CAGIT), the county option income tax (COIT),
the county economic development income tax (CEDIT), and the
various local income taxes for special purposes and special projects
to a single expenditure local income tax with three rate components.
• Expenditure Rate
o COIT (County Option Income Tax)
o LOIT (Local Option Income Tax) for Levy Freeze
o PSIT (Public Safety Income Tax)
This local income tax is collected by the State Department of
Revenue then distributed to counties based on the amount due to
each county on State income tax returns processed.
County Income Tax Council (CITC)
Local income tax is imposed or modified in a county by the action of
the CITC. In Marion County, the CITC is composed of the CityCounty Council and the fiscal body of each city or town that lies
either partially or entirely within the county. The other members of
the CITC are the Lawrence City Council, the Beech Grove City
Council, the Southport City Council, and the Speedway Town
Council.
Voting representation on the CITC is based on each member unit’s
share of the total county population. In Marion County, the CityCounty Council holds over 90% of the voting representation on the
CITC.

•

Local Option Income Tax (LOIT) -Current Rate: 0.27%
Maximum Rate: 1.00%
o An additional income tax rate may be imposed to
generate revenue to replace property tax levy growth.
Thus, imposing this tax reflects a policy choice to
shift fiscal reliance from property tax to income tax,
not an overall tax increase.
Once imposed, this rate may neither be rescinded nor
decreased. Each year the CITC must hold at least one
public meeting to discuss whether or not Levy Freeze
LOIT rate should be increased.

•

Public Safety Income Tax (PSIT) - Current Rate: 0.50%
Maximum Rate: 0.50%

o

Because Marion County has imposed a Levy Freeze
LOIT rate, State law allows adoption of a PST rate.
PST revenues may be used for police and fire,
including pensions, emergency services,
communications systems, jails and related facilities,
and other items related to public safety.

Property Tax Relief Rate (Maximum Rate of 1.25%)
•

Homestead Credit Relief Rate – Current Rate: .0507%
o This credit “becomes” property tax revenue by virtue
of replacing portions of the property taxes that
residential taxpayers have to pay.

Expenditures
Expenditure Categories (Characters)
In addition to the restrictions imposed by agencies/departments
regarding funding sources, agency spending is further restricted by
limiting the total funds available to support various spending
categories or “characters”. The Consolidated City employs five
separate characters to segregate spending. Each is described as
follows:

Properties and Equipment (Character 4)
This category includes expenditures for the acquisition of, or
addition to assets such as land, infrastructure, buildings,
improvements other than buildings, as well as machinery and
equipment.

Internal Charges (Character 5)
Personal Services (Character 1)
This category includes expenditures for salaries, wages and related
employee benefits provided for all Consolidated City employees.
Employee benefits include employer contributions to group health
and life insurance, pension benefits, unemployment compensation,
uniform allowance and similar benefits.

This category includes internal charges such as expenditures for the
Mayor’s Action Center, the Office of Corporation Counsel and Fleet
Services.
If a department has a negative appropriation for Character 5, it
means that department is a provider of internal services and a net
recipient of internal charges.

Materials and Supplies (Character 2)
This category includes articles and commodities that are consumed
or materially altered when used. Supplies include office supplies,
operating supplies, repair and maintenance supplies and other similar
items.

Other Services and Charges (Character 3)
This category includes expenditures for services other than personal
services required by the Consolidated City either to carry out its
assigned functions or to fulfill moral or legal obligations. Other
Services and Charges includes professional services, communication
and transportation, printing and advertising, insurance (excluding
group health, life and self-insurance), utility expenditures, contracted
repairs and maintenance, rentals, debt service expenditures for
principal and interest payments as well as long-term debt.

This category exists for only City departments. Similar expenditures
from county agencies are reported as Character 3 instead. Since the
Information Services Agency (ISA) is a County agency, their
charges are not administered through Character 5. Both City
departments and County agencies pay ISA charges through
Character 3.

MARION COUNTY PROSECUTOR
Introduction
The Marion County Prosecutor’s Office seeks to place public safety as the number one priority and responsibility of government. We are dedicated to holding
criminals accountable for their actions, preserving the rights of victims and continually seeking justice, all while maintaining the highest of ethical standards.
Structure
Criminal Charging Division
Law enforcement agencies present cases to this division for criminal
charging determinations. Deputy prosecutors determine what charges, if
any, are to be filed in each case. The division also has a Crime Strategies
Unit that identifies persons and groups of persons who are generating a
disproportionate amount of criminal activity and appear to present
escalating violent behaviors. The Crime Strategies Unit also aids in
locating witnesses who may not otherwise attend court and other persons of
interest.
Major Case Division
The Major Case Division handles major felony cases, including homicides.
Victim Advocates are assigned to each of these courts to ensure that victims
are notified of actions taken by the court and that they receive guidance and
support throughout the criminal justice process. Within the Major Case
Division, a Special Crimes Team includes prosecutors dedicated to cases
involving human trafficking, arson and unemployment insurance fraud.
Grand Jury Division
Investigators assigned to the Marion County Prosecutor’s Office conduct
long-term investigations in cases involving white collar crime, public
corruption and tax evasion. If criminal activity is suspected, the evidence is
presented to a Grand Jury composed of six citizens of Marion County to
determine if criminal charges are filed.
Special Victims Team
The Special Victims Team prosecutes cases involving sex crimes, domestic
violence and child abuse. This team leads the office’s efforts and
collaboration with the Julian Center and Child Advocacy Center.
Strike Team
The Strike Team focuses on three (3) areas of crime – drugs, guns and
gangs. The Strike Team partners with various police departments and state
and federal agencies throughout the county to assist in investigations,
arrests, charging decisions and the presentation of the case to the court.

Community Prosecution Division
Community prosecutors are assigned to the police districts and special areas
within Marion County and work collaboratively with district commanders
and detectives to develop strategies tailored to the communities they serve.
Community prosecutors encourage community participation in public safety
and crime prevention, engaging residents in problem solving and
establishing and maintaining partnerships.
Juvenile Division
This division is responsible for filing and prosecuting acts of delinquency
by children 17 years of age and younger, including truancy cases. In cases
involving serious violent crimes, the Marion County Prosecutor’s Office
seeks to file the charges directly into the adult criminal courts.
Level 6 Felony/Misdemeanor Division
This division handles the prosecution of misdemeanor and Level 6 Felony
criminal cases. Cases include operating a vehicle while intoxicated, moving
traffic violations, theft, battery, resisting law enforcement, carrying a
handgun without a license and trespassing. This division handles more
criminal cases than all other divisions combined.
Forfeiture Division
Through partnerships with state and federal law enforcement agencies, the
Forfeiture Division strives to reduce the profitability of crime by seizing the
proceeds of criminal activity as allowed by state law. This goal is
accomplished by filing proceedings in civil courts whereby a judge may
determine that property owned by a defendant is subject to forfeiture
because it was used in the commission of a crime or is the profit of a
criminal activity.
Correction Division
This division responds to all requests for post-conviction relief and for
sentence modifications. This division also handles all requests for
expungement of arrests and convictions and the sealing of criminal records.

MARION COUNTY COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS
Vision and Mission Statements
Vision
To provide the citizens of Marion County a safer community.

Mission
To enhance public safety by raising offender accountability through the use of
evidence based practices and interventions.

Structure
Marion County Community Corrections (MCCCs’) serves approximately
2,500 offenders divided into two, distinct populations: (1) those awaiting trial
and (2) those serving an executed sentence. Rather than awaiting trial or
serving a sentence in jail or prison, a court may place a defendant with
MCCC for Pre-Trial Monitoring, or for sentencing via Electronic
Monitoring/Home Detention or Work Release.

Work Release
MCCC utilizes three facilities for both male and female offenders assigned to
work release. In October 2007 MCCC opened the Duvall Residential Center
(DRC). With a capacity of 350 beds, DRC provides housing and services for
male work release offenders. Because DRC is a work release center,
employment is strongly encouraged. However, if a resident is not employed,
MCCC works with the offender to find employment. All DRC residents are
also eligible for the same programming opportunities as those placed on EM.

Electronic Monitoring/Home Detention
Offenders and defendants assigned to Pre-Trial Monitoring (PTM), who are
placed on EM, are required to wear secured Global Positioning Satellite
(GPS) technology and transmitters to allow for continuous physical
monitoring. This technology allows offenders and defendants to be placed on
Home Detention, where, while on home confinement, they: (1) are not
permitted to leave the home except for medical emergency; OR (2) are
permitted to continue working (or searching for employment) and/or attend
religious services; OR (3) are placed on GPS monitoring only with no other
restriction. In addition to GPS technology, the Court may place a defendant or
an offender with MCCC for electronic alcohol monitoring.

To serve female offenders, MCCC contracts with Theodora House, operated
by Volunteers of America (VOA), which provides a capacity of 60 beds.
Finally, MCCC maintains its long-standing relationship with Craine House.
The Craine House provides the programming and work release opportunities
for up to 15 women with pre-school aged children.

In order to determine the appropriate level of supervision, MCCC must
determine each defendants or offender’s risk level, or likelihood to reoffend.
For this task, MCCC employs the Indiana Risk Assessment System (IRAS).
Based on overall risk score and identified criminogenic needs, offenders may
be placed into appropriate Evidence Based Programs (EBPs,) such as resume
and career planning; substance abuse treatment, conflict resolution; or
parenting and life skills.

DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS
Introduction
The Indianapolis Department of Public Works (DPW) aims to improve residents’ quality of life through multi-modal connectivity, green space, capital
improvements, universal accessibility, and collaborative public and private partnerships. DPW builds and maintains public infrastructure, park land, manages solid
waste collection and the city’s entire fleet—striving always to provide effective, efficient customer service to citizens and visitors to Indianapolis, Marion County
and ensuring a healthy, safe, and natural environment.
Structure
Leadership
DPW is led by a director appointed by the mayor. Under DPW leadership are
several offices that can be organized into four main divisions: Policy and
Planning, Engineering, Fleet Services, and Operations. These four divisions
are not rigid: On a day-to-day basis, they merge to solve problems and
increase livability across the City and Marion County.
Policy and Planning
The Policy and Planning division works cooperatively to manage the
administration of the entire department, as directed by DPW leadership. This
division includes finance, the city-county council liaison, communications,
the Office of Sustainability, and the Office of Disability Affairs. While the
Office of Sustainability and the Office of Disability Affairs are housed within
DPW and report to the DPW director, they oversee livability and ADA issues
for the entire City and County. The offices within Policy and Planning work
closely with DPW leadership as well as deputy directors and administrators in
Engineering, Operations, and Fleet Services to ensure policies are developed
and implemented with fidelity, efficiency, and quality.
Operations:
The Operations division is responsible for solid waste collection and disposal;
maintenance of streets, traffic systems, levees, dams, as well as park facilities
and grounds; forestry work; and snow and ice removal from City streets. This
division is comprised of both union and non-union employees. The work
performed in DPW’s Operations division requires highly skilled, dedicated
staff; for that reason, DPW safety and training are housed in this division, as
well.

Engineering Division
The Engineering division plans, designs, constructs, and maintains all streets,
storm water systems, roads, bridges, multi-modal paths, trails, parks, green
spaces, and thoroughfares. It is also responsible for access control, traffic
control, and lights for these assets. Furthermore, the Engineering division
manages the development of studies, inventories, programs, and projects—
and manages all contracts related to transportation and storm water
infrastructure. DPW’s Engineering division oversees parks capital
development and land stewardship activities as well. Engineering—in
collaboration with Operations and Fleet Services—works to directly
implement the vision of DPW and City leadership.
Fleet Services
The Fleet Services division is responsible for the maintenance, fueling,
monitoring, and repair of all vehicles and other City-owned equipment—
including public safety vehicles—and the operation of a municipal garage.
Further, Fleet Services maintains and supplies fuel for vehicles and
equipment owned by several other governmental agencies on a contractual
basis. Like Operations, the Fleet Services division includes union and nonunion employees.

MARION COUNTY RECORDER
Introduction
The Marion County Recorder’s Office maintains permanent public records involving a wide variety of instruments, including documents related to real estate,
personal property, mortgages, liens, leases, subdivision plats, military discharges and personal bonds. Generally, these instruments are recorded either for giving
legal public notice of their existence or for safekeeping and future reference.
Structure
The Recorder’s Office reorganized its staff in June 2015 to provide more
efficient and effective customer service.
Recording and Records Management
The Recorder’s Office accepts documents in person, by mail or electronically;
examines, records, scans, indexes and makes accessible to the public
important real estate documents.
The office continues to seek innovative and technological advances to
enhance service delivery and reduce costs. Electronic recording continues to
increase with nearly 50% of all documents submitted as such. Later this year,
an electronic document router will be implemented to supplement the

electronic recording process and provide customers the ability to receive an
electronic copy of their recorded documents.
The Recorder’s Office manages and maintains records dating from 1822.
Copies of recorded documents are available to the public using paper copies,
microfilm and digital images. Recorded documents are accessible within the
office using public service terminals or online through subscription and free
single-use search engines.
Records from March 1964 through the present are maintained both digitally
and on microfilm. The office is undertaking a project to replace deteriorating
microfilm and digitize records prior to 1964. When completed, all of the
records held by the Recorder’s Office will be available and searchable online,
allowing greater access for the public.

MARION COUNTY SURVEYOR
Introduction
Marion County Surveyor's Office was established by the Indiana Constitution in 1851. General Land Office surveys in what is now Marion County began in
1819. Marion County is part of the rectangular survey system (Public Land System), which divides the land into sections that are one square mile. All real
estate boundaries in Marion County can be traced back to the Public Land System. Statute law requires the Surveyor to recheck at least five percent of the
section corners each year, there are nearly 2400 corners. The Marion County Surveyor’s Office maintains a Legal Survey Record Book and a Corner Record
Book. No fee is charged for surveying services provided to any city, county and other governmental agencies.
Structure
The Marion County Surveyor's Office has three areas of focus,
each with their own operational goals and activities while being
unified by a common vision.
Surveying
In the field, the staff performs the precise measurements of Section
Corners and ties, per Indiana Code and replacing said monuments as
necessary. We monitor the Eagle Creek Dam for horizontal and
vertical movement as well as performing vital research within the
office.
Information Technology
Information Technology supports the needs of the Surveyor’s Office.
This area compiles the data surveyors collect in the field by use of
AutoCAD and GIS software. Further, that data along with both the
corner history and drawing (which this department provides) is posted
onto the county’s website. We collect and quality-check all
measurements to ensure accurate, reliable information is provided.

Having a greater reliance on new technology has helped the Surveyor’s
office to build a solid fiscal commitment to provide government and
private sector agencies and companies timely, accurate and useful
information, while helping us and these agencies and companies save
taxpayers’ money and time. Finally, these advancements in technology
have enabled us to fulfill our legal obligation for the completion of the
Alcohol & Tobacco Commission’s Verification of Business Location
forms.
Preservation
Preservation is as much a part of the Surveyor’s Office as surveying
and technology. We believe in the importance of preserving our past
for the future generations. Understanding the necessity of creating
legible electronic copies of the records, maps, surveys and plats housed
in the Surveyor’s Office, we work to ensure that they will be easily
accessible for years to come. By concentrating on this now we have
been able to scan or have scanned already deteriorating documents.

Debt Service
The Consolidated City carries different types of debt associated with
various programs and services. This debt takes on two forms: (1)
general obligation debt, which is supported by a pledge of the full
faith and credit of the Consolidated City and is usually funded by tax
revenue, and (2) special revenue debt, which is supported by a
pledge of a specific revenue stream.

Special Revenue Debt
Special revenue debt is mostly associated with Tax Increment
Financing (TIF) districts throughout Marion County. This debt is
supported through property tax increment capture. This financing
tool is used to develop and grow various communities and
neighborhoods that otherwise would have little growth potential.

Generally, the revenue stream pledged for special revenue debt is a
fee or other non-tax revenue. In the case of debt funded by tax
increment financing (TIF), tax increment revenue captured is
segregated from the regular property tax revenue of the Consolidated
City.

TIF funds, including debt service for TIF bonds, are not appropriated
by the City-County Council. In Marion County, the Metropolitan
Development Commission (MDC) serves as the fiscal body for TIF
funds.

The Consolidated City of Indianapolis, Marion County takes pride
and care in maintaining its AAA (stable) credit rating for its general
obligation debt.
General Obligation Debt
Most of the Consolidated City’s general obligation debt is related to
transportation, parks, and emergency communications infrastructure.
Other general obligation debt is related to police and fire pension
costs as well as redevelopment efforts throughout the Consolidated
City.

Other special revenue debt includes economic development bonds
which are typically supported by a revenue stream generated by a
specific investment. An example would be a bond issued to finance a
parking garage with the parking fees pledged to pay the debt service.
Another example would be financing stormwater projects,
undertaken by the Consolidated City to address flood control
problems, with stormwater fees pledged to paying the debt service.
TIF debt service and other special revenue debt service is not
included in tables presented in this report, but is available separately.

Debt service payments for general obligation debt are typically
funded entirely, or in part, with tax revenue. Only tax-supported debt
service is included in tables presented in this report.
