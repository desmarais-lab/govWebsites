PROPOSAL NO. 44, 2005 - rescinds a prior ordinance of the Marion County Income
Tax Council and increases the County Option Income Tax rate
Chair Sanders stated that two public hearings were held last week by the Committee
regarding this proposal, and this meeting was scheduled to take a final vote and make a
recommendation to the full Council.
Councillor Nytes moved, seconded by Councillor Moriarty Adams, to “Amend” Proposal
No. 44, 2005 on page 3, Exhibit A, Section 2, to insert the word “years” following the
word “subsequent.” She stated that this is simply a technical amendment to insert a
word that was left out. The motion carried by a vote of 7-0.
Councillor Moriarty Adams moved, seconded by Councillor Brown, to send Proposal No.
44, 2005 to the full Council with a “Do Pass As Amended” recommendation.
Councillor Nytes stated that during the public hearings last week, there were some
questions that still needed answers. She asked Councillor McWhirter if she received
the answers she was looking for with regards to previous distribution. Councillor
McWhirter stated that her questions have been satisfied and she received the answers
she requested.
The motion to send Proposal No. 44, 2005 to the full Council with a “Do Pass As
Amended” recommendation carried by a vote of 4-3, with Councillors Langsford,
McWhirter, and Plowman casting the negative votes.
There being no further business, and upon motion duly made, the meeting was
adjourned at 5:40 p.m.
Respectfully Submitted,
