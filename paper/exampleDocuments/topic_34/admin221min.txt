Mr. Beard said he has been in the construction industry for over 30 years and is President

the private and public school system and participated in the Conseco Fieldhouse
development.
Councillor Talley said he has known Mr. Beard for several years and can attest to his
qualifications and commitment to the community.
Councillor Plowman asked for clarification on the Common Construction Wage
Committee. Chair Sanders said the committee reviews projects where public funding is
being used to ensure that the wages paid in those contracts are relative to the common
wage in the area.
Councillor Brown thanked Mr. Beard for his commitment to serving the community.
Councillor Oliver said that Mr. Beard’s construction company is well-known throughout

employees is a perfect match for the criteria needed to serve on this committee.

to the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried by a vote of 50.

Internal Audit Committee. She said the work of the committee has been more
complicated since the review of the County audit has been added.
Councillor Talley asked if the committee has any oversight of the Municipal
Corporations’ budgets. Councillor Nytes said it is her understanding that the committee
does not have authority to do audits over the Municipal Corporation.
Councillor Plowman asked for clarification on the job duties of this committee.
Councillor Nytes said the committee approves the work plan for the Internal Audit staff
and reviews the finances of the City and County. Councillor Plowman asked if the
committee has any enforcement authority. Councillor Nytes said the committee does
follow ups to determine if recommendations have been implemented. She said it is the
committee’s responsibility to let the executive branch agency and Council know if the
recommendations are not made.
Councillor Talley moved, seconded by Councillor Brown, to send Proposal No. 67, 2006
to the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried by a vote of 50.

PROPOSAL NO. 68, 2006 - reappoints John Thompson to the City-County
Administrative Board
Chair Sanders asked for the committee to act on Proposal No. 68, 2006, as Mr.
Thompson is serving on another board that has permitted him from attending this
committee meeting. Councillor Plowman said he is against acting on this proposal, as it
has always been the rule that the nominee had to be present before the committee for their
appointment or reappointment. Councillor Brown and McWhirter were in agreement.
Councillor Brown moved, seconded by Councillor Talley, to “Postpone” Proposal No.
68, 2006 until March 21, 2006. The motion carried by a vote of 6-0.
