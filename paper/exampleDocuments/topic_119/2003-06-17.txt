Mr. Ricketts called the meeting to order at 8:05 AM.
Minutes
Ms. Sadler motioned to approve the March 18, 2003 meeting minutes, Ms. Womacks
seconded and the motion passed unanimously.
ISA Operational Review Presentation
Mr. Hineline thanked everyone for attending and introduced the topic of discussion.
Overview of ACS Services- John Nero
Information: Storing it, Moving it, Connecting it- Marty Barnes
In response to Mr. Ricketts question regarding document imaging, the majority of the
enterprise has been made aware of this option. Should a user want additional information
on the document imaging process, they can contact ISA or ACS.
Maintaining the Infrastructure- Marty Barnes
Securing Our IT Assets- Marty Barnes
Mr. Ricketts inquired if the authorities are notified when the network has been attacked.
Mr. Barnes stated there is a process to deflect the attacks and the authorities are notified.
Building Toward Service Continuity- Marty Barnes
In response to Ms. Davis’ comment, each department is responsible for their own disaster
recovery plan. ISA and ACS have the IPD Training Academy as the alternate facility
should the C/C Building be uninhabitable.
Ms. Enders asked if there is a set methodology for the internal departments to include in
their plan. Mr. Hineline stated there is no set plan at this time. The challenge is which
department receives which data at what time. Mr. Matthews suggested ISA conduct a
business impact analysis to build business continuity into the overall plan.
Ms. Woods (audience member) asked about the option of system redundancy compared
to backing up the network on tapes. Mr. Barnes replied the cost of purchasing a system
is much more expensive than the tapes are.
Mr. Hineline stated ISA will work with the customers to get disaster recovery test
information to them.
Customer Support-Kevin Ortell
Customer Alliances- Linda Kelsey
Application Services- Dave Gumbiner

IT Board Minutes

Putting Technology To Work- John Nero
Ms. Romeril asked if there were any quality control measures in place that prevents the
project process from getting overloaded. In response, Mr. Hineline stated there is no
direct means of measuring the progress of projects. Mr. Nero added the communication
lines must remain open between everyone involved to maintain quality measures.
Internet-Ahmed Soliman
Mr. Ricketts inquired about Internet filters. Mr. Hineline stated the bandwidth continues
to grow significantly. Certain filters have been turned on for sites that are not job related
these filters have lowered the bandwidth use.
Telephone Operations- Lori Kuhn
Planning and Contract Administration- Nadeen Biddinger
Geographic Information Services- Layne Young
Wrap-up- Mike Hineline
Adjourn
Mr. Ricketts adjourned the meeting at 11:56 AM.

CIO Comments

CIO Report to IT Board

Exhibit B

Page 2 of 3

IT Board Members,
In the absence of the CIO, the “guest author” of this comment section must
emphasize the focus of our office in the past month has been heavily
administrative in gathering much-needed details for the upcoming budget cycle
work for 2004.
In addition, there was a lot of time spent working on the Strategic Planning efforts
in order to give the City and County a strong document, not only to be tied to the
budget dollars for next year, but to be used for requirements gathering as we
move into the sourcing efforts in July.
Gartner reports many organizations are placing increased importance on IT
planning, particularly on project prioritization now that less funds are available
and management leaders want to see a clear economic payoff from any IT
investment. By planning carefully for the future, the City/County can set a sound
direction and put ourselves in a better position to deal with unanticipated issues
when they arrive.
We hope to present the Strategic Planning results to you in July, to include the
GIS Strategic Plan that has been crafted in the past few weeks.
I look forward to answering any questions you may have about the information
provided in this report.
Nadeen Biddinger

Monthly Highlights and Statistics
May 2003
From the Account
Manager’s Desk
The month of May was a busy
yet informative month for many
of our ACS customers. On May
20th, ACS and ISA joined forces
to present an IT Operational
Review to the IT Board and invited all key customers
and department heads to attend. In this session we
covered many of the IT accomplishments which have
occurred over the past several months, but more
importantly, the stage was set for exciting things to
come. ACS feels very strongly that more than ever
before, the City/County is positioned to take advantage
of current and future technological solutions as they are
applied and leveraged to address the complex and
pressing business needs of the local government
environment.
ACS management and our professional staff are
genuinely excited about the promise of tomorrow and the
things we feel we can do for our valued customers here
at the City/County.

XP Taking Hold
ACS Technology Consultants are currently working with
various City/County departments to test applications with
Windows XP and Microsoft Office XP. They are assisting
the departments develop plans for the testing. They are
also assisting with problem resolution as the department
works through the testing. Talk with your Technology
Consultant if you are ready to begin this task in your
department.

DMD Says Goodbye to an Old Friend
The server RCAANV1 located at 604 N Sherman was
retired from service and the migration of data from that
server to the SAN cluster environment was successful with
no disruptions to the users. Customers at North Sherman
now receive all email and data form the City-County
building over the Gig fiber connection that was installed
last year. This will address the storage needs for DMD at
North Sherman and establish a common data drive for all
DMD departments.

Mid-Range Rehabilitation Status
Head Start on the November Election
Planning has begun for the November election. The first
planning meeting was held on June 5, 2003. The
primary focus of this meeting was to discuss automating
the process of uploading Election Results to the Web.
ISA and ACS will be working with ES&S, the County’s
Election vendor, to outline the various options available
to the Marion County Clerk and the Election Board.
This information will be provided to them by June 20,
2003. Monthly status meetings will be held through
August, at which time meetings will be held more often
as needed.

Technology Ready for
Summer Pool Fun
ACS worked closely with
Department of Parks and
Recreation to get the pools
ready to handle the Point of Sale (POS) application used
to take money and produce receipts. This is a seasonal
activity that requires ACS to provide resources to set up
the machines. Everything was completed a week prior to
the pools opening on Memorial Day.
Monthly Highlights and Statistics
May 2003

This month, the Midrange Team has been working with the
Business Consultants and the Applications Groups and has
started the process of moving the Java applications from
the Andretti server to either IMCWSL01 or IMCWSL02.
Four applications have been moved, with 15 more to
follow. The estimated completion date is June 19th.

ACS completed a project in which R300 VOIP (Voice
Over IP) platforms were reconfigured and upgraded and
UPS (uninterrupted power supply) services were installed
for improved stability of the voice systems at the following
locations:

Improving our Management of Storage
During the last week of May, EMC was onsite to install
the EMC Control Center Software. This software will
provide greater control and monitoring than what is
currently implemented. Control Center is the main
Command/Control utility to manage the EMC
Symmetrix, which is the facility that contains all storage
for the mainframe and mid-range platforms. A
component of Control Center called SAN Manager
replaces the current ESN (Enterprise SAN Network)
manager. In June, we will install DB Tuner, which is a
specialized EMC product to monitor and control the
storage space for the Oracle databases.

IPD Training Academy Infrastructure
Upgrade
All internal wiring at the Training Academy has been
brought up to minimum City/County wiring
specifications. In addition, a second frame relay DS1
circuit to relieve customer response time complaints until
head-end re-engineering project can address the problem
has been installed and is working. The extension from
the SBC patch panel to the City/County equipment in
room 108 has been established. All equipment has been
received and will be installed in conjunction with the
headend equipment on 6/21.

WEB Server Migration Status
The migration and testing of the applications to the new
servers is underway and progressing very well. The status
of the applications follows:

Again, these new servers provide City of
Indianapolis/Marion County with a much more robust
WEB environment that has consistent hardware and
software from the development through production
servers. These help us ensure that what was tested on the
development server will work the same way on both the
test and production servers.

Monthly Highlights and Statistics
May 2003

Monthly Statistics from
the Help Desk
During the month of May, 4,305 calls
were presented to the Help Desk of
which 3,315 were handled by the
daytime Help Desk and 752 were
received by our after-hours operation. 238 calls were
terminated before the Help Desk had a chance to answer
the call. The average time to answer a customer’s call was
22 seconds, and 90.4% of prime time calls were answered
in less than 60 seconds
Of those calls, 771 turned out to be technical problems.
ACS closed 802 problem calls during the month and
achieved a first call resolution of 83.9%. This means that
83.9% of those who called with a problem had their issue
resolved by the time they hung up the phone.
ACS processed 339 security requests during the month. 94
involved changes to security profiles, there were 51
deletions of various access rights and 194 new access rights
were granted. ACS also closed 401 service requests during
the month.
ACS technicians completed over 1,368 desktop moves,
adds, changes, or installations during May. This volume is
174% above the contractual maximum for daily activity.
For the month of May, only 20 new desktops/laptops were
installed. This was due in part to the backorder of 17” flatpanel monitors at Dell. During the last week of May, all
requests with backordered monitors were beginning to
arrive at ACS. The number of new installs is expected to
increase for the month of June.

Desktop Support Services
The following procedures were put
into effect in May 2003. Asset
Management now provides installation
follow-up reports to customers. When a new equipment
install is complete, the lead Asset Manager notifies the
department’s IT contact via email and attaches a
spreadsheet outlining the install locations, asset tags and IP
information. A paper copy of the spreadsheet is sent as
well, in conjunction with the Asset Notification forms, for
each piece of hardware. Furthermore, the asset notification
process to the customer was further defined. Customers
should have all necessary install paperwork within five
business days of installation completion.
Customer
response to this new process continues to be very positive.
ACS technicians completed a number of projects in May;
including, the IMS rollout to all DPR Recreation Centers.
This project encompassed 35 installs across 23 locations
and was completed by May 15th. ACS Technicians installed

completion of the final phase, Child Support Enforcement
in early July. The first phase began on May 30th but the
project actually began months ago with the planning, the
network design and build out and the actual construction
required to prepare the building for the Prosecutor’s staff.
ACS will assist in the move by de-installing and reinstalling more than 350 PCs and printers.

ACS Customer of the Month
Our congratulations go to May’s Customer
of the Month, Gary Coons with the
Indianapolis Fire Department. Mr. Coons
needed assistance from ACS in moving
from his desktop computer to a laptop, ACS
Technician Darlene Wheatley configured the machine to
ensure it would meet his needs. Mr. Coons gave Darlene
and ACS the following ratings: (Scale of 1 to 3 with 3
being the highest)
Did you get the assistance you needed? 3
Was it delivered in a timely manner? 3
Was the service friendly and helpful? 3
Mr. Coon has been contacted about being named
"Customer of the Month" for May and will be receiving
lunch for two for his valuable feedback.

On the Move
The following customer relocations were
completed or are currently in progress:

Arrestee Processing Center (APC)
A new site to be used for the purposes of processing City
and County arrestees is currently under-going major
remodeling. On-going construction is taking place. The
fiber connection between the CCB and the APC was
made operational; the network equipment was installed
and operating at this time with a temporary power feed.
User information has been requested for installation of
workstations.
DPW Customer Services
Finalized and documented DPW Customer Service’s
data/telephone drop location at 1375 West 16th Street
and submitted this information to the communications
group. Eric Jardina has informed us that the present
occupants at 1375 West 16th Street will not be out of the
building until June 16th (tentative). DPW wiring
installation will be pushed back from June 2nd to the
16th (tentative).
Marion County Prosecutor has begun moving staff to
their new facility at 251 E. Ohio. There will be a total of

Customer Service Cards Results
ACS technicians distributed 771 customer satisfaction
feedback cards during the month of May. 55 or 7.13% of
them were actually completed and returned. This is a
decrease in participation from April. The returned results
continue to indicate a high level of customer satisfaction
for the assistance received 2.95 on a scale of 1 to 3. Timely
service rated a 2.80 and our technicians were deemed
friendly and helpful judging from our 2.98 score.

Looking Ahead to June
ACS picked up a large number of disposals during May;
231 items were removed from customer locations. Linda
Yanes (City Purchasing) continues to work with ACS to
move items from the City-County Building to the City’s
warehouse. On May 12th and May 29th, a significant
number of items were moved to the warehouse, freeing up
room in the “bum room.” The next scheduled disposal
pick-up is Thursday, June 12th.
The Technical Services area identifies the following
planned activities:
•

•
•

•

Install spam (junk email) protection at the Internet
email gateway. This is a growing problem with over
10,000 unwanted emails entering the City/County
email system every day. Spam protection will be
implemented in a multi layered approach by applying
different technologies used within the Symantec
SMTP gateway. Blocking spam will have a positive
business impact in the prevention of unwanted email
from utilizing GroupWise email system resources.
Upgraded all Novell servers from Support Pack 5 to
Support Pack 6. This will fix minor known issues to
ensure the continued stability within Novell NetWare.
Continue testing and evaluating server based intrusion
detection systems for recommendation. This will
enhance the protection of web servers from various
threats including password attacks, backdoor
capability, memory application vulnerabilities and
vandalism.
Continued testing and evaluation of Novell NetWare
6.0 for future implementation. This will give

ACS Spotlight
These individuals are part of the
ACS team responsible for delivering
services to the City/County and we
thought it would be beneficial to our
customers to know a little bit more
about them in their own words.
Dan Needler, System Administrator
Dan Needler has worked for ACS for five years. He
began his career with ACS as a Tier 3 desktop
technician. For a little more than a year, he has served as
one of two of ACS' system administrators for EDM
(enterprise document management). During his time as a
system administrator, he has helped guide the document
imaging pilot program from its inception to a production
environment. His vision for EDM within the City of
Indianapolis includes:
(1) increasing the number of departments benefiting
from document imaging,
(2) fine-tuning the EDM setup to lower costs, and
(3) to eventually implement a centralized scanning
solution for departments whose needs/resources
preclude them from dedicating time, space, and
equipment to such an endeavor.
Dan has a bachelor’s degree in computer technology
from IUPUI and certifications that include CDIA
(certified document imaging architect), CNA (certified
NetWare administrator), MS Office Word 2000 Expert,
and A+. Prior to his time at ACS, Dan was employed
three years at Symphony Rehab working as a network
specialist. When time permits, Dan participates in
hobbies that include bicycling, archery, and aviation. He
gets much satisfaction from spending time with his
family—two children (boy and girl, 5 and 3) and wife (of
8 years). He is an active, lifelong member of Christian
Tabernacle Church where he serves as a lay minister,
member of one choir and director of another. His goal in
life is to make a difference.

granddaughter. She started with ISA on 11/03/1980 as a
Keypunch Operator until keypunching became obsolete in
the Data Processing world. From there she worked as the
Receptionist plus I/O Clerk, distributing reports to all users
developing a personal one on one relationship with them.
As the department changed so did her positions. Mary
continued with ISA as a Production Control Clerk, and
then moved into a Computer Operators position, where she
feels she finally found her niche. After the outsourcing of
the Data Center to SCT, now ACS, Mary was able to
access online courses that enhanced her skills and enabled
her to continue as an improved and upgraded operator.
Mary made the transition from SCT/ACS to her present
position as a Lead Computer Operator.
Mary likes cooking different recipes considered Soul Food,
plus she has a fondness for gardening, vegetables and/or
plants, but loves crocheting.

From the Tech Bench
How Much Memory is Enough?
Computers depend on a small module
or modules installed on the system
board, called RAM or "memory", to
function effectively. Its function is to provide a "space" for
the computer to "think". Usually, the more memory a PC
has, the better able it is to perform multiple tasks at the
same time or to run programs which require larger amounts
of memory. Early computers required 8 or 16 megabytes
or RAM memory but with today's newer and faster
computers, the more memory a PC has, the better it seems
to work with "memory intensive" applications such as
Windows XP or Microsoft Office XP.
Recently, ISA approved Microsoft Windows XP as the
standard operating system for computers within the City of
Indianapolis/Marion County Enterprise. With the
introduction of XP, many departments are either in the
process of upgrading or will be upgrading to the new
operating system. Managers should be aware of memory
requirements for efficient operation of their PCs when they
begin planning for acquisition of new equipment.
Windows XP needs more memory than previous Windows
versions; just how much is the question. Microsoft says
you can install XP on a machine with 64 megabytes of
RAM. Granted, XP will run on a PC with this much RAM
memory but it will probably run slowly and "lock up"
occasionally. We have PCs with 128 megabytes of RAM in
our enterprise; XP runs on these systems but some
applications may not open or will open slowly. A better
guideline might be at 256 megabytes, a suitable level to
handle most applications. If you have a number of
applications open simultaneously, you may need more

Page 4

memory (512 MB or more) to keep your PC running
smoothly.
ISA has approved the Office XP Suite as the standard for
Office applications, this change should also be
considered when deciding memory requirements. As an
example of the difference in memory usage for the
Office XP Suite (Word, Excel, Access, etc.), Microsoft
has published the following suggestions:
Windows 98 Second Edition requires 24 MB of RAM
plus an additional 8 MB of RAM for each Office
program (such as Microsoft Word) running
simultaneously. Example:
Minimum
Open Applications
Windows 98
with MS Word
and MS Access

Memory Required
24MB
32MB
40MB

Windows XP Professional requires 128 MB of RAM
plus an additional 8 MB of RAM for each Office
application (such as Microsoft Word) running
simultaneously.
Minimum
Open Applications
Windows XP
plus MS Word
