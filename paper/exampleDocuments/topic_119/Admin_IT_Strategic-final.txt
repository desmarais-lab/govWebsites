Governance Group - The Governance Group will consist of a representative sample of the major
departments within the city: Mayor’s Office, Public Works, Public Safety, Administration and Finance,
Community Investment, Parks and Information Technologies. This group will meet regularly to direct
the actions outlined in this plan and recommend policies, procedures and standards for all information
technology efforts. Additionally, this group will be responsible for prioritizing all information
technology projects based on the administration’s goals and efforts.
Best-of-Breed - Established industry-leading devices, software or systems, in which a vendor has
established a sizable market share due to superior technology or customer acceptance (such as
Microsoft Active Directory for directory services and Cisco networking infrastructure devices).
Mission Critical Systems - Systems that are essential for the City of South Bend to function effectively.
Public safety systems, such as police and fire dispatch and water works distribution, as well as critical
city services systems, such as the 311 line and telephone service, must be restored immediately in case
of disaster.
Ideal State - the optimum level of technology provided by December 31st, 2016, as dictated within this
document.
Information Technologies Service Management Catalog (ITSM) - A catalog of all technology services
offered by an IT department. ITSM Catalogs include the procedures for requesting services and list
department protocols, the service level agreement and any costs associated with the service. The
catalog is usually in the form of a piece of software but can also be published on a website/intranet or
a paper manual.
Service Level Agreement (SLA) – Documents that define the level of service and response times for
different service requests. For example, if a mission critical system is down, there may be a SLA that IT
will respond to the request in 15 minutes. A non-mission critical system may have an SLA of 2 hours to
respond. SLAs will transparently let employees know when their request will be processed and
resolved.
Good Government – to provide timely, effective and efficient government services to the Citizens of
South Bend; one of Mayor Pete Buttigieg’s tenants for providing the best services to citizens in the
most efficient and timely manner possible.
System - a software package or technology, such as South Bend’s ERP and GIS systems.

1- DEFINITIONS
Data Management – How the City of South Bend captures, stores, shares, disseminates, replicates and
reports the data collected. Prior to this document, the City has not focused on collecting and managing
data.
Best Practices – the best way to consistently and effectively execute a task. Often times, industries or
organizations develop their own best practices.
Change Management Procedure – A process to minimize service downtime by ensuring that requests
for changes are recorded and then evaluated, authorized, prioritized, planned, tested, implemented,
documented and reviewed in a controlled and consistent manner.
Open Data Platform – a publicly accessible portal that centralizes data collected by disparate city
departments. This allows departments to access and analyze data more effectively, generates datadriven solutions, increases transparency and allows private developers to develop innovative ways of
handling municipal problems.
Hardware – physical machines (computers, servers, printers, peripherals).
Software – programs that run on hardware (Microsoft Office).
Naviline ERP System/Platform – Short for Enterprise Resource Planning, ERP Systems use an
integrated suite of software modules that support the basic internal business processes of a company
or organization. It provides an integrated, real-time view of its core business processes.
SCADA – Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) is the centralized computer controlled
industrial control system that monitors and controls all water and wastewater processes. SCADA
systems often consist of Remote terminal units (RTUs), Programmable logic controllers (PLCs),
telemetry systems that connect RTUs and PLCs with the control center, a Human Machine Interface
(HMI) and Historian software which accumulates time-stamped data used to populate trends.
GIS – Geographic Information Systems (GIS) integrates hardware, software, and data for capturing,
managing, analyzing, and displaying all forms of geographically referenced information. GIS systems
allow users to view, understand, question, interpret, and visualize data in many ways that reveal
relationships, patterns, and trends in the form of maps, globes, reports, and charts. A GIS system helps
answer questions and solve problems by looking at data in a way that is quickly understood and easily
shared.

THE NEED FOR A STRATEGIC PLAN
The Strategic Plan for the City of South Bend’s Information Technology Department aims to effectively
communicate the City’s technology direction, priorities and policies. As the city continues to improve, a
strategy for the development of technology will lessen duplicated efforts and improve efficiency.
Furthermore, this plan demonstrates the Information Technology Department’s ongoing effort to
implement strategies that further the goals of Mayor Pete Buttigieg’s administration.

PROCESS
A committee was formed and met several times in April and May of 2013. The committee consisted of
representatives from all major departments within the city government along with Mike Bieganski,
retired CTO for Bosch, and Dan Rousseve, Vice President of Technology at Teacher’s Credit Union.
These working sessions helped define the role of technology efforts within the city’s overall vision. This
document is largely the outcome of those discussions. As a result, this document will serve as a
blueprint for the Information Technology Department’s direction through December 31st, 2016.

TECHNOLOGY VISION
The Plan’s vision can be grouped into four categories: information technology services, strategic
partnerships, governmental systems integration and community engagement. For a visual graphic of
these four categories, refer to page 7.
1. Developing strong information technology services within the entire organization is critical to
support the business functions of the City of South Bend.
•

The establishment of governance will ensure technology efforts are prioritized and aligned
with the city’s business needs.

•

An emphasis on technology training for information technologies staff and the general
workforce is required. This investment will easily be repaid as technology is more fully utilized.

•

The development of formalized standards, procedures and policies will allow employees to
understand Information Technologies’ role within the city.

•

The establishment of a tactical path will enable the department to focus on prioritized items,
helping the city to realize the strategic target.

•

Provide mission critical systems effectively and securely.

Page 3

Final

2 - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
2. Strategic partnerships with vendors allow IT staff to focus on prioritized projects, while vendors and
partners deliver other necessary services.
•

Cloud-based Services (SaaS), such as Office 365, and Platform as a Service (PaaS), similar to the
City’s implementation of Cisco IP Telephony Services, are constantly becoming more attractive
and will play an expanding role in our strategy.

•

The establishment and maintenance of vendor relationships is needed as technology continues
to change at a rapid rate.

•

When a solution does not exist commercially, custom application development can help bridge
gaps to fill needs.

3. Interdepartmental and intergovernmental system integration is needed to provide more accessible
data.
•

Remove duplicated data collection.

•

Continue to develop our Open Data Platform to transparently share data across departmental
lines.

•

Share data symbiotically with St. Joseph County to eliminate duplication

4. Engage the community by looking for opportunities in the local school systems, universities, private
companies and nonprofit organizations. These community partnerships can help accomplish tasks
and deliver value-added services.

STRATEGY
The steps to realize the ideal state will be accomplished by implementing a formal Governance Group,
strengthening organizational aptitude, establishing policies, procedures and standards, developing an
effective data management strategy and centralizing resources. For a flow chart of data management,
refer to page 17.
•

Governance – A Governance Group will be created with the responsibility of aligning technology
resources with the city’s business values. The Governance Group will meet regularly to prioritize
projects, recommend policies and review progress of this plan. A Chief Information Officer (CIO)
position will be created to help guide the Governance Group and assist in the execution of this
plan.

Final

2 - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

Strengthen Organizational aptitude – A concerted effort to build organizational aptitude with a
foundation of technical knowledge among all of South Bend’s employees must be undertaken.
Advanced technical training for the Information Technologies Department staff as well as a clear
understanding of software and basic technology tools (i.e., Microsoft Office, ArcGIS, etc.) by the
general workforce is an essential element of improving organizational aptitude.

•

Policies, Procedures and Standards – Formalizing Information Technologies’ policies, procedures
and standards are critical. This effort will cumulate with the creation of an Information
Technologies Service Management (ITSM) Catalog, which will allow users to identify available
information technology services and streamline the process of requesting those services. This
effort will provide Service Level Agreements for the delivery of service requests.

•

Data Management – An effective data management strategy is required to define how we capture,
store, publish, aggregate, analyze and consume data. Such a strategy will increase transparency
and accessibility for South Bend citizens. This strategy will be a holistic approach to all data
including public safety, SCADA and GIS.

•

Centralization of Resources – Many applications and hardware touch multiple departments, such
as database administration and design, networking infrastructure and backups. These activities
should be centralized to eliminate duplication and more efficiently utilize resources.

3 - VISION
3 - Vision
To build and maintain a technology platform that allows employees at all levels to quickly, proactively
and efficiently identify and resolve problems by using intelligent, data-driven decision-making
principles, process improvement and technology. The administration’s major platforms of good
government, making the basics easy and promoting local job growth will be the driving force behind
project prioritization and technology decision-making.

ADDRESS PROBLEMS EFFECTIVELY & IMPROVE RESPONSE TO CITIZENS
In the constant pursuit of more accurate and timely responses to citizens’ needs, technology can lead
the way. As South Bend strives to be the “smartest city in the Rustbelt,” the city must continue to
respond to current problems and proactively address looming challenges. Each decision requires
internal discourse on how it affects the community as well as South Bend’s continuing efforts to entice
investment.

PLANNING HORIZON
With the target date of December 31st, 2016, this document sets forth the plan to coincide with the
final budget of Mayor Pete Buttigieg’s first term. It is expected that a new plan will be created following
this Strategic Plan’s conclusion.

COURSE CORRECTIONS TO THE STRATEGIC PLAN
The Strategic Plan must remain flexible and in line with the administration’s goals. Any correction or
modification to the Strategic Plan will occur within the Governance group’s normal meetings. The
Governance group should review the progress made on this plan and make recommendations on
project prioritization and resource allocation yearly, if not more frequently.

TECHNOLOGY VISION
The Technology Vision for the City of South Bend can be grouped into four categories: information
technology services, strategic partnerships, governmental systems integration and community
engagement.

DEVELOP STRONG INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SERVICES
Developing strong Information Technology services within the entire organization is critical to support
the business functions of the City of South Bend.
Capacity
As the City’s use of technology continues to expand, network infrastructure and systems must have the
capacity to accommodate current systems as well as the flexibility and excess capacity to shoulder
future needs.
Reporting
Departments must be able to run reports and process other paperwork without the intervention of the
Information Technologies Department. Departmental ownership of simple processes, such as
reporting, will free up Information Technologies staff to accomplish more.
Transparent and Open Data
As the City continues to increase transparency and provide accessible information to the public, the
publishing of data will be done publicly as a default. Clearly, some sensitive data must be kept internal,

Page 7

Final

3 - VISION
but data collection must be done with the mindset of providing public information. This approach is
furthered by the development of South Bend’s Open Data Platform, which will serve as a central
location for both public and internal data.
The Open Data Platform will enable departments to access aggregated data, allowing better analysis of
problems and data-based solutions. Data will be removed from internal silos, which makes the data
widely accessible and eliminates duplicated, inefficient collections by disparate departments. The
platform will allow proactive decision-making based on concrete evidence. Furthermore, vendors and
private designers can easily access the data, opening the door for innovative solution-making by
outside actors.
Investing in Current Systems
As new technologies arise and the Information Technologies Department purchases new systems,
current systems must not be forgotten. Systems already in place require constant upkeep and
upgrades, and will fail to perform as expected without continued investment.
Centralization of Information Technology Resources
Currently, many disparate offices throughout the city have differing levels of Information Technology
functions, many of which are somewhat independent of the central Information Technologies
Department. At times, this creates duplicated efforts and wasted resources. Better collaboration is
needed and more control of operations must be allocated to central Information Technologies. All
major expenditures and IT decisions should be run through established governance procedures.
Data Management
To better collect, store, manage and analyze data, a data management strategy is needed. With a
centralized storage plan, single point of data entry and strong data architecture, the City of South Bend
could better capture and analyze data.
Build Organizational Aptitude
In order to build organizational aptitude and better utilize technology, The City of South Bend, as an
organization, must cultivate a culture that views technology as a tool, rather than an obstacle.
Technology has the power to improve processes, create data-based decision-making and improve
services to citizens. To do so, we must invest in human capital. After determining where skills are
lacking, training must not only be completed, but taken seriously. When training sessions are not
attended fully or done haphazardly, the IT department spends valuable resources answering questions
and troubleshooting. For employees to utilize these tools and not overuse the IT department, training

Page 8

Final

3 - VISION
is paramount. At the same time, the Information Technologies Department will continue to provide city
employees with the proper tools to do their jobs effectively.
Access to Systems
As technology continues to develop, access to information and data remotely will enable city
employees in the field to better do their jobs. From police officers accessing information at a traffic
stop to Code Enforcement geocoding the location of abandoned houses, greater access to systems will
increase efficiency. The Information Technologies Department must continue to implement innovative
technologies to make mobile access to data secure, intuitive and efficient.
Leverage Technology
Technology should improve the City of South Bend’s regular business efficiency, enabling employees to
do their jobs easier and more effectively. To do so, the city must leverage technology to fulfill basic
needs in the most efficient way. From investing in training to devising better protocols, greater levels of
efficiency are clearly obtainable. Lastly, the establishment of a tactical plan that prioritizes projects will
allow resources to tackle the most pressing challenges.

STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS
With current strategic partnerships, vendors offer needed services that cannot be provided efficiently
by core Information Technologies staff. These relationships are essential to the functioning of the
department and the city as a whole. Today, Cloud-based Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions, such as
Office 365 and Platform as a Service (PaaS), will play an expanded role in South Bend’s technology
functions. Custom application development by private developers will also play an essential role, often
bridging gaps and filling needs. Establishing new partnerships and maintaining current ones will allow
the city to adapt quickly to its constantly changing needs and technology’s new innovations.
External Partnerships and Community Engagement
The community should be seen as one of the city’s biggest resources. Members of our community have
the capacity to help solve a myriad of problems, and community engagement is the only way to utilize
them.
Many resources in our community remain untapped. Our community is full of innovative people, some
of whom are already using data to help the city solve problems and improve quality of life. With a set
of common goals and a focus on community outreach, these resources can be more fully utilized.
Notre Dame’s investment of $100M a year towards research can be leveraged to analyze some of South
Bend’s problems, such as dealing with vacant and abandoned homes, enticing businesses to invest in

3 - VISION
South Bend and spurring economic growth. Many startups have already helped the city, such as
EmNet. With many colleges nearby, the expertise of students can also be leveraged through internship
programs. Joining with the South Bend Community School Corporation, the City could potentially
receive reduced prices on technology purchases as well.

SYSTEMS INTEGRATION AND CENTRALIZATION
Currently, many systems duplicate efforts and fail to share information. Interdepartmental sharing, as
well as sharing symbiotically with St. Joseph County, can provide data in a more timely and effective
manner. Some systems simply need to be integrated with others, while others require consolidation. In
the end, these efforts will reduce duplication and free up resources.

TECHNOLOGY AS THE SOLUTION
Technology has the capacity to fix problems, save the city money and create more effective
government. Locally, the use of EmNet to handle sewage flow has saved the city $100M alone. From
advanced technologies such as EmNet, to simpler technologies sold by vendors, South Bend should
continue to look for technological solutions.

When it comes to mission critical systems, technology services will be delivered using best-in-breed
solutions. With continued investment in industry-accepted best-in-class hardware and software,
mission critical systems will be supported with a proficient staff and reliable infrastructure. Strategic
partnerships and innovative solution providers will also play a significant role, keeping South Bend on
the cutting edge of technology. Some strategic partners will even provide services as a commodity,
such as VoIP Telephony services. As recent history has shown with projects like CSOnet and enFocus,
partnerships often create innovative solutions to some of South Bend's most specific and troubling
problems. The utility these partnerships provide to the city cannot be understated.

At the broadest level, the Strategic Plan can be grouped into 5 focus areas: governance; strengthening
our organizational aptitude; establishing policies, procedures and standards; data management; and
centralization.

GOVERNANCE
A Governance Group will be created to ensure that the Information Technology Department’s
resources and effort are allocated in a manner that furthers the city’s goals. This group will be
responsible for the implementation of this plan and any mid-course corrections. The Governance
Group will meet regularly to prioritize projects, recommend policies and standards, and review
progress of this plan.

STRENGTHEN ORGANIZATIONAL APTITUDE
A concerted effort to build a foundation of technical knowledge must be undertaken. Sadly, technical
knowledge is lacking throughout our organization. Without departmental ownership of systems and
technical proficiency, this plan cannot be realized. All departments, including the Information
Technologies Department, must increase training efforts and boost understanding of systems. Lastly, as
new technologies garner attention and resources, existing systems must be preserved through

Page 12

4 – STRATEGY
continued investment. Outlined below are the three steps needed to increase city employee technical
understanding. A technology assessment of each employee and department should be completed to
benchmark current skills. This information will help prioritize and target areas needed for
improvement.

Improve Information
Techology Skills

Departmental Ownership

Investment in Existing
Systems

1. Both skills and staffing levels must be increased within the Information Technology Department to
support current and future development. More staff would enable the department to pursue more
developmental projects while continuing to maintain current technologies. Additional training
among staff, especially in Naviline will increase the IT department’s capacity to execute the
Strategic Plan.
2. Departmental ownership of software, processes and training is critical. Too often departments rely
on Information Technologies to troubleshoot, pulling staff away from important projects. To
increase the capacity of Information Technologies, departments must learn to thoroughly
document, manage and assess their processes. As new software packages are implemented or
technology processes are altered to increase the organizations capabilities and efficiency,
departments must attend these crucial training sessions.

Page 13

Final

4 – STRATEGY
3. A better understanding of current systems will add productivity as well. Unfortunately, many
systems have yet to be fully utilized. For example, Naviline, Laserfiche, eForms Software, Office 365
and Outlook require further training to increase productivity and efficiency.

POLICIES, PROCEDURES AND STANDARDS
The Information Technologies Department along with the Governance Group will recommend the
establishment of formal policies, procedures and standards that make processes repeatable and
efficient. Ensuring that policies, procedures and standards are maintained allows our organization to
establish and adhere to best practices.
Policies
Policies will be will be developed and maintained by the recommendation of the Governance Group
with assistance from the Information Technologies, Legal and Human Resources Departments.
Following the formal adoption, the policies will be published on the City’s website at
http://southbendin.gov/government/content/policies. Any modification of the Plan will follow the
same procedures.
Below is a comprehensive list of necessary policies. Current policies must be reviewed as quickly as
possible. Currently, many of these polices are maintained by the Human Resources Department or are
published on the City’s website. In addition, this list may be amended by the Governance Group,
Information Technologies, Legal and Human Resources as needed.

Procedures
Creating effective procedures will establish best practices and repeatability. Documenting and
formalizing best practices should be done wherever possible to perpetuate accepted processes.
1. Establish an Information Technology Service Management (ITSM) Catalog, which identifies current
Information Technology Services. The catalog will explain the process of requesting services and
publicize service level agreements.
2. Develop a business continuity and disaster recovery procedure. Mission critical systems must be
identified and protected. In the event of a disaster, a plan must be in place to recover these
essential systems in a timely manner and restore services. Systems that are defined as non-mission
critical will also have an appropriate protection and recovery strategy.
3. Creation of a procedure for effective implementation of new systems. To enable systems to
cohesively become a part of the organization’s everyday processes, a procedure must be created.

DATA MANAGEMENT
As the city continues to pursue data-based solutions, a data management strategy is needed.

Data Entry

Analyze

Storage

Publish

Replicate

`

1. Effectively capturing data is the first step. Data that is not collected cannot be reported, so an
emphasis on complete data capture is crucial.
2. Once data is identified it must be stored. In order to store data efficiently and avoid duplication, a
storage strategy will be created.
3. With many systems that hold different yet related sets of data, replication is often necessary.
Replicating data into and out of disparate systems will create consistency among data sources
allowing for better analysis.
4. Publishing data in human and machine readable formats will allow city departments to share
frequently requested data. When made widely accessible and consumable, data will enable
vendors to build applications, departments to create innovative, data-based solutions and citizens
to access data. Increased transparency and interdepartmental sharing is an essential part of good,
accessible government.

Page 17

Final

4 – STRATEGY
5. Improved analysis of data will enable the city to pin point problems using concrete data. Better
analysis of data will help create better, data-driven solutions to pressing issues in South Bend.

CENTRALIZATION STRATEGY
Currently, many processes are duplicated by different departments, creating inefficiencies and wasted
resources. To eliminate these duplications, many functions must be centralized. After defining
responsibilities with service level agreements, departments will be able to better manage their
technologies and contact the appropriate group or department for assistance.

GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE
The Governance Committee will prioritize projects and recommend the creation of policies, procedures
and standards. With a focus on realizing the goals of this plan, the governance group will align
technology development with the goals of the administration.
Creation of Policies, Procedures and Standards
The creation, review and modification of policies, procedures and standards must be completed as
quickly as possible.
Portfolio Management
As soon as possible the Governance Group will convene a meeting to prioritize projects. All
departments with technology needs will be invited to this meeting. An independent and experienced
3rd party will moderate this discussion.

DEVELOP ORGANIZATIONAL APTITUDE
Employee understanding of technology as it relates to their job functions must be improved. This plan
cannot be realized without training and development across the entire organization, not just within the
Information Technology Department. To achieve the goals set forth in this plan, assessments will be
done to determine current skills and develop training plans.
Information Technologies Training
Within the Information Technologies Department, further training and skill development is constantly
needed. Currently, the department primarily needs a better understanding of the Naviline ERP System.
Creation of Departmental Technology Officers
In an effort to create departmental ownership and bolster organizational aptitude, each department
will be assigned a Technology Officer. Technology Officers will report to the Director of Information
Technologies. Examples of responsibilities include Tier 1 help desk support, on-board training, and
administration of employee training plans.

PROJECTS
The list of projects below is a representative example of projects that must be completed. Actual
identification of projects will be a shared responsibility for all departments including Information

5 – TACTICAL PATH
Technologies. To prevent biased prioritization, the City will bring in a third party arbiter with
technological knowledge to help assess the City’s priorities.
Open Data Initiative
The development on an Open Data Portal began in 2013 in an effort to provide data to Code for
America and IBM. After researching various means to provide accessible data, an open data platform
fully met the needs of the previously mentioned vendors and additionally provided greater
governmental transparency to citizens. The Open Data Platform allows the City to publish, consume
and analyze data like never before, even providing the capabilities to make visualizations, maps and
charts that allow for better analysis. With the platform in place, data can be shared publicly and
privately. The public can view and download information freely. Private developers can access data to
create new, innovative applications. At the same time, this project presents challenges in determining
what data must remain internal, ultimately requiring the creation of data collection and dissemination
protocols.
Upgrade or Replace Current ERP System
The current Naviline ERP System must be upgraded or replaced. The importance of this system as well
as the challenges of replacing it cannot be understated. The City of South Bend must fully commit to
this project. This project will require the most proficient staff from many key departments to be fully
immersed on this project for many months or years to help complete the replacement. Although
replacing the ERP system is a giant and risky endeavor, the outcome will provide additional capabilities
that the city desperately needs.
In order to replace the ERP system, a needs assessment must first be conducted to analyze which
system will more closely meet our current and future needs. At this juncture, the next ERP System
must offer more robust user reporting, mobile access, an SQL database backend, and a more intuitive
user interface. Information Technologies has included funding for the needs assessment in the 2014
proposed budget. Implementation of the new system would begin in early 2015 with a 2-4 year
implementation schedule depending on many factors including the vendor and product selected.
Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Plan
The creation of a Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Plan is needed to ensure mission critical
systems are protected at the highest reasonable level and that they can be restored as quickly as
possible in the event of a disaster. Mission critical systems must be identified. After combining many
essential technologies and locations to better protect them, the Information Technologies Department
will also develop a recovery plan that outlines processes to restore mission critical systems in the event
of a disaster.

5 – TACTICAL PATH
Establish Integration to St. Joseph County for critical data
The City of South Bend and St. Joseph County duplicate many processes, creating inefficiencies and
wasted resources. Establishing integration with St. Joseph County will help several departments be
more efficient. Ideally, the City of South Bend and St. Joseph County can integrate data collection and
freely share data. This will enable the City to access warrant information, property ownership records,
assessed valuations, zoning information, commissioner sales, tax sale information and other data.
PSAP Consolidation
Indiana law requires the consolidation of Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) centers to no more than
two locations per county by the end of 2014. Currently St. Joseph County, Mishawaka, Clay Fire and
South Bend all have PSAP locations, necessitating immediate consolidation.
Mobile Field Connectivity
Increasingly, departments need to access internal resources while in the field. The city must continue
to secure private data while making mobile access intuitive and efficient. Resolving this challenge will
increase efficiencies in all departments where considerable time is spent in the field.
Vacant and Abandoned Housing
Data collection of vacant and abandoned houses has yet to be formalized. Continuing to develop tools
and procedures for an effective Vacant and Abandoned Housing Strategy is necessary to meet the
Mayor’s goal of dealing with 1,000 houses in 1,000 days.
Land Management Cleanup, Policies and Procedures
The city currently lacks an effective land management strategy. A successful plan will create protocols
to geocode addresses, remove duplicate entries and generate more accurate information. Technology
also can be used to provide landowner information and create a field for the state tax ID. Additionally,
the amount of incorrect information can be reduced by ensuring an address validation feature is
enabled, and the number of personnel with access to enter data is controlled. An authoritative
database would allow the City to more easily share data between systems such as Naviline and GIS,
improving reporting and route optimization.
“Future-proof” the Networking Infrastructure
As the City constantly demands more of its network, the Information Technologies Department must
assess the current capacity of networking infrastructure and plan for the future. An examination of the
network must confirm the infrastructure has the capacity to fulfill current needs but is also robust and
flexible enough to deliver services in the future. Some of these steps include closing fiber loops for
redundancy, improving the backbone of the network to 10GB to assure available bandwidth, increasing

internet connection speeds, reviewing the network hardware and infrastructure for capacity, and
completing a security audit. This examination will ensure the network and systems can withstand the
burden of current needs and remain flexible enough to accommodate tomorrow’s demands.
GIS Strategic Implementation
An enterprise level GIS Strategic Implementation will address many issues including governance,
database design, data integrity, data maintenance, software, training and infrastructure. Strategically
investing in our current GIS environment will give decision makers access to more complete data.

GOVERNANCE GROUP
The Governance Committee will meet regularly to discuss project prioritization, further develop
policies, procedures and standards, and alter the strategic plan when necessary. Prioritization of
projects will be determined by several factors including impact, efficiencies, return on investment, risk
mitigation, internal resources and the availability of outside expertise. The Governance Group bears
the responsibility of achieving the goals of the Strategic Plan.
The Governance Group will allocate resources and budgets for projects, and should require
performance measures to determine project success.
An initial project portfolio management discussion involving every department and moderated by a
disinterested third party should be held as soon as possible. In an effort to remove bias, the
disinterested third party will help prioritize the most important projects.

CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER (CIO)
The Chief Information Officer's (CIO) role is to provide vision and leadership for developing and
implementing information technology initiatives. Under the framework of the Governance Group, the
Chief Information Officer directs the planning and implementation of enterprise IT systems in support
of business operations. This individual will be responsible for all aspects of the organization's
information technology and systems and should be viewed as a key member of the administration’s
staff.

APPENDIX C – POTENTIAL PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS
Appendix C – Potential Project Descriptions
Below is a brief description of potential projects mentioned on page 23. The Governance Group will
determine the actual projects and prioritization.

OPEN DATA PORTAL
In 2013 the City of South Bend became the first city in the state of Indiana to create and Open Data
Portal. This portal is a publicly accessible portal that centralizes data collected by disparate city
departments. This allows departments to access and analyze data more effectively, generates datadriven solutions, increases transparency and can even allow private developers to develop innovative
ways of handling municipal problems.

PSAP CONSOLIDATION
Indiana law requires the consolidation of Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) centers to no more than
two locations per county by the end of 2014. Currently St. Joseph County, Mishawaka, Clay Fire and
South Bend all have PSAP locations, necessitating immediate consolidation.

ERP REPLACEMENT
The current Naviline ERP System must be upgraded or replaced. The importance of this system as well
as the challenges of replacing it cannot be understated. The City of South Bend must fully commit to
this project. This project will require the most proficient staff from many key departments to be fully
immersed on this project for many months or years to help complete the replacement. Although
replacing the ERP system is a giant and risky endeavor, the outcome will provide additional capabilities
that the city desperately needs.
In order to replace the ERP system, a needs assessment must first be conducted to analyze which
system will more closely meet our current and future needs. At this juncture, the next ERP System
must offer more robust user reporting, mobile access, an SQL database backend, and a more intuitive
user interface. Information Technologies has included funding for the needs assessment in the 2014
proposed budget. Implementation of the new system would begin in early 2015 with a 2-4 year
implementation schedule depending on many factors including the vendor and product selected.

Page 40

Final

APPENDIX C – POTENTIAL PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS
BUSINESS CONTINUITY
The creation of a Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Plan is needed to ensure mission critical
systems are protected at the highest reasonable level and that they can be restored as quickly as
possible in the event of a disaster. First, mission critical systems must be identified. After combining
many essential technologies and locations to better protect them, the Information Technologies
Department will also develop a recovery plan that outlines processes to restore mission critical systems
in the event of a disaster.

NETWORK ASSESSMENT
As the City constantly demands more of its network, the Information Technologies Department must
assess the current capacity of networking infrastructure and plan for the future. An examination of the
network must confirm that the current infrastructure has the capacity to fulfill current needs but is also
robust and flexible enough to deliver services in the future. Some of these steps include closing fiber
loops for redundancy, improving the backbone of the network to 10GB to assure available bandwidth,
increasing internet connection speeds, reviewing the network hardware and infrastructure for capacity,
and completing a security audit. This examination will ensure our network and systems can withstand
the burden of our current needs and remain flexible enough to accommodate tomorrow’s demands.

GIS STRATEGIC IMPLEMENTATION
An enterprise level GIS Strategic Implementation will address many issues including governance,
database design, data integrity, data maintenance, software, training and infrastructure. Strategically
investing in our current GIS environment will give decision makers access to more complete data.

BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE SOFTWARE
Business intelligence tools are designed to retrieve, analyze and report data for business intelligence.
An enterprise level tool of this nature will help decisions within the City of South Bend become more
based upon a data-driven decision model.

INTEGRATION POINTS WITH ST. JOSEPH COUNTY
The City of South Bend and St. Joseph County duplicate many processes, creating inefficiencies and
wasted resources. Establishing integrated systems with St. Joseph County will help several departments
be more efficient. Ideally, the City of South Bend and St. Joseph County can integrate data collection
and freely share data. This will enable the City to access warrant information, property ownership

Page 41

Final

APPENDIX C – POTENTIAL PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS
records, assessed valuations, zoning information, commissioner sales, tax sale information and other
data.

MOBILE FIELD CONNECTIVITY
Increasingly, departments need to access internal resources while in the field. As mobile access is
created, the city must continue to secure private data while making access intuitive and efficient.
Resolving this challenge will increase efficiencies in all departments where considerable time is spent in
the field.
