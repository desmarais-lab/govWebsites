The chairman called the meeting to order at 10:50.
A motion was made for approval of the April 19, 2005 IT Board Meeting Minutes. The motion was
seconded and passed unanimously.
Introduction of New Board Member and Counsel:
Mr. Clifford introduced Michael Rodman, Marion County Treasurer, as the IT Board’s newest member.
He also introduced the Board’s new legal counsel, Kostas Poulakidas. Tony Schaffer was recognized
representing the Marion County Clerk’s Office.
Mr. Clifford stated that Marty Womacks is no longer a member of the board. Since Ms. Womacks
acted as the board secretary, electing Linda Enders as secretary was discussed. A motion was made
to elect Ms. Enders as secretary to the IT Board. The motion was seconded and passed
unanimously.
Resolution 05-11 to Approve the Disbursement of Enhanced Access Funds
Mr. Clifford stated no motion is needed. The resolution is for signature.
Resolution 05-12 to approve the Aerotek contract
Mr. Rutherford presented the Aerotek contract information. The Board requested ISA compete out
temporary service contracts. The services that ISA requested for the GIS office include process
creation, inventory, data entry, and address maintenance. The Internet Office requested application
testing, content management, tracking, and application documentation. ISA followed the appropriate

purchasing procedures. Central Purchasing moved forward with an RFQ. Five vendors responded.
Aerotek submitted the lowest pricing for the services requested. Mr. Rutherford recommended the
Board move forward with the Aerotek contract.
A motion was made to approve Resolution 05-12. The motion was seconded and passed
unanimously.
Justis.Net Update
Mr. Rutherford and Mr. Harris discussed progress on Justis.Net. Project teams have been identified
including project management, risk, procurement and infrastructure teams. Regular meetings have
been established. The project management team is responsible for general project oversight, review
of project timelines, and project plans and is headed by Mr. Rutherford. Mr. Harris will be focusing on
detailing path assignments, maintaining and publishing the task lists. The risk team is headed by
Ahmed Soliman. The risk team will be reporting any risks related to costs, scope, and quality. The
procurement team is led by Mr. Turner and Ms. Patel. They are working through the hardware and
software acquisition. The infrastructure team is headed by Mark Kastilahn and includes other
infrastructure personnel. They will be focusing on the requirements of the project hardware, software,
the tools necessary, and the wiring.
Mr. Harris stated the first step of the project was to gain the IT Board approval. Stage one includes
preliminary planning of the project. Stage two will be preparing the test environments. The hardware
and software need to be defined and the items purchased and put in place. The procurement team
has been working on the hardware/software list to tighten the requirements. They are looking for best
solution at the best price. As the project moves forward, the team will be providing greater detail. As
the detail is outlined the risks will be identified.
Mr. Clifford asked if a fiscal ordinance is required for the financing for the equipment. Ms. Patel
responded that the Clerk’s Office is working with the Auditor to present the fiscal. It should be filed in
July.
Property Update
Mr. Rutherford stated the requirements have been revised. The Township Assessors’ offices, the
Treasurer’s Office, the Department of Public Works, and the Department of Metropolitan Development
have all been asked to reconfirm their requirements. Other agencies such as Corporation Counsel,
and the Coroner’s office were contacted as well for their requirements for the new property system.
The RFP draft is in process.
Mr. Ricketts commented that the property group has done a very good job. He believes enough ‘plug
ins’ have been included to represent everyone in the enterprise. An interpretation of some of the
statutes need to be established as well as a standard for a state-wide rule for what the software will
and will not do. It is required by statute to have ‘something’ in place by July of 2006. What that
‘something’ is is unclear. A conversion to the state-wide parcel numbering system will be done. It
probably will have to be built into the RFP

Meeting Minutes
Update on the CIO
Mr. Clifford stated at the last meeting the Subcommittee of the Board recommended six final
candidates. Mr. Clifford interviewed the five external candidates. The Board met in Executive Session
today to discuss the process of moving forward. The Board intends to interview three of the external
candidates and the one internal candidate in an Executive Session yet to be determined. The Board
discussed delegation of authorities given to the interim CIO. The Board would like to take back some
of that delegation of authority regarding contracts and personnel.
A motion was made that all contracts and personnel decisions shall come before the IT Board
between now and the time when the permanent CIO is designated. The motion was seconded and
passed unanimously.
ISA Financial Report
Ms. Patel presented the ISA Financial Report. Ms. Patel stated the report describes the financial
position of ISA in four areas: 2004 vs. 2005 Budget Comparison, Year to Date Revenue Statement,
April 2004 vs. April 2005 Contract Comparison, and 2005 Application Maintenance and Support
Expenditures.
Contract Compliance Update - Premis Consulting.
Mr. Beuge addressed the Board. Premis has been actively looking at some of the operational issues
in regard to the contract. The focus of assessment has been SLRs (Service Level Requirements) and
Milestones. Milestones are one-time improvements that make the environment more productive. Of
the 15 milestones due to date, 14 were either late or of such quality that they could not be accepted.
As part of an improvement plan, ISA has provided feedback to Northrup Grumman (NG) and has
asked for a 30 day plan to fix ten milestones. In addition, NG has been trying to meet the milestones
with onsite operations staff, although there was a commitment to bring in corporate expertise. NG has
been asked to provide offsite resources to allow on-site staff to focus on day-to-day operations.
Service levels are on-going day-to-day performance measurements, such as availability of mainframe
and servers. There are 125 Service Level Requirements in the contract. Currently only 33 of 125
SLRs are being reported. Of these, 16 meet the contractual requirements.
Ms. Malloy offered there are several options to remedy some of these performance issues. There is a
contractual requirement that when a service level is missed Northrup Grumman or ISA request a root
cost analysis. NG’s tools are not fully implemented. The plan was that they would be implemented in
January and NG would be able to report. Apparently, this has been more difficult task than they
anticipated. A root cost analysis has been requested on what the issues are. Northrup Grumman
has been requested to put in writing what they think they need to do to fix the reporting issues and a
timeline for that. Also, more corporate presence has been requested.
Dr. Inui stated that users would be adversely affected by missing some of these SLRs. They could be
disabling in the work process. He asked if anyone is paying attention at corporate level.
Mr. Tierney stated these concerns have been communicated to Northrup Grumman corporate. They
continue to progress. Corporate has supplied additional resources to deliver some of the missed

Meeting Minutes
milestones. A few of them are in place. He stated performance has improved since the last report.
He stated he would like an opportunity to analyze the report findings.
Dr. Inui stated that information systems have a systemic effect on the entire enterprise. In looking at
another ½ hour to reset a password, if that is happening over the enterprise, a lot of people are
slowed down in their work. The impact of a small thing is huge. Mr. Tierney stated user password
reset has been pushed forward as a milestone in the contract. It has been demonstrated in a private
session.
Dr. Inui asked what Northrup Grumman reaction was to the potential financial penalties. Mr. Tierney
stated the focus has been on determining causes. Since the beginning of contract Northrup
Grumman has had steady improvement. The service levels are much steeper than the previous
vendors.
Customer satisfaction not measured here. Mr. Tierney stated a tool in Siebel was just made available
last month (April). Customer satisfaction will be measured.
Mr. Clifford commented that the City and County have a number of functions privatized.
Governments are partnering through contracts. This is a new contract. The implemented Service
Level Agreements are much higher than the enterprise previously had and the transition occurred
quickly. At the next meeting the Board would like an update from Premis including discussion about a
policy for the board if it is not satisfied with the service levels. Specifically, Premis should address the
way the Board may use the penalties to voice opinion. Mr. Clifford did not believe the Board is ready
at this time to step forward at that level. The process has been very valuable to both ISA and
Northrup Grumman.
The meeting adjourned at 11:30. The next IT Board Meeting is June 21 at 9:30.

CIVICNET HIGHLIGHTS
Reminder: Financial data is reported on a one-month delay. This means that
financials for May 2005 will be detailed in the report distributed in July 2005.

CivicNet service usage increased across the board in May, with
statutory funds collected reaching nearly $1.5 million so far in
2005, and subscription numbers at an all-time high.
Testing is underway for the Division of Compliance on the
property owner permitting service with deployment anticipated
in late June. This non-subscription service will allow property
owners to apply for and receive structural remodeling and
renovation permits through CivicNet. Property owners who
need a permit are currently required to visit the agency and
submit a written request for their permit. Customers will have
access to the online permitting service 24/7, and the agency will
benefit from reduced traffic as well as lower costs for office
materials and printing for the more than 21,000 permits that are
issued to property owners each year.
In May, the Juvenile Justice Information Sharing System (JJISS)
was expanded to include Wayne and Decatur Township Schools.
Franklin Township Schools will be added in June. JJISS is a
Web-based communication sharing service providing instant
online juvenile information sharing anytime of the day or night
between the Marion County Juvenile Courts, Indianapolis
Police/Marion County Sheriff’s departments, Division of Family
and Social Services Administration (FSSA) and public schools.
While the Treasurer’s Office was busy processing May tax
installments, CivicNet continued work on the Bulk Search
service, which will assist the agency with large customer
requests for information. Currently, Treasurer’s staff manually
processes requests; four staff members are dedicated to this task
throughout the year, and up to ten during peak tax season.
CivicNet plans to have the service deployed for the agency
before the rush of November tax payments.
This spring, CivicNet has also worked actively with agencies to
design and produce marketing and public relations materials for
our agency partners is a service provided by CivicNet.
Marketing projects in May included: full-color brochures for the
Clerk’s Office, featuring all services provided by the office; table
tents with online court information for court clerks; brochures,
direct mailings and new lobby posters promoting the Division of
Compliance property owner permitting service; and Animal Care
and Control brochures and public service advertisements.

Please note: The YTD May 2004 expenses for ACS totaled $4,668 million. This expense for ACS does not
include the following:
A). The cost for the Business Consultants (currently reclassified as Business Relationship Managers within ISA).
B). Any Pass through charges & New Application Development. (In 2005 no new application dollars budgeted.)
It does however, include the cost for Maintenance and Support. In 2004 the contractual dollars allocated for
Application Development included Maintenance & Support along w/ New Development. This breakdown was
75% for Maintenance and Support and 25% for New Development for 2004. Prior to 2004, the split was more
50% for Maintenance and Support and 50% for New Development.
Based on the chart above there is a contract savings of $414K for year to date 2005, and based on this trend,
we are projecting a contract savings of approximately $993K by the end of calendar year 2005.

The chart above shows the hours and dollars budgeted for the City and County for Application Maintenance and
Support. We currently should be at 41% for both the City and County budget at the end of May 2005. We need
to monitor and prioritize our projects and enhancements so that funding is still available for support through out
this year. Based on current spending trends, the County will exceed its budget for application maintenance &
support by $111,000.

Application Support – Bug or performance tuning of an existing application.
Maintenance – Enhancement of an existing system.

IT Board Report
Status Report
June, 2005

Improvement Plan Update:
Last month, two areas of focus regarding NG performance were discussed: milestone quality
and service level attainment. Milestones are one-time improvements that make our
environment more productive, e.g. single sign-on capability. Service levels measure daytoday performance, such as availability of mainframe and servers. The following discusses
the progress made and additional issues to be resolved as part of the improvement plan.

Service Level Improvement Plan (SLR’s):
SLR’s are ongoing day-to-day performance measurements, such as availability of mainframe
and servers. There are 125 service level requirements in the contract. Last month it was
reported that only 33 of the 125 SLR’s were being reported. Of these, 16 met the contractual
requirements. This month, 82 SLR’s are being reported. Of these 63 are meeting
contractual requirements. This is largely due to an increase in the number of SLR’s being
reported in service area 1. The HP Openview and E-Services capabilities should report
about 25 more SLR’s, but this is dependent on implementation of those tools.
The improvement plan was successful in that more of the unreported SLR’s in SA1 are now
being reported for the first time. The chart below describes the improvement in just the past
month. From this data, a benchmark has been established for that area so that it will be
possible to focus on performance improvement. However, when considering that we cannot
assume those not reported are being met, only 58% of the SLR’s are attained.
SA2 performance numbers have remained stagnant. While there was a slight improvement
in attainment from last month, from 23% to 29%, there is a concern that there are significant
underlying issues not being addressed. The progress is very slow.
Outcome: ISA has requested a Root Cause Analysis for SA2 in the area focused on desk top
support and security request.

Root Cause Analysis (RCA): Siebel ticketing system
In May, a root cause analysis was requested by ISA to determine if the new tools being used
in delivering services could be a factor in the poor SLR attainment. Per this request, the
Northrop Grumman Siebel Leadership Team and Technical Team were brought onsite to
Indianapolis to understand the issues, develop and complete the RCA report and begin
remediation plans. The Siebel team, in conjunction with ISA, identified 15 issues.
The findings were mixed as no “silver bullet” was found. Call takers continue to have
difficulty entering tickets: there is a great deal of data entry required. The problems were split
between software fixes that will not be available until the 1st quarter of 2006, issues
surrounding trying to fit City/County needs into the standard NG configuration (such as
adding a department field), and issues surrounding inadequate requirements gathered during
transition. It is unclear whether fixing these issues will lead to improved performance at the
help desk.
Outcome: Siebel progress will continue to be updated weekly at ISA/NG status meetings. At
this time no status meetings have been scheduled by NG.
The IT Board has requested a meeting, scheduled for June 24th, be held to gather information
about the impact SLR performance is having on the customer. 25 customers have been
invited. This workshop will be facilitated by Premis Consulting Group.

Root Cause Analysis (RCA): HP Openview
Hewlett Packard OpenView (HP OpenView) is a network-based product intended to sample
the health of all network-connected devices and send reports for technical staff review. This
product has been installed on the City/County network however there are some
customization still required to realize the full benefits of monitoring network and server events
on a proactive basis. The technical staff is installing agents on the critical City/County
applications to monitor response time. The full benefits of this product will be realized in the
July 2005 timeframe when the response time Service Level Requirements are enabled.
There are over 20 SLR’s dependent on the implementation of this tool. The RCA report for
ISA: IT Board Report (monthly) – June 2005

this tool has not been delivered yet. A NG consultant was assigned the week of June 14th to
work on an analysis of the tool.

Milestone Improvement Plan:
As part of a milestone improvement plan, ISA had provided feedback to NG and executed a
30 day plan to fix ten milestones. ISA asked NG to provide offsite resources to work on
milestone deliverables to improve the quality of the milestone deliverables and allow onsite
staff to focus on day-to-day operations.
The improvement plan has been successful in that there has been progress made on
milestones that were languishing. NG delivered more milestones the past month for review
than for the previous 8 months of the contract.
Because so many are in review at this point an assessment cannot be made as to whether
quality has improved. More information in July will be provided.
Of the ten milestones due previously and being reworked as part of the improvement plan, 2
have been accepted fully. Two others, which require plans followed by implementations,
have had their plans accepted. Four are in the ISA review process. One is a scheduled test.
Two contract milestones are being considered for scope changes, at the request of NG.
These are the Technology Refresh Plan, which may be trimmed down because an accurate
asset data ensures a better plan, and the Technology Plan where the parts that are
dependent on a City-County strategic plan will be re-scoped for those parts that can be
delivered without a strategic plan.

Service Area 1: Projects Backlog
A third area of concern is being watched this month. ISA Operations worked with Northrop
during the month to prioritize and escalate the 170+ infrastructure projects in the queue. This
backlog is as a result of internal staff being dedicated to milestone deliverables and training
on the new tools being implemented. NG project management was minimal the first four
months, but at the request of ISA, two new project managers have joined NG and are
charged with working on this project backlog. ISA has taken the charge of prioritizing the
backlog for NG in an effort to help. Customer moves are prioritized the highest usually
because of date requirements, with upgrades and financial savings driving the priority of the
remaining items on the list. ISA is recommending to NG that additional staff be brought
onsite in order to catch up the backlog and improve customer satisfaction.
Service Area 2: Asset Management:
Per City/County request, NG has assigned an additional project manager– with project plan
writing expertise - for the purpose establishing a workable asset project plan for getting the
asset database to the agreed to 95% accuracy for legacy assets and 98% accuracy of new
assets. Currently NG has estimated that the legacy asset database is approximately 65-70%
accurate. Although requested, NG to date has not been able to validate this approximation.
This project plan will also identify and establish uniform policies and enforcement as the
method to achieving and maintaining the 95% & 98% accuracy enterprise-wide. The progress
of this project will continue to be monitored and co-managed by ISA. Reoccurring updates,
feedback and consensus will likely be sought and needed at the IT Board and IT Steering
Committee levels as the asset management policy’s and enforcement methods are
established as this will require enterprise buy-in in order to be successful.

Service Area 3: Application Services:
Application Services had a good month in terms of problem tickets. They hit 100% of the
problem ticket response and resolution requirements for the third consecutive month. They
have one SLR on which they do not report, client satisfaction, which should be reported in
July.

Other issues and Accomplishments:
Northrop Grumman has been teaming with ISA on the Mayor’s Action Center. Several
technical issues were resolved during April which has made the application more responsive.
We will be working with Tier 1 in the coming weeks to stabilize the application so that the
Portal for constituents can be enabled.
The Standards Committee recommended raising the minimum standards for PCs on the
network by eliminating Windows 95 and 98 machines. The criteria driving this effort includes
improved performance of the network, employees, less resources needed for desktop
repairs, and the need to move to XP machines in order to run Justis.NET and other .NET
applications.
Homeland Security funds requested for Marion County for improved security measures and
redundancy for telephone operations in event of a disaster has been allocated to the
City/County and we are awaiting approval to move forward on proposed efforts.

PREMIS - Statement of Work (SOW): City of Indianapolis/Marion County

Management Consulting Assistance

PREMIS will attend all operations meetings with ISA management to assist in expectation setting
with NG. Additionally, PREMIS consultants will provide ISA contract management and operations
staff with templates that help them manage NG to the contract guidelines. PREMIS will develop
negotiation tactics for use by ISA management in order to facilitate quicker decisions regarding
NG scope issues.
PREMIS Activities, Outcomes & Deliverables:
 Repeatable contract management processes for use by operations staff
 Higher quality milestone deliverables
 Root cause analysis on baseline service level requirements
 Working solutions for continuous improvement.
 Viable negotiation positions for use by the ISA management staff

1-2-2 Miscellaneous Consulting Advisory Services
Realizing the importance of being flexible in a fluid environment such as this, PREMIS has
earmarked time for unforeseen needs identified during the course of the contract for which ISA
may request PREMIS’ assistance. These advisory services can be used for unseen projects or
work assigned by ISA or City/County management. Approval is gained by ISA prior to conducting
any work.
Examples of this kind of work may include:
 Follow up on suggestions collected during customer workshop to be held in June to identify
ISA and NG issues
 Assist the PMO and BRMs in sizing projects, interviewing customers, etc., to practice and
evaluate new processes recently put in place.
 Evaluate customer solutions for financial return on investment.
 Work behind the scenes to assist in customer deliverables as the BRM and PMO divisions
build their skills and staffs.
 Assist in assimilating and coaching new BRMs in their roles.
 Develop an interim workload balancing recommendation for the BRMs.
 Analyze the results from the customer satisfaction survey and create a report for the IT
Board. Develop recommendations from the results.
Note: These are examples only and will be performed upon written request only.

Description:
For reference and review, attached here are all applicable PREMIS team bios for this project.
Bio #1: Executive Management Consultant - Joel Buege
Joel Buege is an expert in helping organizations meet their business objectives through the
better use of technology.
Joel specializes in assessing and improving the cost efficiency, quality and performance
capabilities of information systems in the areas of help desk, network management, and
client/server systems. Well-versed in the latest motivational and teaming techniques, Joel has
directed teams in not only the assessment and vendor selection processes but also has built and
managed the delivery teams in outsourced solutions.
Prior to being a founding member of PREMIS Consulting Group, Joel held the position of Managing
Consultant and Program Management Practice Lead with Compass America. Compass is a leading
international performance improvement consultancy, specializing in IT and business operations.
Joel directed consulting teams using Compass-developed benchmarking and performance
modeling techniques, which resulted in recommendations that fundamentally changed the way
organizations do business. Joel was accountable for the overall business relationship as well as
responsible for scoping, planning, and managing multi-discipline and multi-site studies through all
phases or the engagement.
As the Deputy Program Manager assigned to a premier account for the Unisys Corporation, Joel
was responsible for managing a critical three-month transition from in-house provided services to
Unisys. He subsequently was responsible for the day-to-day operational management of a team
of one hundred engineers and engineering managers in the delivery of distributed network and
desktop services. These services included level one and two help desk, asset management,
desktop support, LAN/WAN, remote network management and distributed application installation
and management. Joel received a Unisys Corporation client satisfaction award given to individual
employees recognized by their clients for superior client satisfaction ratings.
The project was also featured in Unisys’ 1999 Annual Report and Joel was featured on the report’s
cover.
Prior to Unisys, Joel managed the Engineering Department at CompuCom Systems Inc. He led the
building of the Wisconsin Engineering branch, doubling revenues, and establishing 5 new national
accounts and 21 local service accounts with dedicated teams. In every year he was a manager at
CompuCom, he was recognized for outstanding achievement, culminating in two awards in 1998,
one for CompuCom Branch of the Year, and one for Engineering Manager of the Year.
Prior to CompuCom, Joel worked as an Engineer and Consultant for the IBM Corporation.

of Chicago. Ms. Malloy was responsible for implementing a turn-around strategy for city
government and leading the City’s “Silicon Prairie” economic development effort.
She spearheaded a citywide transformation project, resulting in streamlined parking management

her tenure, Chicago won two consecutive “Best of the Web” awards from Government Technology
Magazine.
Ms. Malloy led the restructuring of the technology organization, successfully outsourcing
distributed IT, datacenter and application development services, leading to the largest client
satisfaction improvement the Gartner Group, a technology research firm, has ever recorded.
Under her leadership, Chicago created the concept and implemented 311, the nation’s first
municipal integrated call center and work-order system. The goals of the project included not only
providing faster and better service to constituents, but also reducing the use of the 911 line for
non-emergency requests. In the first month of implementation, calls to 911 dropped 25%, and
service fulfillment times improved 20%. In the four years since its inception, it has become the
accepted standard across the nation’s largest cities, including New York, Houston, Dallas, and
Baltimore. In 2003, it won the prestigious Institute for Government Innovation Award at Harvard
University’s John F. Kennedy School of Government.
Ms. Malloy speaks on topics ranging from using e-government to the political challenges of
business improvement. She has been a regular speaker at Northwestern University’s Kellogg
Graduate School of Management and the Illinois Institute of Technology, as well as featured at
the Gartner Group’s annual Symposium. She has consulted and spoken with local governments
and public companies worldwide. Her work has been featured in Computerworld, Information
Week, and Government Technology magazines.
In 2000, Ms. Malloy was selected from a nationwide field of executives rated for their leadership
and management capabilities by Computerworld magazine and featured as one of its “Premier
100 Technology Leaders”. She was named one of Crain’s Chicago Business’ “Most Influential
Technology Stars” in 1998. She is a board member of the IT Resource Center, a non-profit
company that provides low-cost technology consulting to other non-profits. She founded and cochaired the Mayor’s Council of Technology Advisors, a public / private task force whose charter
includes providing broadband connectivity to every institution, business, and home in Chicago.
After her work at the City, Ms. Malloy went on to serve as a Director at the Gartner Group. Earlier
in her career, she worked in executive sales and consulting management at IBM. She has a
degree in Computer Science and Math from Youngstown State University.
Bio #3: Executive Management Consultant – Michael Gargano (local partner)
Michael Gargano is an expert at helping state and local governments develop a framework for
technology initiatives to support business and operational objectives. Michael has provided
specialized services to over 30 state and local government clients, helping them plan and
implement solutions and technologies tailored to their individual needs.
Prior to founding the Watertown Group, an Indiana-based Consultancy and PREMIS partner,
Michael worked for national consulting firms focused on public sector clients, including over ten
years at KPMG Consulting (now Bearing Point).
Some recent client success stories include:
 Prepared a Public Safety Market Assessment Study for multi-billion dollar company that
documented competitor product offerings; top 30 markets; strengths, weaknesses,
opportunities, and threats (SWOT) related to company’s and competitors’ solutions.
 Produced a Technical Blueprint for a consortium of not-for-profit organizations in central
Indiana. The Blueprint included the following components: vision, high-level business and
functional requirements, implementation alternatives, roadmap, technical architecture,

data architectures. Highlights of the Plan included: (1) a detailed assessment of the current
technical infrastructure, (2) recommendations for the development and integration of new
communications, technical, applications, and data architectures, (3) a transition strategy to
alter the organizational structure and content of the agency’s Information Systems
Organization, and (4) strategies and timeframes to initiate and implement the Plan’s
recommendations.
