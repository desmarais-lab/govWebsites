General Information
60% of the franchise fee revenues collected by Comcast Cablevision and Frontier
Communications are deposited directly into the General Fund. The remaining 4 0 % are
applied to the Cable Fund, and their use is detailed below.
In the previous four quarters ending June 30, 2013, $1,615,509 was receipted to the
General Fund and $1,077,006 was receipted to the Cable Fund. Franchise fee based
disbursements from the Cable Fund are allocated based on a formula, as established by
ordinance G-27-95.
The Cable Fund supports these programs:
Access Originator grants: General ordinance G-27-95 stipulates that 80% of the cable
franchise fees receipted to the Cable Fund be disbursed, as recommended by the Cable
Fund A c c e s s Board, to the four access channel originators in our community: college
access television, operated by Indiana University/Purdue University; public access,
operated by the Allen County Public Library; government access, managed by the City of
Fort Wayne with daily operations subcontracted to the Allen County Public Library; and
educational access, operated by Fort Wayne Community Schools. A c c e s s Originator
Grants are disbursed quarterly. In the four quarters ending June 30 2013, each access
originator received $215,401, for a total of $861,604. The 2014 program (166ACTR)
budget is $900,000. (The amount budgeted does not affect the amount granted, as the
amount granted is always a fixed percent of franchise fee revenue. However, to avoid
revising the budget, the amount budgeted should be safely above the last years revenue
receipts.)
Non-access originator grants: G-27-95 also specifies that 10% of franchise fees
receipted to the Cable Fund be available as grants to not-for-profit organizations located
within Fort Wayne that do not originate an access station, for the purpose of enhancing
local access. These grants can be used in a variety of ways, as long as it relates to
access television and/or enhancing public access.
These grants can be used to
reimburse personnel expenses, overhead costs, production costs, operation expenses,
and equipment expenses. For 2014, $107,000 has been budgeted (166NFPG) for these
grants.
City administrative expenses: The remaining 10% of franchise fees receipted to the
Cable Fund are used to offset administrative expenses related to the grant program,
cable television franchising issues, and information dissemination. For 2014, $83,000
has been budgeted in contracted services: $35k for a five year audit of franchise fees,
$20,000 for closed captioning and another $28,000 related to information dissemination,
supplies, advertising, copy costs, hardware and software. A n operating transfer of
$24,000 has been budgeted to reimburse the General Fund salary expenses associated
with the Cable Franchise and Cable Board, the processing the purchase orders relating
to grant awards, and general accounting functions related to the Cable Fund. Total
program expenses are anticipated to be $107,000 dollars.
