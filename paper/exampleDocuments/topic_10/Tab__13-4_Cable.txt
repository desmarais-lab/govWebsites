CABLE FUND
Mission Statement
The primary purpose of the cable fund is to enhance public, educational, and government access
television within the City of Fort Wayne, through the effective use of cable television franchise fee
receipts.
1. Effectively and efficiently administer the grant program.
2. Continually monitor the cable providerâ€™s compliance with the franchise agreement.
3. Respond to citizen complaints regarding cable television service and resolve any
cable television issues as quickly and equitably as possible.
General Information
These budgets represent 40% of the franchise fee revenues collected by Comcast
Cablevision and Verizon. The balance of the franchise receipts are deposited into the
General Fund and used to offset other City non-cable related operating expenses.
During year 2009, it is anticipated that $863,000 will be receipted to the Cable Fund and
$1,290,000 will be receipted to the General Fund. Franchise fee based disbursements
from the Cable Fund are allocated based on a formula, as established by ordinance G27-95.
The Cable Fund supports the four programs detailed below.
Access Originator grants: General ordinance G-27-95 stipulates that 80% of the cable
franchise fees receipted to the Cable Fund be disbursed, as recommended by the Cable
Fund Access Board, to the four access channel originators in our community: college
access television, operated by Indiana University/Purdue University; public access
Channel 55 and Channel 57, operated by the Allen County Public Library; government
access Channel 58, managed by the City of Fort Wayne with daily operations
subcontracted to the Allen County Public Library; and educational access Channel 54,
operated by Fort Wayne Community Schools. For 2009, it is estimated and budgeted
(166-006-ACTR) that each access originator will receive $159,300, for a total program
budget of $637,200 dollars.
Non-access originator grants: G-27-95 also specifies that 10% of franchise fees
receipted to the Cable Fund be available as grants to not-for-profit organizations located
within Fort Wayne that do not originate an access station, for the purpose of enhancing
local access. These grants can be used in a variety of ways, as long as it relates to
access television and/or enhancing public access. These grants can be used to
reimburse personnel expenses, overhead costs, production costs, operation expenses,
and equipment expenses. For 2009, $80,000 has been budgeted (166-006-NFPG) for
these grants.
City administrative expenses: The remaining 10% of franchise fees receipted to the
Cable Fund are used to offset administrative expenses related to the grant program,
cable television franchising issues, and information dissemination. For 2009, $15,200
has been budgeted for contracted services related to information dissemination; $1,000
has been budgeted for supplies, advertising, copy costs, hardware and software. An
operating transfer of $45,000 has been budgeted to reimburse the General Fund salary
expenses associated with the administration of the Cable Fund and associated with web
maintenance activities. Total program expenses are anticipated to be $61,200 dollars.
