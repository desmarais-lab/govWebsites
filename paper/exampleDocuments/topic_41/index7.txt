Every piece of land in the City of Gary is zoned. Zoning regulates what types
of uses are allowable for that property, and is based on what is proposed by
the Cityâ€™s Comprehensive Plan. Through zoning, the department is able to
serve the community by:
    * Protecting against land use hazards in the interest of public health and
      safety;
    * Controlling the use of land to prevent adverse effects to neighboring
      properties;
    * Steering the character of development and uses allowed within specific
      zoning districts;
    * Managing density;
    * Conserving the taxable value of land and buildings in the city;
    * Clarifying community priorities for existing and future development.
Please contact the Zoning Administrator for zoning and land use information at
(219) 881-1332.
