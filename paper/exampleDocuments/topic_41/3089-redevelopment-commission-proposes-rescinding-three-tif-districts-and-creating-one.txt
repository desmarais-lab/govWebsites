   2. REDEVELOPMENT COMMISSION PROPOSES RESCINDING THREE TIF DISTRICTS AND
      CREATING ONE

CREATING_ONE ******


July 26, 2016 - The Fort Wayne Redevelopment Commission is proposing that City
Council rescind three TIF districts (officially known as Economic Development
Areas) and create one Riverfront-Columbia TIF district. The proposals will be
introduced to City Council this evening.
The three areas to be rescinded include the Washington Center Coldwater Road
district, the Moeller Meyer Road district and the Baker Street district. TIF,
or tax increment financing, districts are set up to assist in the development
of a designated area. They allow any new property tax revenue generated by
increases in assessed value within that area to be used for public
infrastructure projects. 
The Washington Center Coldwater Road TIF district was set up to fund
infrastructure improvements near the I-69 interchange which are now complete,
and no increment was collected for any projects in the other two districts. 
‚ÄúTax Increment Financing is an important tool needed for infrastructure
projects that support redevelopment and help increase assessed value throughout
our city,‚Äù said Nancy Townsend, executive director of the Fort Wayne
Redevelopment Commission. ‚ÄúThe Redevelopment Commission is demonstrating
responsible management of TIF districts by regularly evaluating them and
recommending rescission when appropriate.‚Äù
The proposed Riverfront-Columbia TIF district would support infrastructure
development near the Riverfront Fort Wayne and The Landing projects. The
district would include areas on the south side of the St. Marys River, bounded
roughly by Calhoun and Harrison streets to the east and west, Berry Street to
the south and the river to the north.
The resolutions calling for the rescission of the TIF districts and the
creation of the Riverfront-Columbia district have already been approved by the
Fort Wayne Redevelopment Commission and the Fort Wayne Plan Commission. If
approved by City Council, they will go back to the Redevelopment Commission for
final adoption in October 2016.
