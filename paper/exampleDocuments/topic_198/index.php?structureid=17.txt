***** Law Department *****
You are here:Home|Departments|Law Department
The Department of Law is staffed with three full-time attorneys and one
paralegal.  The Corporation Counsel is the head of the Department.  The
Department serves primarily in a support role within the city organization, and
the attorneys in the Department are responsible for providing legal counsel and
representation to public officials, employees, boards, and commissions of the
City relating to the affairs of municipal government.  The attorneys in the
Department specifically provide the following services:
    * Represent the City in most litigation matters where the City of Elkhart
      is a party, except matters handled by our insurance counsel;
    * Prosecute violators of city ordinances;
    * Prepare, review, or revise ordinances, resolutions, contracts, deeds,
      easements, pleadings, briefs, motions, memoranda, correspondence, and
      other documents for the City and its departments, boards, commissions,
      and other agencies;
    * Collect fines, fees, damages and other monies owed to the City; and
    * Provide advice to and represent management in the labor and employment
      context.
The goal of the Department is to provide competent, cost-effective and timely
legal counsel and representation to all of the internal clients served by one
or more of the full-time attorneys.
