NEWS RELEASE
Mayor Dick Moore announced today the City of Elkhart is blessed to have many
fine old and historical buildings. One of those is the Depot at Tyler and Second Street.
But for many years now the only way to see the building was out of a side window or a
rearview mirror. The Mayor stated “when we can, we need to make the changes that
allow us to get the best view of these buildings that we have preserved and have great
architectural value and make our City even more of an attraction for us and our
visitors”.
Today’s City planners are telling us to do away with our one-way streets as they
do not serve the best interest of the people and do not support business interest. Elkhart
started this process when making Harrison Street two-way and while not a big change it
was an improvement in our traffic pattern downtown. The City will now proceed with
the next conversion back to two-way. Second Street between Harrison and Tyler and
Tyler from Second to Main will be converted back to two way traffic. The change will
improve traffic flow around the Post Office and allow for a frontal view of the Depot.
