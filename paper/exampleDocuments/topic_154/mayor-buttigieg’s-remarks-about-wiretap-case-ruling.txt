****** MAYOR BUTTIGIEG‚ÄôS REMARKS ABOUT WIRETAP CASE RULING ******

In January 2012, a few weeks after taking office, I learned of a situation in
which police officers were allegedly recorded in violation of the Federal
Wiretap Act. Cassette tapes were made of these recordings. I did not then, and
do not now, know what is on those tapes.
Because of rumors about the content of the recordings, I came under enormous
pressure to release these cassette tapes. The Common Council issued a subpoena
to try to force the administration to give them copies of the tapes. We did not
do so, because I was concerned that doing so might be illegal. Instead, we
turned to the courts.
Today, a federal judge confirmed our concerns. The judge issued a decision that
the recordings made after February 4, 2011 are ‚Äúillegal under the Act‚Äù and
‚Äúprohibited from disclosure.‚Äù This means that there is no way to satisfy
all the Council‚Äôs demands without breaking federal law.
Today‚Äôs ruling makes it clear that all but one of the cassette recordings
created by former Chief Boykins and Ms. DePaepe, and subpoenaed by Common
Council, were illegal and violated the Wiretap Act. Making them was illegal.
Listening to them would be illegal. Copying them would be illegal. And
disclosing them would be illegal.
Under this decision, the only exception that we are aware of is one
conversation allegedly recorded on February 4, 2011, on one cassette, referred
to in footnote 2 of the decision. Our attorneys will be reviewing this to
confirm how it can be lawfully and promptly turned over to the Council.¬ 
I do not see this as a matter of the administration winning or the Council
losing. It is helpful to know that we did not waste everyone‚Äôs time and money
by resisting pressure to do something unlawful.
The toughest thing about this situation is that people in the community will
remain curious about what is on the tapes. I am curious too. But we cannot
violate federal law just to satisfy our curiosity.
And we must remember that listening to the tapes would not have completely
answered community concerns.
The truth is that this is not just about some cassette tapes. This is about
issues much deeper, and those issues deserve to be taken seriously. Communities
across America are struggling with deep concerns about the role of race in the
criminal justice system. And as long as there is mistrust between members of
our community and the men and women in uniform whose job is to keep us all
safe, we have work to do.
The fact that some people believe police officers in this community are capable
of racism‚Äîeven the existence of that perception‚Äîis itself something that we
must address, and we have to do it together.
We know that there are police officers who serve every day with courage and
integrity, risking their lives to keep us safe. We also know that some in the
community do not feel they can trust the police. Our entire country is facing
that problem, and South Bend is no exception.
No one can rest until there is both a perception and an undisputed reality that
racial bias is not practiced or tolerated anywhere, especially on our police
force.
Moving toward that future will not be easy. But I am committed to doing
whatever it takes to make that happen. All of us‚Äîadministration, Council
members, community leaders, police officers, faith community, neighbors, even
the media‚Äîall of us have to work together on this so that we can share a life
of safety, justice, and harmony.
