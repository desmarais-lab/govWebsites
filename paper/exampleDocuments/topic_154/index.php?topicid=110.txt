***** County Labor Statistics *****
Much like the rest of the country, the recession of 2008-2009 hit Tipton hard. 
But, just like the character of its people, the Labor Force of Tipton County is
tough and resilient.  Tipton County ranks 4th in the entire state when it comes
to the 5-year change in employment, a true testament to our commitment of
getting locals back to work.  However, there remains plenty of work to be done
as we look to employee the remaining skilled, hard workers left looking for
work in Our county.
