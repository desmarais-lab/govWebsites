PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT
From: Richmond Sanitary District
Contact: LuAnne Holeva, Conservation Education Coordinator
For use: Immediately through January 31, 2013

PSA: Out with the old and in with the new
Now that the holidays are over you may have new things. It might be time to go
through the cupboards and closets and clear out some of your unused items.
Many items that you no longer need may still have lots of good wear left in them.
Consider taking clothes you no longer wear that are in good shape to a thrift
store, charity, or church clothes closet for others to use. Perhaps you have extra
patio furniture, a ping pong table stuffed away in the garage, or even a stereo
system that still works that just takes up space. Consider selling them or
donating the items to a group that would use them. By choosing to pass on
items in good condition rather than tossing them out you save space in our
landfill and give someone else the opportunity to get some good use out of them.
Keep on Reducing, Reusing, and Recycling!
If you are in Richmond and need a container for your recyclable materials call
the Richmond Sanitary District at 765-983-7450 and request a blue Richie Roller
for your curbside pickup.
