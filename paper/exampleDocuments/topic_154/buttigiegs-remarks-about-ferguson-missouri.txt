****** BUTTIGIEG'S REMARKS ABOUT FERGUSON, MISSOURI ******

**** Mayor Pete ButtigiegÂ shared comments about the grand jury decision in
Ferguson, Missouri. What he said about Ferguson, as read at peace vigil in
downtown South Bend on November 26: ****
This evening, residents of South Bend are gathering to express their concern
and solidarity with the people of Ferguson, Missouri. Earlier this week, a
grand jury decided that there would not be charges against the police officer
who fatally shot Michael Brown in August. Â 
Under our system of laws, the grand jury has the last word on that legal
matter. But the decision does not speak to the deeper concerns that have made
this such a painful national issue. The tragedy in Ferguson exposed deep
divisions in our country. Many in our communities, especially minorities, have
come to view this as another example of a system that does not treat them
fairly and that pushes some young men into a cycle of punishment and poverty.
Meanwhile, law enforcement officers have spoken out about their own ability to
be treated fairly in situations where they may fear for their lives while doing
a job all residents count on them to do.
Whenever there is a great tragedy, especially a morally challenging one, it
calls on all of us to decide how we will use the light of knowledge to become
better than we were. We cannot change what happened in Ferguson, but we can
decide what will happen in South Bend. I join you in seeking, praying, and most
importantly, working for a world in which everyone who cares about a safe
community knows and feels that we are all on the same side. Until there is
authentic trust between every member of our community and everyone who works to
keep them safe, we have moreÂ work do to.
The future does not belong to the prejudiced and the hostile. It belongs to men
and women of good faith who embrace the honest and sometimes painful dialog
that it takes to build real and lasting trust. South Bend is made of just this
kind of people, people of good will and deep purpose. Our cityâ€™s leadership
is committed to work with all who seek constructive ways forward so that we can
break free from the wrongs of the past and live in solidarity with one another,
building a future we can all believe in.
