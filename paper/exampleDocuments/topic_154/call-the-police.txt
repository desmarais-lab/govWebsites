   1. Call the Police



****** ï»¿Call_the_Police ******


[pdf]Sample_Letter
If you have done all of the above and your neighbor has responded by turning up
the volume, now is the time to call the police. Try to get the police to come
while the problem is occurring. However, don't be surprised if the police do
not give this problem the priority that you do. They are often very busy with
community problems that are a higher priority.
Of course, you can call the police the first time the problem occurs. But the
police will be more sympathetic to your situation if they see that you have
tried to solve the problem on your own. And if you have documented the nature
and severity of the problem.
