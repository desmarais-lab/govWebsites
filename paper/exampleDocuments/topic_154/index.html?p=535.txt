By Chief Martin McCoy, Auburn Police Department
After 20 years in public service, Iâ€™m convinced that effective community
policing depends on strong relationships. Police officers need to know their
community well. Likewise, they need to be known by residents and business
owners.
Starting this month, weâ€™re launching a new program to integrate officers into
the community even more. Every officer, on every shift, is now assigned to one
of_five_areas_in_the_community. On top of their daily police work throughout
Auburn, officers will spend as much time as possible in their assigned area,
becoming familiar with neighborhood names, faces, vehicles, pets and daily
activities. By focusing on a specific part of our community, our police
officers will be better equipped to know when something or someone is out of
placeâ€”just like a good neighbor. Likewise, we believe this effort will help
you know our police force better as we partner together to maintain a safe and
secure community.
Donâ€™t be surprised if an officer knocks on your door or approaches you at a
park to make an introduction. We intend to reach out to citizens and get to
know as many people as possible. Even more, weâ€™ll be keeping an eye on issues
that need addressed, such as streetlights that need replaced, potholes that
need attention, or abandoned homes and vehicles, for example.
This really is an extension of what we already do on a daily basis. But now,
weâ€™re being more deliberate and concerted in our efforts to develop strong
community relationships. And we believe this will help us provide better
service as we strive to reduce crime and improve the quality of life for
everyone who lives and works in Auburn. We hope youâ€™ll agree.
In the coming year, weâ€™ll be reaching out to people weâ€™ve served for
feedback on how we can continue to improve. If you receive a survey, weâ€™d
appreciate your input. It helps us better understand the needs of citizens and
how we can address those needs. You can also complete the survey online any
time at the Auburn_Police_Department_Resources_web_page. You can sign up for e-
mail alerts, report a tip and find many other forms and services there as well.
Thank you for the opportunity to serve this community. We care about it as much
as every citizen and business that has chosen to establish roots here.
Together, weâ€™ll help maintain it as a place where you can feel good about
raising a family, starting a business and being involved each day.
