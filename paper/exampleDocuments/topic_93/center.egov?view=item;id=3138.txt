aka:
the

T. O. M. P.

What is a TOMP?
A plan that specifies the toxic organic compounds used,
the method of disposal used (instead of being
discharged into wastestreams) and procedures for
ensuring that toxic organics do not routinely spill or leak
into wastewater discharged to the POTW or surface
waters.

Do you analyze or certify for
TTO?
If you Certify…Pay Attention!

Does everyone need a TOMP?
No, just those in the following categories:
413

or…
Anyone we determine should have one
Why?

In a Nutshell…


If you choose to analyze, you must do so at the frequency stated in your
permit and submit those results with your Self‐Monitoring Reports;



If you choose to certify, you must submit a T.O.M.P. along with a
complete analysis;



A certification statement must be submitted each time your permit
indicates you need to report TTOs;



A new analysis and an updated T.O.M.P. must be submitted with each
permit renewal;



If TTOs are ever detected above the limit, you CANNOT Certify in the
future;



Only TTOs that are reasonably expected to be present must be analyzed.
