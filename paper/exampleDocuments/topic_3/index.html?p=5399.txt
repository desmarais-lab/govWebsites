¬ Third program concludes McBarnes administration‚Äôs current 200-Day Plan
Frankfort, Ind. ‚ÄìWrapping up the City‚Äôs third Neighborhood Connection
Program, Mayor Chris McBarnes and the leaders of the City‚Äôs Police, Fire,
Building Services, Parks and Street Departments will host an informal meeting
for residents in Frankfort‚Äôs northwest quadrant at Circle Park October 8 from
6:00 ‚Äì 7:00 p.m.
This event also bookmarks the conclusion of the McBarnes administration‚Äôs
current 200-Day Plan as it is the last day of the Plan‚Äôs time period.
Neighbors who visit Circle Park that evening can check out the Fire
Department‚Äôs equipment, visit with the Mayor, department heads and Recycle
Man, sign up for various free City programs, including Safer Seniors (free home
safety inspections for senior citizens) and Neighbors Helping Neighbors
(available for any senior citizens or physically challenged residents who need
help with yard and exterior home repairs). Information on recycling, bicycle
registrations and the Property Watch Program will be available as well.
According to the Mayor, the Neighborhood Connection Program has three main
parts, beginning with a public safety focus with the Fire Department conducting
Smoke Detector Blitzes and the Police Department hosting a community meeting
for area residents.
     ‚ÄúThe second phase of each Program is a blitz of City services in
     the selected section of the City, including street sweeping and alley
     clean-up by Street Department crews, saturation patrols and extra
     community intervention (talking with neighbors) by Frankfort police,
     property clean up by Building Services staff and park clean up by
     Parks Department crews.
     ‚ÄúWe wrap up each program with a Neighborhood Connection meeting
     with area residents to share the progress made in their neighborhoods
     and have informal conversations between area residents and department
     heads and myself to answer questions and hear suggestions and
     concerns about the need for additional improvements,‚Äù McBarnes
     said.
Launched last fall in the northwest quadrant of the City, the Neighborhood
Connection Program provides extra attention to infrastructure needs, safety and
quality of life problem areas. Due to the need for continued improvements in
this section of the community, City officials returned their focus to this
area, having held the spring/summer Neighborhood Connection initiative in the
southwest quadrant.
Any Frankfort resident is welcome to attend the October 8 event, but
information shared by City leaders will be specific to the northwest quadrant.
The Neighborhood Connection Program is a part of three of the
administration‚Äôs four cornerstones: Neighborhood Revitalization,
Communications and Citizen Voice.
Circle Park is located at 1355 West Kyger Street.
