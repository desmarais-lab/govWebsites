Frankfort, Ind. –Wrapping up the City’s fourth Neighborhood Connection
Program, Mayor Chris McBarnes and the leaders of the City’s Police, Fire,
Building Services, Parks and Street Departments will host an informal meeting
for residents in Frankfort’s northeast quadrant at East Side Park (Lawrence
Ferrell Park) Thursday, July 21 from 6:00 – 7:00 p.m.
Neighbors who visit East Side Park that evening can check out the Fire
Department’s equipment, visit with the Mayor and department heads, sign up
for various free City programs including Safer Seniors (free home safety
inspections for senior citizens) and Neighbors Helping Neighbors (available for
any senior citizens or physically challenged residents who need help with yard
and exterior home repairs).
According to the Mayor, each Neighborhood Connection Program has three main
parts, beginning with a public safety focus with the Fire Department conducting
Smoke Detector Blitzes and the Police Department hosting a community meeting
for area residents, this time in May of this year.
     “The second phase of each Program is a blitz of City services in
     the selected section of the City, including street sweeping and alley
     clean-up by Street Department crews, saturation patrols and extra
     community intervention (talking with neighbors) by Frankfort police,
     property clean up by Building Services staff and park clean up by
     Parks Department crews.
     “We wrap up each program with a Neighborhood Connection meeting
     with area residents to share the progress made in their neighborhoods
     and have informal conversations between area residents and department
     heads and myself to answer questions and hear suggestions and
     concerns about the need for additional improvements,” McBarnes
     said.
Launched in 2014 in the northwest quadrant of the City, the Neighborhood
Connection Program provides extra attention to infrastructure needs, safety and
quality of life problem areas. Any Frankfort resident is welcome to attend the
July 21 event, but information shared by City leaders will be specific to the
northeast quadrant.
The Neighborhood Connection Program is a part of three of the
administration’s four cornerstones: Neighborhood Revitalization,
Communications and Citizen Voice.
East Side Park is located near Fudge Avenue and North Maish Road.
