Event kicks off third Neighborhood Connection Program
Frankfort, Ind. –Kicking off the City’s third Neighborhood Connection
Program, Frankfort Police will hold their next community meeting on Tuesday,
August 11 from 6 – 7 p.m. in Circle Park at 1355 West Kyger Street.
Area residents are encouraged to attend to learn about the Police
Department’s work in this specific section of the community and share their
questions, concerns and ideas for improved safety and security in the northwest
quadrant of the City defined as the area north of West Clinton Street and west
of North Main Street.
In particular, residents are asked to report any vacant houses they are aware
of in their neighborhood so the Building Services team and police officers can
check on those properties. If it is raining that evening, the community meeting
will be postponed and rescheduled.
The Neighborhood Connection Program was launched last fall in the northwest
quadrant of the City to provide extra attention to infrastructure needs and
safety and quality of life problem areas. Due to the need for continued
improvements in that section of the community, City officials are returning
their focus to the northwest area, having held the spring/summer Neighborhood
Connection initiative in the southwest quadrant.
According to Mayor Chris McBarnes, the Neighborhood Connection Program has
three main parts, beginning with a public safety focus with the Fire Department
conducting a Smoke Detector Blitz (next one set for August 22) and the Police
Department hosting a community meeting for area residents.
     “The second phase of each Program is a blitz of City services in
     the selected section of the City, including street sweeping and alley
     clean-up by Street Department crews, saturation patrols and extra
     community intervention (talking with neighbors) by Frankfort police,
     property clean up by Building Services staff and park clean up by
     Parks Department crews.
     “We wrap up each program with a Neighborhood Connection meeting
     with area residents to share the progress made in their neighborhoods
     and have informal conversations between area residents and department
     heads and myself to answer questions and hear suggestions and
     concerns about the need for additional improvements,” McBarnes
     said.
The Neighborhood Connection Program meeting will be held Thursday, October 8
from 6 – 7 p.m. in Circle Park. This event also bookmarks the conclusion of
the McBarnes administration’s current 200-Day Plan as it is the last day of
the Plan’s time period.
Neighbors who visit Circle Park that evening can check out the Fire
Department’s equipment, visit with the Mayor, department heads and Recycle
Man, sign up for various free City programs, including Safer Seniors (free home
safety inspections for senior citizens) and Neighbors Helping Neighbors
(available for any senior citizens or physically challenged residents who need
help with yard and exterior home repairs). Information on recycling, bicycle
registrations and the Property Watch Program will be available as well.
Any Frankfort resident is welcome to attend either the August 11 or October 8
events, but information shared by City leaders will be specific to the
northwest quadrant.
The Neighborhood Connection Program is a part of three of the
administration’s four cornerstones: Neighborhood Revitalization,
Communications and Citizen Voice.
