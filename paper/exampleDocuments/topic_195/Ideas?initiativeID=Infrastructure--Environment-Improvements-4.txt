      My idea is not really an idea, just stepping up what the Americans With
      Disabilities Act has mandated Madison do to comply with the law. The
      items on the list(s) of Madison deficiencies should be completed in
      record time and well ahead of the schedule. It helps us all and that is
      what government is for. http://www.ada.gov/madison_pca/madison.htm
