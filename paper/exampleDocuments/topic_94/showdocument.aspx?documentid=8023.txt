FINDINGS OF FACT - SPECIAL EXCEPTION

1.

Docket No.:

_______________________________________________

Petitioner:

_______________________________________________

The approval will not be injurious to the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the community, in relation to
Ordinance, Section 21.3 (1-26) concerning the special exception because:
_______________________________________________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________________________________________

2.

The use and value of the area adjacent to the premises under consideration will not be affected in a substantially adverse
manner because:
________________________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________________________

3.

The need for the special exception arises from the applicant’s responsibility to provide public utility service, and not from any
condition peculiar to the premises under consideration because:
________________________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________________________

4.

It will constitute an unnecessary hardship for the applicant if the special exception is denied, in that there are no existing or
approved towers or other structures in the vicinity of the premises under consideration which would be suitable for the collation
of the equipment that the applicant needs to locate in such vicinity, having regard to the following factors
(a) Whether the needed equipment would exceed the structural capacity of such existing or approved towers or
structures, as documents by a qualified professional engineer, and whether such towers or structures could be
reinforced, modified, or replaced to accommodate the needed or equivalent equipment at a reasonable cost
(b) Whether the needed equipment would cause interference materially impacting the usability of existing or planned
equipment at such existing or approved towers or structures, as documented by a qualified professional
engineer, and whether such interference could be prevented at a reasonable cost (Please attach appropriate
statements)
________________________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________________________

5.

The approval of the special exception does not interfere substantially with the Comprehensive Plan, in that there are no
alternative sites suitable (having regard to the factors listed above in item 4 for the equipment that the applicant needs to
locate in the vicinity which are located either in Business, Industrial, or Manufacturing Districts, or on property outside of the
jurisdiction or otherwise exempt from the requirements and procedures of the Zoning Ordinance because:
________________________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________________________

DECISION
____Yes ____No: The Board has reviewed the requirements of Ordinance, Section 21.04.02 as they relate to this Special Exception,
and does not find that those criteria prevent the granting of the Special Exception.
IT IS THEREFORE the decision of the Carmel Board of Zoning Appeals that Special Exception Docket No. ____________________ is
granted, subject to any conditions stated in the minutes of this Board, which are incorporated herein by reference and made a part
hereof.
Adopted this _______ day of _____________________, 20 ____.
