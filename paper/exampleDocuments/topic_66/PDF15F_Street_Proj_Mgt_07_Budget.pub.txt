TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING SERVICES:
Street Project Management
Mission Statement
Street Project Management is a department within the Division of Public Works, Transportation
Engineering section. The mission of the Street Project Management Department is to plan, design and
implement the construction and repair of a safe and efficient transportation system within the City of Fort
Wayne.
The City Engineer directs the Street Project Management section of Transportation Engineering. The
duty of the City Engineer is to oversee the preparation of plans and specifications for the competitive
bidding of Capital Improvement Programs, Public Works Maintenance projects requiring engineering
expertise and all other improvement projects necessary for the safe, efficient and economical operation of
the Public Works Division of the City of Fort Wayne government.

Goals and Objectives
•

Plan, design, and construct neighborhood projects in the year they are planned for
construction.

It’s important to fulfill commitments for street, curb and walk improvements in the year those commitments
were made. This will be accomplished by beginning the design process earlier once projects have been
selected. This goal will strengthen our customer’s confidence in our services. In 2006, our project teams
will have designed and/or managed $6.5 million in transportation related projects. Our customers are the
citizens of Fort Wayne and their designated government representatives.
•

Maintain and update the Pavement Management System.

Keeping this database up to date will ensure we are concentrating on the infrastructure that needs the
most attention. The Pavement Management System will also help determine from year to year how well
we are accomplishing our goals and whether those goals should be re-evaluated. We update our system
by reassessing at least 1/3 of our total miles each year. In 2006, our staff assessed 533 miles.
This system is our tracking device to measure our success in improving the pavement condition citywide.
The overall system condition in 2005 was rated at 76 or in the “Good” condition category.
Our customers; the engineers, planners, government representatives, and the citizens of Fort Wayne, are
important to us and together we depend on this information to make sound decisions about
Transportation projects.
•
•

Assist the Street Maintenance Department in asphalt resurfacing over 45 miles of asphalt
roads and streets through contracted services.
As a goal, repair or reconstruct over 9 miles of concrete streets through contracted services.

It’s imperative to keep up with the pace of deterioration our infrastructure experiences each year. We
have determined these are miles of pavement that must be improved upon to keep the overall system
condition in the “Good” condition level. To meet our established goals, appropriate funding must be
dedicated towards transportation related infrastructure.
If we can provide a well-maintained transportation system, businesses will be attracted to Fort Wayne and
ultimately create new jobs. Our customers are the citizens of Fort Wayne who expect a safe and reliable
transportation system.

Long-term goals:
Our long-term goal is to provide a multi-year maintenance and repair plan, as well as an estimate, for
each street segment of the city.
In 2005, a new system of evaluating pavement condition using video, software, and GPS technology was
used to lower our internal costs to execute this task. Our long term goal is continue this system citywide.
The system’s software will help us develop a long term comprehensive strategy for our transportation
system.
