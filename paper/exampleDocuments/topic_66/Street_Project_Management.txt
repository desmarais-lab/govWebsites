TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING SERVICES:
Street Project Management
Mission Statement
Street Project Management is a department within the Division of Public Works, Transportation Engineering
section. The mission of the Street Project Management Department is to plan, design and implement the
construction and repair of a safe and efficient transportation system within the City of Fort Wayne.
The City Engineer directs the Street Project Management section of Transportation Engineering. The duty of
the City Engineer is to oversee the preparation of plans and specifications for the competitive bidding of
Capital Improvement Programs, Public Works Maintenance projects requiring engineering expertise and all
other improvement projects necessary for the safe, efficient and economical operation of the Public Works
Division of the City of Fort Wayne government.

Goals and Objectives


Plan, design, and construct neighborhood projects in the year they are planned for construction .

It’s important to fulfill commitments for street, curb and walk improvements in the year those commitments
were made. This will be accomplished by beginning the design process earlier once projects have been
selected. This goal will strengthen our customer’s confidence in our services. In 2012, our project teams will
have designed and/or managed roughly $7 million in transportation related projects. Our customers are the
citizens of Fort Wayne and their designated government representatives.


Maintain and update the Pavement Management System.

Keeping this database up to date will ensure we are concentrating on the infrastructure that needs the most
attention. The Pavement Management System will also help determine from year to year how well we are
accomplishing our goals and whether those goals should be re-evaluated. We update our system by
reassessing at least 1/3 of our total miles each year.
This system is our tracking device to measure our success in improving the pavement condition citywide. The
overall system condition in 2011 was rated in the “Good” condition category.
Our customers; the engineers, planners, government representatives, and the citizens of Fort Wayne, are
important to us and together we depend on this information to make sound decisions about Transportation
projects. Street Project management will



Assist the Street Maintenance Department in our calculated goal of asphalt resurfacing of 52
miles of asphalt roads and streets through contracted services.
Repair or reconstruct in our calculated goal of 10 miles of concrete streets through contracted
services.

It’s imperative to keep up with the pace of deterioration our infrastructure experiences each year. We have
determined these are miles of pavement that must be improved upon to keep the overall system condition in
the “Good” condition level. To meet our established goals, appropriate funding must be dedicated
towards transportation related infrastructure.
If we can provide a well-maintained transportation system, businesses will be attracted to Fort Wayne and
ultimately create new jobs. A well maintained system will also reduce our liability from accidents stemming
from poor pavement condition. Our customers are the citizens of Fort Wayne who expect a safe and reliable
transportation system.
