Mission Statement
The mission of the Flood Control Department is to ensure that property damage due to flooding is minimal
by the continual monitoring of the early flood warning system ensuring that it is operational; upgrading our
flood fighting strategies; maintaining our 14 plus miles of flood protection structures; and buying
properties in the floodplain mitigating flood damages and creating storage for flood waters.

Goals and Objectives

90

•

Fort Wayne/Allen County Flood Control Project
A s our flood control structures age; withstand significant flooding; and complying with the Army
Corps of Engineers more rigid standards, keeping maintenance costs at a minimum will be a
challenge in the coming years. Our department has and will continue to use smaller experienced
contractors to repair/rehabilitate the flood control structures. This will allow us to effectively
preserve and maintain our structures for the protection of Fort Wayne residents and keep
maintenance costs at a minimum.

•

Federal Grants
Flood Control continues to oversee the administration of three approved federal grants to acquire
and demolish residential and commercial properties and remove them from the
floodplain/floodway. Flood Control is nearly complete in acquiring properties in the Junk Ditch
and St. Mary's River area. Goal is always to look for federal funding opportunities.

9

Community Rating System Program
The goal of the Federal C R S Program is to encourage, by the use of flood insurance premium
adjustments, Fort Wayne outreach activities beyond those required by the NFIP, saving citizens
10% a year on flood insurance premiums.

»

Upgraded Early Flood Warning System
The Flood Control Department expanded its early flood warning system from 16 to 32 sites. The
data from this system is critical to the National Weather Service for flood watches, warnings and
crest predictions during a flood. This system was designed to be used by other City
Departments, outside agencies and smaller communities in this area. Flood Control has
budgeted to maintain the 32 sites to continue communicating as designed and for additional
sensors to be added to the system for its expanded use.
