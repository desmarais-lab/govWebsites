Enhance Access Review Committee Meeting Minutes
Waivers:
City County Council Legislation Management System:
CCC is in the process of implementing a new Legislation Management System which will include all aspects
of the way CCC does business. This new system will house everything from ordinances, agendas, meeting
minutes, vote tallies, council member attendance and voting records. Much of this information should be
made public and is the responsibility of the CCC Clerk’s office to produce and distribute this information.
As a part of the system, the vendor will create a public facing portal allowing constituents the ability to
access selected CCC data. The public will be able to search indexed CCC activities via the portal that will
have the same look and feel as the current indy.gov website. Along with the public facing portal, ISA will
stand up a virtual server containing selected data replication for the public to access in the DMZ. This
configuration is ideal as to not expose the production data and enterprise network to security risks. The
cost of the server is included in the request amount.
Many of the agencies within the City-County government rely on our public facing website to provide
information about the organization, provide information about services offered, and announce events.
This public facing access portal will enable Indianapolis residents the ability to access digital City-County
Council information anywhere, anytime and on any device.
Notes
 Vendor Web Portal:
$17,000
 ISA Hardware:

Total Amount Requested: $23,000
Mr. Brett Wineinger made a motion to approve the City County Council Legislation Management System in
an amount not to exceed Twenty Three Thousand Dollars and Zero Cents ($23,000.00). The motion was
seconded by Ms. Kate Sweeney-Bell and the motion passed unanimously.

Stakeholders
The primary stakeholder in this project is the Department of Public Safety. Business
Requirements are defined and approved by the following DPS personnel:



Laura White - Executive Director Citizens Police Complaint Office (Sign-off
Approval Required)
Valerie Washington – Directors Office (Sign-off Approval Required)

Lastly, the Business Services Consultant will help facilitate in the creation of business
requirements and communication between Department of Public Safety and the
Application Services team.

Business Requirements/Overview
The Department of Public Safety would like to have a Public Portal created to display the
latest goals and initiatives. This will need to be a view only version for both the internet
(http://www.indy.gov/eGov/City/dps/Pages/home.aspx) and intranet pages for the DPS
goal and objectivies. The current portal is only accessible for people who have access
to the internal site (https://portal.indy.gov/sites/DPS/Dashboard/SitePages/Home.aspx).
The data is already provided to the public in other ways however DPS would like to be
able to supply this information via a web page portal. The data and the way it is
displayed is the way the DPS would like this information displayed internally and
externally. There should be a tab for each division that will be viewable to the public.
This should be done when the customer clicks on or selects the different departments
the data should change to the data for that department.

Scope
The scope of this project will include creating a Public Portal for DPS.
Objectives
1. Create a Dashboard to display the latest goals and objectives for all Public
Safety Divisions.
2. Once the dashboard has been created the Applications team will need to make
the dashboard viewable on the Internet and the Intranet.

Department of Public Safety
* Eight divisions
* 3,200 employees
* Annual budget of nearly $500 million

Eight divisions, working

DPS Dashboard
The DPS Dashboard is an electronic tool created by a
collaboration by DPS and Marian University’s A-Team
students for each public safety agency to:
• Track budgets
• Staffing
• Special projects
• Divisional Goals and Objectives

DPS Dashboard
The DPS Dashboard is currently housed on a SharePoint intranet site with limited access by division chiefs
and assigned staff members. The current portal is only accessible for people who have access to the internal
site (https://portal.indy.gov/sites/DPS/Dashboard/SitePages/Home.aspx).
The Department of Public Safety would like to have a Public Portal created to display the latest goals and
initiatives. This will need to be a view only version for both the internet
(http://www.indy.gov/eGov/City/dps/Pages/home.aspx) and intranet pages for the DPS goal and objectives.
