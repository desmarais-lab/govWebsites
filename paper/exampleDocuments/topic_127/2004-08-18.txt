Monthly Highlights and Statistics
July 2004
From the Account
Manager’s Desk
Continuing the cyclical patterns of
the last few years, July was a slow
month. However, of particular note is the completion of
some critical interfaces to the new CRM system.
Additionally, ACS began the development of a new
Administration System for the Public Defender’s office.
In August the City/County will announce the award of
the IT Outsourcing contract. At that time ACS will
begin work with the new vendor and ISA to develop a
services transition plan. Our goal and commitment will
be to not only assist in a smooth and transparent
transition of services, but to maintain the high level of
services the City/County has come to expect from ACS
over the last several years.

By ensuring proper legal addressing, staff will be able to
build histories by address in order to better troubleshoot
and resolve issues as well as keep neighborhoods better
informed using CRM, Hansen, Tidemark and Animal
Control data.
This project completes a major hurdle in the City’s race
to provide excellent customer service to its constituents.
The MAC, DPW, DMD, Animal Control, ISA and ACS
can be proud of their outstanding teamwork in achieving
this success.

Constituent Relationship Management
(CRM) Continues to Grow
We reported last month that the Mayor's Action Center
(MAC) implemented their new CRM Siebel application
on June 21st.
Plans were in place to implement
interfaces with Hansen, Tidemark and Chameleon in
July. Now, we are happy to report all are successfully
complete!
The Hansen/Siebel interface was
implemented on July 7th, the Tidemark/Siebel interface
was implemented on July 12th, and the Chameleon/Siebel
interface was implemented on July 13th. This means that
the MAC, DPW, DMD and Animal Control are sharing
information automatically through their software
applications improving efficiency and accuracy for all
parties involved.
In 2003 there were 42,418 requests received by DPW
from the MAC. Over 40,000 (95%) of these contained
incompatible addresses, which required almost 1,700
DPW staff hours for manual verification. The need for
manual address verification on these requests has been
eliminated via the Hansen/Master Address/CRM
integration.
Both DPW and Parks will benefit from improved
mapping abilities within GIS, saving staff hours in
producing maps. A pre-Hansen/Master Address/CRM
map required approximately 12 staff hours to complete
whereas a post-Hansen/Master Address/CRM map
requires approximately 1 hour to complete.

Monthly Highlights and Statistics
July 2004

As reported in last month’s issue, the Mayor’s Action Center
literally “threw the switch” to begin using the new CRM
system. Of course, ACS Business Consultants Jill Weirick and
Kathy Fluke coordinated the acceptance testing.

Public Defender to Get New
Administration System
ACS subcontractor Sterling Creek Software has begun
development on this project. As of the end of July, they
had completed the general architecture design (including
the Windows Framework implementation), migration of
the existing Access data to Oracle and the development
of the stored procedure framework. They are currently
working is on the development of report framework and
security model.
The development and testing of the Direct Payment
Voucher form is almost complete. This is the most
complex form and a majority of the code supporting it
will be used as a template for the remaining forms.

Page 1

The primary driver for the City/County head end reengineering project was to ensure the continuing
viability of all connections for the City/County Wide
Area Network (WAN) in response to growth in the
number of remote locations served. As a secondary
benefit, the re-engineering provided solid
connectivity to the IPD Training Academy which
serves as an alternate business continuity site for
City /County employees in the event of a disaster
that would prevent access or use of the City/County
Building.

The client has identified additional requirements which
include: a change in telephone operations file format and
a new form to process and track encumbrance document
reference numbers in vouchers.
In addition, Public Defender Administration will start
using ADPICS for purchase orders in January 2005. A
project status and review meeting is scheduled for the
August 4, 2004. Sterling will demonstrate what has been
completed at that time as well as discuss upcoming tasks
and deliverables.

This project minimized circuit and hardware costs,
as well as administrative overhead by reducing the
number of devices that must be purchased and
managed at the core facility. Additionally, it eased
problem identification, isolation, and resolution by
minimizing the complexity and number of
components required to facilitate communication
between all locations.

Applications Service Request Summary
The Application Services group continued to focus
heavily on Maintenance and Support requests during the
month of May.
A total of 42 Application Services
requests were closed during the month, while 57 new
requests were opened. A table showing the breakdown

Major Technical
Project Updates
The following projects were
addressed during the month and
their current status is presented.
Improved Infrastructure and Processes
•

Head End Re-engineering Project Completed

Monthly Highlights and Statistics
July 2004

In addition to the above benefits realized by this reengineering, the City/County redundant core, which
was previously located within the City/County
Building, was re-located to the alternate facility.
This was done to provide isolation from
environmental (flood, fire, power outage, and Acts
of God) and malicious events (biohazard infection,
terrorist threats, etc.), thereby, increasing the
resilience of the network infrastructure.
Also, as part of the design, steps were taken to
isolate all non-City/County agencies requiring
connectivity to the City/County Enterprise by
consolidating them onto an “external agency” head
end, which in turn was re-directed to force them
through the Enterprise firewall.
•

The Parks Department expanded its facility and
services at the Municipal Park site located at 1831
Lafayette Road. The ACS Communications team
facilitated the acquisition of a new high-speed DS1
data circuit with Voice Over IP (VOIP) capabilities,
replacing an older, much slower DS0 frame relay
circuit, and installed a new router and switch along
with adding new data and phone wiring for the
expansion. The upgrade to the infrastructure
provides faster connection speed to the City/County
network, greater reliability as well as potential for
future growth.

Mainframe Support Efforts
The ACS Mainframe Systems team removed the data
files associated with the obsolete OS/390 operating
system from the EMC storage devices. The removal of

Page 2

this software returned six DASD volumes to the online
storage pool allowing that storage to be used for future
data storage purposes and for future upgrades to the
operating system software environment, freeing up
valuable City/County storage resources.
The ACS Systems group successfully implemented
Network Print Facility (NPF) procedures into the
mainframe environment during the month of July. NPF
imposes proactive measures in the production of
mainframe reports on network laser printers. Periodic
monitoring by NPF identifies printing failures before
being noticed by customers and allows for the resolution
of those failures. This monitoring provides improved
reliability in the production of reports to network
printers. Significant reduction in NPF error recovery
processing time translates into improvement in
processing performance by NPF.
Security Improvement Efforts
On July 13, 2004, Microsoft released new critical
security patches due to known vulnerabilities. The ACS
server team downloaded these patches and tested them
via the Novell Application Launcher (NAL) on
designated City/County desktops. Over the course of a
week, testing of the updates proved successful and the
patches were then installed via the NAL to all
City/County desktops. This effort is part of the
continuing commitment by ACS to prevent attacks on
the City/County network.
Server Improvement Efforts
The ACS server team successfully completed the
migration of all City/County Novell print queues from
server IMCIS9 to server IMCIS1 during the month of
July. Migration to the new server provides faster
processing and more memory. This consolidates all
City/County Building print queues onto one server,
simplifying administrative efforts and concludes the
upgrade of all Novell Servers to version 6.0.
The ACS server team successfully completed a ninemonth project of upgrading all Novell servers from
version 5.1 operating system to 6.0. NetWare 6 delivers
higher availability and security with file storage,
printing, directory services, email and database resources
that can be accessed as one network across the
City/County’s Intranet and public Internet. The upgrade
provides solutions that simplify administration
responsibilities while at the same time increasing the
efficiency of the end user. Several new products that are
included with NetWare 6 help end users synchronize and
access their files from any location with the

implementation of NetStorage, accessed from a web
browser via the web site http://mydata.indygov.org.
In response to a request by the Marion County Public
Defender Agency, the ACS server team successfully
replaced the Public Defender’s In/Out database with a
new Gatekeeper application. The new SQL database
replaces an older Microsoft Access database and
provides greater performance capabilities for the end
user.
As a prerequisite for the upgrade to NetWare 6.5, the
ACS server team completed an upgrade of the Novell
eDirectory from version 8.7.0.3 to version 8.7.3.1. This
upgrade also fixes administration issues that have been
known to cause problems in the City/County enterprise.
Novell eDirectory is the central database for
administrating security for local, wireless, Internet VPN
(Virtual Private Network) and web sites using
authenticating
and
accessing
permissions
for
City/County programs and files. The upgrade provides
greater reliability and stability for the eDirectory
services.

Monthly Statistics from
the Help Desk
During the month of July, 4,592
calls were presented to the Help
Desk of which 3,530 were handled
by the daytime Help Desk and 848
were received by our after-hours operation. 214 calls
were terminated before the Help Desk had a chance to
answer the call. The average time to answer a customer’s
call was 21 seconds, and 91.6% of prime time calls were
answered in less than 60 seconds
Of those calls, 626 turned out to be technical problems.
ACS closed 639 problem calls during the month and
achieved a first call resolution of 87.9%. This means that
87.9% of those who called with a problem had their issue
resolved by the time they hung up the phone.
ACS processed 469 security requests during the month.
226 involved changes to security profiles, there were 71
deletions of various access rights and 172 new access
rights were granted. ACS also closed 203 service

Network Communications
•

Conversion of network connections to the new OC3
will continue in August for the “external” sites that
have access to the City County network.

Monthly Highlights and Statistics
July 2004

The ACS server team will begin the upgrade of
NetWare to version 6.5. The latest version has been
proven to be a very stable and feature-rich
environment with improvements from previous
releases of NetWare. Improvements include Open
Source Support and NetWare Virtual Office for
NetStorage. The project begins in August and will
continue for several months to complete the upgrade
on the thirty-five Novell servers.

Mid-range group

Looking Ahead to August

The ACS Communications Group has new WAN
links and/or new remote sites currently underway at
several sites. The Drug Treatment Court is
considering a move to a new location and we are
awaiting their decision of which site they will
choose. They may be able to use existing fiber
communications infrastructure if they choose to
move into the 251 E. Ohio St. building. The Public
Defender’s offices at the Juvenile Center are to be
moved pending City-County Council approval to a
new site and walk-throughs at that site have already
been conducted. Both of these sites will require new
data and voice wiring, along with new network
equipment planning and installation.
We await
funding approval on both sites.
IFD Fire Prevention is moving from their existing
location to The Julia Carson government center at
300 E. Fall Creek Blvd. Network communications
will have SBC install a new frame relay circuit, and
is coordinating with vendors for data and voice
cabling installation, and required network hardware.

There are several software upgrades that will take
place in the existing SAN for the Sun environment.
Those upgrades include the following:
o EMC Support Matrix - This software allows for
better reporting to the EMC customer support
staff in resolving issues.
o EMC Control Center to 5.2 - The current
version, 5.1.1 needs to resolve minor issues.
o EMC StorageScope to 5.2 - This software needs
to be upgraded at the time that EMC Control
Center is upgraded because they rely upon each
other.
o EMC PowerPath to 4.2 - This software is
running on the Oracle servers to allow
redundant connectivity between the servers
using 2 HBAs and the EMC Symmetrix storage.
In addition, the upgrade will add volume
management not previously available.

CIVICNET HIGHLIGHTS
Reminder:
Financial data is now being reported on a one-month delay. This means that
financials for July 2004 will be detailed in the report distributed in September.

The CivicNet team has made significant progress in development
and deployment of services for projects with our city/county
agency partners.

July at a Glance

Transactions ...............................30,609
Subscribers...................................2,382

The Marion County Court staff and Marion County Clerk’s
office have submitted the completed court surveys. The
CivicNet marketing department is evaluating the surveys and
will present the findings along with recommendations to the
Enhanced Access Review Committee at the August meeting.
CivicNet is making great progress working with the Division of
Compliance to deploy the online Completion Compliance
service and online Inspection Requests for all permit types.
During the month of July, plumbing permits was the first permit
type to deploy the two new enhanced services. Continuing
throughout the month of July, CivicNet deployed online
Completion Compliance and Inspection Requests for electric al
permits and heating and cooling permits. Notices were sent to
all current CivicNet permitting customers and links are available
on the CivicNet permitting pages with information on the new
service enhancements and the associated $1.00 price increase.
The Bid Package download application will be given to the
Purchasing Division for testing during the first week of August.
This service will allow interested parties to download bid
package specifications that are free of charge, and will replace
the current system of faxing, copying and mailing the multiple
requests for bid package information. The Purchasing Division
has historically absorbed processing costs for bid package
distribution.
Development has begun on the Division of Compliance online
general contractor license renewals. This project is expected to
save thousands of staff hours each year, eliminate the manual
data-entry process for license renewals, and get licenses into
contractors’ hands up to six weeks earlier. Reminder postcards
will replace the current license renewal forms that are mailed to
contractors. Posters will be produced for display in the agency
lobby to notify customers of the new service, and a link to the
information will be provided from the CivicNet permitting page.
