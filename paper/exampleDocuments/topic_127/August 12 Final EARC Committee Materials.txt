Request of Funds:
DPS Public View Dashboard Project:
Business Requirements/Overview
The Department of Public Safety would like to have a Public Portal created to display the latest
goals and initiatives. This will need to be a view only version for both the internet
(http://www.indy.gov/eGov/City/dps/Pages/home.aspx) and intranet pages for the DPS goal
and objectives.
The current portal is only accessible for people who have access to the internal site
(https://portal.indy.gov/sites/DPS/Dashboard/SitePages/Home.aspx).

8/12/2015 9:55 AM

Enhance Access Review Committee Meeting Minutes
The data is already provided to the public in other ways however DPS would like to be able to
supply this information via a web page portal. The data and the way it is displayed is the way
the DPS would like this information displayed internally and externally. There should be a tab
for each division that will be viewable to the public. This should be done when the customer
clicks on or selects the different departments the data should change to the data for that
department.
Scope
The scope of this project will include creating a Public Portal for DPS.
Objectives
1. Create a Dashboard to display the latest goals and objectives for all Public Safety
Divisions.
2. Once the dashboard has been created the Applications team will need to make the
dashboard viewable on the Internet and the Intranet.
Ms. Claudia Fuentes made a motion to approve the DPS Public View Dashboard Project. The
motion was seconded by Mr. Russell Hollis and carried unanimously.

Other Business:
The next Enhanced Access Review Committee Meeting is scheduled for August 12, 2015.

The Marion County Recorder’s Office (MCRO) respectfully requests funding from the Enhanced
Access Review Committee (EARC) in the amount of $233,116.32 for a project to make records
of this office more accessible to the public.
Records of the MCRO are digitized from March, 1964 to the present and are available for online
searching. Records from 1822 to February, 1964 are on paper and microfilm. To perform a
search, a customer must come in to the MCRO to use the microfilm or look through the few
books we have.
We have a proposal (RFP 48REC-3) to repair and replace the 1822-February 1964 microfilm
(approximately 3,500 rolls containing almost 3.5 million images) and digitize the images.
Currently, much of the microfilm suffers from cellulose triacetate degradation, more commonly
known as vinegar syndrome. The film degradation, caused by age, film material and improper
storage releases acetic acid, the main ingredient in vinegar, which, over time, destroys the film
from the inside layers out. Once repaired, re-filmed and digitized, the images will be reviewed
and indexed by MCRO staff so they may be searched online by anyone in the world.
The estimated cost to enhance and digitize the records is not to exceed $1,852,926.90. Since
the current administration did not participate in the RFP process, it conducted a thorough
review of the contract. Included in that review, the MCRO had the contract vetted through the
Information Services Agency as well as by former state archivist who is a nationally recognized
public records expert. The conclusions drawn were that the project is essential to fulfill the
duties of the MCRO, the vendor is well-qualified and the costs are consistent with industry
standards.
The microfilm/indexing project is necessary for the MCRO to adequately preserve and maintain
the county’s oldest records and make them more easily accessible to the public. The state of
the microfilm makes this project critical. Further delay will lead to further deterioration of the
images.
Again, the MCRO respectfully requests funding from the EARC for the microfilm replacement
and duplication contract in the amount of $233,116.32.
