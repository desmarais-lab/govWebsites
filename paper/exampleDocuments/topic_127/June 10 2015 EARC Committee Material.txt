Geneva Roembke, Application Services Manager for ISA called the Enhanced Access Review Committee
Meeting to order at 1:35pm. Chairperson, Roembke introduced, Linda Haley EARC recording secretary.

Approval of the February 11, 2015 EARC Meeting Minutes:
Mr. Wineinger made a motion to approve the February 11, 2015 meeting minutes. The motion was
seconded by Mr. Joseph O’Connor and the motion carried unanimously.

Waivers:
ISA Request for LoGO Monthly Shortfall:
Mr. Scott Hohl presented the waiver requesting $200,000 in Enhanced Access Funding in order to fund the
monthly shortfall in revenue for LoGo Indiana. A large revenue generator for LoGo Indiana was the JUSTIS
application. When the Marion County Clerk and Superior Courts transitioned from JUSTIS to the State’s
case management system, Odyssey, the public no longer needed to access information from JUSTIS
through LoGo Indiana. This resulted in a dramatic decrease in revenue. The City-County contract with
LoGo Indiana requires that LoGo reaches a revenue threshold of $60,000 per month. If that level is not
met, then the City-County is obligated to make up the difference. At this point, the amount LoGo Indiana

has invoiced the City-County is $85,853.75, which ISA has been paying. It is projected that the City-County
will continue to owe LoGo Indiana through the end of their contract in June of 2015. It is estimated that
the monthly shortfall will be $20,000 – $25,000 per month.
Ms. Voorhies made a motion to amend the ISA request for LoGo monthly shortfall to grant the use of the
Enhanced Access Fund to pay the monthly invoices for the LOGO maintenance contract not to exceed
Three Hundred Thousand Dollars ($300,000.00). Remaining portion of the funds will revert back to the
Enhanced Access Fund. The motion was seconded by Mr. Brett Wineinger and the motion passed
unanimously.

Executive Summary
Utilizing Enhanced Access Funds for Public access to City-County Council content
City-County Council Contact

NaTrina Debow
Clerk of the City-County
Council

Purpose

The City-County Council would like to request $23,000 in Enhanced Access Funding in
order to fund the public facing access portal to the new Legislation Management System.

Enterprise Impact

Description

Minimal – This will have little
impact on the Enterprise

CCC is in the process of implementing a new Legislation Management System which will
include all aspects of the way CCC does business. This new system will house everything
from ordinances, agendas, meeting minutes, vote tallies, council member attendance and
voting records. Much of this information should be made public and is the responsibility of
the CCC Clerk’s office to produce and distribute this information. As a part of the system,
the vendor will create a public facing portal allowing constituents the ability to access
selected CCC data. The public will be able to search indexed CCC activities via the portal
that will have the same look and feel as the current indy.gov website. Along with the
public facing portal, ISA will stand up a virtual server containing selected data replication
for the public to access in the DMZ. This configuration is ideal as to not expose the
production data and enterprise network to security risks. The cost of the server is included
in the request amount.
Many of the agencies within the City-County government rely on our public facing
website to provide information about the organization, provide information about services
offered, and announce events. This public facing access portal will enable Indianapolis
residents the ability to access digital City-County Council information anywhere, anytime
and on any device.

Public Impact

Significant – This portal will
allow the public access to CityCounty Council meeting
information.
