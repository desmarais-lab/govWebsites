would like to see the new vendor take a more proactive role in notifying customers about
outages.

hour.

January ISA Activities:
Business Relationship Management:
A quality service survey has been sent out to gauge customer satisfaction. As of
Thursday afternoon, 467 of surveys have been returned. The survey results will be used
to establish a baseline of customer service for measuring the success of ISA.
Business Relationship Management (BRM) activities kicked into high gear in January.
The BRM staff spent the majority of their time making contacts with their customers and
learning the business. Any remaining time was used up learning new processes and
communicating with ISA staff. The BRMs are making positive progress and getting
geared up for the upcoming strategic planning effort and pre-budget activities.
Operations:
January presented some challenges as the sourcing partners began using new tools
such as Siebel to record Help Desk calls, monitor requests, service desktops and record
more details in the daily workflow tickets than ever before. High call volumes at the
beginning of the month met with a rocky beginning, but by the end of the month
processes had smoothed out much more. In late January the Help Desk was rotated to
Lafayette, Colorado for after 6 PM and weekend calls. This too presented challenges,
but most of the rough spots have been ironed out.
Reporting against required service levels is still in progress, but in the next thirty days
this will be under control. Northrop has or will be introducing Siebel for Help Desk,
Kanisa Knowledge Management, Lex for asset management, and HP Openview to
monitor end-to-end response time. All of these tools are powerful, and will take some
time to implement and incorporate into smooth processes. The end result should make
the interim activities worthwhile.
ISA welcomes a few new faces to the team. Mark Kastilahn, Northrop Grumman
Service Area 1 Manager, who hails from Sacramento, California, Sarvjit Pabla, Technical
Architect, and Leroy Wilson, an employee of Cyberdyne, will be valuable additions to the
team.
On another note, Gary Johnson, Lead DBA, Jason Li, Senior Web Programmer, and
Dan Moses, Help Desk Lead, have resigned their positions in order to pursue other
opportunities. We thank these individuals for their years of quality service they have
provided ISA.

IT Board Report 02_15_05

Over the next several months, Northrop Grumman and the ISA operations team will work
together and dedicate significant resources to the development of several key contract
deliverables. These deliverables include:
• Completion of the rewrite of all process and procedures.
• Development of a Disaster Recovery Plan and Procedures.
• Develop Asset Management and Tracking Procedures.
• Develop a Single Sign On program.
• Develop a Self Password Reset pilot program.
• Implementation of HP Openview for system performance monitoring and
management.
Applications Services
The Northrop and DAI Application Services groups were busy adapting to the new tools
and processes implemented as part of the transition from ACS to Northrop Grumman.
Even with the challenge of learning these new tools and procedures, the team’s
performance in the area of ticket resolution is listed below.

January – Non-mainframe Ticket Resolution – 52.7%
There were a few changes needed to applications as a result of the newly elected and
appointed officials who took office January 1. Although these changes required minimal
effort, they were very important and were handled expeditiously.
A new release of the Courts OTIS system was implemented. This is the Court’s
timekeeping system and some new automation was included in the release plus some
printing problems resolved with time sheets.
Mainframe Activity
The support activity provided by DAI for mainframe applications should not be
diminished by the lack of statistics in this report. Their staff performed the day-to-day
duties required to keep all mainframe applications running and fine-tuned. However,
due to implementation of Siebel concentrated at the NG staff for the first month, the
ability to report on DAI performance statistics is delayed until further reporting features
are available.
Web Content Management System:
The content management project for the web continues as scheduled.

CIVICNET HIGHLIGHTS
2004 was a remarkable year of progress and growth for
city/county eCommerce through CivicNet. Notable highlights
for the year included:
• 44% transaction growth over 2003
• Fifteen new services deployed
• Enhancements made to thirteen existing online services
The Division of Compliance launched 13 services, including
inspection requests and compliance completion card submittal
for six different permits as well as general contractor license
renewal. The division also implemented the Over-the-Counter
credit card service, which enabled the agency to discontinue its
practice of absorbing processing fees for in-office transactions.
CivicNet coordinated with the Purchasing Division of the
Controller’s Office to provide a service allowing downloads of
Indianapolis bid and quotes information. The service will be
expanded in 2005 to include Marion County bids and quotes.
The CivicNet team worked closely with IPD to enhance the
usability, look and feel the Limited Criminal History service.
In February 2004, Instant Access (credit card) service fees were
reduced for all CivicNet services. As a result of savings realized
from a merchant agreement for credit card services negotiated by
the state of Indiana, CivicNet requested a reduction in fees. The
Enhanced Access Review Committee approved the Instant
Access-credit card rate of $1.00 plus 2%, per transaction
processed, which represented an average 25% decrease in fees.
Enhancements were also made to the online payment process for
parking and traffic tickets. The Instant Access (credit card)
option was also added to IPD and MCSD incident reports.
In April, enhanced access fees were eliminated from the Marion
County Clerk’s Office marriage license search. This is a tool
used by many citizens to conduct genealogy research.
