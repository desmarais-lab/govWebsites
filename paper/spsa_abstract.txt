The willingness of city governments to provide official documents upon request has important implications for e-government, transparency, and good governance. However, the presence of partisan preferences may act as an intervening factor, making government officials more relucant to share documents contravening their ideological position. A cross-sectional pilot study based on documents found on city websites in Indiana and Louisiana provides support for this notion. Relying on topic models, we show that cities with Democratic mayors provide more information on fiscal matters as well as recreation, in line with the party's preference for larger government. Cities with Republican governments, by contrast, seem to focus more on basic utilities and city planning. To test whether this finding holds in a causal setting, we plan to present the design of a field experiment in which we ask city officials to provide us with documents of varied partisan significance.
