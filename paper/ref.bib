                  represent all of these features, and we develop
                  Bayesian inference for it. The model is applicable
                  to both binary and non-binary network data. We
                  illustrate the model using two real datasets: liking
                  between monks and coreaderships between Slovenian
                  publications. We also apply it to two simulated
                  network datasets with very different network
                  structure but the same highly skewed degree sequence
                  generated from a preferential attachment
                  process. One has transitivity and community
                  structure while the other does not. Models based
                  solely on degree distributions, such as scale-free,
                  preferential attachment and power-law models, cannot
                  distinguish between these very different situations,
                  but the latent cluster random effects model does. "

abstract = {We introduce the author-topic model, a gen- erative model for documents that extends La- tent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA; Blei, Ng, {\&} Jordan, 2003) to include authorship informa- tion. Each author is associated with a multi- nomial distribution over topics and each topic is associated with a multinomial distribution over words. A document with multiple au- thors is modeled as a distribution over topics that is a mixture of the distributions associ- ated with the authors. We apply the model to a collection of 1,700 NIPS conference pa- pers and 160,000 CiteSeer abstracts. Exact inference is intractable for these datasets and we use Gibbs sampling to estimate the topic and author distributions. We compare the performance with two other generative mod- els for documents, which are special cases of the author-topic model: LDA (a topic model) and a simple author model in which each au- thor is associated with a distribution over words rather than a distribution over top- ics. We show topics recovered by the author- topic model, and demonstrate applications to computing similarity between authors and entropy of author output.},

abstract = {We describe latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a generative probabilistic model for collections of discrete data such as text corpora. LDA is a three-level hierarchical Bayesian model, in which each item of a collection is modeled as a finite mixture over an underlying set of topics. Each topic is, in turn, modeled as an infinite mixture over an underlying set of topic probabilities. In the context of text modeling, the topic probabilities provide an explicit representation of a document. We present efficient approximate inference techniques based on variational methods and an EM algorithm for empirical Bayes parameter estimation. We report results in document modeling, text classification, and collaborative filtering, comparing to a mixture of unigrams model and the probabilistic LSI model.},

@article{Roberts2016a,
abstract = {Statistical models of text have become increasingly popular in statistics and com- puter science as a method of exploring large document collections. Social scientists often want to move beyond exploration, to measurement and experimentation, and make inference about social and political processes that drive discourse and content. In this paper, we develop a model of text data that supports this type of substantive re- search. Our approach is to posit a hierarchical mixed membership model for analyzing topical content of documents, in which mixing weights are parameterized by observed covariates. In this model, topical prevalence and topical content are specified as a sim- ple generalized linear model on an arbitrary number of document-level covariates, such as news source and time of release, enabling researchers to introduce elements of the experimental design that informed document collection into the model, within a gen- erally applicable framework. We demonstrate the proposed methodology by analyzing a collection of news reports about China, where we allow the prevalence of topics to evolve over time and vary across newswire services. Our methods help quantify the effect of news wire source on both the frequency and nature of topic coverage. All the methods we describe are available as part of the open source R package stm.},

abstract = {Policymakers and scholars are increasingly looking to mayors as policy innovators ca- pable of addressing critical challenges, including income inequality. A robust scholarly debate contests whether mayors are (1) limited by economic constraints and unable to prioritize redistributive initiatives, or (2) spurred to pursue equity-oriented poli- cies according to partisan and ideological preferences. No existing research, however, directly and systematically measures local political elites' preferences for redistribu- tion. By interviewing and surveying 72 American mayors—including many from the nation's largest cities—we measure when and why mayors prioritize redistribution. We find that, while a majority of mayors' responses are consistent with being constrained by economic imperatives, a sizable minority prioritize redistributive programs. We also discover that partisanship explains much of the variation in a mayor's propensity for redistribution. This suggests that national political debates may be shaping local priorities in ways contrary to conventional views.},

We present an alternative, semiautomated approach, the structural topic model (STM) (Roberts, Stewart, andAiroldi 2013; Roberts et al. 2013), that draws on recent developments in machine learning based analysis of textual data. A crucial contribution of the method is that it incorporates information about the document, such as the author's gender, political affiliation, and treatment assignment (if an experimental study). This article focuses on how the STMis helpful for survey researchers and experimentalists. The STM makes analyzing open-ended responses easier, more revealing, and capable of being used to estimate treatment effects. We illustrate these innovations with analysis of text from surveys and experiments.},

These are intended either to establish some target semantic concept (like the content of partisan frames) to estimate word-specific measures that feed forward into another analysis (like locating parties in ideological space) or both. We discuss a variety of techniques for selecting words that capture partisan, or other, differences in political speech and for evaluating the relative importance of those words. We introduce and emphasize several new approaches based on Bayesian shrinkage and regularization. We illustrate the relative utility of these approaches with analyses of partisan, gender, and distributive speech in the U.S. Senate.},
