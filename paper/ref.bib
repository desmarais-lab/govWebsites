                  represent all of these features, and we develop
                  Bayesian inference for it. The model is applicable
                  to both binary and non-binary network data. We
                  illustrate the model using two real datasets: liking
                  between monks and coreaderships between Slovenian
                  publications. We also apply it to two simulated
                  network datasets with very different network
                  structure but the same highly skewed degree sequence
                  generated from a preferential attachment
                  process. One has transitivity and community
                  structure while the other does not. Models based
                  solely on degree distributions, such as scale-free,
                  preferential attachment and power-law models, cannot
                  distinguish between these very different situations,
                  but the latent cluster random effects model does. "

Each author is associated with a multi- nomial distribution over topics and each topic is associated with a multinomial distribution over words. A document with multiple au- thors is modeled as a distribution over topics that is a mixture of the distributions associ- ated with the authors. We apply the model to a collection of 1,700 NIPS conference pa- pers and 160,000 CiteSeer abstracts. Exact inference is intractable for these datasets and we use Gibbs sampling to estimate the topic and author distributions. We compare the performance with two other generative mod- els for documents, which are special cases of the author-topic model: LDA (a topic model) and a simple author model in which each au- thor is associated with a distribution over words rather than a distribution over top- ics. We show topics recovered by the author- topic model, and demonstrate applications to computing similarity between authors and entropy of author output.},

abstract = {Statistical models of text have become increasingly popular in statistics and com- puter science as a method of exploring large document collections. Social scientists often want to move beyond exploration, to measurement and experimentation, and make inference about social and political processes that drive discourse and content. In this paper, we develop a model of text data that supports this type of substantive re- search. Our approach is to posit a hierarchical mixed membership model for analyzing topical content of documents, in which mixing weights are parameterized by observed covariates. In this model, topical prevalence and topical content are specified as a sim- ple generalized linear model on an arbitrary number of document-level covariates, such as news source and time of release, enabling researchers to introduce elements of the experimental design that informed document collection into the model, within a gen- erally applicable framework. We demonstrate the proposed methodology by analyzing a collection of news reports about China, where we allow the prevalence of topics to evolve over time and vary across newswire services. Our methods help quantify the effect of news wire source on both the frequency and nature of topic coverage. All the methods we describe are available as part of the open source R package stm.},

abstract = {Policymakers and scholars are increasingly looking to mayors as policy innovators ca- pable of addressing critical challenges, including income inequality. A robust scholarly debate contests whether mayors are (1) limited by economic constraints and unable to prioritize redistributive initiatives, or (2) spurred to pursue equity-oriented poli- cies according to partisan and ideological preferences. No existing research, however, directly and systematically measures local political elites' preferences for redistribu- tion. By interviewing and surveying 72 American mayors—including many from the nation's largest cities—we measure when and why mayors prioritize redistribution. We find that, while a majority of mayors' responses are consistent with being constrained by economic imperatives, a sizable minority prioritize redistributive programs. We also discover that partisanship explains much of the variation in a mayor's propensity for redistribution. This suggests that national political debates may be shaping local priorities in ways contrary to conventional views.},

A crucial contribution of the method is that it incorporates information about the document, such as the author's gender, political affiliation, and treatment assignment (if an experimental study). This article focuses on how the STMis helpful for survey researchers and experimentalists. The STM makes analyzing open-ended responses easier, more revealing, and capable of being used to estimate treatment effects. We illustrate these innovations with analysis of text from surveys and experiments.},

This snapshot captures blogrolls (the list of links to other blogs frequently found in sidebars), and presents a more static picture of a broader blogosphere.

The study analysed the websites of both large and small political parties. It is worth noting that in spite of the lower Internet penetration rates in South Africa, the majority of political parties contesting the 2009 elections had websites. The study shows that the websites of the larger parties generally offer more functionality than those of the smaller parties, supporting the view of ‘normalisation' of party competition in cyberspace.

abstract = {Existing research on the extensive Chinese censorship organization uses observational methods with well-known limitations. We conducted the first large-scale experimental study of censorship by creating accounts on numerous social media sites, randomly submitting different texts, and observing from a worldwide network of computers which texts were censored and which were not. We also supplemented interviews with confidential sources by creating our own social media site, contracting with Chinese firms to install the same censoring technologies as existing sites, and--with their software, documentation, and even customer support--reverse-engineering how it all works. Our results offer rigorous support for the recent hypothesis that criticisms of the state, its leaders, and their policies are published, whereas posts about real-world events with collective action potential are censored.},

abstract = {The Chinese government has long been suspected of hiring as many as 2 million people to surreptitiously insert huge numbers of pseudonymous and other deceptive writings into the stream of real social media posts, as if they were the genuine opinions of ordinary people. Many academics, and most journalists and activists, claim that these so-called 50c party posts vociferously argue for the government's side in political and policy debates. As we show, this is also true of most posts openly accused on social media of being 50c. Yet almost no systematic empirical evidence exists for this claim or, more importantly, for the Chinese regime's strategic objective in pursuing this activity. In the first large-scale empirical analysis of this operation, we show how to identify the secretive authors of these posts, the posts written by them, and their content. We estimate that the government fabricates and posts about 448 million social media comments a year. In contrast to prior claims, we show that the Chinese regime's strategy is to avoid arguing with skeptics of the party and the government, and to not even discuss controversial issues. We show that the goal of this massive secretive operation is instead to distract the public and change the subject, as most of these posts involve cheerleading for China, the revolutionary history of the Communist Party, or other symbols of the regime. We discuss how these results fit with what is known about the Chinese censorship program and suggest how they may change our broader theoretical understanding of “common knowledge” and information control in authoritarian regimes.},

@article{Norris2003,
abstract = {In this study, it is theorized that party websites play a distinctive role in two regards: (i) they function as a pluralistic civic forum by facilitating the voice of oppositional challengers and increasing the visibility of minor and fringe parties, so that attentive citizens can learn more about the range of electoral choices; (ii) in addition, party websites function as a channel for Political participation by facilitating interactive linkages between citizens and parties. The debate about the function of the Internet for pluralism and participation is laid out in Part I. The supply-and-demand research design, including content analysis of 134 websites (supply) and surveys of the public using party websites (demand), in the 15 European Union member states, drawn from the Spring 2000 Euro-barometer, is outlined in Part II. The evidence for patterns of party competition in European party websites is examined in Part III and in Part IV the use of party websites among West Europeans is analyzed. Compared with traditional mediated channels, substantial evidence is presented that party websites play a distinctive role in the process of political communications.},

@article{Therriault2010,
abstract = {Previous research into political candidates' issue emphasis strategies has been limited by the difficulty of estimating the amount of attention candidates devote to particular issues. Nearly all existing studies generate their estimates by analyzing either newspaper articles on campaigns or data on television advertising. I present a third alternative for measuring candidate's strategies: the coding of emphasis on campaign websites via automated text analysis. This approach offers a number of advantages over existing methods, chief among them the availability of data for a much greater number of candidates and the greater depth of content than that available from brief advertisements or second-hand reports. In this paper, I describe the process for automatically coding candidate websites, discuss some of the challenges involved, and present preliminary results from the coding of websites for 2002 US Senate candidates. These results are used to illustrate the potential for this method of estimating issue emphasis strategies to be used for advancing the study of campaign strategy and finally providing answers to questions that have plagued previous researchers.},

It is set against the background of increasing competition between different cities affected by economic globalization. The article relates certain characteristics of the websites, such as their size or presence or lack of certain sections, to certain measurable characteristics of the city that produces the website, such as its size, its level of global control functions and its wealth level. Despite significant differences between the sample cities, their self-representation over the Web often follows standardized patterns. The study suggests some correlation especially between a city's level of wealth and its web design style. However, the analysis shows that a city's size, global significance or economic performance cannot sufficiently explain an official website's structure. ?? 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

We present the results of the content analysis, outlining the prevalence of five categories of ICTs – information tools, e-services, utility, transparency, and civic engagement features - and investigating how type of ICT adoption is related to city size, form of government, and technical capacity. We then rank the 500 cities based on 27 ICT features and note how those rankings have changed over the four-year period. We conclude with a discussion of municipal use of ICTs and what this means for governments and the communities they serve.},
