abstract = {Policymakers and scholars are increasingly looking to mayors as policy innovators ca- pable of addressing critical challenges, including income inequality. A robust scholarly debate contests whether mayors are (1) limited by economic constraints and unable to prioritize redistributive initiatives, or (2) spurred to pursue equity-oriented poli- cies according to partisan and ideological preferences. No existing research, however, directly and systematically measures local political elites' preferences for redistribu- tion. By interviewing and surveying 72 American mayors—including many from the nation's largest cities—we measure when and why mayors prioritize redistribution. We find that, while a majority of mayors' responses are consistent with being constrained by economic imperatives, a sizable minority prioritize redistributive programs. We also discover that partisanship explains much of the variation in a mayor's propensity for redistribution. This suggests that national political debates may be shaping local priorities in ways contrary to conventional views.},
