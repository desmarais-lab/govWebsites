boards to have access and also use the system and that way maybe they could share in some of the cost ms agreed and said that with the current voting board the names are physical nameplates but if

divisions with approved equivalent positions despite low staffing they have been able to complete of commercial appeals of residential appeals and of residential appeals continuing to address that backlog he said that they continue to face a challenge in eliminating that appeals backlog and are facing depleted fund balances in three of their four main funding sources endorsement fee fund reassessment fund and the general fund he added that they also face increased costs which are out of their control for property insurance contributions social security and pay for performance he said that they continue to work on efficiencies by not filling seven authorized positions employees and continuing the assessor university initiative to allow employees to obtain continuing education credits and maintain certification levels instead of paying to take classes elsewhere he said that despite ongoing efficiencies their budget projection for is up slightly over revised budget most of this is due to uncontrolled costs in character and increases in character because of form mailing requirements and continually increasing charges he said that they have also gone to a cyclical reassessment schedule in with only of the county being reassessed each year stated that their office has met the reduction goal requested by for many years and gave back this year in preparing the they were told to prepare for uncontrollable cost increases in property insurance pay for performance and social security and these increases are the difference that is shown between the revised budget and the proposed budget said that she admires the assessors fiscal restraint and would not have expected anything different with at the helm she asked if offering continuing education has also provided some extra efficiency in the office responded in the affirmative and said that it saves them money and keeps their key employees certified asked if having everyone at a certified level helps to increase efficiencies and get the job done with less said that this would be hard to measure but he believes it does he said that the education is limited to key people whose certification is necessary for their job and they try to be as fiscally responsible as they can to fund those educational needs ms stated that when a senior staff member teaches the classes they also get continuing education credit asked if going to a cyclical schedule means each home in county will only be assessed every four years said that ultimately each home should be assessed as of of any given year but most of this assessment is based on local trending the cyclical reassessment refers to a physical inspection of properties to help pick up on any additions demolitions vacancies and other property conditions that trending would not identify thanked for that information and said that a lot of her constituents have questions about that process so this is helpful information asked if the depletion of three of their four main funding sources means that they are spending these dollars for operations he asked how much will be left in those funds at the end of said that they have been asked by to spend down those funds in order to help the bottom line of the county general fund she said that know the answer to actual numbers anticipated to be left in those funds at the end of asked how much they are spending each year from these funds said that they only spend what they are allowed to spend from these funds and gives them the guidelines they used to have of revenue they could use from the endorsement fee fund but it all went to pay charges in they were only given to spend out of that fund but charges continue to increase and therefore they had to go to the property reassessment fund and the general fund to pick up those additional costs said that depleting those fund balances will create a real challenge for said that he does not have the exact fund balance figures with him but those fund balances are being drawn down he said that they can only spend those funds down until the revenues and expenditures match and because of the pressure to keep the general fund balances in the black they have relied on those funds as much as they are allowed to he said that they will have to look closely at those funds to reevaluate fund balances in asked if the city will help the assessor replace those funds in said that will work with each agency to help meet their expenses he added that there is only so much money to go around and if expenditures continue to increase and revenues and fund balances continue to decrease they will have to find other sources of funding or curb their spending asked if other sources need to be found to subsidize these fund balance decreases responded in the affirmative noted that their biggest uncontrollable cost is in the area of he said that three years ago this expense was to last year it was and now it is over he said that he is not sure how these charges are doubling every year when they are not actually adding employees but are losing them asked if they have asked about these charges said that they are in the process now of meeting with to better understand the model of and where these costs are derived he said that if they can identify errors in the charges or ways to reduce those charges they will work hard to do that

which they have little control thanked ms for keeping her budget flat and asked her to explain the abutting program ms said that when there is a surplus property that is not purchased in the tax sale they then contact the abutting property owners to see if they are interested in purchasing that property to expand on their own property asked if neighbors then have the opportunity to purchase this property and put it back on the tax rolls ms responded in the affirmative stated that it seems collections have increased gradually over time and she asked if this is due to becoming more efficient ms said that this is part of it but they are also back on time with their billing the economy has improved a little and online payment options also help with increased collections asked if revenue is not included in their budget ms land said that this issue is under debate by the state board of accounts she explained that the treasurer had an agreement for billing any penalties for waste and weeds and the county general fund received that revenue the treasurers office always counted on that money but the state board of accounts is currently reviewing that process and saying that it should instead go to all issuing units therefore they did not want to count on that revenue in their budget because they not receive it hunter left at pm county county auditor thanked the council for all the hard

match their current salary or compete with other companies or even other agencies he said that they continue to work with to find a way to pay their employees market rate but even comparing their offices salaries with other government agencies they are well below the standard he said that the decrease in character is mostly due to decreased rent for the family advocacy center which was built into their budget due to many county offices being located at that facility after a study they found that the metropolitan police department held more of those office spaces and are now being asked to pay a greater pro of that space this decreased their budget by over he said that with regard to revenue their offices reimbursement of title child support expenses are expected to decrease due to
