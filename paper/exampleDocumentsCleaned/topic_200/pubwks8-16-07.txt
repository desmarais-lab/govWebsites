council met on chair called the meeting to order at pm with the following members present and and arrived shortly thereafter absent were and mike speedy representing council staff was brown chief financial officer department of public works fleet services division consolidated county fund to purchase police cars for use by the metropolitan police department financed by a transfer of cash from the redevelopment revenue bonds fund chair said that proposal no was sent back to the committee because other revenues found to purchase the vehicles moved seconded by to strike proposal no the clerks note arrived at this time pm proposal no approves the issuance of waterworks district revenue bonds not to exceed to fund various projects throughout county executive director bond bank introduced mike assistant director department of waterworks and distributed a handout attached as exhibit a detailing the presentation discussed slides three and four of the presentation he said that the graphs on slide four show the level of funding historically and what is proposed over the next couple of years he also stated that went before the utility regulatory commission last year and early this year for a rate increase which resulted in an approximately increase across the board for waterworks said that part of the rate increase that was contemplated was the issuance of bonds to finance capital improvement programs he said that the list of projects contemplated by the department for use by the requested bond is included in another handout attached as exhibit ms discussed slides six through twelve of the presentation she said that there is a new base structure in place that was implemented earlier this year which is the repayment stream that was pledged for repayment of the bonds that will be issued ms explained slides seven and eight and discussed the following key points the level debt service through takes the and amortizes it as a leveled debt service over the time period of the present until the base case is traditional bonds in which traditional bonds will be issued with a possible year call provision this means that the refunding process can be initiated in a time frame of around years a bond is similar to a traditional bond except there is no call provision or a much longer call provision it tends to have a lower interest rate but there are some risks associated index floaters is essentially a variable rate such as an auction rate weekly bond that is tied to some index such as the interbank offered rate or the swap is when a variable rate instrument is issued but there is a that exchanges interest rates with the bond bank as a way to level out debt service would be for the term of the bond issue either through or callable year swap is essentially the same as the swap but allows the city to exit the swap at the end of years to enter into a new swap issue bonds or use other options to meet capital needs the level debt service with balloon payment reflects a situation where there is a balloon payment in of a larger payment amount of level debt service that would result in interest expense savings from the period of to due to shortening the term of the bond the same sets of scenarios are an option as the bond bank moves forward with the transaction a number of factors will be contemplated before a decision is made the factors include interest rates which scenario under which variation will provide the best interest rate and offer the best cost of capital for the risk some of the scenarios pose an interest rate risk for example variable interest rates can be repriced on a weekly or monthly basis and if the interest rate increases the amount of interest rate on the outstanding debt will also the advantage of a traditional bond is that the interest rate stays the same over the life of the obligation and there is no risk of interest rate escalation overall debt portfolio there is a substantial amount of outstanding debt for and there needs to be a good mix of bonds bonds and auction rates so that it is a portfolio the rating agencies opinion of the proposed structure higher rating is better for the city and enables the ability to obtain lower interest rates what the market wants will be taken into account ms stated the proposed new money transaction will have little effect on the capital debt structure and that slide nine illustrates outstanding series outstanding par amounts descriptions and a graph of the overall portfolio she said that the portfolio will not be impacted no matter which scenario is chosen the or the ms reiterated that slide ten explains that the waterworks bonds will not be repaid by property tax revenues and are solely secured by net revenues of the waterworks and certain pledge funds she said that the bond bank hopes to close on the bonds by late or early asked if exhibit can include which council districts will be affected by the projects ms answered that the information can be provided and stated that there is also a master capital plan that is regularly updated with new projects phases of current projects and completed projects stated that many of the projects impact multiple council said that he believes that this is something that needs to be done to ensure good water service citizen said that he believes that the types of things that the city is doing are good but he believes that one of the problems is that water is too inexpensive he said that he is pleased that the department of public works and the waterworks board are working together to try to take care of the sewer problems drainage problems and the water supply where possible moved seconded by to forward proposal no to the clerks note arrived at this time pm directors overview

reference to slide seven said that the mayor asked to come up with some budget savings and has found money to put back into fund balances every year he said that this year was a little more difficult because of previous cuts but was still able to find ways to cut and will continue to look for more ways to save money or spend less said that slide five lists savings that was able to come up with including some ongoing processes he said that so far has come up with a little over million in savings asked what the impact will be on the services that citizens receive she said that for example sewer cleaning is really important in some neighborhoods to prevent sewage backup answered that will continue doing services but some of them will simply be delayed he said that will make some sacrifices where they can but not at the cost of compromising services to the citizens he said that there will not be any permanent discontinuations said that million in savings is just the beginning of number of accomplishments he said that environment is one of focuses and they are reaching out more to the community about the benefits of recycling said that does not have as strong a recycling program as he would like so is providing recycling services at special events around the city such as the jazz festival and the races he said that also works with the schools and is going to be working with the convention center the airport and any large agency that they can get involved in a recycling program he said that the picture on slide six is of some of the cans that were collected at the at the brickyard said slide seven includes a picture of a ditch with hundreds of volunteers including people from neighborhood associations who spent two or three days cleaning up the area thanked for their contributions he said that he was a part of this particular cleanup and the people of the neighborhood feel more positive about their neighborhood and the city it took a lot of work

alley resurfacing that was done on the morning of he said that has acquired a new machine named the zipper which is a tool until now each time any work needed to be done in an alley tons of asphalt had to be hauled away to the landfill this resulted in associated trucking costs and disposal costs he said that the zipper grinds up the asphalt reuses it and puts it down as a bed and then puts more topping on it to resurface the alley this makes the asphalt available for another three to five years of use without worrying about potholes or crumbling said that one of key things is to reach out and connect with students of all school levels as part of their education goal he said that outreach programs are and they have received some rewards for some of the programs he said that there are so many things that the department does to involve kids and the kids love to see trucks outside of their schools also offers internship opportunities with many different programs said that slide is a listing of some of the partners that works with on a daily weekly or monthly basis he added that also works with the department of finance and management slide is a list of unfunded or underfunded programs that will continue focusing on as part of its ongoing maintenance improvement programs and quarterly programs he said that the highlighted programs are ones that he feels are critical to and they will continue to find as many resources as possible to complete the tasks said that it is known that the curbs and sidewalks program is greatly underfunded and more revenues need to be sought he said that is looking at outside funding for the programs listed such as federal state and grant said that slides and list the departments goals which are a continuation of their value and mission statements engineering department of public works ray deputy director engineering said that engineering has been working on a large capital program over the last few years he said that the majority of that work is tied to the year longterm control plan that signed along with the us environmental protection agency and the department of environmental management idem last year ray discussed slides through of exhibit he said that the run project was one of the first that the engineering division completed next year construction will begin on a new sewer which is a sewer that will be placed between two treatment plants and will shove flow from both of the plants that project is estimated to cost approximately million in reference to slide ray said that the mayor and have worked really hard on the septic tank elimination program step for the last several years he said there used to be a law financing program to finance people converting from septic systems to sanitary sewers but this was a very expensive and extensive process for people has reduced the cost to per connection fee and has reduced the time frame from a year program to the same time frame as the longterm control plan ray said that there are currently about homes in the city that are on septic systems and a number of them are failing he said that wants to get those that are failing converted to sanitary sewers as quickly as possible ray said in addition to the wastewater collection system and the is currently expanding a secondary treatment capacity of the facility from approximately to he said that there is a lot of sewage that gets to the facility but that sewage cannot be properly treated he said that the expansion will allow more sewage to be pulled into the facility and properly treated with the expansion or secondary treatment plant or with a trickling filter ray said that has been working with idem and on this project which is also estimated at approximately million he said that the first phase of the expansion is in construction and there will be two more phases with the second beginning around the first of the year ray said since the utility was implemented in began implementing and designing a number of and drainage projects throughout the city and the county he said that approximately projects and about million worth of work has been identified currently is working on about million worth of projects he said that one project that is currently and continuously being worked on for flood control is the north project is working with a core of engineers to connect from college avenue to boulevard eventually a levy will be built from boulevard to butler university which will result in homeowners and businesses no longer having to pay for flood insurance ray said that is willing to go out and talk with residents about its programs as the participation of the residents is needed to help make the projects and programs successful in reference to slide ray said that is currently supporting the on their light rail initiative of looking at various routes and alternatives for light rails particularly in the northeast corridor he said that when projects are developed looks at ways that a covered bus stop on a sidewalk can be incorporated which also coincides with their sidewalk efforts ray said that is also working with the department of metropolitan development on a large storm sewer project that will be installed from the run box to the street toward rural street and also reducing the surcharge and the sewer backup that residents of the are experiencing in addition is working closely with on their initiative of resurfacing and restoring sidewalks in that area ray said that this program cost is estimated at approximately ray said that the phase of the cultural trail construction will be finished this fall and the plantings will take place in the spring he said that the next couple of phases involve building the pedestrian and bicycle facilities up to th street and the and coming across north street and walnut street over to the madame walker ray said that has been working very closely with private partners he thanked gene and for providing

will be an from street to southbound i complimented and thanked the staff for helping with curbs and sidewalks in her district district said that there are very old curbs and sidewalks in his district district yet there are other areas that are receiving resurfaced or reconstructed curbs and sidewalks he asked what the engineering is with regard to prioritizing which areas receive the services ray said that there is a great need for curbs and sidewalks and not a lot of resources and tries to prioritize the funding he said that between and million worth of backlog is estimated for curbs and sidewalks throughout the county and only about million in funding is available he said that the projects are prioritized based on several different criteria including age usage disability issues school issues and church issues he said that tries to stretch the funds as much as possible to everyone ray said that if a constituent has an issue they should call and an investigation of the area will be done to assess the problem thanked for attending evening neighborhood meetings and other special meetings she said with regard to accessibility for persons with disabilities her neighborhoods do not have sidewalks and she would like to see that be changed in the near future for safety reasons she said that there are a number of businesses on road and there are a number of apartments for people with disabilities she said that she would also like to see sidewalks put in on ditch road ray said that a planning study for sidewalks down road is currently being developed he said that it will be a difficult project because of the need to acquire land from homeowners to put in the sidewalks but is looking into it and hoping to get that done in the near future fleet services department of public works pat deputy fleet services said that fleet services ifs ended with remaining vehicles for the fleet he said that was started with vehicles due to the county sheriffs department and the township fire departments consolidation with and ifs in addition ifs picked up the warren township fire department fleet in said that this increased the fleet to vehicles as of he said that the biweekly employees increased from to and the weekly or union employees increased to said that ifs recently picked up responsibility for city and fleet management which has resulted in a combined city and county fleet of approximately vehicles discussed slides and of exhibit in reference to slide said that ifs contributes to the environmental goal by possessing over ethanol capable vehicles and two city fuel stations that dispense ethanol and hopes to have a third one constructed by the end of in ifs used approximately gallons of ethanol fuel he said that ifs also started using which is a diesel fuel mixture generally of soy fuel mixed with diesel he said that ifs only used about gallons of the last year but hopes to use more because the prices were more competitive during the last six months of the year said that ifs also contributed environmentally by outfitting about ifs vehicles along with other agency vehicles with diesel observation catalysts or a much cleaner influx system he said that ifs is looking to purchase alternative fuel vehicles and is putting in a request for a grant in the near future to request hybrid vehicles said that educationally ifs will place a lot of emphasis on preventive maintenance especially for police vehicles which will have preventive maintenance and safety checks performed every miles he said that this is one reason that the vehicles are lasting longer he said that ifs recently took responsibility for ambulances and training has been provided said that economically it has become difficult for ifs to maintain the fleet at for the overall fleet and for the public safety fleet as the fleet ages and more miles are put on the vehicles there are a lot more repairs and the repairs are becoming more expensive said that character has gone up considerably as a result of more vehicles needing repair he said that character also reflects that ifs has worked with the office of finance and management and the bond bank to address the fact that fuel fluctuations have become a big issue over the last few years he said as a result the bond bank is hedging a portion of fuel purchases and providing them with some additional protection against fuel prices rising above a certain level said that ifs uses about gallons of fuel per month at an average of about per gallon which is nine cents more per gallon than their budgeted amount he said that the fuel varied in from to per gallon he said that fuel budget for is at per gallon said that the budget also reflects that the fuel increase results in an additional for unleaded diesel ethanol and other fuel products and lubricants out of character he said that character shows an increase because as the fleet size increases some of the outside work for transmissions towing services and suspensions also increases said that character reflects an increase because there was a request to replace one van and one van that are used for parts runs and roadside activities he said that ifs expects to be a challenging year because there is a larger aging fleet fluctuating fuel prices and the need to work within a tight budget along with the possibility of having to add prior department apparatus asked if ifs is looking at possibly eliminating cars and using alternative options such as mileage reimbursement answered that ifs hopes to go before the council to change the policy and to add stricter guidelines there are presently vehicles and he believes that a policy change will considerably reduce that number and provide an opportunity to suggest other alternatives commended ifs and for budgeting closer to what was actually spent for fuel he said that he would rather see an increase in the original budget request because it is more difficult to come to request more money or transfer the money from one line item to another said that the numbers are closer than they have been in the past but he suspects having to return for additional repair parts and fuel money asked if there are any city or vehicles that are not included in fleet services answered that all of the city vehicles are maintained by ifs but all of the county vehicles are not maintained by ifs yet because there is not an accurate count of the amount of county vehicles asked if vehicles of township fire departments that have not consolidated will be included in fleet answered in the negative and stated that ifs occasionally performs services on those departments that have not consolidated if services are requested city controller said that he believes that some of the other township officials or governments actually buy fuel through ifs but reimburse ifs for the cost said that it looks as though ifs will exceed its budget for fuel costs for but a consultant is working with the bond bank on fuel hedges and believes that the prices for fuel come down allowing ifs to lock in lower fuel prices and maintain its budget amount for he said that it is also likely that a fuel price will be locked in for in the next month or two depending on pricing so that ifs will not exceed the budgeted amount thanked for initiating the examination of fuel hedging applauded ifs for the things that they have done to address environmental issues he said that he is excited that ifs is moving toward the future with hybrid vehicles because the better the air quality the more attractive it is to bring in more economic development operations department of public works pat chief operations officer and method environmental coordinator discussed slides of exhibit said that operations could not obtain their level of urgency without their partnership with quick president of local in reference to slide method said that operations will be operating under a new agreement with their contract operator for the wastewater treatment plant and collection systems next year he said that the current contract expires at the end of under the new agreement operations filled in a number of performance guarantees measures and an agreement that will improve the departments operations resulting in cleaner water fewer overflows into the streams and rivers less odors across the collection system and into facilities and the ability to provide additional services method said that operations is looking to increase the amount of larger sewer diameter cleanings next year which is why the department feels that those services can be slightly cut back on this year method said that after rain events some overflow happens in the sanitary systems due to blockages or problems and the department wants to address those issues so that they will not be recurring problems method added that their crack connect program is aimed at working with homeowners and businesses that have a downspout or sump pump directly connected to the sewer system in an effort to decrease the amount of clean water in the wastewater collection system he said that operations worked with waterworks this year to look at houses on the where there is a channeling system during the rain less than homes or businesses were identified as possibly having an improper connection said that the fourth bullet point on slide reflects that operations is improving its response time to within five hours when replying to solid waste complaints abandoned vehicles tires appliances freon and other material complaints said that complaints have decreased significantly since asked who is responsible for dead animals answered that he is the person to call said in an environmental effort resurfaces alleys with the asphalt zipper with the zipper the asphalt is recycled by grinding it up putting it back down and spraying it with a liquid that rejuvenates and bonds the materials back together he said that should not have to do anything additional to that alley for three to five years he said that operations is trying to put a program together where the alleys will automatically be resurfaced again in four to six years said that since the program is still new they are still examining the possibilities and time options he said that the zipper is a fantastic piece of equipment and he thanked for finding it for asked how much faster alleys get resurfaced by using the zipper answered that it is six times faster said that is very cost efficient though the machine costs approximately said that the zipper allows operations to get resurfacing done in one day as opposed to six days before they had the machine and it does not cost much more than the initial purchase of the machine because it is recycling what is already present said that she understands that the zipper needs to be used on lesser traffic areas but asked if it would be able to be used on smaller streets such as answered that the machine can be used on streets but not major roads and it has to be asphalt he said that areas of to feet can be resurfaced with the zipper said that he has heard a lot about how useful the zipper is and believes that it is most beneficial to areas that are behind in infrastructure such as old city limits he asked if there are less employee injuries with the use of the zipper said that has not been studied as the machine has only been used for the past two months he said that there is still manual work with use of the zipper but it is completed sooner however he does not believe that there will be much change in the number of injuries commended and method and thanked john workman and bill for being very helpful to her in her district she asked if street sweeps are being done answered in the negative and stated that is doing thoroughfare sweeping because that is where debris is getting into the sewers he said that residential sweeping was eliminated about three years ago asked that operations give her a call if street sweeping ever started back up in reference to slide method said that decals are put onto storm drains by community groups to raise awareness of how anything put into a storm drain comes out into a creek or a river said that is always looking for ways to educate people about solid waste reduction and recycling he said that they work with schools of all levels their snow plow program involves having all the trucks downtown so that people can see what they are and what they do the program involves taking the trucks to schools and letting the children climb safely on them while explaining what the department does said that operations is looking to improve technology for the safety of their drivers there is an automated vehicle locator system that lets the department know where the trucks are and will allow for more efficient routing of the trucks for more fuel efficiency policy and planning department of public works method discussed slides through of exhibit he said that the policy and planning division includes strategic planning office of environmental services and financial management in reference to slide method said that is planning to implement its central clean air partnership program next year which involves working with businesses to help improve air quality he said that the green infrastructure manual involves working with developments across the county to encourage the use of natural processes as a manager rather than simply using detention ponds method said that is excited about the program that the mayor launched in as detailed in slide he said that has a huge role to play in the action plans for in trying to reduce the overall energy usage an energy conservation policy has been put in place for all city government as well as with the city facility managers an policy and mandatory recycling program have also been put into place for all city government he said that will also be performing some auditing of its wastewater treatment facilities and exploring options for reducing energy usage or using alternative energy sources method said that will be working with on green buildings to reduce energy usage because buildings are the largest of the instruments in reference to slide method said that is going to make an extra effort to have materials available in multiple languages and the policy and planning division continuously looks for ways to reduce overall spending or provide additional revenue sources chief financial officer discussed slides through of exhibit recognized some members of his staff and the partnerships finance has with the in reference to slide said that million for is included in the overall program said that slide reflects a total of full time equivalents but page in the budget book indicates he said that the budget book is incorrect but will work with the to correct it he said that the increase in fleet services is due to the merger with the warren township fire department said that the graph details the changes in from to resulting in an overall decrease of in traditional services however the graph indicates an increase in since fleet services joined in in reference to slide said that the revenues used to support primarily come from charges for services via sewer user fees fees solid waste fees parking meter fees intergovernmental fees such as the gas tax transportation federal and state grants and fees such as to other agencies said that has surprisingly low revenue from property tax but there is some cumulative fund capital money which is about of the budget that is supported and goes to transportation and capital improvements he said that a portion of the tax rate also goes toward solid waste collections which accounts for about of budget said that the comes out of budget and not from property tax revenues said that the top lighter portion of the graphs on slide are things that are nontraditional spending he said that in there was a total budget of less than million but million went to for public mass transit due to a legislative change he said that the darker portion of the graphs indicate the change in budgets in the top portion represents the addition of fleet services said that this slide reflects that there has only been a or million increase in budget for traditional services over the last five years commented that the increase in budget affects constituents directly because it is for increased services to the citizens and asked if it is also related to increased fees answered in the affirmative and stated that is a basic service provider and tries to use the user fee funded programs to provide those services which has been the source for funding increases he said that the positions that were cut were not due to the lack of work that work has simply been absolved by other staff said that tries to internalize budget cuts as much as possible in an effort to continue to provide the necessary services to citizens said that consideration should also be given to the astronomical increase in fuel prices from said that has also experienced substantial increases in products and services as listed in slide he said that has been able to do a lot with an increase of less than said that slides through are tied to pages three to six in the budget book reflecting the changes from the budget to the proposed budget in reference to slide and page three of the budget book there is a increase in character said that he inadvertently left some increases in character but he would propose to leave the increases in until it has been determined if there are budget increases available for biweekly contracted employees he said that there is a increase in character which includes supplies such as fuel and salt and construction materials such as guard rails signs and other materials he said that this includes a increase in fuel and additional repair parts said that the largest part of budget is character also referenced on pages four and five of the budget book which includes operating and management contracts for the plants solid waste and the major services that are provided he said that there is a increase in the character portion of the budget said that character is primarily capital projects that are handled by the engineering division of which there is not much change he explained that character also referenced on page six of the budget book is internal services and the numbers look as though they are negative with a positive difference he said that pays out internal charges for services that are provided to the department which are reflected as positive numbers in the budget but the negative numbers reflect money that is received by the department said that line item of character internal departmental charges reflects a decrease of million due to the amount that was paying out to animal care and control that has been deducted from budget added that animal care and control is still being funded but not through the solid waste division said that the budget book shows an overall increase of million or he said that the pie graph on slide shows the percentage distribution of the dollars by character and attempts to illustrate that with a traditional budget as proposed approximately of the budget goes to salaries to drive the program he said that this does not include the major portion of the that comes through the bonds grants etc he said that when those things are included character becomes only of the budget and services and projects become approximately as reflected on slide he said that this reiterates that most of the money collected goes into services provided by clerks note left at this time pm said that slide reflects the cost projection of the capital improvements program over the next several years by infrastructure category he said that the numbers fluctuate based on the availability of funding said that sanitary continues to increase due to the long term control plan commented that the increase is so large in because the rates have finally been addressed but stated that the rates are still some of the lowest in the state and in other comparable cities she said that rates increase so that the needs of communities can be met asked if the graph reflects when the money is spent or when it is requested by the council answered that it reflects when the money is spent said that slides through break down the budget changes by character asked to explain the employee assistance item displayed on slide said that the employee assistance program is for services such as counseling and wellness programs for employees said that most of the changes in character are due to increases that are occurring in fleet services he explained that institutional supplies as listed on slide are for thirst quenchers and supplies for the employees that are on the streets especially in extreme weather said that character is very rarely increased said that overtime and what is proposed for the budget significantly differ he asked what plan is to decrease overtime said that the majority of the increase happened during the first three months of the year in which fleet and operational crews handled the snow efforts he said that time decreases over the course of the year and works with on keeping track of character spending reiterated that snow is the driver on most of the overtime costs and the costs are controlled as much as possible through the remainder of the year sometimes by hiring delays asked if last winter was significantly worse than past winters answered in the affirmative asked if the proposed amount for overtime is based on a more mild or typical winter answered in the affirmative said that if there are days during the winter that are declared snow emergencies can apply for reimbursement that happened during of this year and just received a reimbursement check from for which will be put into character after appropriation approval from the council asked why group insurance is being increased by answered that the city has been averaging a yearly increase of over for the last three or four years so has asked all departments to budget an additional however there is no increase this year because human resources did a great job with negotiating the contracts with the insurance providers he said that the increase will likely be left in budget to cover some other issues with the contract that will need to be funded however a fiscal resolution has not yet been brought before the council asked what kind of programs has for employees that are on workers compensation comp as he understands that makes an extended effort to find tasks for those employees to do during that time said that area with the greatest workers comp issues used to be solid waste because the nature of the job was to lift approximately ten bags per home from homes every day he said that about four years ago started moving to the gallon carts that uses the automated bandit that picks up the carts to empty them this resulted in a reduction in workers comp claims among solid waste employees said that has not had the opportunity to implement the carts in the entire city he said that the pot hole patching and asphalting also tend to increase injuries but staff conducts a training program that teaches safe and effective work methods he said that when someone gets injured has a light duty program where people continue performing job functions such as office filing typing or anything productive he said that this program has helped many people continue working with the city while healing who later return to their usual position asked how many gallon carts will be placed within the next year said that has budgeted approximately each year for the purchase of the carts for the last few years and they had a great contract for purchasing the carts at per cart which included shipping delivery assembly and deployment into homes he said that contract expires this year and cannot be extended therefore the price per cart will increase said that is trying to purchase as many carts as possible as quickly as possible before the end of the year he said that the same amount will be budgeted next year but because of the price increase he is unaware of how many will be able to purchase said that currently there are carts deployed and there are an additional to more to be deployed within the district alone he said that it will take another two or three years unless there is a sudden infusion of cash made available asked if homeowners have been asked to participate in buying the carts from the city said that is exploring that option with the haulers as their contract with allows private haulers to buy the carts and amortize the cost over a five to time period however is trying to purchase as many carts as possible for its area which is the core of the city and find alternate financing options added that for every carts purchased a new automated truck has to also be purchased because the old trucks do not work with the carts said that the change in engineering services in character is due to intent to enter a contractual relationship with the county soil and water conservation district which has previously been funded by the county method is working with the group to develop a memorandum of understanding for contracting of the groups expertise said that the changes also include a feasibility study for ifs looking at the functionality of their current buildings and

diameter sewer cleaning the million is also reflected on the decrease side on slide asked to further explain the large increase for contracts said that most of the increases in over the last several

presented an to stating that they will continue to operate at the same level of funding as last year while continuing to look at alternate sources of funding said that the increase in water is for contractual increases in collecting and hauling solid waste asked if costs could be controlled more if solid waste was done internally as opposed to being handled by contractors said that a study was completed that indicated that the prices were comparable except that every time vehicles go away from the garage incremental costs are incurred therefore it is more cost effective to use private contractors said that increases in character line items and are due to the need for additional expertise in ifs to handle some of their new responsibilities and for additional training in engineering for the implementation of the longterm control plan added that the increase in building is due to contractual obligation to maintain the roadway in front of the motor speedway and along road of which funding has previously been taken from different areas he said that the increase in other contractual is due to responsibility to perform years of for ash said that the decrease in facility lease reflects the satisfaction of a debt service on the building in which fleet services was housed said that slide does not reflect the largest part of character which is capital improvements because it did not change however the other changes are due to the changes in fleet services with respect to newer vehicles and the expiration of lease payments said that slide reflects increases in fleet

the snow trucks are also used during the rest of the year as dump trucks to help other agencies he said some of the trucks have problems such as salt coming out of the sides due to rust but is looking at newer trucks with stainless steel bodies that do not rust and will continue to look into those types of things and possibly invest said that at some point it becomes too expensive to maintain older vehicles and investment into newer vehicles must begin he said that the work can be done more efficiently with newer vehicles chair asked if funds for new equipment should be considered in the budget or in the near future answered in the affirmative and stated that all solid waste trucks also have the ability to be equipped with snow plows in order to ensure that the trucks are vehicles asked what progress is being made with the new facility that will house along with and what amenities will be available for staff and customers that are not currently available said that is moving from their drive facility to a different location at south avenue he said that the building is an old existing building and the move should take place by said that the move allows to combine the engineering clean stream and water services teams into one location and also provides some cost savings he said that is trying to consolidate their people because the closer people work the more they communicate he said that the department is asking for several green initiatives to be incorporated into the building such as energy efficient lighting recycled carpet or carpet with little artificial adhesive projects to allow for reduction of discharges and green space on the grounds asked if was included in the move in part as an attempt to be more for customers answered in the affirmative asked if has considered fleet leasing said that has looked into leasing as an option but many of the trucks are used far past their lifespan he said that a lease is not practical for because of the limit on mileage and because of the loss of all initial investment said that some vehicles have been leased in the past for police fire and public works as a way to get financing caught up and leasing will probably be the option for the plan of replacements for asked if there is a resource within that is designated to finding more areas in which the city can become more efficient by utilizing more

distributed a picture of himself attached as exhibit that included mayor chair and when the septic tank elimination program began he said that septic tanks can rationally be eliminated in four to five years as opposed to the projected years passed around a map of the areas in which septic tanks are still present some of which are still in the central city he asked that the bonding be increased to eliminate the human health problem of failing septic tanks pat vice president county alliance of neighborhood associations asked if the figures on slide represent the fees that are included in property taxes if is the sole recipient of that money and why that amount went down answered that there is money that is used from the money collected but the majority of improvement funding is from bonds he said that there are some locally programs but the variation illustrated in the slide is due to the increase and decrease of bond money ms asked if there was million expected per year from the latest round of money ray said that the rate increase will finance about million of the latest rate increase over a period to but distribution is based upon when the job is bid and how long it takes to complete the job ms asked where the additional million per year will go ray answered that funding is broken into two methods one is and the other is bonding he said that approximately million per year or million of the money collected goes toward and the remaining balance is bonded over a year period brown added that the initial rate only covered the flood control debt service that was a tax rate therefore it was decided that all of the money collected would first go toward paying off the debt service he said that there was approximately million left over to fund operations that used to be funded from taxes brown said that the first rate that the council passed eliminated all the flood control and the increase is distributed as ray described he said that another factor that impacted the revenues is that beech grove opted out which caused revenues to decrease he explained that all revenues go toward the future payments of bonds for the increase but the increase was not as large as the initial rate added that the appropriations for many of the bond funding projects are made by the council outside of the annual budget process so it is likely that additional bonding projects be seen in and as other bonds roll off or additional revenue becomes available he said that consistently from year to year the budget is initially lower but additional appropriations are made throughout the year for projects as they are identified and approved by the council and the public works board ms asked if those appropriations go through answered in with no further business pending and upon motion duly made the public works committee of the council was adjourned at pm
