included in the lease for the new arrangement smith answered in the affirmative he said that is standard the building owner can issue what amounts to be a street price for the space in its current condition including their profit a lessee asks for a and will be amortized over a period of time as it is a lease cook said that he got an idea from about an interesting office concept of universal office space which is where everyones office space is exactly the same and is expecting to employ that concept in the gold building he said by using this concept the space has been very efficiently

purchase the building which highlighted the benefits of buying versus leasing and he believes that the city should look into purchasing land to house all the courts the prosecutors office and the

rather the city own the property than rent it as it would be a longterm aid to the city and the benefit of the taxpayers cook said that one of the issues is immediate need and the systems ability to respond and provide the necessary space to perform services brown asked if ten years is the standard lease smith answered that commercial leasing is typically never less than five years and ten years can be relatively short he said that moving the will allow the city to address other interim needs for space within the building brown said that he understands the immediate need said that there is office space that is unabsorbed that is over and above what the city pays to occupy the he said that lease including parking averages to be approximately per sq ft whereas the lease for the gold building will average at approximately per sq ft smith said that in comparing the numbers it also must be recognized that there are currently three people to a room which does not reflect good working
