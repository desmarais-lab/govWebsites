with a instead of a as indicated on the proposal moved seconded by to amend proposal no to change the in to the motion carried by a vote of moved seconded by to forward proposal no to the full council with a do pass as amended recommendation the motion carried by a vote of proposal no approves a transfer of from the budget of the township assessor county general and property reassessment funds to the budget of the township assessor to pay for maintenance and licensing fees and services provided to the county township assessors township assessor said that joint funds for the assessors is generally kept in the account of the president of an informal group of assessors ms said that the former president was the township assessor but she is now the president and the money needs to be transferred to her account she said that there are several things that the assessors pay for together in order to receive better prices including plotters she said that the assessors would have to pay nine times the current if the contracts were separate and this is the case with other items chair sanders said that she is concerned that the assessors would have to pay each for a single plotter if the plotters were contracted individually she said that she understands that the assessors have been acting as a group for a while but corporation counsel has determined that the assessors technically have no legal position as a group chair sanders said that she appreciates that the assessors have put forth efforts to find more reasonable ways to pay for some of the maintenance on various pieces of equipment in the assessors offices the council as the fiscal body has not had the opportunity to review most of the contracts that the assessors have initiated over the last several years and that raises overall concerns ms said that city legal has approved all of the contracts that the assessors are involved in chair sanders said that city legal has not been involved in all of the contracts chief deputy assessor township said that the documents being discussed are not actual contracts but they are licensing and maintenance agreements that are needed brown council said that the budget is done for each individual agency and the budget for any licensing or maintenance resides within the budget of each assessors office he said that he is unaware of any case where the funds of different agencies are consolidated into one budget to pay for a common contract ms distributed a handout attached as exhibit a as a small example of the type of savings that the assessors receive by purchasing some items together exhibit a shows the cost breakdown of purchasing maps at a group rate including combined shipping and at an individual rate with individual shipping the savings to the group would be brown said that the assessors should be able to receive the same type of savings by using the purchasing department he said that purchasing can do all of the negotiating and contracts can still be written as one chair sanders said that the committee is not arguing the assessors needs but that brown is simply informing the assessors that the purchasing function is available to all agencies in an effort to help decrease costs ms asked if a purchase order has to be submitted for each assessors office chair sanders said that a blanket purchase order can be submitted for the group and the costs can be distributed across the budgets separately this will show the true cost of each agency by making sure that all the costs relative to a particular agency are encumbered on that said that the current way that the assessors purchase certain items has been past practice for approximately six years and there has not been any problems until this point she asked if there has been some new development that has caused this to be a problem chair sanders said that the concern is that the current process does not allow for a concise determination on what it costs to operate each office because funds are being put into one consolidated account in one assessors budget to purchase items as a group but yet each office is an individual agency she said that there would be no way of discerning the true costs of each agency if an auditor came in to examine the budgets said that she recognizes that the process has been done this way for years but she questions if this type of transaction is proper and legal if there are agreements set up between the assessors to do this type of cooperative purchasing and why the assessors do not use city purchasing she said that the most important point that she is concerned with is that it seems to add to the argument that the city should move toward having a single office for property assessment in the county she said that as long as the city continues to have nine different offices for nine different township assessors things are being done nine different times and she wonders how much more money can be saved by combining the offices into one said that she is prepared to support the proposal because it is the middle of the year and the process is already in place but she would like consideration of the big picture to be part of this years budget process ms said that the assessors have had discussions with the controllers office about how to separate the costs for each office so that it can be tracked because they are concerned with that also ms said that in the past there has not been a separate item of the township budget but they have been told by the controllers office that the assessors can have a separate index for the funds for general and reassessment in other words there can be a separate budget set aside for the assessors jointly and it can be tracked in that sense asked what happens if one of the township assessors decides that they want to go through purchasing instead of being included in a joint purchase ms said that they were not aware that the purchases could be done through purchasing but it is a possible option for all of the assessors asked whose responsibility it is to determine what is purchased for the group ms answered that it is a group decision and everyone decides asked who does the research on particular purchases ms answered that it depends on who has the time and available resources to gather the information ms said that bids for licensing and maintenance of the plotters and cannot be obtained because the current vendor sold the equipment to the assessors many years ago said that he believes that additional options need to be explored on ways to improve the current process to make it less expensive and more efficient ms said that she agrees that a more efficient process for any new purchases should be examined but she believes that the current process is best for the plotters and the system ms said that the assessors would have to start over to obtain a better process for those items because the system is used on all the equipment asked if purchasing can buy a bulk of items for the assessors and deduct a particular amount from each individual assessors budget brown answered in the affirmative and stated that purchasing is set up that way so that they can do the legwork of gathering the information and negotiating prices so that the departments can focus on their individual functions said that maybe purchasing and the assessors can meet to discuss some of the options that are available and work toward those particular practices so that the purchases can be better tracked in next years budget brown asked if the controllers office has a view on the process hope controllers office said that the request was accepted for the transfer because it has been the past practice but it is probably best in the future for the assessors to do a blanket purchase order that will hit the budgets of each individual township assessor said that she also encourages the assessors to have thorough discussions with the staff from the information services agency with regard to some contracts on items such as the system as it is also used by other agencies township assessor said that the program that the assessors use is specific to the assessors needs he said that purchasing has been involved in some of the assessors transactions as the licenses and maintenance agreements for the plotters have been presented to and approved by purchasing said that the original purchases of the licenses programs and plotters were also reviewed and approved by city legal brown said that the council need to look into whether or not an agency can legally sign a contract if the money is not in their individual budget he said that as the fiscal advisor he recommends that the expenses be sent through purchasing and separated chief information officer information services agency said that some changes have been made in the last couple of years as has taken over most of the information technology it maintenance agreements by working with purchasing and the controllers office she said that they have been trying to ensure that has the control to determine if the right licenses exist and when things expire she said that will be glad to look into the assessors maintenance agreement and see if it can be incorporated into next years budget ms said that there are two different systems and can support one or the other but it will cost a lot of money and require a lot of research to integrate one system into the other however these things can be examined for next year moved seconded by to forward proposal no to additional space at east street for use by the county prosecutors office chief of operations prosecutors office explained her offices need for additional space her statement is attached as exhibit she said that the sharing of offices also poses an issue of privacy for victims ms said that the prosecutors office is requesting the additional space through a renegotiation of their current lease renegotiation

difference between the total current cost for and and the total amended cost for and is which includes the cost of approximately she said that the prosecutors office feels that the difference is reasonable with the addition of more offices she said that it is her understanding that the additional space was left on the sixth floor with the anticipation for possible future of the prosecutors office however a growth in staff from to was never anticipated but is what has happened chair sanders asked if the growth in staff is due to the increases in budget because of the actions of the criminal justice planning council ms answered in the affirmative and stated that grants have allowed for additional staff chair sanders asked how many offices are currently in the department ms answered that there are currently offices chair sanders asked how many prosecutors are currently employed chief of staff prosecutors office answered that there are approximately deputy prosecutors including child support deputy prosecutors chair sanders asked if all of the prosecutors are ms answered in the affirmative with the exception of two who share an office brown asked who owns the building that the prosecutors office is currently occupying ms answered that it is owned by hertz one brown commented that the prosecutors office does a wonderful job at obtaining grants and asked if the total rent for will be ms stated that will be the amount for the current lease but the amended lease will be million ms explained that the first column for each year in exhibit shows the current lease amount and the shaded columns show the amended lease amount it then summarizes the total lease amount for each year through brown asked if the prosecutors office renegotiated the current lease because it was more cost effective than to move the department to another site ms answered that she is not sure if the additional space could have been located to encompass the entire department she said it cost the prosecutors office approximately to move in of which approximately was used for telephone and data brown asked what the cost per square foot is to lease ms answered that exhibit shows that the current average square foot cost through is and the amended square foot cost is brown asked if that amount is comparable to other lease amounts for space in the downtown area ms answered in the affirmative and stated that she believes that the current average cost per square foot is to brown said that he would like to be added as a sponsor for proposal no asked if the proposal has gone before the space allocation committee ms answered in the negative and stated that city legal advised her that the space allocation committee addresses the space needs of the building and that the public defenders agency and outside entities have not recently gone through the allocation committee said that she was trying to discern whether there are any particular space standards as to whether all attorneys for the city receive private offices as the public defenders agency has also added attorneys bob city controller said in the case of the public defender there was an attempt to have a systematic approach based on the number of attorneys he said that the controllers office gave the department guidelines on how many square feet should be explored based on what is allocated to other agencies asked if the lease figures include the cost of building out and furnishing the new space ms answered that it includes the and a lot of the furniture will be moved out of the offices that are currently being shared she said that furnishing the remaining nine offices will be budgeted in character asked if telephone and data is included in the or if there is money in the budget to cover the additional costs ms answered that there is money in the budget but the cost will not be as much as it was at the time of the original move she said that many of the hubs and phones are already present so it will simply be a matter of the wiring being moved to the new side asked what kind of storage the prosecutors office uses currently if there are any plans to reduce the storage needs and if all the storage is kept on site ms answered that all of the storage is not on site as many of the closed files are moved to a storage area for which a rental fee is paid ms said that there are plans to send someone to a conference that gives information on a paperless office system but the prosecutors office is not currently technologically ready for that she said that the current storage need for the prosecutors office includes storing every old case file that exists but some are sent she said that files that are kept for a long period of time include death penalty files and files for defendants with relief actions ms said that files also have to be pulled for clients that have had previous cases she said that she is not sure what the best system is for the needs and accessibility of the prosecutors but other storage ideas can be explored asked if all of the prosecutors are now located in one place with the exception of those that are stationed in the neighborhoods ms answered that all will be except those prosecutors assigned to the juvenile division asked for an explanation of the intangible benefits such as more work being completed in a timely manner and more efficiency that the prosecutors office will reap from the acquisition of the additional space ms said that the additional space will allow privacy to be given to victims of sensitive cases because there will not be an issue of trying to discuss a case in the presence of another attorney that is doing unrelated work in the same office ms thanked the council for helping with the increase of salaries as everyone has been working hard to reduce the number of turnovers and attrition has significantly decreased she said that the decrease is due to salary increases and the desire to offer a comfortable work environment she said that she believes that the convenience of everyone having their own office is better for morale better for productivity and provides little to no interruption of work commented that the administration and finance committee is limited to simply assessing the need for the additional space but she believes that the committee should also take into consideration the factor of whether the county budget can afford to fund the project stated that the county can afford to fund the project and said that the prosecutors office consulted the office of finance and management several months ago with the desire to obtain more space in the same building that they currently occupy said that he agreed with their philosophy and asked the department to try to negotiate the best possible deal for the space he said that the prosecutors office returned stating that there was no rent increase for the department this year and the department negotiated a very small increase going into next year said that the contract still has the funding that the city requires which states that the council can stop funding for leases if they decide to build a new building or judicial center he said that he believes that the renegotiated contract amount is reasonable and he would be supportive of the proposal he stated that he has also seen the budget proposal for the prosecutors office and it is also reasonable said that he believes that the city has reached a steady position with judicial funding for the prosecutor public defender and the courts chair sanders said that she has requested a tour of the prosecutors facility as she believes that sometimes feel that they are allocating funding to agencies but cannot always determine what they are paying for she asked to arrange a tour of the facility and stated that several of the would be interested in being a part of that tour brown said that he tries to be pretty consistent with supporting public safety initiatives and he believes that it is the job of the council to make resources available for the proper functioning of the departments seeking requests based upon their expressed needs said that during the time that he spent in he learned of a program called blue book standard that depicts the office space according to various professional positions he said that be something that could be consulted in the future he said that he would also like to be added as a cosponsor for the proposal moved seconded by brown to forward proposal no to clerks note left at this time pm proposal no transfers in the budget of the county board of voters registration county general fund to cover expenses for temporary staff to assist with entering and maintaining voter registration records republican board member voters registration said that the transfer is being requested from character out of their postage budget to character to cover temporary employee salaries she said that most often the temporaries perform data entry but voters registration will need additional help this summer with updating voter information in the polling books chair sanders asked if notifying the voters of the purge will be costly and how the postage budget will be affected ms said that funds for the additional postage are already set aside with the treasurers office she said that the department set aside money that they believed to be surplus and put it into character earlier this year because it is a municipal election year asked ms to explain what will be involved with the update ms said six to eight weeks prior to an election voters registration works really hard to get all of the registrations into the system the registrations come from the bureau of motor vehicles mail and candidates and political parties she said that there is a small amount of time to get all the information together and to the printer for the poll books to be printed she said that temporaries are typically brought in to help with this process but they were previously paid out of character commented that there is some logic in paying the temporaries out of character as it provides an understanding of the number of staff hours that are needed to manage the office regardless of whether the employees are or temporary she asked how the voter registration records are ms answered that she believes that the records are in better shape than they have been in the past but that will better be determined once the cleanup this summer is completed chair sanders asked to what degree the clean up will be ms answered that voters registration will check voters and the last voting dates of voters then first or the system will generate a list of people that will potentially be but no one is ever deleted or purged from the records chair sanders asked if a postcard distribution will be done to verify addresses ms answered in the affirmative and stated that no one can be without notification plowman asked if the cleanup will reduce the number of return mailings stating that a person is deceased or has moved with no forwarding address ms answered that it can help in some cases but it depends on the number of years that a person has been deceased or has moved and did not notify anyone she said that deceased records can only be removed by notification from the board of heath or with the presentation of a death certificate but other records can be not removed if there is no response within two general elections brown asked if the temporaries will also help to enter new records and to ensure that the voters are registered correctly and in a timely manner so that they are eligible to vote in the next election ms answered in the affirmative and assured the committee that temporaries are not going to be cleaning up the files that particular task will be handled by current staff she said that temporaries will help with other duties as necessary asked if someone will be able to vote if they have been because they have not voted in the last two general elections but they decide to vote in the next election and still live at the registered residence ms answered in the affirmative and stated that a certificate of error can be issued if the person shows the proper identification moved seconded by to forward proposal no to proposal no authorizes and approves an agreement for the investment of public funds invited curt president financial group inc to speak to the committee stated that the proposal relates to an agreement the council needs to approve to allow the city to invest in fund

throughout the country he said that has approximately six and had one for a while called invest but he is unsure if it is still in existence he said that his firm currently operates a fund in that is approximately billion said that he believes that there is a great opportunity for all the small cities and towns in to benefit from a program such as this as this type of pool was created to help small cities and towns to access the market just as the larger cities do he said that by pooling the funds together a larger pool of assets is created in which the city can negotiate a better rate at the market place and then pass that rate down to the smaller cities and towns discussed the monthly yield comparisons with the following key points state investment guidelines and guidelines are identical except that also has an investment pool for commercial paper which was not included at the time of the comparison the yield on the fund was used as a proxy fund outperformed fidelity and funds out of months fund outperformed the invest fund out of months said that she can appreciate that an offering such as this will be very exciting for small towns and cities in she asked how this opportunity will affect the investment patterns in local banks answered that the process will be gradual to see how things work before making any major changes he said that he would probably begin by investing funds that he does not feel will be needed for a period of time and invest them for a to day period as a testing phase which is the typical practice with investments he said that he believes that the local public improvement bond bank is also considering this endeavor for an opportunity of determining if there is a higher rate of return said that there is also an issue of operational efficiency as a local or international bank currently manages the funds which makes it is easy to operate he said that the rates have proven to be very competitive and if it turns out to work more funds possibly be moved into the fund asked if there are still state requirements on how the city distributes its investments across the banking community answered that his attorney has advised him that those statutes are no longer in use he said that the requirements were one of the reasons that a fund such as fund was not appropriate for said that the document has been approved by the attorney
