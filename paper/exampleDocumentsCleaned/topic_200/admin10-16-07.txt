were available earlier in the year chair sanders asked if the is coming out of the county general fund answered in the affirmative asked what the county assessors office is doing to help with the reassessments for commercial property since the additional four will be assessing residential property answered that the county assessors office was ordered by the to hire a private contractor to do the commercial portion of the reassessments however the four new officials are managing that contract and supervising the vendor to ensure that the assessments are done correctly and on time he said

on deliverables and the first reassessment will not happen until brown asked what will happen with the four positions once the reassessments have been completed stated that it is anticipated that the positions will remain as permanent positions because there is a place for the county assessor to provide the skill that the officials possess that can be shared through training and supervising of the township assessing officials he said that it is expected that once the reassessment is done there will still be a need for the four officials to be involved because there currently are not enough assessing employees that are capable of doing the more complex commercial properties he said it is hoped that they would be available to take on the more difficult and complex assessments brown asked if the four positions are funded in the assessors budget answered in the affirmative brown asked what would happen if the assessors offices are consolidated through legislation next year answered that if a proposal comes out of the general assembly suggesting that the township assessors should be consolidated into one county office then it would be expected for those employees to be shifted to

budget process said that the reassessment would not appear on the line statement because it is a transfer between characters but the general fund portion coming from fund balance was taken into

the fall bill to all of the taxpayers who own property he said that the treasurers office would sometimes send out additional mailings due to misplaced bills or corrections or additions to the bills however this year a complete mailing had to be sent to all taxpayers because of the governors order which created an expense for the treasurers office said that the postage expense for the bills that were mailed out on was which is a much higher expense than it would typically be he said that the governors order has also created additional work for the treasurers office due to increased calls and responding to questions from the public as the public is very confused about the order said that the governors statement in addition to the order that taxpayers pay the same property taxes as last years amount also mentioned that there would be a reassessment and a third reconciling bill he said that the treasurers office is spending a great deal of time trying to educate the public on what the third bill means and what reassessment mean to the taxpayer unfortunately people believe that the reassessment means that their assessment will go down said that the treasurers office staff has to explain to people that the property will be examined but the assessment could increase or decrease he said that if all deadlines are met a reconciling bill will be sent to taxpayers on that will be due these dates have been set by the department of local government and finance said that he hopes that the dates can be met he said that the requested appropriation is to cover the expenses

are being received from taxpayers ms answered that they are not receiving as many calls as when the governors order was first announced however calls are still coming in daily she said that they are encouraging taxpayers to file an appeal if their original assessment is higher as it also helps the assessors office know where the trouble spots are asked if ms feels that people have had a chance to get a better understanding about the assessments ms answered that she believes that more people understand that as long as their assessment is correct it is all that the assessors office can do chief deputy assessor added that she believes that most people are more upset about the tax rates she said that they seem to be comprehending but are waiting for the third bill to be sent out chair sanders stated for clarification that the third bill will not be sent out until and the bill that taxpayers will be receiving in the next few days will reflect their level for their property tax payment proposal no amends the deferred compensation plan for warren township civilian personnel transition director controllers office said that this proposal stems from the merger of the warren township fire department into the fire department she said the firefighter contract was negotiated in began in and just expired at the end of a term of that contract was that the nationwide deferred compensation plan was added for firefighters only part of the benefits structure that warren township had was the nationwide deferred compensation plan for both firefighters and civilian paramedics so the city agreed with local that the city would amend the nationwide plan to cover those civilian paramedics ordinances require that any plan amendments be approved by the council ms said that it will be up to the city county administrative board to deal with nationwide in terms of the actual plan chair sanders asked if any additional costs are reflected for the city or if it is simply to give the employees an option ms answered that it does not reflect any additional costs because the city does not make any contributions to the plan for the civilian paramedics asked if this is one of the last of the loose ends about this particular merger and about how far this is to being completed ms answered that it is almost complete but there is an outstanding bill for oxygen that can not be explained and needs to be resolved asked how ms characterizes this merger with the township merger and if the processes are better understood ms said that she believes from the that the township merger went smoothly given the fact that this type of merger had never been done anywhere before she said that more time was spent ensuring that everyone received their paychecks on time ms said that ensuring that firefighters were on the pieces of apparatus responding to emergency runs went very smoothly through the merger she said that the city walked out of the township merger understanding that all of the personnel issues were dealt with first so that those things were not being resolved at the end ms said that those types of issues along with operational issues were resolved with the warren township merger she said that she feels that the warren township merger went even smoother than the township merger additionally the city feels that they are in a good position to assess issues identify those issues and resolve them so that they run seamlessly from the publics perspective of those who receive the services as well as the firefighters and other employees that are involved in the merger said that there has been a lot of talk about the savings that will occur from all the mergers and she hopes that there will be an opportunity for the council to see some type of analysis ms said that the city is required by law to submit an audit to the legislature regarding both the police and fire mergers that audit is due in and this will also be a very succinct way to look at the brown said that ms did an excellent job working with the firefighters the local and the fire department administration to work through the consolidation issues he said that he was at a meeting in warren township a couple of weeks ago and some of the citizens did not realize that the merger occurred because the name is still on the station and the same firefighters are responding to their homes for emergency management services ems runs the only change is that more personnel are available and warren township avoided a huge tax increase by being able to staff the fire stations and apparatus with personnel he said that the merger was a great benefit in warren township and he is sure that the citizens appreciate it chair sanders said that brown brought up an interesting fact that many of the townships borrow money to get through a given budget year which in turn costs taxpayers additional money she said that she does not believe that the average person realizes that that is currently happening in township and would have continued to happen in both and warren townships chair sanders said that she is glad that the merger in warren was obviously seamless ms added that township was fortunate that they had never had to take out an emergency loan but they acknowledge that they were approaching that threshold she said that warren township was able to avoid a million emergency loan by merging this year chief and former warren chief worked very hard together and the controllers office worked very hard with the trustee to come to terms and work out a transition and a merger that allowed to continue operating and providing service in warren township at a level that those citizens deserve while also making up for the million ms said that taxpayers have essentially saved million she said that this is considered an invisible savings but it is an element that is a true benefit to taxpayers and city residents as opposed to the township fire department need to take out a million loan this year chair sander called for public input mike reeves local said that he represents the employees that are affected by the amendment he thanked ms for this assumed oversight on his part because if he had looked at the resolution that was introduced in for the firefighters he have realized that this amendment needed to be done there has been a lot of discussion and he appreciates the mayors office and ms for stepping forward to make the changes reeves said that some of the members felt that they lost having this type of benefit he said that nationwide is not the issue the issue is that the members wanted a second option he said that a lot of things were said about the merger and the firefighters also realize that there is not a noticeable difference he said that he has spoken with many of the personnel from the old township and warren township fire departments and they are pleased because they are getting paid and they are doing the service reeves said that something was
