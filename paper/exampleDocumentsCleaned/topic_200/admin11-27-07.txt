working at the end of and they were trying to calculate their budget to cover those costs but there was honestly not enough to cover the expenses said that they tried to request the funds for but they were told that it was too late to correct it and they would have to come before the committee to request an appropriation brown said that he understands that sometimes the controllers office operates the budget to average out if a departments staff fluctuates but the township assessors office was underfunded this year and will have the same employees next year said that at this point there is nothing that can be done for the budget except to put it on the to do list for corrections in he added that it is always easier for a larger department or agency to manage the departure and arrival of new employees and it is always the smaller departments or agencies that have a problem managing a budget that is contracted the way they are for all smaller agencies as they tend to run short when there are no vacancies or turnovers during the year asked if the township assessors office examined their characters and to ensure that there are no funds available to transfer to their character answered that there is not much available in any other character of any of the agencies or departments he said that there be some underspending from other township assessors but it is easier at this point to appropriate out of fund balance than to take the funds from another agency asked if the other eight township assessors offices will make it through the remainder of the year with their budgets ms answered in the affirmative and stated that some other offices anticipated shortages but those offices lost staff persons and are therefore all right through the end of the year chair

handout attached as exhibit and stated that is working on update but the end of quarter report is relevant he said that exhibit is a copy of the spreadsheets that were attached to the report he previously submitted to the council in he said that the most critical information is the revenues compared to the budget which indicates that the city was at of its realized revenue at the end of said that the major shortfall was due to property tax and tax increment financing which were significantly short due to the failure of the assessment process he said that he recently met with the treasurer and auditor and it is believed that almost of the city and county levy will be collected which will result in the city being significantly short chair sanders added that historically the city is more toward to said that is still a very rough estimate and that is high at this point asked if the is through the end of or when everything is finally completed answered that it is to through the end of and approximately to when everything is completed he said that the budget was put together at the realization as some shortfall was anticipated chair sanders asked what the completion represents answered that everything will be complete once the third reconciliation payment is received he said that the tax anticipation warrants that are issued will be extended to the anticipated collection date in late when the third reconciliation collection will be received added that he anticipates a significant shortfall in cash flows in as well because as the assessors finish their pay work they will have to immediately complete their pay work therefore it is likely that it will be delayed and that tax bills will not be put out on time next year he said that there will be a proposal before the council at the next meeting that will discuss the extension of the tax anticipation notes through asked if there will have to be an additional appropriation for interest payments on the tax anticipation notes answered in the affirmative and stated that the cost of interest will be the biggest cost he said that there will also be an ordinance introduced at the next council meeting to pick up the additional interest that occurred in because of the delayed cycles that were a result of the property tax issues stated that he believes that these types of problems will be present for approximately to months said that the city actually received more pension relief than anticipated and the courts are doing an excellent job of collecting their fees and fines with their new collection agency he added that county option income taxes are also being collected as anticipated said with respect to expenditures in the quarter he noted that about of the budget had been spent and another has been reserved for payment of contracts that have already been allowed he said that he put a comment in the financial report was that he felt that the budget looked robust and the city would underspend the budget he said that mayor asked for significant reductions in spending and there are reserves in place that have not been released and the hiring freeze is still in effect said that approximately people have been hired since of which to of them were police officers for the new recruit class for public works to help keep the city clean and operational and a few seasonal or employees were hired for the parks department stated that he previously mentioned that fleet services will return to the council for another appropriation for fuel and it continues to be the bane of the controllers office he said that this factor does positively affect the budget or the remainder of the budget said that the police department will also be coming before the council for an additional appropriation ms said that a proposal was submitted for million for the police department of which million will be to cover the new police contract million will be to cover overtime expenses and the remainder is related to supplies and equipment for the new recruit class she stated that it is proposed that million will come from the sheriffs budget so part of the appropriation is an adjustment of the amount that was left in the sheriffs budget when the two departments were merged chair sanders asked if adding additional police officers through the recruit class has an immediate impact on the amount of overtime or is overtime something that is rarely eliminated despite the number of staff said that overtime has been at a higher level for at least the last year or two to combat some of the spikes in crime and it was anticipated that it would not continue at that level but there has been some mandatory overtime that chief spears could better explain chair sanders said that more information be given at the public safety meeting said that the new police officers coming from the academy do not do their own shift duty for at least six months therefore it takes approximately one year before those officers are on their own and assigned to their own beat asked if the additional appropriation that is going to be introduced would have been anticipated when there were talks about why the public safety income tax is needed answered in the affirmative and stated that the controllers office has been working with king the sheriffs chief financial officer on the budget he said that it was not clear how the administrative functions would be aligned or who was going to control them when the budget was divided between the sheriff and the police department originally one recruit class was anticipated in and that the administrative functions would all go over to the sheriffs department but the sheriff did that incrementally said that he is referring to information technology finance and purchasing when referencing administrative functions he said that more expenses were left in the police department than anticipated due to those functions being transferred incrementally and therefore some of the money is coming out of the sheriffs offices budget said that raises were not included in the budget and the second recruit class was not anticipated he said that both recruit classes are relatively large consisting of approximately people and there typically are about to people said that it was very difficult to break down the sheriffs budget as it had traditionally been managed on a macro level and the city budget is managed on a micro level he said that trying to identify the specific charges between the sheriffs office and the police department was difficult however he said that he believes that the metropolitan police departments budget will be in pretty good shape going into the budget said with respect to the county he believes that a significant amount of underspending for will occur and a million fund balance is projected he said that there are some additional revenues from the public safety answering point the clerks miscellaneous fees and the coroner have contributed in revenues for charges to outside counties for performing autopsies he said that this was not included in the previous agreement with the coroner said that he does not suspect that his report will have any significantly different numbers he said that he hopes to have that report available to the committee next week and he believes that significant underspending will occur throughout the year as part of the transition he said that the controllers office is being very restrictive on any new contracts or hires at this point said that there could be some character problems associated with turnovers in various departments as there are some departments in which people have served in their positions for many years chair sanders asked if the problems with turnovers would be due to accrued benefits answered that prior to employees who had accrued vacation and sick time could carry over that time then the accrued benefit leave was initiated and it stated that the maximum amount of accrued vacation or sick time that could be carried over is hours said that there are a number of people that would have significant payouts such as police officers firefighters and some people in the administrative offices chair sanders asked where the coroners revenue shows up in the budget answered that it appears in the county general fund said that there was an earlier discussion with the treasurer about how the rebate would be handled and that it would be costly if they had to mail out those rebates she asked where those expenses would be in the budget said that the treasurer recently informed him that a bill was introduced in the senate to allow county to give that rebate as a reduction in the third payment in and that all democrats and republicans in county and the senate had sponsored that bill so the treasurer is hoping to get that authorized said that currently state law requires the treasurer to do the rebate checks which he believes the estimated cost to mail those would be million he said that whether the checks will have to be mailed or not not be known until sometime in distributed a copy of the standard and ratings services report attached as exhibit he stated that for the last two years the city has been on a negative outlook because of its imbalance in the revenues and expenses shortly after the budget was passed he and from the bond bank traveled to and met with all three rating agencies he said that and will likely not update the rating anytime soon but affirmed the rating which is the highest potential rating for any city said that there are only five major cities in the united states that carry an rating and the city should be very proud of this accomplishment he said that also removed the negative outlook because of a passed budget that contained balanced revenues and expenses said that the controllers office is very proud as the city inherited an rating eight years ago and it has been a significant effort to manage and maintain the rating he said that it is very important for the city to continue with the rating with respect to being able to perform major projects such as the convention center expansion the circle city mall the anthem development the development or tax warrants chair sanders asked if he knows the identity of the other rated cities answered that they are and chair sanders said that it would be interesting to see the combined tax rates that helped to determine their funding sources and revenue for those cities she said that maybe the star can be convinced to do another comparison said that two of them are southern cities and has always been known as a fairly high tax rate state he said that he believes that is very similar to in its competitive nature and how it goes about doing business said that it would be beneficial to attach this report to everyones minutes as she believes that it is really important that everyone has a chance to see this document brown asked what the rating means to the citizens said that it means that the financial situation reserves or fund balances are healthy and that city is viable as far as going forward in doing business and that the budget is balanced he said that a balanced budget means that the city has properly matched revenues and expenses has a low unemployment rate has a good economic environment and has a good overall outlook brown said what it would mean if the city had an a rating or an rating answered that lower ratings would mean that the city has budgetary problems would be faced with cutting services out of city government would have a lower employment rate and the opportunities in the city would not be as good chair sanders asked if the city had previously dropped from an rating to an rating answered that the rating dropped with and there was a threat the rating would also drop with but put the city on negative outlook first he said that they have now revised their outlook and given the city an rating said that the report outlines some ongoing issues that the city is still facing with respect to changes in the state legislation property taxes circuit breaker and other matters such as these asked what the difference was between last years budget and this years budget that allowed the city to receive the rating answered that last years budget required the city to spend down approximately million in fund balances and to borrow money to get through the year the budget paid back the debt from the previous year and increased the fund balances added that the city has fund balances because it allows the city to pay bills timely and to perform necessary services this year would have been a catastrophe if the strong fund balances were not available he said that not all of the fund balances are flush but because there are other fund balances the city is able to do loans during the year to prop up the ones that do not have available balances he said this year would have been catastrophic as the city went all the way to before receiving any distributions on property taxes said that the city was also able to have loans with the county to sustain their budgets as well so it is very important to maintain that going forward into as the city becomes more reliant on income taxes those fund balances are needed to sustain the fluctuations that happen with income he said that property taxes are a fixed amount that comes in each year with a to collected each year but there are wild fluctuations with income asked if it is easier for the city to borrow money with lower interest rates when the city has a higher rating answered in the affirmative stated that that information is good for the constituents to understand said that the city seldom borrows money except for the tax warrants or county option income tax notes with the general obligation that carries the rating he said that when a project is done such as the circle mall or the anthem project the district supports itself however it is important to have the backing of the city and the ability to put a moral obligation on one of the bonds provides a huge monetary advantage to the city
