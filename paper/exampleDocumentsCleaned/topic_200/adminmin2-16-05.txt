over stressed and under funded our jails have been over crowded for the past years and worst of all murderers and other dangerous criminals are being put back on the street he said he does agree with others in saying that the increase in the county option income tax is not enough to solve this problem but it is a good start in the right direction said since the early release of criminals in more than offenders have been put back onto the street and five have been linked to homicides following their releases he said that in alone more than people were released from jail early of those have committed additional crimes while awaiting trial indicated that of criminals released early fail to appear for scheduled court dates said the was adopted back in to help slow the growth of property taxes she said there has not been an increase in the rate since made a presentation on exhibit a attached in and there was some increase in revenue generated by but it has not continued to grow the certified distribution for is for million not all of the money goes to county or the city of the money is distributed to other governmental needs such as million for homestead credit which is an opportunity to reduce the property tax burden on residents scenarios from to at there has been some reduction in collection of due to a recession at this time keeping the rate at will produce a very slight increase but not enough to address public safety needs the rate will be increased by one tenth of this year and subsequently increased for the next three years by one tenth of to get to the full that is allowed by state law the amount of increase depends on when the state actually distributes the money to the county the current law will not distribute the money until however there is a proposed senate bill that will allow counties to receive their increases in line graphic of the two scenarios in exhibit a the council has made a commitment that the new revenue generated will be used for referred committee members and the public to a question and answer handout and documents that show the collection over the years exhibit attached she said this proposal needs to be voted on next week in order to meet the state requirements judge said she is in support of this proposal and is grateful for the leadership that is shown in responding to the public safety needs by proposing the increase in she said her colleagues experience a great deal of frustration because of their inability to let misdemeanor criminals know there are consequences to their criminal actions judge said there has to be some sense of lawfulness in the community and a sense that the judges have the authority to enforce what they say she echoed what previous judges have indicated about the lack of resources in the courts and the effect it has on the system judge pledged to the council that the judges would work to coordinate with community correction the probation office the prosecutors office and the public defenders office in addition the judges will work on an effective system that assesses offenders appropriately places them according to their assessment and ensures our community is investing their public safety dollars wisely judge said he urges the passage of this proposal and the increase is justified he said this increase will go a long way in showing the public that we are meeting the needs and governing well counsel to sheriff frank highlighted sheriff report to the federal court one of the issues is jail staffing the council has given approval to hiring the minimum amount of correctional officers although there is a high turn over rate which means more resources have to be used for education and training security in the building is also a great concern to sheriff the study gave numerous indications on how unsafe the is sheriff tried to cut back on all overtime throughout the sheriffs department including the court line staff presiding judges indicated that there cannot be a cut back on court line staff because the courts would then have to cut back on court session which will lead to jail overcrowding said in behalf of the sheriff he thanks the council for their leadership and gives his support of the increase asked if the sheriff will be seeking more dollars for court line deputies replied in the affirmative asked if any studies have been conducted on the cost of video conferencing rather then transporting inmates to court said sheriff moved to video visitation to cut down on personnel and staffing he said the criminal justice planning counsel is also taking a look at video conferencing asked if the judges and the sheriff would work together in identifying priorities and advised the council as to what they would recommend the priorities be said speaking on behalf of the sheriff he believes the is the vehicle to help everyone make those decisions said he agrees that the council needs to do everything they can to keep the crime off the streets but he is concerned with the financial side of this proposal he said when looking at the scenarios one thing that is not being taken into consideration is that when you tax someone to a certain point they are no longer motivated to make money said he is concerned that taxpayers will leave the county due to tax increases and this proposal needs to be reevaluated brown chief financial officer said there are counties that already have the at or higher in place therefore taxpayers leave for other reasons but they will be taxed at the same income tax rate sue representative of the greater chamber of commerce said that the chamber has been talking about an increase in for several years she directed the committee to the chambers most recent report called invest in exhibit see file ms said the report highlights two main subjects increasing the investment in the community and expecting more government efficiency she said there are three reasons why the should be increased the county and city budgets demand the increase the legislature expects the increase in the chamber has had some difficulty going to the general assembly for local needs without full usage of the tools they already have in place the increase would be a release valve from property tax chair sanders asked how many businesses the chamber represents ms said they represent over businesses in central citizen said he is interested in public safety and keeping criminals off the street but he is a believer in long ranch planning he said there are simpler ways to solve problems such as public safety without raising taxes said he could only support this proposal if there is a plan to give the money back to the taxpayers said the council is looking at a long ranch financial plan and they owe that to the citizens said last year the put together a strategic plan to address many of the criminal justice and public safety needs for the city and the county chair sanders read a letter from taxpayers into record exhibit attached plowman said he is not sure that raising taxes is courageous the council can raise to the maximum and that will still not take care of the judges plan to hire additional judges that are needed or address the other needs that are facing the public safety system he said he is keeping an open mind on a tax increase but it is not the total cure to solve the problem chair sanders said the committee realizes that raising is not going to solve everything but they need to start somewhere asked why there is no commitment that the money raised would go to public safety for the next two years said the money that would be raised in the first one tenth of would go to criminal justice and public safety and would remain there she said if the money is used to hiring additional staff or fund another court that money will still be needed year after year said what is not clear is how the second one tenth of would be spent asked if the council could take the to the full now said the way the ordinance is written the council can only increase the by one tenth of each of the next three years unless the council votes to freeze the increase brown said in the city cannot help the county with their budget therefore this increase will help the county fund its own budget he said the increase alone will not solve all the problems and he would be happy to provide the council with other options of generating money chair sanders said the committee would be voting on this proposal sanders chairwoman
