who live in the country cooperative extension has been a partner and member of county government since the early as local needs have changed it has continually evolved to meet the needs of an ever growing urban constituency the mission is to engage university resources to help local people craft practical solutions to local problems part of the rationale given to his department for the elimination of funding for cooperative extension is that it is an external agency that receives subsidies from county government the county budget recommendations only include funding for those agencies that have traditionally been considered a part of county government so that no county jobs would be lost the extension has nine individuals that are on the county payroll and individuals are on the university payroll however funding for all of those positions are a blend of county and resources he clarifies that the code provides for the establishment of cooperative extension in each

of the budget goes toward the care of the children judge juvenile court reviewed the graphs in exhibit clerks note exhibit can be found in the clerks office stated that the psychiatric levy is a new levy issued for which was million rather than establish a new levy as prescribed in the law it was decided that the levy be taken directly out of the family and children fund requiring no increase in the tax rate that impacted the expenditures and what revenue could be gathered from property tax for the family and children fund in the budget request there is a request for a rate increase sanders asked if the psychiatric rate is committed to certain treatments and if it could be explained since it is not a pool of funding that could be easily accessed judge stated that this comes from a legal case where parents literally had to take their children and turn them over to the welfare system to get treatment this case which was heard in and went up to the seventh circuit court held that the state of could not force parents to give up their children and turn them over to the just to get residential treatment services the legislative result was that a formula was used to designate a fund that amount of funding was taken out of the fund and placed into this new psychiatric fund from a management standpoint the problem is the amount is put into a special account and the children are put into one of the facilities with no oversight the impact has been interesting because to date no child has qualified for this which means none of this fund has been spent as many as nine children will be able to access this fund according to statute the balance remaining in this fund at the end of a year must be paid toward the juvenile department of corrections doc debt asked what the amount of this fund will be in replied it is the total budget is asked if this is a way for the state to receive the money for the doc that the county owes asked if qualifying for psychiatric services would be

model that is nationally recognized these children are very difficult children who need psychiatric designations they must receive psychiatric care in an intensive residential facility and they must be eligible asked if those balances roll over if they are not used judge answered that the balances do not roll over they are paid to the state to pay off a local county debt asked how participants would qualify for psychiatric treatment services said that each particular case would be determined on some merits including the last residence of the parent and where the eligibility originated and was retained the cost of this program would go back to the county of origin brown asked if the number of children that are eligible or will be eligible for this program can be predicted judge said that this number cannot be predicted brown asked if all of the money could be used judge answered that it could not this year brown asked how much it costs per child for this program judge answered it is about per day and pays part and the county pays part out of the psychiatric fund in the initial evaluation it is estimated that between and thousand would be spent brown then asked if the remainder of the fund would make a payment on the million that the county owes for juvenile incarceration judge answered in the affirmative judge reviewed attachment clerks note exhibit is on file in the clerks office asked if there is any relation to the budget presentation and the department of correction doc bill from the state judge answered in the asked if clarification could be made of institutional

each category including children answered that he did not have those numbers available asked for those numbers to be provided asked if it would be safe to say that without senate bill one the budget position would be similar to last years position and equates to an unfunded mandate by the state said that without senate bill one there would not be an excess levy request and there would be an increase in the appropriation amounts asked county auditor to explain the billing relationship between the state and the county ms answered that it is different than other county agencies she stated that these are state employees who are providing services for county children whatever they deem appropriate is what is funded the county has no authority over what the state employees say the needs
