money be applied to the next tax bill or be refunded he said only of taxpayers have their payments escrowed said some mortgage companies cause a problem when they submit a check with a stack of escrow bills but the amount of the check does not balance with the amount of the escrowed bills submitted to the treasurers office said if a shortfall occurs a problem is created because there is no way to determine whose escrow bill was not paid in full and who should be assessed a penalty said taxpayers particularly elderly taxpayers on fixed income want to pay on a monthly basis because they receive their pension and social security checks on a monthly basis he said it is hard for them to put a little money aside each month to save up for a lump payment because emergencies arise and they would need to used the money for the emergency said they have a lot of incorrect addresses on file and therefore a lot of mail is returned he said if they had a new property system the treasurers office would be able to correct addresses currently the treasurers office cannot make an address correction and that is frustrating to the homeowner the current property tax system only allows township

address corrected by the township assessor and there is not a direct penalty to township assessors if an address is not changed said he is not suggesting there should be a penalty but there is not a benefit to the township assessors to ensure that bad addresses are corrected said that some township assessors do a good job when it comes to correcting addresses said she has a constituent that has been trying for three years to get their address corrected said they manually research over parcels each month that be up for foreclosure and a sheriffs sale the office also researches property

million by he said the increase is due to increased rates and bank specials said some banks are offering good rates that are not being published to the public said character increased by nearly due to
