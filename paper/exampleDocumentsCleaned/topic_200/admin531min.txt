in the county budget for insurance premiums appropriate the transfer to each county agency and add to the auditors budget in character said the will be a transfer and there will be no additional appropriation chair sanders asked why the realignment of the appropriation for health insurance is not reflected in the digest or the proposal said he understands chair sanders concern because a majority of the dollars are to realign the health insurance premiums he suggested the digest be amended to reflect the appropriation said this proposal is complicated because there are other issues to this proposal besides the minimum level of salary she said there are issues with work week benefits number of holidays etc she said the committee has a great opportunity to address all these issues this year with the salary study and implementing provisions of senate bill no suggested that all these issues be addressed at the same time and the proposal to be brought back to the committee in a more comprehensive form county auditor said merging human resources is not a part of senate bill no asked why she had that impression ms said the merging of human resources started in another bill but was not put into senate bill no asked if the merging of human resource departments would then be the act of the council terry nelson chief deputy auditor said it is his understanding that it would be the act of the council chair sanders indicated that the information she received from the auditors office does not match the numbers in the ordinance nor is there a distinction made between the actual payroll taxes due to the salary increase and the actual amounts that are being put into the various fringe lines relating to the health insurance premiums she also stated that when the committee runs all the numbers there is a discrepancy between what appears to be needed for both salary and fringe for upgrades and the total amount that is going into the salary line said the reason why the numbers are a little different is because the ordinance was based on data from different payrolls chair sanders said she would like to see a much cleaner ordinance and supports postponing this brown said he is in support of increasing salary grades for both the city and the county to become equal he also stated that he would like to see the insurance premiums paid for county employees in a separate proposal said a separate proposal can be done but this proposal will have to be tabled and three proposals reintroduced he stated the reason why the proposal was submitted now is because they wanted to begin paying county employees by brown said right now he could not support any salary increases because of the current financial situation he said later in the summer the council will have a better picture of where the city and county stands financially said she would like to see the health insurance premium cost individually accounted for in the ordinance said he will provide that requested more background information to explain what each figure is for in the proposal she stated that she would also like the payment to be retroactive to once the proposal is decided on and the figures are in place said he supports postponing the proposal but he wants to make sure the county employees get what they deserve encouraged the auditors office to make sure that the departments who have manageable adjustments take a look at their budgets to see if they can make the adjustments within their existing character moved seconded by to postpone ms asked if the committee is requesting three ordinances or one ordinance that is more detailed chair sanders said it would be appropriate to do the health insurance premiums as well as the salary adjustments she said the back up information needs to be relative to the insurance salary and fringe breakdown chair sanders said the increase in the auditors budget needs to be separate because it is a separate issue brown councils chief financial officer said if the items are going to be separate a new ordinance need to be introduced at the council meeting he suggested the chair talk with general counsel for the council on how to handle the ordinances the election board help vote act fund for voting machine refinancing and election systems and software litigation county clerk directed the committee members to exhibit a help vote act reimbursement fund schedule and schedule without she said exhibit a shows the breakdown of the amount they are asking for appropriation ms said when the county purchased the voting machines they entered into a note through the bond bank a repayment schedule was set based on the federal money that is given by the state to pay for the machines she stated the litigation expenses were due to outside counsel hired to pursue litigation against for difficulties with their contract the litigation was voted on unanimously by the county election board ms stated the reason why there are two exhibits for the loan payment schedule is because she wanted to show without the anticipated from the county general fund the county election board will be short by to pay off the note in full she said the appropriation within this proposal does not include the that was anticipated for she stated the principal payment can be made this year but it does affect the long term payment of the note in ms said they are expecting another federal reimbursement on for over million for a reimbursement totaling asked what happens in when the million is still owed ms said without the anticipated the note will have to be taken out further to pay for it asked why they are assuming there will never be a county payment ms said she is not assuming there will not be a payment but because there is not one

be a shortfall ms replied in the affirmative asked what was the county trying to get with the litigation ms said they are trying to get money asked if the money will cover the cost of the litigation
