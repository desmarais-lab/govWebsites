benefited from the bond issue she said as the bond bank goes through all of its outstanding issues team members are being sought to help assess the benefit or cost of doing the refunding in some instances it results in a small savings amount but in this case it is a substantial amount depending on the market conditions she said that it could range anywhere from million to million ms distributed a handout exhibit a that outlined their presentation which included the following key points bond refunding overview given by ms refunding occurs primarily because the interest rate environment and market conditions differ substantially from when the bonds were originally issued current low interest rate environment presents an excellent opportunity for the bond bank to lock in

full copy of exhibit a is on file in the council office with the original set of minutes chair sanders asked for an explanation of the total interest cost the net interest cost and the interest cost as described in the analysis shown on page of exhibit a financial advisor to bond bank and sycamore advisors president said that the interest cost includes everything over and above the actual interest expense such as rating cost of issuance legal expenses bond insurance and some run analysis asked why the million savings would not go back into the general fund ms said that bonds are for specific purposes therefore any proceeds generated from a refunding must be used for the same issues and projects she said that the amount going back to each entity is based on the amount that is outstanding asked if the million savings will later cost the city more ms answered in the negative she said that amount is the net present value amount which the city would receive up front said that the distribution will be received in of which is after the budget is set for she asked if the proceeds have to be spent on projects in the qualified entities or are simply put back into the funds of those entities ms answered that the money can go to either the funds or the projects asked if those amounts will be counted in the budget council chief financial officer brown asked if the bonds are general obligation go bonds ms answered in the affirmative brown asked if the savings is calculated interest savings or if the bond bank will actually receive cash out to deposit into the debt service accounts of the qualified entities ms answered that the savings will be received as cash up front and redistributed to the qualified entities as bond proceeds and their debt service will remain the same brown asked what will happen with the proceeds ms answered that the proceeds will either be expended for projects or put back into the entities fund balances brown asked if there is an appropriation request involved with the proposal ms answered in the negative as the authorization is determined by the council and the appropriation will be determined at the board level brown said that once a bond is issued the appropriation comes with the bond issue and this money will be put into the bond fund and possibly be used for projects he asked if another option might have been to reduce debt service instead of taking the proceeds ms answered in the affirmative brown said that this option could reduce property taxes by transferring some of the bond proceeds to debt service therefore the money or not be used for the budget depending on which option the council and the city decide upon ms said that it was determined through discussions with the department of public works and the parks department that it would be beneficial to have the revenues for projects to meet their ongoing capital needs asked what the current bond rating is for the city ms said that the rating is still good and bonds are continuing to be issued but one of the challenges is the unfunded pension obligation she said that although it was not popular to issue million in pension obligation bonds at the time rating agencies view it as an important positive step and they like to see that the city is taking steps to solve the problem said that she supports putting the proceeds back to work for the qualified entities because there are lists of things that constituents would like done in their neighborhoods and finding resources to handle the requests is difficult she said that the benefit to using the proceeds to pay down the debt would be to an individual taxpayer and more results will be seen in the completion of projects said that it is helpful to the city when refunding is found in this fashion she asked if there are other opportunities such as this ms answered that there is one other opportunity that will come before the committee and she stated that any savings amount that is discussed with the committee is savings after expenses she said that the bond bank is being vigilant in examining all opportunities as market conditions change chair sanders said that she would be very leery of using anticipated funds with such a volatile market in terms of creating the budget she said that she feels that the funds should be dealt with when they are received moved seconded by to forward proposal no update on the tax management associates contract chair sanders said that brown has the responsibility to keep the council informed of what is going on financially at the city and county level relative to the budget brown said that the council was first involved in the issue when the assessors entered into a contract in and later realized that the means was not available to pay the contractor he said that he believes that there are statutes that state that contractors be paid directly out of funds collected by audits brown said that when the assessors met with the treasurer and the auditor it was determined that the best way to pay the contractor was to set up a fund which can only be done through the council he said that the reasons to outsource were because the assessors did not have the qualified people available to perform the audits and there was also a claim that a state statute established that only the state does audits over brown said that was chosen for the following reasons they had a track record of receiving a or a ratio which would result in million being received by the local units of government for every million collected they would never collect more than what they found they could do all the townships at the same time no other company in could do this type of work brown said that in some results were seen and a claim was made that the transactions has not cost taxpayers any money however that was not true because it cost money to pay but they were also bringing in money he said that the estimate was that million to million would be collected as could get to the companies that were suspected of underreporting chair sanders said that browns comments reflect the history of statements made at previous administration and finance committee meetings as people presented early results she said that she recalls the statements made at the meetings but she does not recall receiving much documentation summarizing cost versus collections brown said that requests were made for the documentation and promises were made to honor the requests but he has no record of any documentation to meet those requests mike county treasurer said that he believes that he and former township assessor appeared before the committee last fall with figures that were not in balance he said that the two of them were to reappear before the committee however is no longer the township assessor said that the only figures that he has are the ones from the treasurers office and he distributed a handout exhibit clerks note a full copy of exhibit is on file in the council office with the original set of land deputy administrator treasurers office said that the last page of exhibit represents the total taxes collected in and by township and the property tax replacement credit that the treasurer billed the state in order to have a gross tax collection she said that per the contract was entitled to a gross tax distribution which is the net tax with the ms land said that over million of taxes were collected in and and the collected from the state was million therefore the total taxes available are million ms land said that invoices were provided to the township assessors and the treasurers office would receive invoices from the assessors by signature or by email indicating which ones were authorized for payment she said that the last page of exhibit reflects that invoices totaled million and was paid million which leaves a balance of approximately asked if the total taxes that were collected in and were reflective of only those collected by ms land answered in the affirmative she said that there are unpaid balances to but money was paid to the individual units she explained that was only paid based on their invoice amount or what the treasurers office had available per cycle ms land said that the ordinance indicates that all monies go into the fund and are to be paid out every and she said whatever is not paid to goes to the individual units which totaled million ms land said per the original contract and city legal penalties and interest were not to be included in payments to therefore the units received million in penalty and interest for a total received of million ms land said in addition the state indicated that if does discovery and uncovers that there should be an increase in assessed value av the treasurers will increase those amounts however if it is discovered that has been done those cases are entitled to refunds she said that there was million of discovery refunds which comes out of money that will be distributed to the units of government therefore the net benefit to units is million said that page of exhibit is broken up into townships illustrating the total invoices for each township the amount paid to the outstanding amount still owed to and unknown amounts that are said that it is his understanding that has not yet sent in all of their invoices but he is not sure of the dollar amount of those invoices ms land said that she believes that has only billed for the items that have provided an increase in billing she said that the concern is that if the treasurers office does not collect enough money is still entitled to the amount that is owed to them and that becomes a county liability chair sanders said this is why the became concerned because of the condition of the county general fund she said that she understands that from the assessors perspective this arrangement look good if it is working in their particular township however everyone should be aware of the holistic view of its impact on asked how the owed to is concluded as a county responsibility when the contract was not signed by the council or by officials but was instead signed by individual township assessors ms land said that it was a contract of which the content was approved by city legal and the assessors are part of the county government she said that their budgets are funded by the general fund and therefore if sued the money would come from the general fund plowman asked if there are any townships to which the agreement is unprofitable said that page of exhibit shows the percent of tax dollars that are going to each of the units he said that although townships percentage reflects there was approximately paid to that unit as a result every township received some tax dollars asked if the increases will be repetitive for future years if the businesses stay in the townships as it is now recognized that they were previously below value ms land answered in the affirmative said that the problem will be who will check to ensure that the are being done he said that the question is if an outside vendor is needed to do the audits since the townships assessors were not able said that although the increases will be repetitive the refunds will also be repetitive in the future she asked if the gain is a gain or a yearly gain answered that it is a gain brown said that page of exhibit reflects a total of distributed to the units but it should have been based upon the information that the council was given he said with regard to contract performance the question should be why the units did not receive the asked if the township assessors have a spokesman chair sanders asked if the presentation can be completed before hearing from the assessors said that page of exhibit summarizes that was the net tax to the units and was paid to which resulted in receiving for every dollar collected asked of the overall taxes collected what percentage is attributed to the refund ms land answered that she is unsure asked what the total amount of taxes collected overall is answered that overall taxes collected are billion chair sanders asked if the refund amount shown in exhibit is for all taxes that have been collected ms land answered in the negative and said that those refund amounts are only reflective of what has been done by she said that the treasurers office has recently completed million of refunds from to the present and there are more to be done plowman asked if the distribution to the units was in writing ms land answered in the negative plowman asked if the city is still ahead answered in the affirmative but stated that there is still the question of the amount of invoices chair sanders said that she believes that it is relative to the cost of collecting the amount received she said for example page of exhibit reflects that township received approximately but the cost to collect that amount was slightly over plowman asked if there is a way that the city can handle this process in the future or ensure that a more solid contract is negotiated brown said that another issue with the process is that in dealing with taxpayer money the city should be aware as to whether the increases were based upon a fair price unfortunately there is no way to track the information ms land said that she understands the assessors perspective on the ability to have the audits done but she believes that the charge for the service was too high she said that receives between and per audit whereas the city could possibly hire accountants locally for each township and pay them a salary including fringes and benefits and still not total the amount that is charging said that he is very concerned that has shared figures that do not correspond to the treasurers figures and he does not know how to resolve that commented that no more payments should be forwarded to until the books are reconciled chair sanders said that she agrees with however there is a possible liability because a contract has been signed chair sanders said that there needs to be a solution to the process that appeases everyone and determines what the efficiencies are for reporting and settling asked why there are huge differences in the percentage amount paid to each unit ms land said that she does not believe that there is enough information available to make the determination but she believes that it is based on the amount of taxes collected in each township asked if the ordinance can be amended to state that nothing is disbursed until all outstanding balances are paid she asked if that change will eliminate the balance owed to since this is the last year of their contract ms land said that there is no guarantee that it can be eliminated because there are so many unknowns said that put the county back into a situation in which taxpayers from one individual township pay the fees to have another townships assessments updated which was one of the principles that the city was trying to avoid asked if there is a coordinator among the township assessors for the contract township assessor and president county township assessors answered in the negative she stated that everything has been a joint effort by the assessors asked if each township worked individually with for their township ms answered in the affirmative asked if the assessors know how many more files need to be processed ms answered that township has approximately but she is unaware as to the amount of the other townships she said that information can be made available to the committee asked if any of the townships know how much is still owed for their particular township ms said that the assessors are unsure of the amount at this time chair sanders asked if the formula that the assessors used to determine which files were turned over to can be provided to the committee ms answered that all files over were given to chair sanders asked if the assessors can provide the committee with a list of the individual files that were turned over to ms answered in the asked why a payout was anticipated and why that did not happen ms said that history reflected a payback and that is what the assessors initially based the contract on asked if the assessors are fairly satisfied with the audit and what they anticipate doing in the future ms said that it has not been discussed as a group but they feel that auditing is a necessity however the assessors will have to work out the methodology ms said that there is also million in penalties and interest that have not been included in the figures given to the committee therefore the overall percentage will be slightly raised chair sanders said that she is not sure that those figures can be included in the overall percentage ms said that it is money that will be received by the townships she said that there are also some large amounts that are not yet on the books asked if the assessors anticipate that all of the auditing will be completed by the end of the contract which is and how long after do they anticipate knowing the end results ms said that the assessors have no control over that ms land said that bill will be paid in but the treasurer will not be aware of any additional values that assessors possess county assessor said that the contract does not have an expiration date as it reads that it will continue on a basis until the assessors give a written day notice to cancel however he said that the ordinance has an expiration date of said also as a part of the termination clause is allowed to complete any audit that they have been assigned and invoice for that audit once completed he said that can only audit as assigned by the assessors therefore the assessors can stop sending audits without trouble said that in speaking with he was told that approximately audits have been assigned to the company and are all in various stages of completion in response to question about benefits after the audits said that personal property tax returns that are being audited are by the taxpayer therefore there is no way of knowing if the information is accurate unless an audit is completed because of this there is no guarantee that additional revenue will be received each year ms land said that audits have been on schedule a and schedule and schedule for businesses is for inventory she said that the schedule is going away effective this year therefore some of the realization not be realization in future years chair sanders said that she does not believe that the information given is anything that anyone could have predicted but it raises concerns about how to proceed how to pay unfunded balances and what to do to improve the process she suggested that maybe an audit can be performed on the auditors said that it concerns her that it will not be documented in any budget or published financial report that the cost of auditing personal property tax returns for this time period was million because it was paid off the top she said that assessments cost money and the challenge should be to find the most efficient and way to perform assessments she said that there are still a lot of unanswered questions and the potential liability is unknown she said that she would like to ask the president of the council to ask that the assessors cease giving any more files for a time period during which time a review of the process and the procedures involved with the contract can be conducted moved seconded by to request that the president of the council allow the council to conduct a formal review by an objective of this process to date the reconciliation issue and projections as to where the county is likely to end up before the end of the contract this year said that she is concerned that there is no on the motion asked to amend the motion to have the review completed by plowman asked ms how the assessors feel about a review being done on ms said that she understands that the committee feels that a review is appropriate asked what type of review is being sought said that he would like for a to be done to examine the treasurers figures and figures to ensure that everything is reconciled said that the treasurers office books are public record and it should not take much time for a review or an audit to be done on them ms land said that the treasurers books have already been audited as a audit therefore they will simply need to be compared to books brown said that if it is a contract review it is typical to break the contract down into deliverables review all the invoices and take samples to ensure that they have done the work for which they have been asked if a review is being done to see if has done their job or if too much money has been paid to them brown answered that both of the issues will be examined said that he would like to see some of the undefined things calculated franklin township assessor said that six of the assessors have petitioned the state board of accounts to audit the fund she said that she was not aware of the figures but she has spoken with and they say they have found over million in assessed valuation she said that should amount to a lot of taxes she said that if the assessors were aware of the issues they could have possibly gotten the answers from she said that she was told that no more payments were to be sent to but the reasons were not disclosed ms said that has performed audits all over the country and to her knowledge county is the only county that has had any major problems she said that the refunds were not a consideration in the beginning but the state later informed them of the process of overpaid discoveries ms said that one of the reasons was chosen is because the auditing sometimes require travel out of the state to a headquarters she said that she does not believe that the county will do that ms said that she does not believe that the review should be done to determine if is doing a good job but to determine the reconciliation of the finances said that the committee tried to retrieve accurate numbers associated with this contract and process last fall but it was not resolved she said that over the winter the council began to hear issues when it was time to send bills which caused concern through discussion with some of the townships it was discovered that there is a liability and interest is paid on it she said that caused more concern chair sanders said that the statements that brown gave were from observations and questions at previous administration and finance committee meetings since she said that assessors have been represented at some of those meetings giving reports on the contract and the committee asked for reports in spring of in fall of in spring of and in fall of and the information is still not available asked if the motion carries is it able to begin at any time and must it be completed by chair sanders said that it should be completed no later than but she would prefer that it be completed prior to that time asked who would perform the review chair sanders said that she believes that the council will hire an outside consultant to receive an independent view who has experience in tax assessment and extensive credibility moved seconded by to respectfully request that the assessors suspend the release of files to for audit and that the chair be authorized to ask the president of the council for a review of this process to be completed no later than plowman asked if the council has the authority to mandate that the assessors stop payment said that she is unsure since the assessors signed the contract but the review can still be done
