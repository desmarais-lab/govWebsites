much is spent it has no incentive to make certain we pay only as much as we need for the most efficient system that protects our children he said this system does not work because the state has no incentive to look for other alternatives such as investing in education and more prevention programs to eliminate the need for so children to be placed outside the home clerks note exhibits a and are
