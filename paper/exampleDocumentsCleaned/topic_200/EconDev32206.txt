property taxes in the next couple of years she said the proposal as it was introduced would allow the committee to address the impact of the inventory rolling off the assessed value av and also an opportunity to provide some additional revenues through income tax revenues for the additional funding of the public transportation system mike county treasurer said that the good news is that the general assembly has raised the state homestead credit from to which will reduce the taxes that would be payable this year unfortunately he said that most people will assume that their property taxes will go down he said that the state sent the treasurers office the revised rates this afternoon and by performing a couple of examples on employees of the treasurers office it revealed that one person was fortunate to have their taxes decrease by about but another persons taxes will be increased by he said that the credit spread among the different townships depends on where one lives and what the rates are for the services that are being provided in those townships said that it is important for people to remember that the state tax credit is only for this year he said in the state is raising

first page of exhibit a is a taxpayer prior notification that the treasurers office will have to send out the second page of exhibit a gives the information of what has to be included on the prior notification so there will be even more information than what is included on the first page he said that he hopes that the general assembly will make adjustments to this change as the new form produce calls to the treasurers office with many questions and the treasurers office will not be equipped to answer some of the questions but only be able to direct constituents to call other departments clerks note a printout of the presentation exhibit was given to the committee and is on file in the council office with the original set of minutes chair stated that the items that land treasurers administrative deputy will be discussing are new elements that are now in place because of these things are being examined because the way they are played out have some impact on how the committee chooses to proceed with the proposal about imposing the economic development income tax ms land referenced the bill discussed and said that a law was passed several years ago that had certain elements to be shown on the statement but has expanded the scope that includes much more information the presentation had the following highlights a law has been expanded that will require a of av cap on property tax liability for all residential property and apartment complexes beginning payable the gross assessed value is to be multiplied by and a constituents bill cannot exceed that amount if any exceed the maximum amount a credit must be applied so that the constituent does not get billed for it however the credit is not revenue that can be replaced by any units of government ms land had a preliminary test run on residential and apartment units using last years information that revealed that the amount of dollars that would be lost is over million of which schools be she said that this limit will apply to all property in the adoption of a county economic development income tax extends the time in so that an additional rate be imposed to provide property tax relief to lessen the effects of the end of the inventory tax the inventory tax will be removed next year the homestead credit will be removed next year and the deduction will be increased for residential property which will shift and create tax rate increases for other taxpayers sanders asked what percentage of the total revenue that amount represents ms land said that she can get that information to submit to the committee but does not currently have the information she said that the legislature is predicting that the new trending that is to go into effect for assessors is going to be enough to cover the difference ms land concluded the presentation which included examples of actual bills the bills the parcel number of the taxpayer the assessments exemptions and exemption types the total tax amount that is then divided into half for the spring bill and half for the fall bill currently a breakdown of where funds are based on the tax district brown commented on the presentation with the following key points the next example of a bill was not an actual bill calculated by the treasurers office but was able to take the previous calculations with the new rates and guess at what an increased homestead credit would be going from to a homeowners taxes could result in an increase of about per six months with the homestead credit as opposed to a per six month increase without the homestead credit the next slide shows an increase in homestead credit going away and an increase in the homestead deduction going from to which would result in a for the year for the property used in the example the next five slides illustrate numbers from the impact of the inventory av loss that have been updated to include an estimated increase in homestead deduction that would occur in the last slide shows figures from a study that represent the inventory av the inventory tax dollars the amount needed for additional homestead relief between the two years based on the updated information and what edit rate would be necessary to be able to fund it sanders asked if someone could explain what it takes for a homeowner to be eligible for the homestead credit and when the deadline is to file ms land said that legislation has been passed that extends the deadline from to she said that if people call the treasurers office they will refer constituents to the auditors office to apply if the treasurers office notices that the constituent has not filed said that there are many senior citizens that are not aware and have not filed for the exemption said that these are very scary numbers and asked what the remedy would be in coming back from these changes said that the hope is that the general assembly will look at these numbers and make adjustments he said that the city also desperately needs a new property tax computer system asked if the homestead deduction can be initiated or automatically done by the treasurers office ms land said that the taxpayer has to apply themselves through the auditors office the current year for the deduction to apply to the following year brown said that there is no money set aside for a deduction of av ms land said that the deduction is not state funded it is taxpayer funded brown said that the fiscal impact statement exhibit states that doing the deduction will save the state money chair said that she had seen a study that indicated that the growth in the property tax replacement credit was slower and the state thought that they have some room to reimburse counties brown said that the final answer on that is not known clerks note a full printout of exhibit is on file in the council office with the original set of minutes asked if the numbers include all the new debt that the city is owed by individual taxpayers brown answered in the negative and said that the numbers shown are assuming that rates would stay the same asked if there are any fund balances to offset the amount that would have to be written off if the cap is reached bob city controller answered that there is nothing in the fund balances at the levels that ms land mentioned he said that debt that is secured by property taxes is outside the cap he said that could worsen the problem which would likely get worse for and said that of the property taxes are done by the school corporations therefore are not part of the council he said that the council approves the budget for about of the taxes chair said that the council is in a position to approve any additional homestead credit that might be funded through the income tax but not in a position to approve all of the spending that would drive up the tax rates that the council would be trying to offset asked if there will be anyone caught in the middle of the tax shift brown answered in the affirmative and said that the percent shift are from businesses with inventory over to everyone else and now shifts those amounts over to owners of residential properties apartments and businesses without inventory they will see a potential increase in property taxes because of the two actions chair asked if it is true that a decimal cannot be approved when looking at rates ms land answered in the affirmative said that the limit for this purpose is chair asked if according to the calculations at least half of what is allowed be needed in order to provide the homestead relief answered in the chair said that does allow the amount of homestead credit to be allocated in different proportions to different taxing districts ms land said that it would be difficult to implement that but it is what is allowed chair said that also illustrates that those who would be eligible for the homestead credit also includes for some type of rental units four or less township assessor said that some taxpayers will be for trending and some will be against it he said that each year trending will try to capture what the market has in certain areas it will basically work to bring all the homes within an area into the same market value for example if the area is at most of the homes must sell between and if later the homes are shown to sell for more a reassessment will be done to bring the area into the correct market said that it is very difficult on commercial properties to use the market approach because there are not many commercial properties that actually sell he said to achieve the trending goal appraisers expertise will be used throughout the county to discover what the trends are and try to average for the county he said that there still be a potential problem of incorrect assessments which will result in some taxes going up and some going down assessments will vary from neighborhood to neighborhood asked if there is an older neighborhood that has newer homes built within the area if trending would potentially increase the assessed values of the older homes answered in the affirmative asked if it would also affect homes under answered that it would affect those homes if the newer more expensive homes are pulling the market value up chair said that this discussion was to propose the consideration of an edit tax that would be used to help offset some of the features that have been discussed and for the revenue to assist in providing some support to citizen said that he was a teacher at university for years and lives on the northeast side of town said that he believes that using the edit tax to reduce the burden on homeowners is a mistake he said that he does not believe the homeowners bear high property taxes compared to other states he said that he does not believe that government should interfere in the decision of a person to own or purchase a home and should be biased against renters he said that the edit tax should be used for economic development therefore using it for is a great idea asked if can differentiate between a bias toward homeowners versus a bias toward people who ride the bus said that everyone who drives a car benefits from someone who rides the bus because of the congestion and pollution factors asked if the same argument can be made that everyone who lives in an apartment benefits from those who live in a house said that he cannot make that argument finance secretary for amalgamated transit union asked to what portion of the tax would be allocated if allocated she said that she has heard that the money would go to routes on the outskirts of the city said that the purpose of the funding from is to give a onetime infusion of cash to help grow city operations by providing more routes more frequency of routes and more convenience for people said that he believes that must be grown to meet the needs in terms of transportation he formed a working group last year with the mayors office council leadership and the chamber that has talked about ways to come up with dedicated funding to help grow in the future said that he knows firsthand the importance of public transportation mayor convened a task force to study and the vision of that task force was that public transportation is vital to the economic development and continued growth of the transportation should be able to effectively provide services to the area and is customer focused one study indicated that every million invested in public transportation creates jobs and yields about million in sales said that has one of the highest foreclosures on homes and it is ridiculous that the citizens have to decide between a home and transportation he said that central coalition on aging talks about the fastest growing population in is the seniors and public transportation provides mobility and independence for seniors he believes that the regional transportation authority is needed but first needs a viable growing bus system in to meet the needs of the people said in looking at all the fiscal crises that the county is facing he does not believe that this onetime infusion of funds to is appropriate at this time he said that maybe a holistic approach of how critical funding areas are funded should be taken and should be included in that approach he asked if an amendment can be done to remove the portion from the proposal as a possible funding solution for the future chair said that the committee is not prepared to verbally amend the proposal but can possibly prepare that at another meeting she said that another change that the state has made in has extended the date to make a decision on the use of the edit for homestead credit to st sanders said that she agrees with that funding is an economic development issue and she is not prepared to address it she believes that the committee needs time to continue to gather more information and determine what action should be taken moved seconded by sanders to postpone proposal no with no further business and upon motion duly made the economic development
