federal reimbursements stated that he believes it would be more around million a discussion ensued between chair and brown about the confusion on the different ways in which the same number is often used brown explained that it has to do with the way the auditor has its system set up and generally they try and use the same description for objects and characters brown went on to say that the

care that are placed with relatives or even in their own homes while this does represent the children pays typically per for it does not represent all of the children cares for chair said there needs

abused and neglected children that come into the agency and how many are assigned he also stated that another expense is that also supports the guardian home at the cost of almost million he added that when a placement is necessary the courts require a review to provide a justification for continued placement beyond those three months ping stated that on occasion visits to some of the facilities are needed to ensure that appropriate length of stay is required there are many young children that come in that are severely damaged and who almost immediately require some kind of residential treatment asked what type of process goes into assigning an investigation stated that the allegation is reviewed by a supervisor to determine if the case meets the legal requirement to initiate an investigation or whether the case is screened out if the case is screened out there is a committee that will review and determine if the right decision was asked to what degree is there adequate staff stated that more staff is needed and that the state administration has committed to additional case managers who are in training and will be with the agency by of chair asked what effect the number of caseworkers has on the length of stay and as a result the cost of care stated that caseworkers would be able to monitor each case more frequently if they had smaller caseloads and that could result in earlier resolution of permanent placement issues and therefore reduce expenses chair asked what course of action would have to take if the committee does not agree to support this loan ms stated that if the council denies the loan or does not take any action can appeal to the department of local government and finance and they can hold a public hearing in county to determine the outcome of the loan asked if the council did approve the request could that be appealed by someone to the who could deny the request ms stated that all borrowing and bond issues go to the and they are the final approval on whether the request is accepted ms also stated that if the thinks for whatever reason the loan is not necessary it has that power chair asked what else there is that the council can do to help resolve the budget shortfall other than borrowing money stated that any member of the committee is invited to come visit the agency to learn more about how is operating on a daily basis to talk with some of the staff at the front line and to understand what the staff is doing to get a better first hand observation on how the process works chair also asked if there is any other legal or legislative tool that can be used other than a gift of money stated that he cannot believe that the average taxpayer would not agree to pay more per year if they were to believe that would help because of all the things going on with children chair stated at this point there has been so much state involvement especially where the state employs the caseworkers who have so much to do with how much is spent that the hands are tied tightly about what can be done to influence how much is being spent he also stated that the decision should not be up to the council to be the ones to say it is raising taxes sanders stated that the community recognizes that most taxpayers will be willing to pay the more per year to help the children who are victims of abuse or neglect unfortunately there are several issues at the level of the state legislature that are now coming back and impacting those very property taxes she also stated that it is very difficult for the individual homeowner to make a distinction between the increases on the bill going to the children versus the increase that will come about because of other impacts on the property tax credits that will be eventually phased out at a time where reassessment has hit so many so on behalf of taxpayers the issue is not whether it is the for the children but a broader issue of what the council was struggling with last year and what brings everyone here today sanders stated that she would like to see a way beyond funding that can help and assist in ensuring that there are not more and more children being driven into the system chair stated that the statute mandates a response whether it is positive or negative therefore a proposal needs to be submitted to either authorize the loan or to oppose borrowing the funds he pledged to help expedite either method of resolving this
