present day sanders and representing council staff was general counsel chair stated that she would like to reiterate her invitation from the last administration and finance committee meeting inviting the public to attend all of the committee meetings as they are where the business of the city is discussed and the public has the opportunity to provide input proposal no appoints ruby to the information technology board ms ruby said that she is willing to serve on the information technology it board and currently serves on a variety of volunteer boards she said that now is a good time for her to step off some of the other boards if necessary in order to effectively serve the it board ms ruby said that it has been an undercurrent of many of her past positions as she worked in the information services agency from to the end of therefore she is fairly familiar with how the city and county agencies are managed and has some ideas for possible improvements sanders asked if ms ruby is a council appointment chair answered in the affirmative sanders said that in reading the ordinance she has a concern relative to the definitions described that are required for the council appointment which indicates that the position requires senior management experience that includes holding or having held line authority over the manager of a data processing area of an organization in county that is comparable to the city county installation sanders said that although she appreciates all of ms experience and she realizes that ms ruby was employed with the city for a while it is unfortunate that the qualification as described is not met by ms ruby chair asked ms ruby to speak to sanders concern ms ruby said that she was a senior manager in and she directed the work of the contractor of that agency in addition she said that she worked with other agency managers in order to implement projects ms ruby said that she currently owns her own law firm of which she directs the it services through her law firm she has a contracting company that performs some of the it services as well as an independent contractor who works for her chair sanders said that she appreciates ms experience however the ordinance clearly requires line authority over the manager of a data processing area of an organization that is comparable to the size of the city she said that she is sure that ms ruby has a worthy legal firm but she would argue that it would not be comparable to the size of the city chair asked ms ruby if she was in management with the city ms ruby answered in the affirmative chair said that this would seem to fulfill that particular requirement sanders said that the ordinance is very specific in terms of the authority commented that she believes a good example of what is intended by the definition as written in the ordinance would be someone like the gentleman who has served on the it board for the last several years who is an it director at chair asked if all of the members of the board meet this specific criteria sanders answered that the mayors appointment and the councils appointment are the two appointments that are required to meet that criteria the other members of the board are city officers and constitutional office holders which is why it is imperative that the mayors and councils appointments have this type of experience sanders said that a corporation comparable to or universities would have information services agencies and individuals who are managers over the managers of data processing would be the caliber of individual to which this refers sanders said that her concern is not a reflection of ms ruby as a person or of her experience she is simply referring to the ordinance requirements asked ms ruby what her title was when she worked for the city ms ruby answered that she was the senior information technology planner for commented that there is no agency more similar to the agency than the agency and ms title was senior manager therefore he feels that this experience qualifies ms ruby for the appointment sanders said that ms ruby have managed a particular account but she did not manage the entire agency said that he speaks in favor of the proposal and he feels that the technical argument is not relevant with respect to ms qualifications chair asked if he had any comments regarding this issue answered that he believes that it is the committees decision as to whether they feel that the applicant meets the qualifications said that she suspects that the reason for the language in the statute is because of the desire for the council to be able to bring the expertise and experiences of other large entities that are dealing with it issues on an basis to the it board while there have been some experience within the own technology enterprise the fact is that the statute was seeking to bring a broader experience from the two key board positions it was an effort to understand how other big agencies handle their issues moved seconded by sanders to table proposal no to afford the committee the opportunity to talk further with other members of the it board or to more clearly understand the qualifications chair asked ms ruby if she would mind the committee postponing the proposal until a later date sanders stated as a point of order that a motion to table does not allow for further discussion chair said that she understands that but she wants to make sure that it would not be a hardship for ms ruby if the committee postponed the proposal ms ruby answered that it would not be a problem the motion failed by a vote of with day and asked ms ruby if she feels that her experience will allow her to meet the requirements of the ordinance ms ruby answered in the affirmative she stated that she has attended a variety of conferences that the it board has not attended in the past she has on the bar associations science and technology section and participated in their seminars of her own accord and she has several it clients she feels that this experience will allow her to provide a different perspective to the it board that would encompass larger organizations moved

that ms is very familiar with the operation of local government and she appreciates her willingness to serve sanders asked if anyone knows the requirements of this particular appointment chair answered that she does not have the information available but she believes ms is said that there are no special requirements day moved seconded by to forward proposal no to the chair stated that the council always appreciates the willingness of citizens to serve assessor county general fund to cover the cost of contracting for the reassessment of commercial and industrial property as ordered by the department of local government county assessor distributed a handout attached as exhibit a and discussed the following key points reassessment order the department of local government finance ordered county to reassess all of its real property on this was in response to the substantial increases that taxpayers saw when tax bills that are payable in were sent out the assessors office was able to meet the cost limitation of million residential properties were allowed to be assessed internally through the county and township assessors offices the assessors office was ordered to complete the reassessment by but information was presented to the to ask for an extension the assessors office hopes to have all of the reassessment values completed by the assessors office is not required to perform reassessments and physical inspections on each parcel individually selection of vendor the professional appraiser is a specific designation granted by the there is an available list of professional appraisers that are already certified in by the all professional appraisers on the list were notified as part of the selection request for expressions of interest was posted on the website and the only two proposals were received one proposal requested to complete work in a period of one year which was unacceptable because the reassessment order requested that the work be completed in six months inc had to determine a mass appraisal valuation of each of the commercial and industrial properties one of the methods for assessing property is by using the replacement cost minus depreciation in order to use this method a determination must be made as to what it would cost to replace a building the cost data that the assessors office uses that was given by the is using the costs that went into effect in the order required the vendor to pick cost information that reflects the cost to replace a building as of which is the valuation date that the assessors office is required to use when assessing properties in inc updated the cost tables so that the proper cost methodology could be information was taken out of the assessors aged computer system and converted to be used in a more modernized database and managed more easily in the short time frame allotted stated that he used the wrong terminology for the division that inc has arranged they have divided county into nine commercial and four industrial this reflects that certain geographical areas can affect the value of a property each has been divided into tax neighborhoods a neighborhood in assessment practices is a way to lump properties into homogenous groups example group with inc had to perform this task from scratch because the assessment methodology was changed in and the current method was not very effective in ensuring that like parcels were being fairly compared the statistical measures for the analysis are dictated by the and rules and statutes have also adopted the standards from the international association of assessing officers inc is taking regression analysis and performing modeling to help the assessors choose the factors that should be used to determine the value of different properties once the statistics are compared to the new cost data that has been implemented adjustments must be made to ensure accuracy and uniformity budget process said that he feels that the reassessment was appropriately forced on the assessors by state government as there was much to correct in the last years assessments consulted with the office of finance and management and council leadership during the reassessment process and disclosed the cost of the vendor after negotiations a decision was made during the presentation of the county assessors budget for that stated that the vendor expense would not be involved due to the late announcement of the order and the fact that the actual vendor cost had not yet been negotiated the expense was not included in any of the assessors budgets appeals were based on the previous assessments that have now been nullified and will hopefully be corrected with the reassessment said that in the first reassessment that took into account market value resulted in nearly appeals and he is predicting that the number will be nearly that for this reassessment his office currently only has the capacity to handle the average number of appeals which is about he anticipates that he will be asking the council for more help later in the year to address the increased number of appeals hopefully the reassessments will eliminate a majority of the appeals state law requires that the county pay for the reassessment whether or not there is an appropriation awarded by the fiscal body for example if the proposal is rejected the county assessor still turn the invoice in to the county auditor and payment must be rendered chair asked about the positive implications of the reassessment answered that he believes that homeowners will experience some relief as a result of the reassessment but the amount of relief is unknown it depends on how much additional assessed value is obtained from commercial and industrial parcels also added that he believes that taxpayers both residential and commercial will estimate that everyone is seemingly paying their fair share of the burden of providing for local government services sanders asked if the commercial assessment was originally increased by two percent answered that he is unsure but the governor and the were concerned that only of all of the different commercial and industrial parcels had any change at all which implicated that they were possibly not examined for any changes said that he is confident however that changes will be made on more than of the parcels by the time the reassessments are complete sanders said that she is concerned with the process of mass appraisal but she understands that there is no time for all of the facilities to be physically reassessed she asked if there was some type of random identification or inspection of given sites to set perimeters for like buildings or if no inspections were performed at all answered that the basics of assessment involves a physical inspection on each new building as it is constructed which includes taking measurements recording the buildings attributes and inputting the information into the property system sanders asked if the information in the property system was in the system before the last assessment answered in the affirmative and stated that the size and measurement of each building is in the system added that the code also requires that a building permit be obtained for any new construction the building permit is copied to the township assessor which should prompt a new inspection of the premises sanders asked if any spot check inspections were completed as a part of the reassessment answered that the vendor completed surveys before they presented their bid and physical inspections have been done if the statistical measures and current building data were not accurate he stated that other methods for assessing property without going to the site are the original building data aerial photography and that allows a building to be viewed at all angles he added that a physical inspection is only necessary when the replacement cost methodology is being used the other two methods are sales comparison and income and expense valuation and the assessors rely more on sales comparison everyone that sells a property must file a sales disclosure stating the price that the property was sold for and identifying the parcel number said that approximately sales occur each year in county which provides a large statistical sample sanders asked if there are commercial sales that occur each year answered in the negative and stated that this number represents all parcel sales sanders said that she is concerned with commercial sales because they could be ten to fifteen years old said that when the sales analysis is being used the assessors are required to look at the sales for a particular year and estimate a value for those particular buildings he said that for the statistical analysis for this assessment year they used the sales from and he does not remember the exact number of sales but he believes that there were more than there were less than by the time they were reviewed he said that they also use other measures to determine if the samples are adequate for the statistics analysis if a valid statistical sample is unavailable additional years be examined sanders asked if the state provided any funding to help with the reassessment that they ordered answered in the negative and stated that there was discussion as to whether political pressure could be put on the state to encourage financial assistance which have been part of the reason that the appropriation was not included in the budget request asked sanders why the assessors office was restricted to not exceed million for the reassessments sanders answered that a maximum amount was established because originally the cost of the reassessments was unknown since the city was short on revenues for it was suggested that it would be beneficial to try to find other ways to fund the reassessment and hope that the state would provide some assistance stated that during the negotiations with inc it was agreed upon that there would be no payments made in he added that the whole reassessment process triggered a shortfall in revenues because taxpayers were instructed to pay the amount therefore the budgeted amount was not being collected stated that she does not feel that mass appraisal is the most fair and equitable way to assure that all taxpayers are being assessed accurately she said that there are many other states that do not use the mass appraisal approach she said that it appears that it cost approximately for each property to be assessed through the reassessment she asked if could track the number of appeals that actually have to be processed and look at some of the neighboring states that do not perform mass appraisals to determine if they experience the same amount of appeals said that she would be interested to know what the amount would be to do individual appraisals for residential properties said that he believes that the average cost of the appraisals was about per parcel for this particular reassessment contract he said that during general assessments not under the time pressure that the county experienced mass appraisals typically cost about per year per parcel for an assessment office to keep track of each parcel he said that one calculation that can be used in terms of residential parcels is to look at someone getting their house appraised to refinance their home the cost range from to if one assumes that each costs and then multiplies that by the residential parcels in county it would amount to over million to perform individual assessments additionally to calculate a cost for the amount of time it would take an employee of the assessors office to do the assessments should also be considered if it took an employee an hour to do each parcel the cost would be well over million just for residential properties said that he believes that it is too expensive for local government to perform repetitive physical inspections on each property and assessors should be able to rely on the initial data collected data gathered from building permits and statistical analyses he said that the difficulty lies in how much time money and resources the county wants to spend to get as accurate as possible and if the community is willing to double the cost to obtain a small amount of additional accuracy chair asked if the county is able to keep the database and work product that the vendor completed answered in the affirmative and stated that the contract states that the data belongs to the county and not the vendor however he is unsure if the county will receive the exact depth and detail of their data because of the differences between their computer system and the said that the council approved an expenditure of million last year to replace the old computer system with a new system he said that they are in the conversion and testing process and trying to get the new system online as soon as possible the new system will provide more detail and analysis capabilities once it is in place chair asked if the new system will enable the commercial and industrial assessments to be done answered in the affirmative however he believes that the county assessors office is the place to best do the commercial and industrial assessments he stated that the nine commercial that the vendor created do not coincide with the township borders and therefore would create difficulty for the township assessors to perform the assessments he also stated that some of the township offices not have the staff available to accurately perform the assessments chair stated that the assessors budget was increased by million and asked if any of that amount was intended to pay for the contract with inc answered in the negative and stated that the increase was to pay for additional very skilled and competent assessing staff to help direct most of the residential reassessment he said that he does not have the information available for all of the areas that the increase affected but he does not believe that the entire amount was given he said that the county assessors office is fully staffed for the first time in a long time chair said that her concern is that the appropriation being requested to pay for the contract is to be taken from the county general fund which currently has a balance of approximately million she said that she has been in touch with council chief financial officer and he recommends that the council approve the appropriation moved seconded by to forward proposal no to the
