meeting and asked for the committees approval to alter the order of the meeting to allow the county coroner to present first there were no objections county coroner said that there have been a few changes since his election which include no longer working with the sheriff for vehicles and gasoline and that university will no longer perform autopsies for the department after th was planning to eliminate the entire staff but the coroners office would like to have the staff work for them instead of having to recruit new people said that the idea of having staff work with the coroners office has worked well so far instead of having to recruit people at this time he said that mostly all the staff is interested except for one therefore the transition is going well with a transition of this nature there is a monetary difference which is the reason for coming before the committee john chief deputy coroner read a typed statement included in exhibit a of the coroners presentation clerks note a full printout of exhibit a is on file in the council office with the original set of minutes discussion included an overview of the county coroners offices responsibilities a list of the

expenditures information on fleet services supporting information on the need and reason for conducting autopsies also included in exhibit a are a copy of the county proposed budget documentation of costs for monthly supplies and outside services provided by pathology last year budget documents of cities comparable in size to including st and explained that has conducted autopsies for the county coroners office for the past years but will no longer support a forensic science division at the university the university gave the coroners office a day notice that they will no longer perform autopsy services the last time the coroners office was trying to find a forensic pathologist it took seven months and that one was recruited from in town if it is necessary to recruit from another city days is not enough time the coroners office has a proposal that was presented by members of forensic pathology to continue the service but due to the elimination of reduced costs for hospital supplies linen services and hazardous waste services the coroners office would be faced with paying an additional per month to support the service with he said that there are no other forensic pathologists in town therefore leaving no option to go elsewhere he said that the coroners office could try to get private autopsies done but they only perform forensic autopsies and the most inexpensive private autopsy would cost about plus additional costs was providing those services in the past for about with the new service it would cost about each which is still well below stated that he has looked over the numbers and the coroners office has the bare minimum of staffing he said that of the appropriate full time equivalent positions the coroners office only has but the additional has to be saved for the part time staff he said the operational supplies reflect the actual cost of performing an autopsy and the supplies to perform the autopsy based on a month period he said that the coroners office conforms to alternative ways to reduce spending for example buying paper directly from an office supply store as opposed to using the paper that xerox offers because of a better price and being able to purchase vehicles elsewhere at a lower price than what the sheriffs office offers he said that although these things are done there is not much room to reduce their budget or staff they are also looking for other ways to generate more consumer revenue but have not yet noticed the benefits of current efforts returned to the department in the way of additional funding he asked that the committee look over the information that he has provided and consider the need of the coroners office mentioned that the suicide rate in county unfortunately is up by about

staff as long as possible as part of these cutbacks the coroners office has an answering machine that answers calls about of the time which is unacceptable for a city of our size did not buy police radios this year therefore some of the deputies have no way of communicating with the police department did not purchase new computers and is sharing vehicles to stay under budget the hour shifts are stressful for the employees and there is a need to increase staff asked how many more employees the coroners budget calls for said they functionally have but on paper it shows but the funding that is represented by the additional positions is needed to cover for time taken off by a deputy asked if the coroner is asking for additional employees answered that the coroners office needs to absorb more employees but part of that is through university he said that the office would be funding which is what they have been appropriated but have not funded in the past the coroners office was given additional last year but no money was given to pay for those positions and that is what is needed now asked about the rent and for the copier that the coroners office has in its budget said that the

far he can make it on the current budget and thinks there will have to be a reexamination based on the final conclusion with the pathologist said that some of the information that he has was just given to him this afternoon therefore he has not had a chance to discuss the changes with asked if the total budget amount of million on the last page of exhibit a is reflecting that the coroners office is asking for an additional million over the budgeted amount of million that the controllers office has allotted said that the reflects the original amount requested by the coroners office

change and a few other supplies asked if the coroners office is trying to recover the that was reduced from the budget answered in the affirmative franklin asked why the sheriffs office discontinued

were looked at last year with autopsies or examinations conducted and the coroners office is expected to do the same this year the difference be in the cause of the cases whether homicide accident or suicide brown commented in regard to statement of saving money by purchasing copy paper from an office supply store that the difference is that xerox offers a package that includes the copy paper and the amount the departments are charged to copy he also asked if the vehicles that stated that he could purchase for a lower price are used or brand new vehicles answered that the vehicles they were able to purchase were new vehicles that were two years old and still on the lot that were not able to be sold some were demos oliver asked if a fee can be charged on the autopsies said only if a

does not have the exact number but it is high he said that he thinks that paying more money to people who are sacrificing is the right thing to do he said that it also be due to law school graduates

some have said this will be a and that extra jail beds will not be needed he does not believe that and feels that all police officers should continue to work more officers should be added to the sheriff and that more jail beds are needed asked if he could explain what the additional is for that is included in the revised budget said that the original amount was a mistake and the revised version included the correct amount said the that was added back to the county general fund was originally requested in the diversion fund but there was not sufficient revenue in the diversion fund it

the clerks perpetuation fund to cover expenses and more importantly to the clerks office the salary increases and health insurance benefit increases that are in character said that there were a number
