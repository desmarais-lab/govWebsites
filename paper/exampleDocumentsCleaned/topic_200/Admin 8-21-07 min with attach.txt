decrease she said that slide eight illustrates revenues generated by the auditors office asked why there is an difference between and revenues ms stated that the decrease in charges for services is caused by the shift of drug free community fees from the auditor to the justice agency she said that the decrease in intergovernmental revenues is due to grant reimbursements some agencies used to have some character costs paid through grants and that money used to flow through the auditors office she said that the large decrease in miscellaneous revenues is due to the anticipated borrowing of million of the county option income tax notes in that will not be borrowed in she said the decrease in transfers from various funds in is money that will not be transferred county administrator deputy auditor distributed a handout detailing the presentation exhibit and stated that the tax revenues are property taxes that are received for the cumulative capital development fund and the juvenile incarceration fund she said the transfers out are from the cumulative capital development fund to various funds and these have been done historically asked if the city is required to have the county administrator as a separate entity of government ms stated that it is actually being used more now than it has in the past the administrator budget was created to cover those expenses that were not associated to a particular agency asked if there is a parallel agency on the city side and if not how this is handled stated that the city has a character and the city has a debt service schedule while the county does not stated that she is looking for parallels in the hopes that someday the two can merge stated that there are a lot of differences between the two ms stated that she does not believe that the two will be the same in all aspects she said that some of the differences between the city and county make sense and this agency is one of them ms stated that character is being increased because there is a state mandated increase for mental health subsidies she said that auto liability insurance is also in the administrators budget she said the major changes in the administrator budget is the transfer of the noble center and mental health service agencies fair board local emergency planning and right to know and juvenile incarceration debt service from the auditors budget asked which committee hears the fair board and noble centers presentations chair sanders stated that it is the community affairs committee asked if they have presented already chair sanders answered in the affirmative asked for the status of their budgets chair sanders stated that they remained flat chair sanders asked for public testimony none was given treasurer distributed a handout detailing the presentation exhibit stated that the treasurer has been distributing the taxes collected to the townships without delay this distribution means that the townships do not have to borrow money to cover expenses and saves the taxpayers money she said that she is sure that it creates more work for the staff of the treasurers office but it is very much appreciated the taxpayers should know that the treasurer is helping everyone save money stated that they sent a letter to the largest corporations in county asking them to pay their taxes early eighteen corporations responded and made payments before tax bills were sent out he said they collected million and that allowed them to make the advance payments to the townships stated that the treasurer collects taxes including property taxes last year they collected billion and this year they were projected to collect billion however the governors order to freeze property taxes at levels and reassess property changed everything he said that the budget will essentially remain flat from to he said that there are things that the treasurers office is mandated to do and they have to come back to the council for additional appropriations later in the year he said that they have employees and during the tax season they often employ employees to assist he said they received many compliments regarding the service citizens received from staff they did not receive the irate customers and complaints in this tax cycle as in other tax cycles he believes that part of that is due to the quality of the staff and part of it is due to the reprieve they received it is extremely important for people to understand that there will be more than two tax bills this season the spring that was already sent the revised in the fall and there will be a reconciling the reconciling will push the later in the year but there will be a fall then also he said once the money is collected there is usually a lag time before it is distributed to the units of government he said tom deputy treasurer has done a good job investing the money and getting the highest rates for those investments he said they have exceeded the revenue projected each year it will be tough to exceed the revenue goals this year but they will do their best chair sanders stated that the investment revenue goals are tied to the fact that the treasurers office is distributing the money to the local units of government quickly stated that they normally collect on but were unable to do so until he said he has confidence that will meet those revenue goals chair sanders stated that even if the revenue goals are not met they should take into account that the money saved by the local units by not borrowing should be considered in that formula stated that the treasurers office has been providing analysis to other local government agencies as well as the general assembly regarding the fiscal implications of these tax difficulties he said that many people do not understand how money flows through local government but land deputy administrator has done a great job explaining it to the legislators and the general public stated that slide two illustrates some of the problems and expenses that will be created due to reassessment he added that there will not be a tax sale this year due to the collection this is a loss of million he said they receive approximately in additional revenues that will drop in and citizens used to use enhanced access to get their tax information online at a cost of per transaction but this year they were able to post all tax information online for free access he said some of the enhanced revenue will continue to be generated because the mortgage companies search for information in bulk asked if there is a law requiring tax bills to be mailed even if someone signed a waiver preferring to receive their bills electronically stated that there is a statute that requires two installment payments with bills sent out ms land stated that they have changed the statute recently to include a comparison statement every year she added that other counties have not sent an informational tax mailing to homeowners who pay property taxes through escrow but county sends them stated that it is a good idea but it would take a lot of work to input all that data added that the spring mailing costs in postage every time the state talks about unfunded mandates this is the minimal cost this year they tried to offset those costs by selling inserts as a way to bring in revenue it generated around and that covered about half of the increased postage cost stated that perhaps there would be a way for a taxpayer to fill out an online form that would let the treasurers office know not to send that person a tax chair sanders said that could be costly also stated that the council has allowed for the replacement of the property tax software system and hopefully it will allow for a lot of the information to be available online stated that some of their increases this year were due to the governors orders including employment of temporary employees for a longer period of time and extended office hours he said slide four illustrates the call spike they received in that trend will continue through when the reconciling bills are received he said they still recommend that the rebate become a credit instead of an additional mailing he said slide three illustrates total interest earnings from stated that they will have to come back before the council for additional appropriations as the state continues to make changes she said that the county general fund balance shows on page of proposal no brown stated that is the old balance printed but the new revenues increased that slightly stated that the public defender will receive higher reimbursements from the state some of the auditors functions be able to be funded through the auditors endorsement fund and or million of the local option income tax will be placed in reserve stated that this answers her question regarding whether there will be enough money in reserve to pay for the additional costs stated that they have been looking for underspending and other ways to pay for the costs of this reassessment and many agencies have been helping the justice agency is giving of their general fund spending back the public defenders office prosecutors office and the crime lab have all identified underspending said that she is glad to hear it because the treasurers office is facing financial hardships due to circumstances beyond their control stated that the unknowns that will be coming in the future will require everyone to be flexible he said that the state legislature will make changes to the property tax system in response to the outcry of citizens but no one knows what those changes will be he said he hopes that one of those changes will be allowing the rebate to be applied as a credit to the he said that sending out a rebate check will also require a lot of bookkeeping they will have to review every homeowners tax liabilities for their home and other properties before determining the amount of the rebate chair sanders stated that the rebate checks could also have income tax implications on homeowners said that another complication is that people will buy and sell property between now and he said that they cannot close until all the bills are sent out and the cycle cannot be started until is closed the new software have glitches while things are migrated and this is another area that requires flexibility asked if the budget that is presented will be worked with for the time being and if the controllers office had input on this budget stated that this budget is being used as a starting point county commissioners treasurer distributed a handout detailing the presentation exhibit and stated that there are three commissioners the county assessor the county auditor and the county treasurer they meet monthly and make appointments to boards the commissioners have one employee that works on the appeals for public assistance the budget for the year is brown asked for a list of the appeals made due to a township trustee denying assistance to someone by township stated that he just asked for that information and it will be heard at the meeting and he will provide a copy to brown stated that she would also like that list and would also like information on cases in which the trustees decision was overturned because of new information stated that in all fairness many of the denials were caused because the person seeking relief did not bring in the documents that are required brown stated that he would like the list to be broken down into demographics also stated that the trustees offices would have that information said that the townships keep demographic information but not by race as that is illegal said that the commissioners have made several appointments this year half of them have been and half have been female brown asked if the previous commissioners made diverse appointments said that this commission has tried to appoint people that reflect the diversity of the county tom glass county alliance of neighborhood associations stated that they believe there are too many taxpayers who cannot pay their tax bills many of those that can pay them will have their budgets destroyed for the year or even their lives it is imperative that this is corrected it is unfair that the entire county budget is being dumped on citizens he said that spending abatements and tax exempt properties need to be addressed by the council chair sanders stated that she appreciates the comments but the city and county only represent about of the property tax she said that she hopes that glass heard the council members going through each budget and holding the line on spending in these committee meetings she said that each meeting has shown that each agency is struggling with trying to fund raises for city and county employees which are some of the lowest paid employees in the county she said that everyone here is a property owner in county and she knows what it is like to get a that has been increased four times since she said they are not spendthrifts who dump taxes on taxpayers she believes that they are fairly fiscally responsible glass stated that he saw the graph showing the number of phone calls the treasurers office has received and would like to remind the committee that not everyone is calling there are probably more people not calling who cannot afford their tax bills he said that he has seen pictures of people trying to sell their properties this is a problem because sellers will not be able to find buyers if the taxes are unreasonable but if the owner cannot afford the taxes they will have no choice but to move he said that this could cause a lot of houses to sit vacant and no one will benefit from it he added that this is an issue to which is paying attention he said abatements are a problem and not enough notice is being given to the public about those properties that be abated and how they affect the tax load on citizens chair sanders said she agrees with many of the points made there are abatements that contribute to the tax load she said exempted properties are under the jurisdiction of the state she would suggest that join the in approaching the general assembly to ask for change ms land stated that many people have called the treasurers office in the belief that all local spending is controlled by the city she said that of the increases in tax levies this year are attributable to schools and welfare she said that she hopes taxpayers go to school board township and other unattended meetings the largest portion of the budget is in areas that are not controlled by the city she said it is the smaller meetings to which people need to pay attention stated that he include a simple pie chart insert in the next tax to give people a better understanding of where their tax money is being spent stated that his mortgage company paid both tax amounts the amount and the amount he said that people should check their bills and the reassessment only result in a reduction brown stated that of the tax is under the control of the city and county and asked if the property tax levy has increased or decreased stated that the city levy is lower now than it was in the county is higher because of the debt service levy for juvenile incarceration he said that he understands that the library and health and hospital corporation are attempting to lower their levies also brown said that all of the agencies have been working to reduce their budgets chair sanders stated that the republican caucus should make their recommendations of cuts to the budget sooner rather than later so that they can better be analyzed and implemented stated that the outside efficiency study requested by the recorders office could be held although it is a small amount of money it is many small amounts that add up to a large reduction in spending he said that goes to the city and goes to the county and asked what goes where stated that the way the pie chart is divided is often confusing he said that it is also confusing because of the various taxing districts in center township the levy is but in the surrounding townships the levy is in the as a percentage said the biggest piece of the tax levy is due to the school districts it ranges from to of the total levy the percentages are being averaged for the county but change for each of the taxing districts ms stated that there is an accounting correction the surveyors perpetuation fund balance on line should indicate estimated revenue for at for a cash balance of million at the end of the budget and revenues for should be higher at chair sanders reiterated that the administration and finance committee meeting will be held
