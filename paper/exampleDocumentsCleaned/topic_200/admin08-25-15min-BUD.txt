the following members present hunter jack and lewis and arrived shortly thereafter chief financial officer brown and fiscal analyst represented council staff county recorder introduced chief deputy and provided committee members with a presentation handout attached as exhibit a ms reviewed some brief initiatives implemented since she took office in including an office reorganization cross training records management review and adding the electronic recording methods and she said that the budget has slightly increased due to the implementation of those electronic recording methods and their microfilm digitization project she said that revenues are not expected to change much she said that their general fund budget has decreased mostly due to reorganization however the perpetuation fund which funds most of their offices duties is being depleted and a new funding source needs to be identified before when that balance will go negative if current spending continues chair asked if it is accurate to say that the recorders office generates revenue for the general fund but is pretty much living off of the perpetuation fund ms said that this is correct clerks note and arrived at pm asked why the security protection fund line item is projected to double in ms stated that fifty cents from everything that is recorded goes into that fund and that fund was created by the general assembly to eradicate social security numbers from documents she said that she believes there is approximately million in that fund and it is appropriate to use the bulk of that money approximately million for their digitization project because social security numbers still need to be redacted from these documents from to asked if this is the reason for the jump in other services and charges and if this redaction activity is contracted out ms said that the redaction and indexing will be done by their office staff asked what the increase in contracts is for in that case ms said that this is for the microfilm digitization asked if the office has been streamlined to meet budget restrictions ms responded in the affirmative and said that they eliminated three funded positions brown chief financial officer for the council said that the recorders office is spending more than they are bringing in he asked for clarification that in ms is saying their offices entire expenditures will be transferred over to the general fund ms said that this is correct if they continue funding as they currently are brown asked if they anticipate still bringing in revenue in the amount of approximately in said that this is correct and they are bringing in about in perpetuation dollars but are spending to those reserve perpetuation funds that have been used to supplement will be depleted by brown said that they can still use the coming in to fund operations though and they are really only shifting of expenses to the general fund not the whole ms said that this is correct chair asked if the perpetuation fund fees can be raised ms said that those fees are set by state statute and cannot be raised by the recorders office chair said that she thought the idea behind the creation of this fund was to cover expenses incurred therefore if they are not covering expenses over time then these fees need to be increased brown said that they will look up that statute and see what the parameters are ms said that the fund was set up for recorders across the state to do what they had to to maintain their records and protect the documents that they are required by law to protect chair said that the state needs to look at raising these fees if they are currently not covering their costs and doing what the fund was set up to do ms said that they routinely speak to their legislators about this and would encourage others to do the county surveyor introduced deputy surveyor and presented committee members with a handout of a presentation attached as exhibit ms reviewed the challenges facing her office their accomplishments and their goals for the coming year ms said that she requested an additional employee but was not granted that addition in the budget that was introduced by the office of finance and management she said that they currently only have seven equivalent employees and one employee to staff a office she said that with all of the infrastructure improvements going on around the county she is concerned that they are understaffed they really need three more people out in the field but only requested one and that request was not granted she said that they are continuing to look for additional funding to help with this staffing concern she said that their office is funded out of three separate funds county general fund surveyors perpetuation fund and county elected officials training fund their revenue sources come from copy fees deeds and alcohol and tobacco control form fees which was added late by this council ms said that she has lowered their costs in all other characters but is in desperate need of more personnel she said that she has used as much of the perpetuation fund as she can with only of their budget coming out of the general fund and the remaining being funded by the perpetuation fund chair asked if ms biggest concern is that they are not adequately staffed ms said that this is correct and that prior to her taking office they had staff and when she took office there were four she said that they were able to address some funding for equipment a few years ago which was desperately needed at that time but with all the infrastructure improvements going on around the county they are now in dire need of more employees she said that their employees require a specific set of technical skills and competing with private engineering or surveying companies for these individuals is next to impossible with the salaries they are able to offer chair asked how the surveyors salaries compare with the rates of the private sector ms said that their salaries are to less than the private sector offers while they could hire interns and immediate college graduates once they get the experience they do not stay around long enough to help solve the problem she said that she is fortunate to have some current employees who have stayed around for a long time some even up to years asked how many positions have not been hired that the surveyor has needed in the last two or three years ms said at least three referred to the memorandum of understanding with the department of public works and asked what that is about ms said that this is when they need to have a surveyor on site with a project and this money comes from the subcontractor asked why an is needed when helping out other departments ms said that this was suggested by their counsel and this funding has been helpful chair asked how much it will cost for an additional three ms said that the starting salary is plus benefits chair said that this low a salary being offered for an employee with specific technical skills is ridiculous for a city like brown said that like the recorders office the surveyors perpetuation fund has supplemented their budget for a long time and it will be totally expended by the end of he said that at that time they will see a shift of in funding from the perpetuation fund to the general fund due to that depletion and this is an even greater immediate and dire funding issue chair asked if the general assembly could adjust the fees ms said that surveyors across the state are before the general assembly every year asking for an increase and the issue has not yet gotten to the floor or to a committee she said that continuing to deplete the perpetuation fund and creating new fees is simply not working brown asked how much of the surveyors employees time is spent on streets and sidewalks ms said that their employees are out there every day addressing these issues ms said that they do not have enough people to handle it all and with the increased infrastructure improvements it will only get worse sometimes because she does not have enough people to get out to a site this prolongs the completion of projects asked how much of the surveyors work is dependent on and she asked if that rate can be increased ms said that this would be appreciated if it is possible brown said that they can look into that hunter asked if the surveying being done by professional firms on county projects transfers to the surveyors office ms said that the skills would transfer but the surveyors office cannot compete with the salaries private companies are offering hunter said that he is referring more to the data and computer aided design cad files and asked if these cannot be shared ms said that their office operates under very specific state mandates and they have to sign off on work by private firms often and actually have to that data she said that this is mostly survey work and their office deals more with corners hunter said that if they are putting in a sewer line they would still be looking at the same data that the surveyors office is confirming and he asked what prohibits the transfer of those files ms said that these surveying firms use the surveyors section corners information and if they are not updated or accurate it affects the work being done ms said that the statute that governs their offices duties and standard of work has very strict parameters the surveying companies are shooting to please their clients and meet their guidelines but the surveyors office has to meet the states requirements hunter said that it seems someone could work to streamline this process with the support of counties and he is surprised there is not someone who can work on a study to see how all this sophisticated survey data can be shared ms said that the work the private engineering and surveying firms are doing is a little different than what her office does hunter said that it seems if these firms are relying on this surveying data that part of the permit process could be to streamline this data collecting and determine what needs to be verified and what can be shared as it seems of the same data is being collected he said that it just seems there could be some efficiencies found ms said that the data these companies access is as accurate as her office makes it for them to shoot from hunter asked if she has to go back and review work an engineering firm has done to make sure it is accurate ms said that they do not look at what these particular firms do but they are doing government surveying as required by the state and these surveyors refer to her data as all of this data comes in different layers and she is not specifically looking at their project hunter said that it seems worth looking into to see what efficiencies could be found ms said that she has not had much success with changes on the state level but she has appreciated all the help the council has given her in finding other funding sources asked if all their fees are governed by the state ms said that all except for the recent fees established through the council asked if private companies pay for the use of the surveyors information ms said that as a government office she cannot charge them stated that she can however charge through an and it seems these options need to be investigated further county clerk introduced chief financial officer recognized other staff members and provided committee members with a presentation attached as exhibit ms said that her numbers will show the amount her office requested in budgeting and actual introduced and the difference in funding between the two she said that the full difference of what was requested to sustain her office and what recommended is she said that next year is a presidential election year which will require more work as they are required to conduct a successful election she said that the budget cut that is asking them to make will require them to cut seasonal staff that typically work for three months as well as being unable to hire an additional workers needed for a presidential election due to some changes at the state absentee voter registrations increase and that will cause the need for overtime or additional staff also the central counting system did not eliminate the need for providing bipartisan teams at each polling location which they are required by law to pay she said that besides seasonal staff other charges out of their control are the information services agency she said that they expected these to increase but they did not expect them to increase ms said that she has served as deputy director and director of elections since and she knows what it takes to conduct a successful election money manpower and machines she said that it is impossible to conduct a successful election without the proper working voting equipment she said that it was inevitable that new voting equipment would be needed eventually and yet these costs were cut out of her budget she said that they have already begun the request for proposals process but this was unilaterally cut out of her budget she said that they are the only jurisdiction voting on two types of voting machines and it is important that new voting equipment be purchased she said that they requested million for this purchase and she would like the committee to consider allocating that money for them to move into the th century she said that voter turnout is embarrassingly low in and they are working tirelessly to increase that turnout but this requires money if they did have turnout she asked them to imagine what kind of an investment that would take to handle brown clarified that the million the clerk is requesting for is only the payment on a total purchase price of approximately million director of elections said that this is correct and the million is budgeted as a placeholder for the initial debt service payment brown added that although clerk stated that her budget had been cut by it was not actually cut but items they asked for or requested in addition to budget guidelines were simply not approved in the final introduction said that she recalls when city controller presented the budget for he indicated a huge increase in costs would be absorbed by his office said that there was an increase in across the board and they did not make agencies absorb that expense within their budget and worked to hold agencies and departments harmless he said that a pot of money was moved around and they made base budget adjustments so that this was not funded out of operations asked why presented a budget that is inadequate for an effective successful election said that they know of the clerks request for additional expenditures but they do not yet know those actual costs they will be happy to address those with a cleanup ordinance like they have done in the past asked why they are experiencing an increase of over in charges ms said that they were told the increase is due to the number of they have and charges because of seasonal employees stated that in the assessors office where she works charged them for every employee in the office to have access to the financial system she said that only five individuals in their office actually need access to this in relation to their job but they were charged more to allow all employees access to the and budget she said that she thinks this is outrageous and when they raised the question with they apparently cannot do anything about it this year but will work it out next year she asked if the election board asked for a breakdown of charges ms said that their first bill this year was extremely high and they were able to work with them to amend that bill but for they are being charged for all seasonal employees to have access said that this is ridiculous as most agencies do not allow all employees access to their financing software ms said that they are planning to sit down with to see if there is a way to decrease this number and she is hopeful that they can asked excluding the purchase of voting machines how these budget numbers compare to budget numbers in order to compare apples to apples with a presidential election year ms said that she is not prepared to answer that question this evening but can provide it chair thanked ms and asked that she forward that information to the committee clerk to distribute asked if the election board received the money they needed for extra expenses that was promised by the controller after the primary election this year ms said that they did get an additional allocation at the beginning of the year to bring their budget closer in line with their original request she said that they feel they are completely funded for at this point said that it seems is playing the same game they played last year and he does not know why they are not funding the seasonal employees until they see what the cost will be he said that they know they will have these costs he asked if the contract has been signed yet for the voting machines ms said that they are only in the phase at this time and this has to go before the election board first brown said that the was issued to get an idea of how much they would need to spend the vendors are excited about getting the information to the clerks office and they are still in the early phases of this process there are some other funds that could possibly be looked at to help fund this including capital cumulative funds asked if they could go ahead and purchase these machines after the process with an additional appropriation brown answered in the affirmative and said that the contract cannot be signed without an appropriation in place said that he feels the is way too big for such a small agency ms said that she was not involved in the budget process last year because she was running for office if she does not have the answer right away it is because this is her first experiences with the budget process she asked the committee to take into consideration what it takes to run a successful election asked if any savings was realized with the central counting process ms said that it cost approximately more said that the general assembly said it would be a better system and save money chair said that it is too bad they cannot send the bill for the increased cost to the hunter commended clerk on keeping the tradition of having one of the nicest most helpful staffs in the building freeman democrat board member for voters registration introduced republican board member who reviewed a brief presentation attached as exhibit ms stated that if there is no incumbent president running more staff is typically needed to handle voter registration in they processed registrations but in registrations were processed she said that although was a historical year they will still have a larger number of registrations that need to be processed she said that their character is up slightly due to an increase for temporary services overtime for processing increased registrations and some of their employees health care plans changing from single to family there was no change in characters and and the increase in character is due to temporary agency hiring if necessary with increased workload she said that their charges also increased from to and they were told the difference was due to different storage for the voter information portal they looked into getting rid of it to decrease those costs but county clerk said that this portal is used by a lot of voters to make sure their registrations are up to date asked if they are being charged by for everyone in their agency to access the financial reporting system ms said that they have not yet received the documentation on those charges that they requested but she hopes to receive them before the budget is passed general manager of the county building authority introduced the president of the board of trustees don and provided a brief presentation attached as exhibit said that has no taxing authority and the only income they have comes from lease rental on the properties they manage he said that their budget year runs from through and is approved by their board these lease amounts are already included in the city and county agency and department budgets the council reviews they manage a total of properties for a total budget of an increase of over the budget the increase is due to the renovated building plaza maintenance and other capital projects for which a list was given to committee members at their last meeting he said that they did reduce the budget after negotiations with by and the revised budget list shows these reduced numbers he said that the plaza project is in the final design stages and be completed by but for sure in the first quarter of he said that utility costs have the biggest effect on their budgets and weather and rate increases impact those costs he reviewed the proposed capital repairs and said that while the building authority has a capital repair plan they do not have the funding to complete everything on that list and these proposed projects will meet the most immediate needs said that the lease area space in the is per square foot if they do not include the common areas if all the building manager standards were factored in it would be approximately per square foot asked what added maintenance is needed for the plaza said that this is an estimate if the plaza includes a temporary ice skating rink with an interactive fountain when the fountain is shut down is a budgeted item of operation for a vendor to bring in a skating rink and operate it there would be added utilities due to pumps for the fountain display increased electrical water and trash removal services asked if the skating rink vendor would be paid to operate or if they would rent space from said that would pay a contract for them to operate and the share in would be negotiated between the vendor and asked if they are working on ways to create more revenue such as with vendors or renting space said that the department of metropolitan development is working on the programming and is only responsible for maintenance asked what kind of increase has been seen with the electrical costs due to the new electric cars said that he is not involved with that as they are metered separately and the city addresses that cost said that he can research that issue and get an answer said that last years rent got deferred and he asked if they are now current with rents said that operates on a different fiscal year and they took that onetime opportunity to shift one payment to the subsequent year but they are now current confirmed that all rents have been paid and are asked about the money budgeted for the public safety training academy and if this involves any improvements said that the only item slated for repair at that facility is replacing the hot water tank at an approximate cost of asked if the metropolitan police department would bid out improvements at the firing range and training academy or if would do that said that they could do that if asked and manage the construction phase and the newly renovated facility asked how the process is going with finding more space for the paternity court said that they are close to acquiring the current auto desk space from which will then move to another location he said that some other dominoes need to take place but they have done some preliminary layouts to address the courts current needs asked if they will need all of the auto desk area said that there will be some space left over
