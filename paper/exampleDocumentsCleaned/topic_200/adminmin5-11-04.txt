issue was addressed in the budget last year and asked why is there a problem now ms said it was addressed for union contracts and weekly employees they determined later in the year that for biweekly employees they needed to be addressed within the confines of the current budget said she believed that when they did budgets last year the salaries where going to be divided into pays and there would not be a need for additional money she asked if that is not what is happening brown said the budget request was the same level of funding as the biweekly salaries they did not increase the budget for biweekly employees they decided to keep the biweekly pay the same for and the council would not be asked for an increase in character for any department asked what are we going to do if we get to the th pay and the money is not there ms said they would have it and they are watching character very closely she said the biggest factor to the th pay issue is overtime and most of the factors are covered under the union contact and if she comes back it will be for a transfer from other characters said she was under the impression last year that the th pay was not going to an issue because the salaries were going to be divided by pays she asked if the city would be coming back to ask for additional money ms said they need to ask for a transfer from other characters but not an allocation

they will completely absorb the th pay and they have some funds left over in character and this will be added back to the underspending plan said printing and copy is a high volume for the department

into it said document is a list of contracts for with not to exceed amounts and all contracts end at the end of sanders asked why the county is not charged for their services said he does not have a good answer but historically since the city and county budgets have been separate there was never a tradition to cross the divide sanders asked if he has looked at the value attached to the services said they could figure that out county auditor said the office is funded from the county consolidated fund which covers all of county and therefore the council would have to provide the county with funds in their budgets to pay the corporation counsel services sanders said she would like to see the value of the services said their lawyers account for their time so the numbers are available chair
