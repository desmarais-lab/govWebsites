expenditures by function is now approximately of the budget and is anticipated to rise to approximately to for expenditures by character of costs are going toward character expenditures which include salaries group insurance pension costs unemployment benefits and other benefits character expenditures reflect that civil employees have not had salary increases in three years as they are not

from fees licenses and other tax revenues property tax rates this shows reference to power point presentation the percentage of each dollar paid in property taxes percent of the total for center township is given to schools the percentage is slightly higher in some townships and faster growing suburban assessed value av from there was a steady climb from there was a reassessment in that reflects a fairly substantial increase in assessed valuation in which the city and county decreased the tax rates to accommodate for the increase the new assessment laws have caused some decline the assessment reflects the reduction in av that will be caused from the loss of the inventory tax growth in av compared to growth in and child services expenditures funding for has been the fastest growing expense and av which is the basis for property taxes has been declining child services expenses are also growing major challenges and expected budget impact biggest challenges will be funding for the police and fire pensions including pension plan there are currently firefighters and police officers receiving pensions from the unfunded pension plan which results in two portions being distributed at the same time for current and retired personnel prior to no money was set aside for rural police districts there are plans to add back the officers that were not included in the budget

infirmary beds the elimination of inventory tax revenue from av will cost the city and the county around million a year in lost revenues the child services funding continues to increase annually the

the levy due to appeals of av has appealed their state assessed property which will affect all the counties and result in a loss of approximately million clerks note a full printout of exhibit a is on file in the council office with the original set of minutes chair sanders asked to indicate how much the budget for public safety and criminal justice has grown said that he does not have the exact statistics but that he believes that the total budget for was approximately million and public safety and criminal justice was about million of the total he said that the budget is currently approximately million and public safety and criminal justice is about million of the total chair sanders said that although civil employees have gone without a salary increase for three years the city has paid increases in insurance premiums as a benefit to the those employees said that the increase in insurance premiums has averaged around of the cost chair sanders asked if the payment of increased insurance premiums could possibly be more valuable to civil employees than a or wage increase answered in the asked about the category of child services in the character expenditures of the budget explained that child services is mostly done through character for the county side but it is a separate budget that is not actually controlled by the city or the council however it is appropriated and taxed and is a growing part of the budget but it is spent separately asked if salaries pensions benefits and supplies would be included in that amount answered in the negative and said that this is where of the costs covered are for foster care institutional care and psychiatric evaluations for said that the graph showing the revenues by source clearly shows that property taxes are only half of the funding needed for the city asked if child services expenses reflect the original appropriation for as outlined in the budget proposal answered in the affirmative asked why there is a large dip in the av for and again in answered that the decrease in was the result of a number of appeals being quickly processed from the reassessment and the decrease in was the result of the loss of inventory chair sanders said that it looks as though the child services funding significantly increases over the next four years and asked if that information is based on the numbers entering the system said that the numbers are based on the historical growth rate however children services is looking at alternative funding and ways to get additional money into the system chair sanders stated that in the past the council has attempted to bring agencies before them to look at what can be done about salvaging any unexpended balances or underspending she asked if there is going to be an effort to try to capture underspending again and what type of underspending can be expected from the various agencies answered that it is normally attempted as a part of the budget that is submitted to the council and he is not sure if much underspending has been captured at this time chair sanders said that she is concerned that agencies will be driven further into even tighter budgets plowman asked if has thought of how to remedy the financial shortfalls that the city and the county are facing answered that there are several remedies being considered including possible savings on administrative costs between the county sheriffs department and the police department possible savings as a result of the councils approval of the merger of the township and fire departments the hope of having another substantial year with revenue growth from the the pursuit of excise taxes believed to be owed by the state for several years of underpayment asked if future percentages of excise taxes have been adjusted to reflect that the state is in agreement that the county has been shorted wright corporation counsel answered in the affirmative and stated that state auditor estimated that the city was shorted approximately million and that the future distribution should increase by about thousand to thousand per year proposal no enables the controller to reserve a percentage of county agency funding out of the county general fund said that the county is falling behind in reconciliations to the county general fund but it has now been reconciled through he said that some critical questions need to be answered such as how spending is trending versus what is planned for in the budget said that the proposal will allow him to reserve the budget by no more than five percent of the county general fund to prevent the county from getting into a position where budgets have to be cut before the end of the year he said that there still be places where additional funding be required he said that there is some good news on the county general side with collections of fines and fees said that the advantage of reserving the budget is to prevent the need to come back before the council to decrease appropriations his intent is not to reserve any agency but to have the ability to move quickly if it is discovered that the general fund balance is not sufficient to handle all of the appropriations chair sanders asked if the five percent is foreseen to apply across the board or if agencies will be assessed differently answered that agencies will be assessed as there are some smaller agencies that could not even afford one percent he said that some agencies have anticipated projects that have not been completed and have some funding that can be reserved for example the courts had funding for the new drug court for the year but that court has not opened yet due to construction issues he said that the two biggest budgets on the county side are the sheriff and the courts which are also the two agencies that are involved with jail overcrowding and crime management said that she has a problem with the proposal as it states in the second whereas that the county general fund has not been reconciled yet mentioned that it has now been reconciled chair sanders said that it was stated that it has been reconciled through but there is still work to be done through said that wording of the proposal can be changed to reflect that the reconciliation of the county general fund is not current said that it is still important for this resolution to be approved even if that section is taken out because of the potential shortfall for revenues and the fact that spending trends in the county are unknown plowman asked what the negative aspects of the proposal will be said that the negative aspect is that anyone that has their appropriations reserved will not be happy plowman asked if has spoken with any agency heads answered in the negative but stated that all of the agencies are aware of the budget issues and he does not believe that anyone believes that he is being irrational he said that the consequences of not allowing the proposal is that he returns in the middle of or immediately following the budget process to ask the council to cut budgets he said that he would like to reserve budgets to ensure that enough money is available so that there are not any layoffs toward the end of the year he said that his office have a broader perspective of where the immediate needs are said that last year there were a number of agencies very upset about cuts to their budget and he believes that by doing this now he will not have to come back with cuts but rather transfers between characters plowman asked if agencies are expected to stay within their budgets answered in the affirmative and stated that last year the revenues came in lower than what was budgeted he said that he would like to have more of a rational approach this year so that agencies have the opportunity to plan for where money can be spent he said that about of the property tax levy was collected which is of the total tax base this year could be worse with appeals from rolls and other big companies as well as outstanding appeals said that this proposal gives the controller the opportunity to prepare for some cushion toward the end of the year to make decisions on what can and cannot be spent he said that he is not asking to reduce any budgets or spending he is simply asking to reserve the budgets so that there can be an idea of whether or not there is enough money and where the money is needed most in moving toward the end of the year the juvenile center and the jail are probably two of the primary needs for and said that a statement in the ordinance says that the controllers office is not able to determine the county fund balance or run financial reports to county agencies she asked if the controllers office has access to go into the system to look at the information answered in the negative and stated that because the county fund balance is reconciled at the end of the year the controller cannot get a picture of where the city is as of he said that some of the problems will be alleviated with the reconciliation but he is unsure of how accurate the balance is as of because the information is not current said that it would be great if everyone would slow down and hold back at the request of the controller but she guesses that most agencies already feel that they do not have enough money to begin with she said that she believes that the council should give the controller some type of official power to restrict spending she said that she would like to hear from the auditor as to what is going on with the reports county auditor said that she understands that the budget cuts over the last two years are part of the reason behind the proposal she said that her staff is down ten people from what it was two years ago and she has not been able to replace those people because she does not have the budget to do so she said that her staff has been doing the best that they can and working long hours and will be working very hard over the next few weeks to get information and give the controller the necessary reports chair sanders asked if there was any training or retraining that needed to be done for the staff completing tasks relative to the reconciliation process ms answered in the negative and stated that the people inputting data into the system have been doing it for many years she said that there were some changes on the county side regarding the new function of purchasing which has taken some time for people to adjust chair sanders asked if ms sees any problem with getting the reconciliation completed between now and when the budget has to be introduced ms answered in the negative asked how the completion of the financial reports that are usually due th is coming ms said that the city is in charge of that this year because of the statutory changes but the auditors office is working with the controllers office asked if the controller will have what is needed to do the county report by ms answered that the auditors office is planning to ask for an extension said that now that the st balance is complete the controllers office is looking at trying to give a guesstimate of what the actual balances are as of th he said that he does not anticipate that the last six months will be completed but he is looking at alternatives which is why he would like to reserve some of the fund balances because he believes that there is a larger margin stated that he does have the ability to reserve budgets for city agencies and departments but the auditor never had that power when she was over the budget for county agencies he said that this proposal would give the controllers office the ability to better control the budget said that she believes that this would be a smart step early on while there is still time to make adjustments but she assumes that the controller cannot do this without the councils approval because there are so many elected officials on the county side said that county officials will not like this change but he feels that they understand asked if plans to reserve a large percentage of the budgets answered in the negative and stated that he not be able to reserve anything for some of the budgets as most of the agencies do not have a very sufficient budget he said that he will look at where there be pockets of money to try to reserve ms said that she has been working very closely with bell regarding their abatement which has taken place in every county in she said that she is working with them so that the entire million that is owed over a period will be worked out so that the paid in amount will be deducted from the fall installment and then a credit for the balance will be given over a number of years in order not to have such a huge impact on the units of government chair sanders asked if county owes the entire million ms answered that it is for all taxing districts throughout the county for example public schools share would be million she said that she tries to work with companies when this happens because the county have years in arrears to pay for and the companies are entitled to interest from the date the original tax bill was due she has found that companies want to be good corporate citizens and are willing to work with the county chair sanders said that she would appreciate it if ms kept the committee informed as to what is going on with the abatement and the decisions that are being made said that she was thinking that the increase in the could cover the abatement but realized that the abatement is split among all units of government such as schools libraries and health hospital corporation she said that many of the school districts will also be hit this year because of the loss of inventory tax and do not have the added available she said that an impact such as this is pretty big and communicate to the community an understanding of the layoffs of teachers and other cuts asked what reserving the budget would actually mean provided the example that if the sheriff had a character budget of for automobiles the system has a tool that has the ability to only allow to be spent and the other reserved money is not taken away from the appropriation made by the council it simply reserves it until funds are sufficient and then the reserve will be released said that she is concerned that the controller feel that a budget needs to be reserved but the council not agree yet the controller would have the ability to make the call chair sanders said that the controller currently has authority for the operations of the budget and by the time the council would find out that a particular budget has been overspent and could not be reserved for other spending it would be too late stated that in the past the council raised the and dedicated the first to large county agencies she asked how the reserve would affect the increase that was given to those agencies to do better business said that it should have very little impact because the majority of that money is likely already committed to salary increases and the drug court which has not yet been completed he said that he would not unilaterally reserve a budget without working with the agencies to determine where money can be held or particular tasks put off until the next budget in order to make it through the remainder of the year asked what occurs if and an agency have a difference of opinion said that he is sure that the council would hear from that agency asked about current ability to reserve budgets for the city said that the city has had fund balances for the last six or seven years because of the ability to reserve the budgets but none of the budgets have been reserved yet for this year said that he understands the need for this tool as the controller is responsible for the upper management of the budget for the entire corporation commented that though elected officials or county agencies are responsible for their budgets and be doing the most careful job of monitoring their spending they have no idea at what percentage the revenue is coming in she said that if something like this is not done it could result in a situation where an agency needs to spend money for something and there is no money at all to be spent said that he believes that this is an important tool to use until fund balances can be restored on the county side moved seconded by to amend the second whereas of the proposal to reflect that the county auditor controls all access to the accounting system for the county and the county general fund at this time is not current the motion carried by a asked if section can be altered to require the controller to notify the council during any budget year when he determines that a reserve needs to be applied said that he would be happy to comply said that she believes that would allow the council to be prepared to address any concerns expressed by agency heads asked if there is a time limit on the proposal or if it can be cleaned up and brought back to the committee said that there is only one meeting in and then the budget process begins in moved seconded by to amend section to add a sentence at the end of the paragraph that states the controller shall notify the council prior to taking such action the motion carried by a vote of said that this addition is not for the controller to obtain permission from the council to take action it is simply a notification that specific reserves will be taken plowman asked ms if any agency heads or elected officials have spoken with her about the proposal ms answered in the negative plowman asked ms how she feels about the proposal ms answered that she is not happy but realizes that the financial situation is tough and feels that it could work out if the controller is willing to communicate with the agencies and elected officials plowman said that he feels that elected officials have a responsibility to the voters and should be held accountable for keeping their budgets chair sanders said that she understands concern but it must be understood elected officials do not have the whole picture and someone who has that picture must oversee activities said that the system is designed for officials to provide services and spend money not for raising or collecting money therefore they do not have access to information about revenues coming in deputy accounting auditor said that he would like to bring the committees attention to the second sentence of section he said that currently if agencies or the council request that budget transfers be made those requests go through the office of finance and management and then the auditors office posts those changes to the system he asked why the controllers office would need to change this process and obtain access to the system to perform the changes said that as appropriations or changes in appropriations are made by the council the auditors office is not necessarily making the changes right away the controllers office has had issues primarily with grant reports where final payment cannot be released because there has not been an adjustment for additional appropriations to spend money said that this is simply to allow the controllers office to deal with the budget aspect in a timely manner asked if the transactions in are coded to reflect who made entries and if they are easy to track answered in the affirmative but stated that it is more difficult for the auditors office to detect problems if they were not the ones who entered the data into the system said that she is concerned that the auditors office is overwhelmed with trying to get everything done therefore this seems to be good assistance for the auditors office moved seconded by to forward proposal no to with and plowman casting the negative votes
