senators as well as other elected officials across county and the state of to address efficiencies that could be related to making decisions and developing a plan for consolidation chair sanders said

he said that working with the county assessors office township assessor hill and the center township assessors office he found that the nine township assessor offices have different processes and different skill levels of people and therefore it would not be possible to fund each of the offices based on the matrixes the assessors would not be able to get to a level of operational efficiency in

property tax levy of a particular fund he said that the public safety tax must be used for crime prevention police and fire pension or the criminal justice system asked if there is a difference in which entities receive the versus the ones that participate in the new answered in the affirmative stated that in past years the city has occasionally received an additional distribution from the state for the revenue and she asked if there is any hope of receiving additional money from the state this year answered that it was originally estimated that the city would receive million but the budget reflects an additional million or million distribution for that should be received in he said that the state collects the and holds back a reserve because they give a certified distribution monthly and last year the city anticipated that it would receive a million excess distribution of in said that the collections were not as vigorous as last years forecast which decreased the amount

on the reserve level set by the state growth income as well as other uncontrollable factors plowman asked if the state gave the city some relief on pension what the city would do with the money that has been dedicated to pension relief with respect to the sinking fund for pension debt service answered that the public safety tax percentage could be reduced by the corresponding relief amount as public safety tax can be determined by the council up to every year asked if the council would also have the option to allocate the resources to other things such as curbs and sidewalks since the tax has some flexibility answered that the could be recycled for a number of uses including curbs and sidewalks and paving roads stated that he understood question to be what would be done if pension relief was received from the state for police and fire and the most likely relief for that would be from the public safety tax stated that also mentioned that excess distributions could be used to pay off the outstanding pension debts or invest with the public employee retirement fund said that the pay ranges for various groups of employees are included on pages of exhibit a and she asked if the numbers are different than last year and who makes recommendations of salary ranges answered that the numbers in exhibit a include a increase in the maximum pay for each pay grade chair sanders asked if minimum pay grades increased answered in the negative and stated that it could also be done however the city still has not finalized a way to build raises into the budget and there would be a cost to increase the minimum pay for each pay grade the minimum pay was not increased the because there was no additional money budgeted in character expressed her concern about the lowest level which is the minimum pay for a grade employee she said that she believes that when the schedules were being revised the council was working to try to ensure that all city or county employees would be at a level of pay that a working individual or family could survive she said that she believes that over time there is a risk of slipping back into an unfortunate position and she hopes that the city can continue to examine the entry level minimums and adequately adjust if the opportunity arises chair sanders said that she agrees with and stated that she thought that human resources hr administrator previously stated that the minimum salaries had increased which makes more sense to her brown said that stated that the maximum salaries increased because increasing the minimum would be a fiscal impact that would have to be approved in the budget by the council chair sanders said that she agrees that the council must stay on top of the issue of people falling below the poverty level she said that she understands that if an employee is they also receive benefits and that does make a difference however looking at the minimum salaries in the lower ranges reflects that it would be very difficult for anyone to sustain themselves in this community at the cost of living required asked what the cost would be for an overall increase for employees answered that for unit city and county employees totaled million last year therefore he assumes that this year it would be million to million asked if he had indicated that an agency could give the increase if the funds were available in their character answered that his statement was not intended to indicate that idea chair sanders said that she understood to state that he was not taking a position on pay increases at that point but that is was conceivable that some agencies have money within their budget to provide those increases however she said that she does not believe that it would be fair if the pay raises cannot be afforded to everyone agreed with chair sanders and stated that one of the reasons that he does not like to include additional funds in an budget for potential increases for bargaining unit employees is because it result in reclassification of jobs or agencies trying to process raises said that currently there is a process in which hr does not allow raises except in cases of promotions which also has limits he said that he does not foresee allowing some departments to have money in their budgets to give raises and not allow others there has been discussion of creating an efficiency commission that will work with the city on ways to streamline city and county government to try to offer incentives to directors and agency heads to find ways to be more innovative to free up their budget but there was no discussion of increasing an character he said that he would like to ensure that all employees get pay raises as they all are probably underpaid councilor plowman said in response to concern of slipping back into an unfortunate place that he does not know if the city has ever reached a fortunate place he said that he has been on the council for four years and there is constant conversation about employees making a decent living but he does not recall the council making any effort to correct the problem he asked if the city has to wait another four years chair sanders said that there were studies done adjustments made based on the results of the studies and the salaries are better plowman asked what is considered better answered that three or four years ago the minimums were and per year she said that those have increased since her time on the council plowman asked how long has been on the council she stated that the she began serving in and since then the council has moved the minimums from to per year added that the increase is still not the best minimum pay for employment but progress is being made and she stated that the poverty level is approximately for a family of four chair sanders said that she believes that the poverty level for a family of four is said that she believes that more should be done to increase the minimums but changes are being made plowman said that it is unfortunate that a city the size of is paying level wages for city and county employees said that she felt that the council has worked really hard on salary schedules and on looking for some sort of equity across departments for positions she commented that she believes that the city has come a long way and she respects the staff that has worked really hard to increase the numbers she said that she believes that the challenge is that there are so many employees and the city works very hard to meet the needs and requirements for the level of skill and experience of employees of bargaining units the dilemma is that sometimes there are not enough resources available for the council to be able to support or convince the public to provide support to continue with the salary schedules that represent the employees to make the same type of progress said that she believes that the council has done a good job of keeping up with the market place in the public safety budgets and she hopes that the council will put the same energy in the salary schedules included in exhibit a said that another concern for the lack of raises for nonunion employees is that there are units of people that are covered by a contract in some agencies and are continuing to get raises but the supervisors in those same agencies not be covered by the contract which results in employees making more money than their supervisor said that has been faced with that dilemma in the fire departments communications department public works and fleet services he said that equity adjustments had to be made from and it is important to have someone that is willing to work as a supervisor oftentimes overtime carries hourly employees over supervisor levels but usually supervisors are working overtime in addition to their employees said that he agrees with the council and he believes that it is important to find ways to fund these concerns out of the existing funds and everyone will have to work together over the next two to three months to find a way to ensure that employees receive raises next year asked if is suggesting that the council could entertain an additional appropriation that could be used to fund adjustments for employees if all agencies could manage to be frugal in spending for the remainder of the year said that it would be a means available but also to find better ways to do processes be more efficient and better utilize technology to free up money he said that he also believes that the public expects that from the agencies as well brown stated that the controllers office has covered everything with regard to the administration and finance committee and stated that everything else in the proposal has been approved by the other committees and forwarded for review of the full council chair sanders asked if there is a place in the ordinance that illustrates the distribution of the said that the and the public safety tax are shown as miscellaneous income in any of the civil taxing funds that has a tax rate for example page of exhibit a reflects the county general fund the and public safety tax are both line items shown under special taxes he said that it would be shown in the same way in the consolidated county fund the metropolitan police department fund the fire department and public works chair sanders asked if the payment in lieu of taxes coming from the water company and health and hospital are the only two answered in the negative and stated that there is also a pilot from sanitation he stated that also provides miscellaneous revenue for fire protection services and the waterworks pilot is part of their ongoing agreement that they pay taxes clarified that the health and hospital payment is reflected as an intergovernmental revenue brown asked if could provide the council with a compilation of allocations of the that goes toward the public safety tax and the answered in the affirmative chair sanders asked if of the is withheld for freezing the levy and goes toward public safety answered in the affirmative and stated that of the for freezing the levy goes into a reserve fund for the first

associations thanked the controllers office and the council office for ensuring that received information that they requested with regard to the budget she stated that there was an expansion of character but also expressed concerns about seeing more detail as to what was being requested as contractual obligations or contracts ms asked if more detail could be given for the miscellaneous contractual expense of listed in the budget of the treasurer stated that he believes that the expense is for finance banking and wiring of money charges but he will examine that expense and forward the information to ms ms said that there was a description of bus passes in multiple departments but the amounts greatly differed from to nearly she asked if bus passes are part of the employment package and why the charges differ so significantly answered that bus passes are paid for those employees that choose to ride the bus to work as opposed to driving and obtaining a parking space as parking is offered to downtown employees ms asked if parking fees are reflected in another line item of the budget answered in the affirmative and stated that parking fees are reflected in rent fees clarified that the fees are included in rent fees if employees park in the city county building but it is reflected in another category of the budget for employees that park in private garages he believes that it will be under a travel category he said that those expenses are not reflected in character also added that some of the agencies have a line item for taxi services and he gave an example of the prosecutors office that pays for taxi services for some of the victims and witnesses that have to come into the building for testimony and matters ms stated that some of the line items list taxi services and then list bus passes under comments said that the accounting system maintained by the county auditor lists the taxi services but it was determined that departments are actually paying for bus passes that are being charged that he said that tried to clarify when the charges were for employees and when they were for witnesses thus the reason that bus passes is listed under the comments ms asked about the expense of for transporting machines listed in election expenses brown answered that that expense is for the voting machines he said that there are voting sites with

that several of ms questions were recently explored in the meetings that were held for the election investigation committee she said in addition to the traveling boards that go out with absentee ballots taxi services have been used in the past to deliver absentee ballots to the polling places on election day she said that it has been suggested that the county clerk take a look at using city and vehicles and city and county employees to perform that function she said that it is expected that performing the function in that way even if employees have to be paid to work on election day would help decrease the expense amount however the previous expense amount is still in the budget for because it is not known how soon the change would be effective but the clerk is looking into it added that there will be another meeting of the election investigative committee on th in which there will be an opportunity to take a look at the new precinct maps that have been developed she said

result of the changes chair sanders clarified that these types of changes especially the precinct changes will not occur until because they have to be approved by the state election board added that
