said currently assessors salaries are based on parcel count and there is an increased amount of newly elected assessors who have no experience or certification yet make more money than assessors who have been in service for years with certification ms directed the panel to exhibit a where they drafted a pay structure for assessors beginning with newly elected to years of service the requested starting pay is at a level so that no assessor would receive a pay cut she added that their requested salary range is well within the salary amounts city department heads are currently making ms

the center township assessor who is already at chair oliver asked if there is information on each assessors skill level or certification ms said she was trying to obtain that information before the meeting but the department of local government finance could not give her current information at the time she said the skill level information will show which assessors have level i or ii certification county salary recommendation panel ms said the problem with the current salary structure is that it is based on parcel count and certain townships have more parcels than others giving them the higher salaries she said in some cases the assessors with the small parcel count have smaller staffs and work just as hard as those with bigger parcel counts asked if the panel could receive the parcel count for each township ms said she will provide the panel with that information asked if they are requesting a salary for a newly elected assessor after they serve one year ms replied in the negative and said any newly elected assessors starting salary would be once an assessor has served a full term four years with a level i certification they would move to and would move up further according to their requested pay structure chair oliver asked if the assessors would receive the three percent raises as given to other staff in addition to their term raises ms said the intention is that if three percent is given to other employees then the requested pay figures would also increase by three percent asked if a calculation has been done for the total cost of this increase ms said she has not done a calculation council clerk said she will have the councils chief financial officer calculate the total increase asked if anything else would be added to the assessors compensation ms said the eight percent deferred compensation would be added chair oliver asked when the salary ranges are implemented and staff is at the maximum of their range if they automatically receive the three percent raise said with the salary ranges they do not automatically receive the three percent increase he said for example the and the mayor have not had a raise for eight or nine years and the increase last year was only given to employees which do not include elected officials chair oliver asked if an increase is done every year council clerk said once the increase is passed it remains until a new recommendation is made that is different said the state statute does not say that the assessor has to have a certain level of education or certification to hold the office he said the panel needs to be careful not to do anything in the ordinance that goes against what the legislature has allowed he said by amending how assessors are currently paid by the level of education and certification they obtain open small claims judges and township trustees to the same claim said when a company gets into certification and education as the basis of compensation there is a possibility for unfair classification that could cause the county money and a lawsuit added that there is a statutory provision with assessors that could provide a decrease in pay if certifications are not met by individual assessors ms clarified that she only provided the panel with classification specification of the assessor to give the panel an idea on what the assessors do she said she was not implying that all assessors need to fit the specification she said currently according to county salary recommendation panel statute if an assessor does not obtain a level i by a certain time in their term they could be subject to lose part of their salary there is also pay for having the level ii certification assessors receive and employees receive county treasurer clarified a statement that was written in the salary panel minutes with regard to raising employee salaries rather than elected officials salaries he said he was not speaking on behalf of other elected officials but only to his own salary he also clarified that he does not personally obtain a car which is noted with his salary the treasurers office has a car available for several staff members that use it to look at properties with no further business pending and upon motion duly made the county salary recommendation panel of the council was adjourned at pm oliver chair county salary recommendation panel
