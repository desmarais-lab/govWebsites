exhibit powers need for purchasing and implementing the software program and the approval of he the quickly new was clerks note the disc of exhibit is on in the council office with the original minutes powers said that the great deal of technology in the field such as the hands of the inspectors the city has an that there will be no additional include that type of technology as it is already present however the older too big to via an air card asked if an analysis has been done on how much the city will save by program on studies the committee that the to the to and what is being done in that area he said that one problem that was that building of the safety relative to the lives in being is occupied that staff is being that will put the the still does not said that the new help pick up the allow of ken slide four of exhibit the have the support of property the affirmative to slide six of exhibit the area overview and the program really simplifies the a improves overall efficiency

pay for the software it will be paid with three equal approximately million it will take so long to it will take time old be a be installed he said that this software is dramatically different and will require training conversion of within multiple integrating he said that the city will go four separate one plowman type of the public have in what they have now that citizens will be able to as inspections perform contractor submit cards he said that there is currently outside vendor support completing some of the the new could online permitting asked about the difference between the citizens the service requests that ability to and citizens ability to is being done for the city he the two are different but the the service request is a mac or citizen relationship function where it will integrate with systems the cell but it is also a component he said that the be the new chair a be section of the increase it was as million and it million to with the the motion a vote of chair explain the funding for the project said that it will be fee the sub fund within the metropolitan he said that the funding came from the fee was done is paid for the permit sub fund is a sub fund of the fund the and the transfer of million from the permit sub fund to the fund will make the three year the software the ending fund the permit sub fund is known that he the permit sub fund approximately million or million which is enough to cover the transfer and have funds chair if the no interest financing the to forward to the full council with a do motion a vote of with no further and upon motion duly administration and finance the council pm cf good evening we will be looking to you this evening to make new technology available to us in the very near future via this fiscal ordinance of million and an overall purchase amount of just over million over the next three years this will affect the permits sub fund balance however has been involved in negotiating on our behalf toward a service of with and moving the contract to their area for management as an enterprise solution this took place on somewhat of a fast track because of the enterprise flavor of the services provided by this robust solution in doing so was cognizant of our construction seasons and the impact of an implementation process on our staffs daily roles within those seasons in a nutshell as a result of those constraints we are before you today to provide a brief of services that we hope to employ as a replacement to and many systems throughout the enterprise the it board has approved those services and allowed for contract signing with a funding dependent clause contained therein we have also briefed the metropolitan development committee and now finally appear before you and the council for fiscal approval this solution has actually been contemplated ever since a labor intensive tornado damage assessment in and each incident response since then to include the recent emergency exercise at that time we were simply looking for ways to streamline our disaster mitigation efforts we were provided a demonstration of a component of the we are here to discuss today during that demonstration it became painfully apparent that our current technology was lacking in many areas maybe most of all in the area of integration with other agencies and their respective technologies since then other factors have been contemplated and acted upon those factors have also made this a breakout year for and the division of compliance in particular we are in the midst of adding the staff and services needed to address insurance survey office findings that are related to home owners insurance rates in county when we have completed these service level enhancements that a substantial fee increase has provided for and part of which is devoted to perpetual technology improvements we will also have added the following staff to our division additional building inspectors building code analysts zoning inspectors a legal case specialist and a landscape review specialist we have also moved the business licensing inspection role from the office of finance and management and plan review into our offices considering the dramatic changes we are making by adding staff and equally if not greater changing policies and processes to improve government oversight of the construction industry and code enforcement to address public safety we have still found that the results needed to resolve our shortcomings will require a robust technology upgrade to carry us the distance however with this huge challenge we also realized we have even greater opportunities we have been working with many other departments on the software integration committee established by the mayors office researching this known as automation that will provide for integration across department lines and provide a means to remove many of the silos of our legacy systems our technology is aging but we are still on the forefront of developing new ways to do business technology must keep abreast of our requirements and we in turn must keep abreast of mission supporting technology we are using limited wireless applications we have integrated into our inspection operations via cellular phones and our vehicles are equipped with docked laptops that operate remotely however we can only go so far with the legacy systems that these enhancements are providing a means to update we also have third party systems in place that are actually impeding our moving forward we now come before you with a solution and an opportunity to change the landscape of technology in our city and county the automation product is a suite of software modules that will allow to upgrade and enhance our current software table editor and in the future we hope it incorporates support for the missions of the mayors action center and asset management as we fully realize its capabilities as well as provide the opportunity to integrate several key business processes that rely on additional rd party software systems this software will also provide a means to support the enterprise in including planning permitting licensing inspection enforcement interactive voice response citizen access and services and a huge leap forward in emergency response all of this functionality equates to dramatically increased service delivery in but more importantly for the first time the ability to truly integrate technology in support of like core functions and even systems across the enterprise we do indeed envision this as an enterprise solution to many processes for example the service request module functionality is a dramatically enhanced ability that relates to our current citizen relationship management solution in the mayors action center this component will fully integrate with the planning permitting licensing inspection enforcement citizen services and emergency response functions provided by the same and integration of systems outside of software scope and as noted previously there is also a module that operates in the asset management arena that could benefit us in the future hence offering even greater enterprise interoperability ken will expound on the other modules during his comments now we would like to show you the emergency response damage assessment component in operation in new following hurricane then i will turn it over to to share other particulars ca co ca ca it ca go go go go mu qt ca ca ca ca jog ca do
