he was able to attend the most recent advisory committee moved seconded by to send proposal no proposal no adopts the annual budget for the solid waste collection chairman stated that he believes the office of finance and management has some amendments that need to be offered for the budget proposals he asked city controller and deputy controller to explain these said that each member should have a copy of a proposed amendment before them exhibit a he said that the changes are highlighted in these copies these changes are primarily due to the salary increase for employees who are not represented by a bargaining unit clarified that there was an error in the original budget and money was budgeted in character for union employees this money was taken out and then pay raises were added back in for nonunion employees the negotiations for union contracts are still taking place and those numbers have not yet been determined he said that the other change is due to funds being added for the increase for two metropolitan police department employees formerly police department employees who work for the department to enforce the code regarding trash and illegal dumping said other changes include the tax rate being added to page two and the assessed valuation being added to page three which was previously left blank he said that they reduced the estimate by to take a more conservative approach they know the city will lose because of the loss of inventory tax and another because of the onetime homestead credit he said that with the trends of reassessment there is no real good gauge but another could be lost there and therefore they have taken a conservative approach in their estimates the department of local government and finance will adjust that number once the true assessed valuation is known along with the tax rate said that this number is always an estimate and they have used a conservative estimate to be consistent with all taxing districts to insure they will get the revenues they need to fund next years asked if the can change both the assessed valuation number and the tax rate said that they will adjust the assessed valuation number based on assessments and they can only decrease the tax rate but cannot increase it he said that the city cannot afford for them to decrease the tax rate by even a millionth of a cent he said that there is a lot of tax restructuring going on with the inventory tax being eliminated the homestead credit and other trending homeowners in moderate homes and businesses with high levels of inventory will probably see their taxes decrease while other businesses with low inventory or homeowners in high growth areas will see increases he said that it is hard to predict and other cities are dealing with the same problem chairman asked about the for assessments said that assessments probably will not be available until or but the city has to prepare and pass the budget and submit it to on time he said the will then adjust the numbers based on the reassessment brown chief financial officer for the council stated that time is of the essence he said that the reassessment made tax bills late and caused the city to borrow money until tax revenues came in he said that the city would incur additional costs because of tax replacement credits if they withhold the budget the trending is causing the assessments to be delayed but the budget must be submitted on time asked about the two employees and if they are paid out of the public works or the budget director of the department of public works stated that these two individuals are a retired and a reserve officer who work nights and weekends to enforce the code with regard to trash and illegal dumping these officers can arrest charge and fine individuals in violation of the ordinance he said that the two officers work for but are on contract loan from the police department asked if they are part of the union contract said that they are not clarified that this arrangement has been in existence for two or three years he added that although they are putting into the budget for increases it does not necessarily mean that everyone across the board will get a increase he said that there is some flexibility for the department director to award raises per human resources guidelines chairman asked if these two officers are then on payroll said that they are actually on soon to be payroll and there is a memorandum of understanding between and for their services asked about reimbursement for lost benefit time for those employees who accrue more time than is allowed to roll over to the next year he asked if the pay increases will help to offset this loss of time stated that they work with employees on a basis so that they do not lose their benefit time he said that some employees in management positions lose a few hours because they cannot always take time off but the department tries to assess this quarterly so that employees do not lose their benefit time said that he would like to have a discussion on this issue after the budget process is completed clarified that there are restrictions as to how many benefit hours an employee can carry over to the next year and he thinks there is a cap of hours he said that the balance can be converted to short term disability hours if that cap is not exceeded but most people work out their vacation time so as not to lose their benefit hours chairman referred to line of the line statement on page of the amendment and asked if this is an increase in the budget from to said that there is actually a decrease in the budget and this number represents the fund balance projected at the end of which will actually increase moved seconded by to amend proposal no as per

employees the change in character is due to an error when putting together the budget when the budget was first submitted the rent cost for the fleet services ifs facility was left out chairman asked if this was strictly an oversight said that it was added that the change of in character is due to ifs not totaling out at zero making this correction necessary all of the character changes in the funds on page two are due to the salary increase he said that on page three the amendment shows the changes approved by the community affairs committee earlier this week regarding distributions to the county soil and water conservation district and the noble centers he said that had an increase in rent and the city will transfer money from the utility fund to pay that appropriation to the auditor

brown is aware of this million transfer brown said that it has been discussed with him and this amount is actually less than he anticipated said that this amount is actually less than received from
