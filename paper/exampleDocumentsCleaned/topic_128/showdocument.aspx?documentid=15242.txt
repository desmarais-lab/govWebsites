maintenance and expansion of the gravel drive and parking area in lieu of a paved surface is requesting renewal of variance approval to allow the access and parking area on his commercial lot at first avenue to remain gravel in lieu of having the required paved parking lot the zoning code requires that all access and parking areas in the co district must be paved rezoned the sq ft residence on this lot from to co in for an insurance office that was currently in operation on the site without permit approval at the time of the rezoning it was noted that the access and parking must be paved in obtained variance approval to relax setback requirements and reduce the parking requirement for the insurance office but the request for gravel parking and access was approved with only a time limit to pave at the end of the time limit to pave was again notified by staff that the parking and access must be paved and must be installed and maintained as shown on the approved site plan this is a request for relaxation of the zoning code to allow maintenance and expansion of the gravel drive and parking area in lieu of a paved surface all those who will speak on this petition raise your right hand do you swear or mulberry place are you the owner of the property yes i remember a year or ago when you or somebody else came before this board and asked for that extension tell us about what is going on i originally bought it for the insurance company a friend of mine wanted a location on that side of town so i bought it he did move in we found out we needed to go commercial on it he went out of business so now trying to sell it the only bites had so far are subway looking to possibly go there i had a lot of other bites but i would rather not pave it not knowing whats going to go there not knowing what its going to be used for its good location for commercial but at this time i still had a lot of interest in it are you actively trying to get it sold yes do you have it listed yes we have a huge sign in the yard are there any questions so its vacant now actually it has some construction stuff one of our contractors that does a lot of our work keeps stuff in the garage i think a couple of his tools are in the reception area but there is not business going on no if you have any success in getting it sold in a fairly timely manner then would you try to rent it out again to another business since i really do a lot of commercial i would probably want to go back to residential come back and get it zoned residential it would be a lot easier to rent than commercial the insurance guy said his clients had a hard time getting in and out of there not a developer on commercial so it is really out of my expertise any other questions the variances to expand the existing gravel to comply with the requirements of site review for the business was listed originally yes and the business that was originally there there any more right thats correct so my question is i guess since he want to pave what hes got is there a point to expanding the gravel and making it worse i really object if its vacant to leaving it like it is for awhile i think if it was used for an office then it certainly would clean up the neighborhood a little bit if it was paved the other things around there i think are mostly paved but not sure how to make that work from a legal standpoint we have launched the effort to try to change the ordinance for gravel in lots out in the county and maybe this is almost a timing issue where that amendment to the ordinance gone through the process yet but maybe it will within a month or two is this not in the county no its in the city no but we have been requested to do a similar one for the city but i believe it would include offices not the way it is currently formulated could i make a motion to approve the request with a one year time limit with the conditions that he not expand it until the building is occupied or sold not expand what the parking area i think you plan to expand it do you i do not but thats required because of whats required for that building i was really hoping to just sell it as is thats what i would like him to be able to do if we can make that happen well one thing you can do is to put a condition that the variance only applies for its current use so if it is sold to subway or somebody else it obviously apply just trying to follow along i think your motion is to leave everything the way it is now until he sells it then the new occupant would have to conform to whatever is required at that time and with a one year time limit thats another thing you could do is to limit it to this owner i just want to be sure it cover him not having to expand the parking lot because he is in violation of the size of the parking area i thought he already had the variances he got an approval from seven spaces down to six he has an approval to relax the setbacks to allow him to expand it not approval not to expand it they gave him approval to expand it i make a motion we approve the variance request for one year with the conditions that it only apply to this owner for this use which is vacant right now and that the parking lot not be expanded until the property is sold at which time it would have to conform with whatever requirements are there does that make sense yes is that something you can live with yes motion was made and seconded call the roll ayes docket no applicant common address complete legal on file drive nature of case applicant requests relaxation of zoning code restrictions to allow an accessory structure taller than the residence for construction of a new pole barn is requesting variance approval for his residential lot at the zoning code requires that accessory structures be subordinate in height and size to the main structure the residence currently has a sq ft residence on his residential lot constructed at a height of the proposed new post frame building on the site is planned at a size of sq ft and at a height of this is a request for variance approval to allow the height of the new structure accessory buildings in agricultural districts not be used as dwellings and be used only for personal use any retail service and storage uses not for the residents of the site require commercial or industrial zoning classification this is a request for relaxation of zoning code restrictions to allow an accessory structure taller than the residence for construction of a new pole barn all those who will speak on this petition raise your right hand do you swear or my name is usually people come to us before they build the building and your building has already been built before we get into the meat of the matter curious what happened where you got through the system i knew the building needed to be no taller than my house i even spent having scissor tresses built so the roof would not be as tall as it would have been otherwise so i could at least have somewhat of a loft in the building i know if the word get down to the builders at or what but it ended up being inches taller than what we planned on being just asking for relaxation on the height the footprint is well within the code its just the height was inches too tall are there any questions so you had a building permit for the building yes are there any singer my name is singer i live at drive i live just north of his house i just really had two questions how the building got built prior to getting this variance and did he get fined for it did the contractor have a contractors license did he do all those things properly i was out of town and when i came home and theres this building here he is going to be my neighbor for a long time i know not going to make him tear it down but i want to know how did he get to this point where when i come home from a meeting i have a building here and i even know what size it was going to be thats my questions i do know the building is there it looks fine its a little larger than i expected it to be in the neighborhood i think it will hurt the property value but its not an ugly building but those are my two questions i have the same questions sort of i prepared to tell you who built it i know that it was built with a permit and that the permit showed that it would not be taller than the house so somewhere between after our issuance of the permit to the contractor the height changed and we were not informed of it we caught it when the contractor came in to put an addition on to it and was honest and said this is how tall it is since this was approved if you go through the process of getting a building permit and getting it approved for something that is within the code there is no public notice to anybody so thats why you come home and theres a building there without you knowing about it beforehand but it is taller thats the only thing singer from are you going to be using this as living area no its for storage only i have a tractor in it and a boat and my truck i know its a residential area i tried to build the barn and make it as beautiful as i could i cant tell you how many people another guy stopped today and told me it was the prettiest barn hes ever seen not trying to be a bad neighbor it just worked out that that guys ended up making it inches taller than it was supposed to be there was no intent to do that whatsoever i spend the on the scissor trusses if i was trying to make it too tall on the zoning application it asks for the height what was the height on the application i have the foresight to bring the copy of the permit with me but i believe it was several feet shorter than the house it was originally inches shorter than the house the building has been built a little higher than it should be i think we are mainly troubled with the fact that something got through the cracks another question the gentleman had is there any kind of a fine given out to the contractor not from our office the contractor came in to put the porch addition on and he gave us the actual height and we told him we could not issue a permit until the variance was approved they were making a good faith effort to bring it into compliance by filing a variance there would be no reason to issue a fine including the addition is it still going to be within the code to be less than the living yes it still meets code for size except for the height any other questions is there a motion for approval ayes docket no applicant misty common address complete legal on file drive nature of case applicant requests relaxation of the rear yard setback from feet to feet for construction of a new home and misty are requesting variance approval for construction of a new home on their property located at drive currently the own vacant lots with a total area of acres they are proposing construction of a new story home on the site the zoning code defines the smaller side of any corner lot as the legal front yard for the purposes of establishing setback requirements the have purchased two lots in farms subdivision section at the southwest corner of drive and court the legal front yard for this site is along court the are proposing construction of their new residence facing drive and the placement on the lot as proposed by their site plans requires relaxation of the foot rear yard setback along the western property line this is a request to allow construction of a new home on a corner lot facing the legal side yard setback due to the odd shape of the lot the owners request to place the house fronting onto rather than court this is a request for relaxation of the rear yard setback from feet to feet for construction of a new home all those who will speak on this petition raise your right hand do you swear or my name is with the contractor for this house where are the owners speaking on their behalf i was contacted by he asked us about laying out the house he brought to our attention of the front on this geometric makes the west side the rear of the two lots together and therefore the size of the footprint gets within six feet of that west line its like the side yard for the house as its constructed but by definition its the rear of the two lots together if the geometrics were such that was the narrower side of the street and it was the front that would be a five foot yard setback so its the definition of being the rear that we are asking to be relaxed from to six show me where you are considering the rear of the lot the west side of the two lots is by definition the rear of these two lots together the frontage on is less than the frontage on so if the front is the east then the rear is the west the owner owns both of those lots since yes are there any questions the garage driveway access is going to be off the court yes it is off of the house next door that would be the side yard for it so it could be five feet away from that line too correct lot would have a five foot side yard setback and it is the side of the house which would normally have a five foot setback are there any other questions are there any none is there a motion for approval motion was made and seconded call the roll ayes docket no applicant common address complete legal on file road nature of case applicant requests relaxation of zoning code restrictions to allow an accessory

this petition raise your right hand do you swear or my name is county metal sales so they are going to add on to the existing building yes we built the original building in but we did not get the permit the question he asked about the height i saw the permit he applied for when he did it we normally get them ourselves now to alleviate this problem the permit asked what the building height was when we sell a building when we ask for the height that is to the bottom of the trusses it was feet so thats how we built it he realize how you measure it he know that you need it to the peak height and thats where the confusion came in i think he honestly just realize what they were asking when he filed for that is it going to be the same color yes we are just extending he stores his personal items in there and needed more room he liked the first building but make it big enough so he wanted to add feet onto the end are there questions from the board are there any none is there a motion for approval motion was made and seconded call the roll ayes
