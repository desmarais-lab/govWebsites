petitioner is requesting a parking variance for each site and a front yard setback variance on the west site the university plans new buildings in the west village that will house students the east village site is planned for new buildings which will house students the zoning code requires one parking space for each of the bedroom units plus one space for each three bedroom units for visitor parking the total parking required by code would be parking spaces to accommodate the western village and spaces to accommodate the eastern village site spaces are planned to be provided at the western village there are existing of parking lots near or adjacent to these sites that will be used to meet parking needs a request for rezoning from to for the west village site had final approval by city council on site plans indicate that one of the new west village residence hall buildings requires variance approval to allow a proposed open porch to encroach feet into the minimum foot front

for an open covered porch on one of the four western village buildings is a request for relaxation of the number of parking spaces from to for construction of new student housing on the west side of the campus is a request for relaxation of the number of parking spaces from to for construction of new student housing at the eastern edge of the of campus all those who will speak on this petition raise your right hand do you swear or griffin my name is griffin with companies meridian street we will address the first one which is the one where you want to reduce it down from feet to feet griffin we are engaged by of to redevelop these sites into student housing for them as was mentioned earlier we have gone through the rezoning process for the western site tonight we are requesting three different variances i will go over the first two variances for the western site because they are lumped together the western site is bounded by walnut to the south and to the east this exhibit shows you the other houses in the neighborhood you can see the own the majority of the single family residences that are there currently these are used for student housing as well as office and administrative uses this is our redesign of the site to the west it shows four structures each structure has six units in them and each unit is a unit that totals bedrooms but the total of units is units on this site currently the site is host to a parking lot along the entire northern half our plan would envision cutting that in half and doing half of that lot as a parking lot and we would use the remainder of the site to sort of shield the residential nature going west with other residential structures and we have added some green space our first request is for a setback on the south border the required setback is feet if you pull that line across all of our structures are meeting it the primary structure is meeting it however as designed our front porch is exceeding that the here is shown feet just to the south what we are requesting is a foot setback that will give us the leeway to construct this open air porch which every structure has here is a look at the floor plan vision the second story is the roof and this is a rendering of how it would look in real life so one of these porch structures will peek out into that required setback by not fully feet but somewhere between feet the in regard to the parking lot we are asking for a relaxation from to the will be located here that is primarily because these students currently live on campus already if not possibly on this site previously these students already have a place to park on campus this an addition of new students this is a reallocation of students on campus of will allocate the new parking spaces either here on site or somewhere else on campus so they wont be parking in the neighborhood or on the streets they have a specific permanent place to park on campus thats all for those first two variances are there any questions from the board none we will address docket no are there any on this none is there a motion for approval motion was made and seconded call the roll ayes ms abstention there being affirmative votes and one abstention docket no is approved the next one i do have a question about what is going to happen to the building that these students currently live in is it going to remain a dorm griffin currently on site there are four houses we have already demolished some of these houses the university managed those students so that they would no longer be in the units once it came for us to redevelop so they have a new home reallocated while we are bringing these up but no one is going to get booted out of their home unexpectedly it has been managed for some time now okay i wonder if we should put a time limit on this and try for a year and see how it works out if it is not problematic after that then you could come back in a year and extend it indefinitely perhaps my only concern is if the university grows and this creates additional parking problems it could impact the neighborhoods around there ms the old armory parking lot back there is that part of the student parking lot griffin yes ms is the entire lot allocated already griffin i know there is a member of the university here but i cant speak to how they have allocated the parking lot horn horn university of the way that we permit our parking is by permits the lots you are talking about at the armory is designated for students and staff so there is a combination of permitting there but it is completely permitted in that regard ms do you issue permits for anyone who asks for them horn we issue to anyone that pays for it the permits are issued by fee could you get yourself in a situation where you issued more permits than there is parking horn thats not unusual in college situations for that to occur and yes that is entirely other questions are there any none is there a motion for approval motion was made and seconded call the roll during roll call i will vote yes but i sure would have liked to see that one year condition put on it ayes ms abstention there being affirmative votes and abstention docket no is approved the next one is another parking situation does the board have questions griffin its not unlike the parking request the site is sandwiched between street and currently there is nothing on the site we have completely demolished the site it will be replaced with two structures identical to the west site we have added a little green space in there as a buffer to the south in this situation there a parking lot on site to begin with like previously these folks were allocated somewhere on lots on campus so we are not adding parking but certainly making use of the parking as previous so these are going to be more campus parkers so the request is to relax the parking requirement from to zero for this site with the understanding that the university will allocate those spaces this new students it is just shifting students into new housing questions on this variance in the photo on the screen now the parking toward the top is that new parking or just the existing parking griffin it is the existing parking are there any none is there a motion for approval ayes ms abstention there being affirmative votes and abstention docket no is approved docket no applicant common address complete legal on file st road nature of case applicant requests a special use for an owner operator beauty shop in the home oliver is requesting special use approval to allow establishment of a beauty salon in her home at saint road ms resides in a sq ft residence located on the north side of st road between fares and avenues she is planning a sq ft addition onto the front of her home which she proposes to use for a beauty salon the zoning code requires approval of a special use permit by the board of zoning appeals for a barber or beauty shop in the residence the special use approval is limited to a resident occupied and resident operated salon there is an existing residential driveway and an existing circular drive on this site the existence of the circular drive could eliminate the need for customers to back out into st road the home beauty salon use requires two spaces for the residence plus one space for the beauty salon for a total of three spaces space is available on site in the existing driveway this site is located in a residential neighborhood the board of zoning appeals typically imposes an initial time limit on special use beauty salons in residential districts to determine if the use is harmonious with the nearby residential development and if any complaints have been expressed about traffic parking or other concerns unless otherwise limited by this board approval of a special use in permits signs up to sq ft no sale of merchandise is permitted at beauty shops which operate within a residence in a residential district sales of beauty supplies and equipment require commercial zoning all those who will speak on this petition raise your right hand do you swear or affirm that the testimony you will give is true and accurate so help you god ms has been sworn in ms my name is here representing asking for the approval of the special use for her to operate a single operator beauty shop my client has owned and lived here since she is looking forward to retiring from her job at currently she started to look at this addition for a bedroom for her home as it progressed she decided with the upcoming retirement having the ability to service some clients there would be very desirable she has talked to her neighbors i believe we have any for this request we do have adequate parking on site because of the circular driveway it is nice without having to back out on st if you see her neighbors on the right side indicated that she allows them to use her circular driveway as well because backing onto st road very pleasant given the proximity to atlas van lines there it meets the legal requirements for a special use it would not provide any nuisance or adverse impact on the surrounding properties accordingly i would be happy to answer any questions i would appreciate your vote of okay are there any questions of the board are there any none is there a motion for approval motion was made and seconded call the roll ayes ms docket no applicant common address complete legal on file avenue nature of case applicant requests a special use for a home occupation historic replicas and reproductions oliver is requesting special use approval for her residence located at avenue is required for those proposed home occupations not specifically listed within a use group in the zoning code ms residence is located at the northeast corner of avenue and chandler avenue across avenue from park ms has indicated that she resides at avenue and is requesting special use approval to allow relocation of her business diva arsenal into the basement garage of her residence the zoning code requires special use approval by the board of zoning appeals for those uses deemed appropriate to be operated from a residence and not specifically listed in a use group in the zoning code ms states that her business is predominantly historic restorations and replicas the only access currently available to this site is a driveway that leads to the garage in the basement of this house the basement garage area is planned to be used for the proposed home occupation there is a public alley at the rear of the lot which could if fencing and trees were removed provide some parking home occupation use requires four parking spaces two for the residence plus two for the home occupation there are currently no parking spaces available typically in the past we have not required a variance to be filed with an initial filing for home occupation it is by common practice over the years and not per code one reason for this is that by ordinance the first approval of any is limited to a maximum of two years many are given shorter time periods to determine if the activity will cause traffic parking or other safety issues and to determine if the home occupation is in compliance with all the mandatory restrictions of the code that limits use of the home by ordinance in addition to all the other limitations and provisions contained in the zoning code is limited as follows no identifying or business sign shall be erected or placed on any site for which a has been granted by the except for the shipment and receipt of goods products or items necessary for the the use shall not be visible from the exterior of the premises the maximum time for which the first be granted is two years from the date of approval thereafter a subsequent grant of a for the same parcel of property for the same use shall be for such length of time as approved by the no person or persons be employed in the home occupation at the site other than the resident or residents of the site for which the has been granted the use not be varied from the specified home occupation identified by the applicant for whom it is granted ms provided a letter detailing her proposed home business diva arsenal a copy of the letter was included with the staff report all those who will speak on this petition raise your right hand do you swear or ms my name is was your business previously on road ms yes it was and in a storage unit on avenue what is the nature of your business ms i do replicas and restorations as i indicated in my letter i have been doing this since i do a lot of natural fiber fabric costuming and historical clothing some leather work quite a bit of metal work is that kind of noisy ms not usually not terribly your page indicates you have a firearms sales permit ms a federally licensed gunsmith yes do you have any plans to sell weapons or ammunition ms not out of the house for what its worth i have an industry standard gun cabinet with two different locks on it that has four inch and a quarter bolts embedded in the concrete to secure it are you restoring rifles and guns as part of this ms as part of my thing yes i have several disciplines that i have learned how to do are there any questions from the board in the special use is it just for this particular individual i hear that oliver yes ms it is for this particular use its whatever conditions you put on it only this person only the use that she proposes thank you ms i have a question about the vehicle that is there is it always parked in front ms it is no longer there that was a truck that i was restoring for a customer it has been gone since or of last year we did the upholstery we were going to do the woodwork on the sides and back then he decided he would do that himself ms do you do things like that ms actually thats the largest one done normally if i do any vehicle work it is small vehicles one of the reasons that garage door is seven feet and i plan on doing anything that we cant get in the garage again but that was a special situation in the plan that i drew it shows two sections in the basement that and then an open area in the middle so that impede being able to drive my regular car in i read the fine print in the special use and see that i need to have actually four spaces by the letter of it i submit that i am not entertaining any customers at that site there is one internal place to park if you pull straight in that open area in between the two sections i have delineated is actually big enough for another vehicle the driveway would hold a third where got the old truck now if it pleases you i can gravel that and call that the fourth parking spot ms that would be in the city ms never mind oliver the one thing id like to point out she mentioned work on smaller vehicles repair and body work metal work blacksmithing those are all uses that are listed in the code in use groups and those are for and uses so i wanted you to be aware of that you are saying those would be restricted oliver no those uses are listed in the code so if you get a business that would do one of those uses you would have to rezone to that category to do it you cant do it through a special use ms turned off require anything she is proposing to do would oliver yes if she were to work on small vehicles for example motorcycles are listed in those two use groups repair of motorcycles or other small vehicles like a motorcycle or some other kind of small wheeled motorized vehicle those would have to be done through rezoning ms with this action today would not allow her to do that oliver she could not because it is a listed use and a special use is limited to those uses that are not listed in the code in another use group and you did mention blacksmithing oliver yes are you going to be doing any blacksmithing not even sure i know what blacksmithing is are you going to be doing any of that ms most likely not and that have been a misnomer the extent of the metal work i intend to do would be in the case of an historic vehicle replacing a panel or trying to restore a piece of metal that is bent out of shape to put it back to its original spec please make the mistake of thinking anything like an auto mechanic thats not happening but i have and would like to continue being able to help restore historic vehicles from time to time small vehicles obviously if only got a seven foot garage door ms if i understand it correctly you cant do that at this address ms okay keep in mind we are not trying to keep you from doing your craft but we have to decide whether or not this is the right location ms thats why i had the storage unit before to be able to move the thing in there and take individual stuff from it and bring it back and reassemble it at that site so that bother me at all could you give us some examples of what could be included in the blacksmithing definition sounds to me like she be able to do that either oliver she i assume heating of metal and shaping ms and banging on it theres not going to be forage on this site no i have a gas torch for heating up metal so i can move it back into the same shape that it is supposed to be like removing a dent from a fender but theres not going to be forage or anvil or trip hammer or any heavy equipment on this site will there be any welding done here ms maybe little amounts not anything industrial i actually do have a small box welder that runs on that probably the thickest metal it can even consider would be quarter inch thick so it is like a home shop welder i think maybe there needs to be a better understand because we have the permit i see a copy of the actual permit all i see is your letter but from what your letter says it lists work in natural fiber textiles leather some wood most metals seamstress and work on clothing it says knowledge of blacksmithing i think we need to get hung up on blacksmithing when i think of that i think of taking melting steel however under use group which is what oliver was referring to let me just read you the service uses and this requires a or higher automobile repair and specialized service excluding rebuilding painting and body work and do you remember where rebuilding painting and body work actually falls ms oliver use group so the reason it excludes rebuilding painting and body work is because you would be able to automobile repair and specialized service other than those things in as low as a district but what i hear you describing concerned by considered body work anyway i will continue reading automobile seat covering installation automobile washing awning and canvas shops cabinet and carpenter shops fabric dying motorcycle repair tool sharpening or grinding and welding so a lot of those things seem to be what you are describing and i think the concern is that if the board of zoning appeals grants a special use special use say anything other than home occupations not specifically listed in section so in other words its not like some of the other special uses which say school or church or hair salon so if this were granted for a home occupation you would have to limit that home occupation to those things which are not identified anywhere in any of the other use groups ms okay the reason i bring that up is because we want to set somebody up for failure or to become a regulatory problem where we have i know what you would be able to do other than what i read can you describe what kinds of things you would be doing that fall under use group ms currently doing a lot of reproduction clothing costuming and making of small items the big historical thing right now seems to be and world war ii although world war i is coming up since this is going to be the centenary a lot of my customers are repeat customers i describe the nature of my business is becoming primarily internet and reputation an seller on several lists online that deal in such things pretty much i try to find a niche that people are wanting and try to fill it the last couple of years we have been doing a lot of soviet world war ii uniforms and equipment which is kind of neat and different prior to that i was doing civil war stuff it changes i cant even predict when it changes but it changes occasionally and you just go on and find the next cool thing that everybody wants i think the thing that caught my attention was in her letter you wrote that you have a good working knowledge of blacksmithing the next thing was talking about a federally licensed gunsmith i think that might be something that catches other peoples attention but i think that what you are saying is that she be allowed to do that anyway so even though its in her letter it really apply is that correct oliver if you approve a special use you should make sure you are not approving it for uses that are listed in other places in the code for example if she is going to be doing blacksmithing certain types of metal work or working on vehicles those types of uses are listed in another place so you cant really approve a special use for that because the code allow for you to do that how would we police that anyway ms we just say you cant do that at this address and if you intend to continue in that field you have to have another address to do it as a matter of law any special use permit that you grant cannot change the actual use to something that is within a use group i mean to beat a dead horse here but i keep looking through the use groups for example in use group which requires a or higher some of the things that are listed are the services of or tailoring repairing shoes watch and jewelry repair if you go through then to there are services uses involving furniture repair small appliance repair upholstery if you go on to that apply i read to you i read excerpts from all of these use groups which involves manufacturing products as well as servicing products you cant manufacture and when i say manufacture i mean taking it to assemble basically rooms and brushes buttons canvass products felt and feather products jewelry leather products luggage there is just a huge list i think the concern the has right now is they be granting you something that is completely useless to you ms okay do i need to apply for a different thing then was the special use the wrong one to apply for well that it sounds like is that you would need a zoning change you would need to rezone that property if you want to actually use it for any of the uses that we are talking about the ones i have been reading some of them require as high as an some of them require a minimum some of them are minimum you would at least have to bump it up to a commercial even then it would still not catch all of your uses did you see a list of the use groups ms no i came into the office and said heres what i do i need some help figuring out what i need to apply for and you never got shown a ms i see a complete list ms i believe i did talk to ms on the phone and told her that if she is doing anything whatsoever with any vehicles it will not qualify as a special use i definitely told you that ms i apologize too then if i hear that if she had a chance to look at the use groups and pick this would be a lot smoother i think can i suggest that we listen to some of the and what their concerns are that might help us with the list okay with that do we have any other questions of the board so with all the discussion here the only thing that she could do is the seamstress occupation or is that incorrect no she do that either oliver the standard home occupation does allow for seamstress and tailoring inside the home so if you live in the home you operate a home occupation seamstress business thats different from rezoning a site as a business without a home there i think thats what you are looking at is the use group that is a stand alone business for tailoring right but the home occupations not specifically listed in section and thats use group oliver talking about the standard home occupations within an or residential districts where you can live in the home it even require a special use you have to meet certain requirements like you have any employees you have an additional door for the business itself those kinds of thing but you can do a seamstress in your home business and fall under that category and not even require a special use but you are talking about additional uses some of which might not be listed and some are listed so that lies the problem some of these sound like they would be great to have in the neighborhood but lets hear what the concerns are ms inaudible off we had two or three situations in the past year where the houses that are already zoned come forward to get to this is a are there any keep in mind have a total of minutes combined my name is this is my wife she is handing out some things that we found that has been done with the business we are talking about i would like to mention one thing i did see there was a for sale sign on the truck thats out there at some point it be that it was for somebody else but there was a for sale sign i do hear noises in the basement that sound like rat tat tat guns firing i live at which is next door to thats how we here the noises in the basement what really here for is on behalf of the park neighborhood association and president as a concerned citizen and president here to say that most of us around the park feel that its in the best interest of the neighborhood that the home at not be given a special use permit to have a shop or a gun shop by the name of diva arsenal located in the basement or garage or house the homes around park and adjacent to the location are all residential only the people in this area all strive to do the best to maintain their homes and the neighborhood in keeping with the way it was originally developed from through the early the owners and developers of the land and properties at the time prohibited via recorded plat restrictions any type of commerce in the park subdivision during the eight and a half years my wife and i have lived at directly across the street from park we have seen young families moving into our neighborhood for the amenities it has to offer our beautiful park with playground equipment and the east branch library which offers wonderful activities and workshops for children as well as adults and we want this influx of people moving into the neighborhood to continue the diva arsenal is not a positive influence nor does it even belong in a residential neighborhood we are in the process of working with the historic preservation to declare the area around the park the park conservation district under the auspices of the preservation commission being one of oldest and most distinct neighborhoods we would like to maintain its safety environment and character and not become a mixed use area we thank you for your time and hope you take into consideration the feelings of the majority of the people around the park when you make your decision are there questions of i do do you have a copy of the plat restrictions he mentioned that there are recorded plat restrictions when this was originally platted i know that we have a copy of that we can certainly find one thats another thing that a special use permit is not going to trump special use trump zoning it trump the use groups its not going to trump a covenant or restriction that runs with the land which plat restrictions are we just read in a book about the park association that the plat restrictions were there but go and look them up just trying to avoid creating an outcome that seems to conflict with something else or that gives a conflicting message any other ms my name is i live at i just think that this business or any business really when we are trying to work on improving our neighborhood in making this a residential historic district to have this come into our neighborhood and bring the housing values down that are already down we need to go any lower really concerned with safety considering there are children in the park and the library and anything that deals with any kind of metal work or fumes or environmental smells or chemicals that are used for this type of business in working on cars and such i just think thats an addition to the neighborhood i would like to keep our neighborhood residential the way it is thank you ms my name is i live at two houses down from this property i just oppose it i think having a business there is going to hurt our little neighborhood i do hear it is like machine gun noises coming from her basement i know that she does make replicas of guns rifles and automatic weapons i think it is right for our neighborhood thank you ms you said you think it is right for your neighborhood were you referring to the guns ms yes to have a gun manufacturer whether it is replicas or real in our neighborhood it is right next door to the park or across the street where children play are there any other if not ms you have a chance to come back and talk to us and plead your case ms i feel kind of i prepared because i see the different uses that were specifically enumerated so not so sure that the special use permit is the thing that i should have applied for in the first place as regards permitting or whatever on i know what else i need to speak to if understanding the words from our counsel it sounds like you have more of a zoning issue than anything else for what you are wanting to do it sounds like you might have to petition for a change of zoning ms or look for one of the aforementioned already correct zoned areas it looks like this special use is probably not the best fit i think we are trying to make that happen but i think it is a and if i were to vote i cant see approving this for the special use because it fit the mold so to speak so i guess other options be if there are other special uses or a rezoning that does fit might be an avenue that you want to try or relocate as mentioned and would solve those problems thats my comment on where we are with whats written here just trying to focus on special use as far as what was applied for that would be my feelings are you at the present time conducting the type of work that you say you do in your letter to this board ms i changed my sales tax license or anything to the property pending the outcome of this i closed my storefront next door to strictly shooting which is where felts lock is behind the mall then pending the outcome of this i was going to have my licensing changed to that i think if we took a vote on this it would be kind of dicey maybe you need to go back and explore ms i would like to come back and see the book with all the different uses in it ms it is all available online oliver and we are willing to work with you if you want to come to the office we can go over that list together and see how we can help you ms i appreciate that i feel kind of dumb for suggesting the use and not been able to look at all the options that are available we appreciate you taking the proper steps coming before this board ms i wanted to make sure i doing anything that was against the planning commission or the codes and it can certainly be convoluted and difficult if you are not used to working with ordinances it is sometimes confusing how do you want to proceed do you want us to call for a vote ms thats a good question because my understanding of it is if it is voted down i have a calendar year and if i withdraw is it the same ms yes ms it makes me no difference i was going to suggest we postpone it let her get her ducks in a row with the plan commission then once she finds out all the options that are permissible maybe have a discussion with the neighbors and then come back and if you find out you need something else you can then withdraw it but i think should give her the opportunity to table it so she have to start over again with the whole process so i would make a motion to table and waive the fee for days motion

do you swear or ms my name is i live at court my company is promotional services here on behalf of casino hanks signs has applied for our permits i did have a representative from hanks here but he had to leave for another engagement i also have with me the director of marketing she will be able to tell you what purposes she will be doing with the message unit that we are asking for the special use i also have with me he is out of and who is going to be manufacturing the signs and hanks will be installing them the sign itself is tall but the message unit is it has been approved by design review and redevelopment i also have some pictures of other signs that have been approved by redevelopment and design review we have done the mail out that was required and we get any objections we are here to answer your questions we thank you for approval thats an exciting new look ms it is a very contemporary it is different sure chose signs because they have done a lot of but this is not going to be a typical sign anywhere else except for the logo of they are very unique and different they have dimensional the big circle at the top has led lighting behind it and it is all very contemporary a new look you have a paper in there too that shows the location where it is going it is between the transportation center and the hotel we have gone and marked the spot and gone by all the rules if you got any questions on the message center can answer those too this sign here ms that face is just the message unit right how big is that one again ms okay people walk across that street a lot and necessarily use the walkway thats provided what do you all envision being advertising on that is it going to be a fast moving my fear is that somebody is going to be looking at that and not watching out for somebody trying to cross the street ms we do have signs posted to encourage people to use the safe passage but people will walk right past those and take the chance everyday we plan on following any kind of rules or regulations that you have for content our primary messaging would be current events promotions entertainment hotel and restaurant specials varying information like you would see on our the speed contrast and video content would be controlled by whatever guidelines there are in the city if any inaudible ms we will want it to be complimentary and easy to read its obviously going to be a stronger westbound read than east thats intentional the eastbound read will be from people on our crossing over and will have more still content the other side will be the primary messaging ms i absolutely love these kinds of signs inaudible ms i think when they first started coming in existence there was a rule that you could only flash only so many seconds in a minute or something this was years ago but i think there is anything to that now because of new technology ms so i would just ask that you not intrude on ms sure we will keep that in consideration and we want to intrude we want to help create a sense of arrival on the property all of you from know that when especially when people outside our area which is a large percentage of our business come to our property there is no true of arrival we are pretty sprawled over acres so this will help us anchor that end of the downtown which we have tried to identify as the entertainment district so it will just help them experience the excitement outside our property before they even walk in my name is with sign company out of st we are the manufacturers of the display i would like to explain a little about the operation and how we do choose the best programming and for site specific applications the best way to display a message on a moving display there are guideline on freeways where you have one second off four seconds on you have different messages like that on freeways depending on the area it might be more stringent in an area where it be seconds on and things like that in different areas of cities where we have that where we have pedestrian traffic or mph streets you might see it a little bit different but still the best way to display a message is to put it up and have it on approximately seconds and then either have it fade out or quickly its off and the displays are automatically dimmed so at night they are on brightness for two reasons one that can be bad if somebody is driving second the pixels themselves will halo into each other if it is too bright so they image sharp so by getting the best picture the display automatically dims down to sounds like this package you have has the flexibility to accommodate different brightnesses lightness and such are there any nix my name is bill nix with industrial we got a notice about a week ago our concern was really what we would see from our office side there and i would like to say that casino and have been great neighbors sure they will continue to be and an added community value too but i would like to see about any changes on the back side of the parking garage facing our office is there any changes on that side on ms inaudible are they on the poster ms so you cant really see it very well the third thing down there is actually a red arrow that points into the garage and says casino and that would change out to a arrow so it would just change out to a green the sign thats on the corner is going to be removed nothing will be put back there so as far as obstructions or added lights or flashing they will have nothing added on that side nix i have no other objections is there a motion for approval motion was made and seconded call the roll ayes ms when do you start putting all these up ms in we look forward to seeing them oliver interim executive director
