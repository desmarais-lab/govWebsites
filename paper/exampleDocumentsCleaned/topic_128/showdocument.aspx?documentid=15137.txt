and development commitment nelson is requesting to rezone a small acre site at avenue from to with a use and development commitment this site is on the east side of ave adjacent north of pigeon creek and south of unimproved ave this is a request for rezoning to to afford nelson the opportunity to file an application for erection of a new cell tower on this site the zoning classification allows erection of a cell tower if approved as a special use by the board of zoning appeals this small lot is adjacent to additional lots zoned under the same ownership and is not a practical site for residential development the zoned sites in close proximity to this lot are all wooded undeveloped sites due to the topography and the location of the surrounding isolated zoned areas it is unlikely that residential development will occur on these sites there is a use and development commitment included as part of this rezoning petition that limits use of the site to a cell tower a copy of the commitment was included with the staff report the comprehensive plan designates this area for commercial development the rezoning to is consistent with the comprehensive plan future land use map no site plans were submitted with this application detailing the exact location or height of the proposed cell tower however the site is limited to some degree by the proximity of pigeon creek it is uncertain how the proposes to access this site the property adjacent north of this site is under the same ownership as this site and presumably access is available to through the alternate site the previous site of a bread store site review will address access and compliance with all code requirements upon submission of plans for the construction of a cell tower on this site if approved for rezoning to the owner will next need to apply for special use approval from the board of zoning appeals to allow the erection of a new cell tower on this site and additionally need to file for variance to relax the height limit for the new tower all those who will speak on this petition raise your right hand do you swear or affirm that the testimony you will give is true and accurate so help you god those nelson my name is nelson this site is on the corner of and diamond on the southeast corner the lot we would like to have rezoned was at one time back in the maybe a residence was on that lot its a foot wide lot the adjoining lot is zoned correctly and what we are asking for is the lot next to it to be zoned to be in compliance with that so that can put up a cell tower i have a ground lease to on this site it is by far the best use for this ground because most of it is in pigeon creek the top part of it is above ground and out of the floodplain told me they will go through the necessary permits to put an elevated platform in and a cell tower here going through and the corps of engineers they have to go through a lot of hoops before they can get this done as far as access i own this property where the bread store is this is an foot wide easement called avenue in after i acquired this property we came before the city council to try and have that vacated i know if you have had a change to drive out there but it is basically a road that goes nowhere it goes into a big pit the owner of the property at the time was and he made the petition and he hired an engineer who made the plea to have it vacated but for some reason the city council voted not to vacate it so we are going to try that again i want to get this zoned and i am going to go back and try to get that vacated so that they will have access right now i have an encroachment permit from the city to use that easement thats what we will use it is valid for two ms thank you are there questions for nelson when they tried to get that vacation does that road serve the other properties to the east of where the bakery used to be nelson its really interesting i also own this lot over here too but right here if you go down a ditch that is about feet then there is a giant washout or something on either side of me there is feet embankments if the land is ever going to be developed all that would have to be filled in in when billy who was a surveyor out of mt came in and pleaded this case he estimated that the cost to build a bridge was somewhere around two million dollars it would go across property owned by the family and they currently use it to store trailers on i want to sound bad but this is just basically wasteland theres a giant inch storm drain that comes out of diamond avenue and flows into pigeon creek i talked to an engineer looking at possibly trying to fill in my lot and bring it up and make it worth something how high would the cell tower be nelson i know has requested that i first get it zoned they will have to follow whatever regulations they will go through the permitting process ms thank you are there any none is there a motion for approval motion was made and seconded call the roll ayes ms abstention there being affirmative votes and abstention docket no goes forward with a recommendation for approval docket no petitioner professionals plaza address complete legal on file ninth street nature of case change from a co zone to a zone professionals plaza is requesting to rezone their property at one southeast ninth street from co to this is a acre site located at the northwest corner of ninth locust streets this is a request for rezoning to to allow more flexibility in the use and development of the old county school corporation administrative building the moved its offices to new quarters on the south side of walnut street and their administrative office building within the civic center complex campus area has been vacant since that time the new owners plan to remodel and change the use of part of the building to include a restaurant the existing co classification limits commercial use of the site to professional offices the comprehensive plan future land use map designates this as an area of institutional use with commercial and mixed use in close proximity the rezoning to is consistent with the mixed commercial uses within the surrounding area the entire civic center campus area from martin king blvd formerly seventh street east to avenue south to walnut street and north to vine street excluding the existing commercial building was blanket zoned by the city in in anticipation of the construction of public buildings and uses all in close proximity to each other and all sharing the large parking lot known as the back forty this is a public parking area available for use by any business and institutional uses there is an existing space parking lot on this site with two access drives onto ninth street the building is immediately across ninth street from the back forty public parking lot utilized by the civic center complex and surrounding commercial buildings and uses any changes to the existing parking area will require site review approval no changes will be required to accommodate the of the building site review will address compliance with all code requirements upon submission of plans for any changes to the current use of the site this is a request to rezone the old administration building to allow more flexibility in the uses allowed on the site the building has been sold to a private entity and it has been indicated that the new owner would like some flexibility to convert some of the building space for other uses all those who will speak on this petition raise your right hand do you swear or affirm that the testimony you will give is true and accurate so help you god those ms my name is here on behalf of the petitioner the professionals plaza is owned by i told today that he probably need to be here for this presentation i think everybody can see what a great use this will be for this property that is currently vacant right now is going to remodel the building as indicated and it will be professional offices predominantly but he would like to put in a coffee house and lunch eatery for convenience for all of us that work here in the civic center with that the coffee house will be coffee and lunch in the beginning eventually he hopes to expand to have it open for dinner three nights a week and probably also have a small fitness center in the building for his tenants and possibly also city and county employees so exciting use of the property and we would appreciate your recommendation to approve this rezoning ms thank you are there questions i have a question but i just want to reiterate the conversation that and i had just so we are on the record about this because i had asked about the fact that there enough parking spaces we have required other people to have an easement why you answer that question that way we are on the record then in the future if somebody else says we let them do it they will understand why on this particular issue that is the case sure the back parking lot was built for public use so this building would be able to use that as parking spaces if they need additional from what they already have they need any type of shared parking agreements since it is for the public thats where we were coming from ms so that would apply to anybody around that same back yes ms thank you are there any none is there a motion for approval motion was made and seconded call the roll ayes ms abstention there being affirmative votes and abstention docket no goes forward with a recommendation for approval ordinance changes amendment of section of title of the code of ordinances of county pertaining to gravel parking lots what we would like to present here just to give a little background i had a meeting put together with a small committee of the county surveyor county engineer city engineer who is one of the commissioners and also the we decided to bring this up we have quite a few people coming in for variances for gravel parking lots they go in front of the what we were trying to do with tis ordinance allows certain uses to be able to use the gravel parking instead of paved parking which is required for all commercial uses now ms variance to so are these just some of the ones that you almost always gave a yes a lot of it had to do with the mini storage facilities then add to that i sent out several emails to people and we were trying to think of that would apply for gravel parking areas i have sent this out to several review and comment i know with that committee we put together we have we tried to other uses people for gone back and added language taken language off this is the final project that we came up with i have sent it out to everyone here for their review and i tried to make any minor changes that i got back from comments so this is what we are presenting to you today ms and we are presenting this to vote on it correct we would like this to move forward to the county commissioners and this is for the county only ms alright i was kind of hoping is this going to be for the county only it wont be for the city no this is only for the county if we decide we want to put together something for the city we always can one of the things that has come up in my tenure of being elected when i worked at cape and i bring it up with i worked for cape i work there any more we had a fire house on the and we used it as a shelter a lot of our constituents lived out in that area so we turned the downstairs into an old office we had to have a concrete parking even though we had planned parking on the street and everywhere else they kind of forced it on us so they allowed us to have rock for a couple times finally we decided to close the office instead of putting in a concrete parking lot because we cant afford it nonprofits have that much money and they are taking it away more and more so thats one but we have also had others we have had people that will buy they own commercial and they will buy the property next door they have a rock driveway already so why make them make it change it into concrete we had a problem on baize street doing the same thing a area he was trying to hook two buildings together and he was going to have to go through the state he had some blacktop and some other things some things there was going to be changed you just constantly run into these things all the time they do the project so they hire more people they just passed on it which i think is a shame we cant work common sense somewhere comes along the line also the thing to is we are paving so much anymore it seems like the more and more we pave the higher the water table is getting and we are flooding people so the answer was i just said why we use rock that once it gets wet it pretty much hardens but it still seeps through i think that would solve all the water running off into the street i think its a win been trying to do this ever since we changed it so i thought now was the time to do it i actually thought both city and county were doing this because we will have more instances in the city than we will county id rather pass for the county and get moving for the city next ms thank you any other comments as someone who worked on this too i want to point out that is a center for a lot of mining for southern southern western we are going through now some gas and oil people that in those businesses require large storage yards and they need paved yards we have a lot of equipment people in this town and again that type of equipment when you are talking about trying to pave to meet the weights of that equipment you are talking about a really undo cost what i see from this ordinance would be to allow those type of people heavy equipment users to be able to have rock parking lots and not have to go through variances or even some of the requirements they have of paved roads but try to make it easier for these folks to locate in there because these are good tax paying businesses ms thank you let me ask you a couple questions number one is the water absorbed through pavement a lot more expensive than regular asphalt you mean the porous pavement it is again give me the cutoff point here between what you want to allow to have gravel versus what you are going to demand people to asphalt that seemed a little nebulous to me what we had come up with was and the back story is the first feet that a person comes into their property we are not asking for them to pave where that came from was whenever you do an erosion control plan the first feet you have to put down a number two stone and that is to be able to clean off the material coming from your site before it gets to the road so with doing this that first feet that is kind of the process that would give the ability to clean off your tires and also so that rock go out into the road either with coming up with the rock we thought it was a with allowing the storm water to infiltrate the ground instead of having so much runoff thats kind of another reason behind it then also in talking with the about the green space and the trees for pat of that requirement thats something they brought up as far as a pollution control type thing so thats where we came up with the premise of this i think you answered my question ms you are talking about what kind of business yes what kind of businesses will fall under this particular scope as proposed to a we have mini storage facilities cell towers campgrounds inventory storage and display for commercial sales or leasing or agricultural or construction equipment semi trucks and trailers recreational vehicles or motor homes manufactured and modular housing yard barns then we also have for the small businesses kind of the combined business where they have a residence but they also want to have their commercial facility in their back yard or something to that effect it also covers those types of facilities ms i think it is good common sense as well as making it more business friendly thats outlined on page two its kind of a crawl before you walk as your rep to the this is where we get a lot of requests from so having the feet of solid surface in only for certain kinds of uses kind is what we use to provide permission to have gravel on a permanent basis otherwise it is just a two year temporary i think it is a good crawl before you walk and its very limited on the uses to be able to have to do feet of pavement i think is still some substantial cost and requirement i would like to call everyones attention to page three at the top where it talks about the tree buffer zones i think that this is pretty well written and gives lots of relief to the residential properties where they are doing some commercial business but this says it is going to require a tree buffer zone basically on all sides of the property i think that we will probably have a lot of applicants come to us where not all sides of the property its almost wasteful so i guess what i would just like to do is keep that language there and maybe provide some language that says unless in the discretion of the area plan director we see that it is not needed ms how do you feel about that i would like somebody else to draft the language exactly to be more comfortable with it i just think that not every single situation is going to need trees ms when you say all it is like every i like to have black and white whenever dealing with something because i want to feel like said its okay for this person to do this and the next person come i think it needs to be black and white if somebody wants to eliminate something they can always go to board of zoning appeals but i think we have worked with and i have talked specifically with a person who was planning on doing another mini storage facility and they said they would be more than happy to do the green space so they have to spend that money for the concrete or asphalt paving i think it is a they are giving a little bit we are giving a lot ms other discussion any other concerns bill are you okay with that i think the question is what was the point of having a paving requirement in the first place and does this thwart that and i think it does ms well we still have a paving requirement we do have a paving requirement for the majority of other types of businesses but when you are considering whether to amend this or that and to provide this or that i think you have to look at it from a planning and land use standpoint and not just an administrative ease of administering it because we want to knock out a lot of petitions for variance from the ms its common sense thats right and there are specific reasons and i guess i would point out that not only do these types of businesses come before the a lot they almost uniformly are approved because when you get into the factual situations there really a problem with the neighbors around them they are worried about the dust from gravel or anything like that when it comes to the front property line remind me is this were they otherwise required to have an opaque fence or is this just those trees are just there because of the gravel yes the trees are there for the gravel and they are also there for whenever they do grow to a certain height it was for that pollution control of dust kind of one of those meet in the middle with basically some people who want the gravel right and thats another thing that comes up at meetings where you do try to protect for example if you have a residential neighborhood behind an area that is going to be gravel a lot of times they will suggest you put plants and trees there so its a wind block basically to filter out anything that is going to blow through there is that needed on the front property line though if the front property line is always going to be frontage adjacent to a public street i guess if you are talking about having it black or white which i agree i want you to be burdened by any discretion that you want to have wondering if it should be just be eliminated and just have all property lines except for the frontage i have no problem with that that was just the language that was crafted from all the comments from different aspects perhaps it would be better for the developer if we permitted site review with the developer to select one side that require trees because it be in a situation where you are displaying equipment and its not on the frontage and theres a side road that is a lot away but the people can see your equipment from that road if we say it is required on three sides and let site review and the developer agree on which side it have to be then that gives them a little more flexibility we did put in there for if they are displaying equipment that the reduction as far as the spacing goes was reduced in half so we did try and put something in there ms okay so that was something that was taken into consideration for if they are trying to show their product eliminate a good portion of what would go in that frontage ms in the interest of not getting into another hour are people comfortable voting on this or do you want to continue to talk about it my comment was based on whether we can make it better right now this is something that we need and i would say lets vote it through we are crawling before we walk we have other uses that we might add to it someday we change that part some day but i think it is important to keep this moving ms everybody agree with that do we need to do a roll call well there ought to be a motion and are you moving that it be approved as is or are you moving that we eliminate the trees on the front or you need to vote on whatever is in writing in front of you or continue it so that we can get it in the format that you need if you want to make changes it will hold it up to some degree ms you would have to make the changes and then we would vote on it next month yes pretty much i think you could make some changes there are some things that we do change on the fly usually they are not major the only thing i had was that there is a deadline of today which we got extended until tomorrow to get it on for first reading in for county commission if we do make changes that probably will push it to an extra weeks before it can get to final hearing in the county if a property that an applicant has business in two subdivisions on the other sides then i would say you have to do all the sides but if it is two miles to the next farm house they can always get a variance for that i know but we are trying to stop that thats the whole purpose of this but i will make the motion to approve it as it is tonight and then hopefully we can see how that goes and come back and change it then ms okay we have a motion and second please call the roll i just want to thank everybody and i vote yes ayes ms there being affirmative votes the ordinance amendment goes forward with a recommendation for approval we have one last thing on the agenda this would be under other business it is a request to change a condition on a plat i will go ahead and read this then if anybody has any questions i will be more than happy to try to answer them this is ms commercial of lot request to change a condition the commercial of lot is a lot commercial subdivision which split lot into lots a and the site is located on the east side of green river road south of riverside drive primary plat approval was granted by the area plan commission in and the was recorded in the plat showed that lot a had frontage on riverside and green river road with its location at that intersection while lot only had frontage on green river lot still has an existing residence as it did at the time the plat was approved in granting primary plat approval on the of lot the area plan commission imposed conditions of approval regarding access the concern was that access to the new commercial lots not be from green river road lot a was required to access riverside drive access for lot was to be from a new roadway to function as a frontage road immediately to the east of the site which would connect with riverside drive the approval letter to the representative for the applicant lee describing the action taken by the commission lists the conditions as follows the developer must post a letter of credit for the proposed extension of the road to be located immediately east of the site covering the cost of extending this road to at least the driveway for lot prior to recording the plat construction of this road extension to the driveway for lot must be complete prior to any change from residential to commercial use of this lot and all access to the proposed other than residential access to lot must be from interior streets only as a result of these conditions of approval an access note was added to the recorded plat which states lot a shall access riverside drive lot is currently utilized as residential use when lot is changed to commercial usage access shall be from the roadway to be constructed along the east side of said lot no access to green river road is permitted the family has submitted a letter requesting to modify the conditions of approval and access note on the plat and has submitted a use and development commitment to further specify the actions that they or a future buyer of the property will take concerning the access road and the letter of credit the request is to modify conditions of approval and to state the following the current owner or any future purchaser of the property must install the road to be located immediately east of the site to at least the driveway for lot lot of commercial section adjacent to the south if lot is to have a separate commercial access on the road or post a letter of credit covering the cost of this road prior to any change from the existing residential use to a commercial use of lot lot the road will need to lie within either dedicated or a private easement the owner shall comply with this condition unless the lots are sold with the adjacent land to the east and an alternative plan for development of this overall property that provides satisfactory access from riverside drive is filed with and approved by the area plan commission approval of the modified conditions would effect a corresponding change to the access note on the plat so that it would state when lot is changed to commercial usage access shall be from the roadway to be constructed along the east side of said lot or from an alternate access approved by the area plan commission staff recommends that the access note on the commercial of lot plat be changed as requested staff also recommends that approval be conditioned on the modified condition wording the recording of the signed and notarized use and development commitment and recording of the approval letter for the modified conditions to be cross referenced with the plat ms okay so all of that is telling us basically what it is they have a letter of credit in place since what they would like to do is get a couple conditions removed basically what it is saying is if someone wants to come in and do a commercial use in what is now a residence that they live in that that road would have to be built at that time on the back side of the property and the commercial would have to access that drive on the back side instead of accessing green river road which that was the intent all along so they would like to go ahead and have that condition removed and i believe we have a representative here if i could just add to that the basic problem here is you have a letter of credit sitting there for no reason it is costing these people a year when it was originally platted i think it was intended that there would be some commercial development there but as circumstances changed the family decided to keep it residential there is no reason to have a letter of credit sitting there to build a road that the residential property need so what we had worked out was to change that condition but protect i mean you still would want the road there and the access closed off of green river if it was developed as commercial so putting these conditions on the plat and under statute the plan commission can require as a condition of approval of the plat the use and development commitment which sort of repeats the same thing and makes a commitment that all of this will get buttoned up once it is sold to someone for commercial purposes but in the mean time it allows the family to stop having to deal with that letter of credit and incur that expense and to continue using it and refinancing it for residential
