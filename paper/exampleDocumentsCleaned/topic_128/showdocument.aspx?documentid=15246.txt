mobile home and patsy are requesting a renewal of their temporary variance to relax the restrictions of the zoning code to allow temporary placement of a mobile home the county code allows only one dwelling per lot in the agricultural district in the contacted area plan commission regarding reconstruction of their residence at the time of the application it was noted by staff that there was an existing mobile home on the site occupied by a sick elderly parent of the owners area plan commission staff contacted the with an agreement allowing the construction of their new home subject to immediate removal of the existing mobile home upon the demise of the mother who was residing in the mobile unit since that time area plan commission staff was notified by the building commission office that the existing house had received such extensive damage to its foundation as a result of recent flooding that they had ordered the residence to be vacated immediately for safety reasons and all utilities were disconnected from the house as a safety precaution the then moved into the existing mobile home on the site the existing residence has been demolished in of the board of zoning appeals approved a time limit to allow the temporary maintenance of the mobile home on the site the have obtained permit approval for their new home from area plan commission and have been preparing their site for construction of their new home they had run into an issue with their septic system which has just recently been resolved and are preparing for their issuance of final building permits they are requesting additional time to work through the issues that they had encountered it is recommended by staff that the mobile home be approved only for the period of construction of the new home once the are able to move into their new home the mobile home should immediately be removed from the site or they will be in violation of the zoning code for having two residences on one lot this is a request for relaxation of zoning requirements to allow for the temporary placement of a mobile home all those who will speak on this petition raise your right hand do you swear or patsy road and you are both living in the trailer now yes i remember the case a year or two ago when you came before us was your attorney so familiar with what is going on how much time do you think you will need to work out the problems with the septic tank and get the home under we are hoping that the problems have already been taken care of but the way things are going we are afraid to say yes because it seems like every time we think something is going right something else happens so if you could we would like another year if possible but the mobile home will be gone when we can get into our home and are living in it thats not an issue we just know how long this is going to take like you said last year the way weather is and getting everything set up the way we need to do before we can move in we were supposed to be able to get our building permit after i saw you that day there was issues with that that i aware of so there is a holdup on that now so its just one thing after another so we would appreciate the year i have one question for you as the trailer sits there now by itself is there any violation of any ordinances or codes technically yes because trailers and mobile homes are allowed only a mobile home court this one has been there since the so i think that its probably close to being uninhabitable in that they probably move it off if they wanted to it would probably destroy the unit i will say the problems that the encountered because i went to building commission and asked them dealt with the flood elevations which you probably even know i think you already have the information you just know it when you applied before you gave elevations by a surveyor and that is what they were looking for had i known that i would have gone and helped them but i know until you left yes we were unaware of everything i think it is already taken care of if you come in our office we will help you work with with the building commission he has already called me and he has some other issues that i had to call the surveyor to talk to them about it takes a lot of doing which we realize we were going to have to do all of this we are new at this i was by there today is the new home going to be built on that elevated pad i see and thats up above the floodplain no the home has to be three foot higher than what the dirt is that we hauled in does that road flood yes the road in front of our house does get under water not every we have lived there for years and we have only had water in our basement one time thats when it destroyed the basement are there any other questions or i know they want the mobile home gone immediately but if we could just relax that a little bit and give us a couple months after we get into the house because you are talking about a lot on us to do all that and then turn right around and try to empty the mobile home also so a couple month leeway there would really help us out is a year going to be enough time a year would be enough but the problem i had was the way it was worded it would have to be removed immediately the immediately not sure we can do after we move into the home i think we mean that the second the builder completes it i think if you want to make a motion that clarifies that you can say they have a year to build the house and then days from the completion of the house so that would give you a maximum of two months thats just one way to do it another way would be months or two years i will make a motion that we approve it for months so you motion is that in months they need to have the house built and the trailer off the property motion was made and seconded call the roll ayes so as of today you have months to get the house built and your stuff moved docket no applicant common address complete legal on file road nature of case applicant requests a special use for a farm is requesting approval of to allow establishment of a farm winery in conjunction with his vineyard at road has a acre site located on the west side of road north of road the zoning code chapter requires approval of a special use permit by the board of zoning appeals for those uses identified in use group in the zoning code on county adopted a change to use group adding farm products processing and sales where fruits vegetables or other planted crops grown on site are processed including but not limited to cooking mixing with other ingredients bottling packaging etc that transforms the fruits vegetables or other crops into higher valued farm products for human ingestion value added farm products such processing involve the making of wines ciders jams jellies and other consumable food or beverage products the approval of this proposed farm winery requires approval the proposed farm winery use requires parking spaces in an amount determined by the board of zoning appeals to be reasonably adequate to serve the public for customers patrons visitors and employees the submitted site plan indicates a space compacted stone parking and access drive farm wineries and similar uses are further restricted by ordinance as follows written requests for temporary use of substitute crops grown off site be

added farm products is allowed as follows a the sale of other foods and beverages is allowed as long as these items are associated with or commonly consumed with the value added farm product are

facilities for the processing retail display sales and sampling of value added farm products are allowed within the following parameters a the facilities must be strictly ancillary and incidental to the primary farming use the facilities include patio seating or other outdoor areas for picnics gatherings private noncommercial gatherings hosted by the property owner or the farm use operator or other activities incidental to the farm use all those who will speak on this petition raise your right hand do you swear or my name is west franklin road i am the owner of the property why you tell us a little about what you are here for and what you hope to accomplish what we are here for we currently have a on the property consisting of about five acres of grapes and we would like to open up a farm winery and operate it there on site at the vineyard according to code and according to the new amended ordinance thats our main purpose to try to open up a business have a farm winery in county so you are going to be building and taking the grapes and making the wine there on the site grapes would be processed on site and in the building we would have a tasting room for patrons to come in and taste and purchase the wine alright ill open it up to questions from the board so you own the ground and you leased it to someone for this operation i own the ground and i operate the vineyard grow the grapes myself it would be ours i just got confused i obviously easily get confused today but you gave a different address than the address of the property yes you asked where i live i live at west franklin road the property is located at road i do not live there will you be using only your grapes or are you going to be bringing in grapes according to the county ordinance i can only use my grapes this is something that at area plan we crafted with the expertise of and oliver at area plan staff the trick was that they grow the grapes there they process it and then they serve it so thats how the special use kind of came up with it so there is a lot of thought in how this special use is going to be applied as far as concerned there are other bodies like the state of that regulate the business thats going to be happening on sites so there are some things that typically we might look into but in this case i think we have too its good to see that this land can be used in a very productive way and now we get a winery in our county will you be selling other products there like jams and jellies probably not jams and jellies it would be probably associated items that go along with wines that you would normally see or have at a winery you could have cheeses sausages bottle holders cork screws things like that that would be associated with it not that they are going to but what if they use it for a farmers market kind of location does that fall within the parameters of what you all have set up i think it has to be the processing on that parcel its got to be what you grow there the only flexibility that i can see of the product being grown and processed and served there is that if there is a bad year for a crop they bring in more supplies to make that same kind of product as long as they get the authority or permission from the executive director of the area plan commission is he being limited to wine only or if he bought a bunch of goats he do cheese and things like that thats why the ordinance was written as a value added products rather than specifying that any other questions are there any ms my name is road our property is located directly next to their property so theres questions we have the location of the square foot building where exactly is it going to be located you know where the existing building is that sits there my observation when i was out there was it looked like it was going to be north of that building there is going to be a driveway coming off road then as it approaches that existing building it makes a turn to the right going north ms is that a copy of something that we are available to have also yes ms do we walk right out of our house and see the whole back of the building thats kind of in reference to it as what looking at are you located north of this property and on the same side of the road ms yes i know the answer to that question but i think that might be a possibility that you would walk out and see the back of it have you had the opportunity to talk with them yes these are the questions i have the location of the building and if the building is directly right by our property if there would be consideration in moving the building south or towards the lake or anything like that the other one is how does that affect our property value with a business going right next to us secondly when the ground was being done there was some drainage issues and we just want to know that is taken care of when you start digging dirt and putting a building in there is a hill and it could drain down into our property we just want to know that is taken care of then just in general because there is a lot of in the asking of things there is a lot of clay in it they could host private things and then because its county is there a noise ordinance at one in the morning when they are hosting a private event is that going to affect noise and things like that and that we also have a special needs child at home we just want to know that the safety of her is taken care of just a lot of questions those are all good questions as far as the location of the building according to the site plan the location of the building sits to the south side of their property and to the rear of their property if you are looking directly to the north it is not in direct view of their house the building would be like on the back side of their back yard about how far off the property line it is listed to be feet off the property line it is roughly close to feet off the road which that property line is probably maybe feet so from a western direction it is going to be about in the same location as the existing building it would be farther west the site plan shows it feet from road i know if the site plan shows the property line being feet it show it currently the mouse if you ran that a little to the north that would be about the location of the building on the west side is that about also where it would be located probably a little farther to the east not much maybe feet what business hours do you think you might operate it was projected proposed business hours would be we plan on doing any private functions i am retired this is a retirement business for me i plan on spending most of my life there best case would be that we opened up on a but it would be closed and as well the same hours can you sell wines on there yes according to the code give me your hours again say through are you aware of any drainage problems are you aware of any drainage problems we are the highest point so all the water on our property drains downhill and they are at a low level below us there is some natural drainage a little that goes right down into the yard i would like to let everybody know that this will have to go in front of site review so drainage issues and things like that will have to be reviewed and approved by all the members of that committee thats a good point the drawings that we have are kind of just to give us an idea of what it might look like but this body does not approve exactly where the building is going or anything like that or drainage the question before this body right now is is it appropriate to allow this special use on this parcel of land somewhere on this parcel of land i think you need to be cognizant of how your construction affect additional drainage onto their property and do everything you can to keep it on your property the matter of property values i know if we can speak to that or not thats an element of the considerations but without evidence have you talked to a or appraiser ms this is the first thing that we have done so it was more of a question on your part ms we just had questions about it whats the dash line up in the corner up there is that an existing thing going to be torn down or something the dash line is the location of the septic system what kind of grapes are you going to grow we currently grow about grapes we have seven varieties concord whites most of them are and hybrids i wanted to ask the neighbor if she was satisfied with those answers whether she had any follow up questions ms i do have a couple this is just to approve the permit not the building or the hours even or what would happen on the property well it would approve his ability to use that property for that purpose ms just because too just sometimes because you have plans to host parties and do that but if thats in there to approve and there is lots of people and do you have the space i know if that is what we are asking in the permit as far as the safety the traffic how is that stuff regulated ms well at this meeting is when you have the opportunity to request changes not that suggesting you do anything like this but if you wanted him to put a fence or build a berm or plant trees or other things like that this is where you would get him to make this commitment once he gets that building to do this and it sounds like a wonderful thing this is where that would happen once he gets the permission and leaves he is pretty much done except for the site review not opposed to that being there it just like all those things if the building is feet from our house and not saying change happens but for the last however many years we have been the only person right there thats kind of hard to walk out and see a commercial building feet because its not a residential building its a commercial building feet from your property that could potentially have people there drinking or this or that and you know thats their reasoning for coming there and just with our safety and you have other children and i know they are perfectly aware of that because they have family that has kids our age right there too i just want to know that stuff like that is taken care of he is not proposing to take care of anything if there is something you want to propose ms well i would propose that the building location be moved or somehow that there is a property fence or things like that i would also propose that there was some regulations on how many people could a maximum capacity i know if thats possible or not or the hours of special gatherings are different or that the noise not really sure and just to make sure the drainage he is the highest point and it down hill not only does it affect our property but just the drainage in general drains down the hill into other peoples driveways to wash out things the drainage issue certainly at a loss to see how the building of this is going to increase the water flow on your property i see how it would ms i know thats why just asking because right now there necessarily but when it rains heavy and hard just on our property line down you can watch it down our fence line and go down and make it dirt spots which not a huge deal we just want it to be exceeded more i think from a certain standpoint these are not strictly speaking commercial more like there a special operation agricultural as far as the occupancy the fire marshal sets that in terms of indoor capacity i know that there are any and there could be but i just know of them i know of any regulations relating to outdoor spaces i guess its possible to have a big party anywhere living out there if like most people who live out there that i know you have been to maybe a bonfire ms well we but we understand that there are limited parking spaces its not a terribly large site in terms of moving the building the septic bed cant be moved according to the owner i think that was who told you that sir i had a soils engineer come out and test the soils and it would be very difficult to inaudible portions ms are you willing to do anything to address her concerns i know she asked you anything in particular i would be willing to plant trees inaudible so she would still see you inaudible ms i think that would help if there is not other options well i would be willing to include that in a motion since you have agreed to it on the floor if we are ready for one if there are no other we are ready for a motion move approval of the request and make it a condition that you plant trees that are mutually agreeable wit this particular neighbor and where do you want the trees in a location that is agreeable to inaudible you guys work that out well the biggest problem i see is what if they cant work it out maybe the better thing is if we can get him to agree to put up trees along the property line that would block her view i would be willing to plant two rows of trees along the north property line of their property within feet of the existing fence on how big centers probably eight foot centers and how long least to the foot setback line ms i would be willing to just i know like meet you there and just kind of you point out ok you say this is where it is and we could kind of talk about that i mean i have any issues with that inaudible the other thing about tying it to the property line exactly is because of the contours if you plant them next to the property line by your fence it take years for them to get tall enough it blocks their view whereas if you move them up the property line a little big it might be better i know and he would be easy to work with id have this next door to my house no question so i kind of like the idea of letting them work it out i think that seems to be a reasonable person and i know is he is very conscientious and wants to be a good neighbor i would recommend we just let them work it out the motion needs a second we have a motion and second call the roll ayes we will leave it up to you guys to get it worked out i think it is going to work out just fine ms i thing we had seasonable questions absolutely docket no applicant living hope baptist church inc common address complete legal on file hitch peters road nature of case applicant requests a special use for a church and incidental facilities living hope baptist church is requesting approval to allow establishment of a church within the commercial building at hitch peters road the petition filed by the church indicates that the church is requesting to lease the existing commercial building one day each week presumably on a day when the structure is not otherwise in use by the owner medic services the zoning code chapter requires approval of a special use permit by the board of zoning appeals for churches and incidental facilities there is an existing partially paved and partially graveled parking lot that was installed when the building was built in there are two paved access drives onto hitch peters road one at the south end of the property and one approximately feet north of the south drive that leads to the front of the building the site plan submitted indicates approximately parking spaces could be available on the site within the area that is predominantly gravel space is available for additional parking on site if it should become necessary for the use of the site a church requires parking spaces for each seat in the church although no information has been submitted regarding the proposed church attendance the existing parking lot would facilitate up to a seat church and there is space available should the congregation exceed that amount compliance with all code requirements will be determined by staff upon issuance of a change of business occupancy permit all those who will speak on this petition raise your right hand do you swear or my name is road i have any questions so going to open it up to the board do you have anything to add other than what was read into the record no and this is just one day a week yes we used it on a for a funeral dinner and like a good service on a night but we basically lease it one day a week do you have another facility somewhere no what happened was we are just two years old so we met at the holiday inn the clarion inn we borrowed my sisters church in the afternoon so the owners who were great to work with said we could put a sign up so we had the sign built and did the permit and got a call that said we have a church there so we had no idea so soon as we found out we started the process so we have met in those hotels but we have been in this building since so we are just trying to make it right what part of the building do you utilize for the church we use the front part but the building is kind of set up into two parts the back part is where they keep their ambulances and equipment then the front part is about square feet and has the big auditorium nursery and three classrooms kitchen two bathrooms they also use those classrooms and teach and that kind of thing so we use the front part of the building so its kind of already set up to your benefit yes it used to be used for like weddings banquets receptions then when these people bought it they kept the front end like it was for classrooms and the big room so we rented it one by the previous owner and i found out they were keeping it that way so i contacted them and we worked it out to set up a one year lease great any other questions any none is there a motion for approval motion was made and seconded call the roll ayes docket no applicant fellowship inc common address complete legal on file road sign is requesting special use approval on behalf of fellowship church at road the church proposes erection of an

message unit as part of a proposed new sq ft monument sign planned on the church property along the road frontage compliance with overall will be addressed by staff prior to issuance of permits for the new sign all those who will speak on this petition raise your right hand do you swear or ms my name is with sign road representing fellowship church basically we are requesting your blessing for their new sign that they need desperately its a good looking sign i think not invasive fits in with the neighborhood ms its actually smaller the initial sign they had was a pole sign a lot taller they want something lower to the ground just to let the church members know different activities and things that is going on at the church any questions how far off the edge of the road will this be because i think there is a ditch are you going to be in the ditch ms no its actually back it looks like it is set back far enough where its not going to be an issue ms we had so many feet back from the that we had to be then we had and associates who did a survey also are there any questions are there any none is there a motion for approval motion was made and seconded call the roll ayes the first two items on the agenda tonight according to our ordinance should the petitioner fail to comply with notice requirements as provided by this section before the second regular meeting and this is he second meeting of the board of zoning appeals following the date the petition is filed the petition shall be withdrawn by the board and the time limits imposed for the withdrawal is the same as a denial so it would be a one year time limit before they could reapply okay is the applicant aware of that i have talked at length with the first two on the agenda porter seem to know exactly what she wants to do just yesterday i talked with i had expected him to email me a withdrawal letter he is not going to go forward he is going to let his home go into foreclosure the company that placed the manufactured home on the site placed it incorrectly he is having trouble getting them to correct it and he is walking away from it sure the company if they are not going to get paid will probably move the house in the past we have typically given one final notice letter if you comply with a notice and pay your continuance fees by a certain date then we would ask them to withdraw by ordinance you could withdraw it tonight its totally up to you but we have in the past as a courtesy given them a letter spelling out that it will be withdrawn if they do notice where is the ordinance you are reading from looking at the county it says because when you read it you said shall thats the way it reads it says the petition shall be withdrawn can you read me the number again i do not believe it is totally up to you i think it says shall okay if you want to be belt and suspenders about it you can call for a motion do we need to have a motion on it lets have a motion just to be clear its because they were on the agenda twice and do their mailing properly twice they do their notice at all they have to comply with the notice requirements before the second regular meeting of the board following the date the petition is filed so got two months to comply with notice requirements whether you consider it as being this month and last month or just sometime within the last got to get here by now okay with that being withdrawn but to wait for a whole year again to do something about it they have the ability to come before this board and with unanimous approval you can waive the one year time limit alright have either of them paid anything neither of them have paid any continuance fees we did send a letter telling them they failed to show up they need to pay the continuance fee by this date neither of them replied neither of them did notice i contacted both of them by phone and confirmed that neither of them have done notice or paid any continuance fees they paid the filing fee though they paid the filing fee to get on the agenda and to continue it requires another fee yes half the original fee unless it is waived we need to be clear i thought you said all three of the no not all three the this is his first he forgot to do notice he came in our office and it was too late to do notice he paid a continuance fee he will do notice and he will be here next month okay so the motion is as to the first two on the agenda i think they have had two opportunities to be here its deemed withdrawn as a matter of law but if you would rather make the record clear you can make a motion and vote on it well whats the term we use do we withdraw it yes it says the petition shall be withdrawn by the board then i make a motion to withdraw the first two due to the compliance with the ordinance motion was made and seconded ayes there being affirmative votes docket nos and are withdrawn we will send them a letter telling them it has been withdrawn in the future it would be fine with me if you just did that as a consent agenda item we have this happen very often it just happened that you had two people on the same agenda who one who cant make up their mind what they want to do and the other who flatly told me they are not going to go forward findings of fact docket no petitioner kings great buys plus address road they came before in and had some banners up on their light poles they got caught doing that so they came before us to see if they could keep them up and voted it down has drawn up these findings of fact first of all the findings stop at page four with the signature line i attached for reference the transcript behind it and the staff report basically this is a case where the sign company had a new type of product and put up this product on the kings property sort of as a test to see how it did they were not aware that there was a rule against putting too many signs up if you go to page three they already have three signs identifies who is from digital imaging says that they put it up they made it and put it up and know about the ordinance says members of the expressed concern regarding retroactive approval of and the waiver of fees says no evidence was presented to show the need for the variance other than the fact the violation had already occurred says the does not find that the strict application of the terms of this title will result in practical difficulties in the use of the property because the use of the property require approval they present any evidence regarding the nature of the property at all says the does not find that the need for the variance is not created by the applicant which of course is a double negative and means that the found that the need was created by the applicant it means that the found that the need was created by the applicant nothing inherent in the physical properties of the business premises or circumstances that would keep them from using the commercial property consistent with their zoning uses or from having signs so it was voted down i would like to make a motion that we accept the findings of fact on the kings great buys plus at road docket no to be correct and accurate second ayes there being affirmative votes the findings of fact are approved is there any other business i have one thing that is more like an announcement in the next week or so i hope you will be receiving a letter and a confidential questionnaire that i need you to return to me and this is simply so that we can have information that will allow me to help identify conflicts of interest it will be an privilege document not subject to public disclosure the letter should be but if you have any questions please give me a call it is something that the general assembly has really been focused on in terms of conflicts of interest on public boards and commissions and i think it is important that we try to comply with that with as much information as we can thats all i have will it be emailed directly from you to each of us or from the staff it will come from me in the form of an email i decided yet whether it is going to be an email it will be to that was one of the things i wanted to talk about sent us all an email asking if he could email the board packets i know there has been some discussion about that i responded to you that i felt it should go on the website ms appearance here this evening really brought it home to me about how very useful to me it would be if you posted the packets on the website letting everyone see them i think that it would help everyone who appears in front of this board the packets are available online everything you get in your packet we put online the next day you simply go to agendas and meetings click on the little blue link to the docket number you want to see and the whole staff report pops up oh well thats so useful maybe everybody should know that maybe you should perhaps let those folks know thank you so they can check maybe a week and a half or two weeks before and see what is going to be on the agenda and have access to the same information we do they have access to the same information that you have as a courtesy we always mail them out to the members first and then within hours we get them online the other matter we talked about earlier before the meeting started was trying to save some paper are we sort of all in agreement that the minutes from the previous meeting thats okay to email and we will read those but the agenda and specific pages related to the special uses and variances will be mailed to us okay with reading the minutes online but i always take the printed material with me so it makes it a lot simpler for me if got that in front of me i prefer to have the specific pages relative to the special uses inaudible conversation is there anything else
