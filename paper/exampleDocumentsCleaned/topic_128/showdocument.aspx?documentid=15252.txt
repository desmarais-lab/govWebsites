totaling sq ft this is a request for relaxation of the maximum number of signs from to to allow maintenance of two banner signs erected without permits all those who will speak on this petition raise your right hand do you swear or affirm that the testimony you will give is true and accurate so help you god has been sworn in my name is berry drive what is your affiliation with kings we produce the that is on the property those two banners did you install them also we did whats the name of your company digital imaging did you know you cant do that no honestly because we normally install signs this is actually a new design for pole banners that kings allowed us to put on their two poles to test out the new design and its currently we hope to have that finished up so we can sell our business section nationwide so we hope to that this test will be allowed to continue so we can move forward with the marketing of this product are there questions from the board ms does anyone else in town have permission to do this sort of thing i guess thats for staff ms i can recall that asked for maybe eight of them at two different locations and held them to one or two other than that i cant recall any that have done the actual permanent banners ms so if we do this this would start a new trend we have also installed recently of these for the university of on their campus we are moving forward with the design and they are very happy with them and they got a variance for that i remember years ago there was a special occasion that they wanted to put some up i have noticed that they are back up again maybe they interpreted that it just went on forever we replaced what was already there thats all i know can you tell me what is the actual sign made of its got steel a strut channel at the top and the bottom and they are welded together then the same on the other side and allows you to spread across the pole as opposed to two vertical signs on the side which are generally hard to read because they are so tall and vertical where the writing is whats that made of vinyl so subject to fade wind things like that with it being a permanent fixture you do you anticipate rotating those out with different adds and different promotions my understanding is that if it fades and needs to be replaced we can replace it with exactly whats there but no change the wording thanks my concern is twofold you are asking for something permanent sometimes in this capacity i sort of cringe when somebody wants something permanent secondly the owners did not go through the right process and correct channels to even put up a temporary sure that was probably an oversight but nevertheless what they are asking is forgiveness of that they get a permit they pay the necessary fee that makes it a little unfair to others that follow the rules and pay the fee secondly you are asking for something permanent well the choice was temporary and they were unwilling to pay the fee every month to keep the up there so there was some discussion that it could be put up on a permanent basis where we have an ongoing fee and i could continue this test we are asking to add permission to put the two signs up that are on the poles in the photograph and on a permanent basis ms they are asking for your approval to allow those two signs that are there in the picture as permanent signs to stay unchanged because if they change the face they have to get a new permit to make the two signs in the picture permanent in the paperwork it says from ms there are three fascia signs there now and they will be required to they are going to be removing if they already the banners on the sides of their trucks that they park there can you summarize the temporary sign approval that is present from a temporary sign ms right now you can get a temporary sign permit for days the price of the day permit is based on the size of the sign up to square feet is a month up to square feet is a month it is a square foot for anything over square feet and you can only have one temporary sign on the property at a time and it cannot exceed square feet my concern is if we allow this it subverts the whole permit application process and the waiving of the fees if it matters i did pay to seek the variance which would have been easier to just do the permit i realize coming in the back way here and thats part of the deal and how did this come up ms typically its usually a complaint how did this one come up ms site inspection ms we find it a little difficult to ignore when we see the giant banners on the trailers which brought our attention and raised a bright red flag ms so hes not requesting a temporary sign for these two signs he wants it to be permanent so that means that if we granted it other people would come in and ask for permission and they would probably ask to have the fee waived too are there any none is there a motion for approval motion was made and seconded call the roll ayes nays ms there being affirmative vote and negative votes docket no is docket no applicant common address complete legal on file avenue nature of case applicant requests relaxation of side yard setback from feet to feet for an attached carport brown sparrow is requesting variance approval for her property located at avenue currently ms sparrow has a sq ft residence with a sq ft porch sq ft yard barn and an above ground pool and deck on a acre lot she is proposing construction of a new carport attached to the north side of the residence over the existing driveway table a requirements in the zoning code requires a minimum foot side yard setback for residences in the district this is a request to relax the side yard setback from feet to feet to allow an attached carport addition to the residence all those who will speak on this petition raise your right hand do you swear or affirm that the testimony you will give is true and accurate so help you god ms sparrow has been sworn in ms i live at avenue and you own the property ms yes is there anything you need to add ms basically i have a concrete pad not even a driveway just going to extend the concrete out the carport will actually be on the side where you cant even see it coming down the road its a street there are two houses past me it is its going to be a shingle roof block base i want to be able to park my car and get my kids and grandkids in the house safely id also like to clean up the front i have roses and and a rock garden then this clutter yucky porch because i have nowhere to put trash cans or bicycles there are carports of this nature in the walking distance around my house its very common in this old type of neighborhood the construction would be totally on my property which includes all the gutters there will be nothing hanging on the other property i had engineering come out i wanted to make sure everything was okay with the land and the property for what i wanted to do to make sure i was doing it right you described what it is going to look like will it have a gutter on it and where will that water be channeled ms yes it channels down if you can see to the left the whole property drains to my land anyway from both properties but its going to come down and over it will be on my property leading back the back end of the carport where will that be in relation to the end of the existing concrete drive ms they are going to add feet so its not on the existing concrete they are adding feet of concrete back and its also drawn on those papers so you are going to have to put quite a bit of fill in there ms whatever is needed its really not that steep at the top it kind of drops off but there will be block wall and foundation saved for years to get this so i wont go into debt we are not going to go wider than we see in this photo its just going to go further back ms correct and that driveway right now the edge of it is on the property line ms actually about inches which one of the drawings shows thats why we need to go to zero ms yes ms have you talked to your neighbors ms only talked to two one is against it one thinks it great and wishes we could put it between our two houses and share it are there any my name is i reside at avenue i have property that borders martin and so the back of my property backs up to the same street my lives at she has concerns about the zero property line issue as far as home valuation she bought the property last fall had there been a structure on a zero property line she might not have bought the property the pictures show a bit of a grade but it really show a grade as true as it actually is so she has concerns with the foundation and the pad being poured with water run off issues possibly also her property has a driveway that goes down the grade and in the back yard where she has a detached one car garage the property to the north of hers has the exact same circumstance in just pure logic i cant see any reason why this person go behind the house and put a nice detached garage and not need a five foot variance on the zero property line and it would stay aesthetically pretty much in line with all the other homes that are there the biggest concern is the zero lot line its one of those issues where maybe some folks would buy a piece of property sitting on a zero lot line and not give it a thought but others are going to i buy a house that on a zero property line but she has concerns about that but its run off issues i know she is going to put a gutter on it but how much will come from a pad being poured or a foundation sitting there for them to build that structure they are going to have to access ingress and egress on her property and i think she really wants her property to be a constructing landing zone so just basic concerns that she has but she has a detached garage behind her property the house to the north has a detached garage behind their property there is really no reason why you need to put a carport at the end of this house just go in the back yard like the other two have done and build a nice carport or a detached garage as you are facing the subject house your lives she lives immediately to the right she also has concerns about i also heard storage if you start sitting grills on there gas cans mowers on there that make a potential fire hazard five feet closer to her house also are there any questions ms my name is i live at about two months ago ms my next door neighbor she was on my property with a big machine really ruined the side of my yard it kind of slants down toward her house she had a construction man and when i saw him on the property they had this big machine sitting there and i asked him what he was doing there he said he was putting a carport up but she have a permit to do it at that time this was two months ago so anyway he said he got a permit so later on he came knocking on my door and he said he had mud on his face i said why do you have mud on your face he said i thought she had a permit and i said i thought you were supposed to get the permit he said well no i i said well you ruined the side of my yard i said you need to fix it and they fix it i had to fix it myself so just saying you know i do not want it there and id appreciate the board saying no you live next door ms yes i want it there be a bad place just depreciate my property and i just bought it in if i had known this id never bought the property are there any questions of this lady ms sparrow you can come back up and we will give you five minutes to respond to what heard or add anything ms there is no room on my property for a garage i have a pool that was there when i bought the home and a shed out back where my lawn mowers go i have a deck that i just put composite down so i never have to worry about splinters thats where my grill goes the only thing that will be in my carport other than my car are the two large trash containers that the city says we have to use now and in the summer a couple of bicycles and baseball and softball cleats i plan on getting gas cans the incident with concrete tech he told me he was getting the permit a resident i know this is making me a nervous wreck i know the minute i found out he have it i said this is your job thats why i paid a licensed concrete person to get the permit i said well then stop ill go through the right channels so i came down here to do it the right way i also bought grass seed fertilizer and tried to fix her yard too hoping to get a carport and ill be thrilled to plant any grass seed she wants if she wants a nursery to come out and do it i will pay them to do it got another neighbor on the other side i take care of my property i want it to look nice i want the neighborhood to look nice not going to destroy her grass i will keep them off her grass and not step on it as much as humanly possible as far as the drainage you can see from the paperwork i gave you water would have to drain uphill to get on her land at all i have the lowest property in the entire neighborhood its fine i knew it when i bought the house but everybody drains on mine its okay my gutters will be toward me even for arguments sake if i tried to make it go out the water would still go back on my land its all documented by engineering thats why i had him come out and look how the land drains to make sure i be doing anything to her property sorry i think she want me to have a carport my house is appraised at more than what hers appraised for its going to increase my property her property and anybody in the neighborhood when you increase your home value it helps the whole neighborhood i have the latest appraisal of my house too could you build a carport that still maintains that five foot ms no i wish i could the edge of your existing concrete driveway ms there is only about anywhere from inches from what the guy that came out and surveyed and said its less than a foot so almost already on the property line ms yes so i want to go past that are we free to try to suggest going down to like a one foot setback instead of a zero with the width of that driveway looks like we be able to do something ms i know if i could get my car doors open then we are going to put on the white picket in the front thats what we are going to put on the side and back so i have more room to get the car doors open i babysit my youngest granddaughter three times a week and shes only seven months old and i think i could get a car door open to get a car seat out of that is it going to be for two cars or one ms just one and it be any wider than the existing concrete drive and it would be a straight line back ms yes and i have pictures if you want them if you live on the west side around there they are everywhere are there any none is there a motion for approval ayes ms i would ask you that your contractor or whoever is out there respect the property of your neighbor and any messes you make out there please ask them to get it cleaned up so your neighbor have to deal with it at all would you do that for us ms sure docket no applicant and common address complete legal on file franklin street nature of case applicant requests relaxation of maximum fence height on a corner lot from feet to feet for chain link fencing and are requesting variance approval for their properties at franklin street the purchased and rezoned the lot at franklin street in and razed the buildings on the site with the intent to allow commercial vehicle parking they have since purchased and razed two zoned residences between the vacant lot at franklin street and their existing commercial warehouse at franklin street the appeared before the board of zoning appeals and obtained approval for temporary gravel parking to allow time to complete the purchases and raze all the structures the petitioners erected a fence around their temporary gravel parking lot on this site they are requesting variance approval to allow the chain link fence to remain along franklin and baker streets a permit was granted for construction of a new sq ft storage building on the site and all existing gravel parking areas will now be paved the are requesting variance approval to allow the foot chain link fence to remain along the franklin street frontage and along the baker street frontage the zoning code states that maximum fence height within any front yard on a corner lot be feet this is a request for relaxation of maximum fence height on a corner lot from feet to feet for maintenance of the chain link fencing all those who will speak on this petition raise your right hand do you swear or affirm that the testimony you will give is true and accurate so help you god ms has been sworn in ms my name is here on behalf of the property owners and as the staff report indicated over the past couple of years the have been acquiring some property that at least one of them was under foreclosure they razed that property in order to be able to expand their electric business and storage of their equipment across the street from where their primary business is located on franklin street this body granted our variance for the paving relaxation because the process took a little longer than we expected and we appreciate that now this is the final step the chain link fence does not obstruct the vision which is the idea of the setback requirement on a frontage property the fact of the matter is given the location and the equipment my clients have in this property there is a real risk of having a three foot fence around this property to damage to the equipment they have in there they keep as much as they can within the storage warehouses but sometimes do have to have equipment outside of there and are very concerned about vandalism accordingly we request a variance for a six foot fence obviously we sent the letters as required to all the property owners i have had one call from a neighbor who lived in the alley in the back and she indicated she have any objections at all as long as we blocking the alley and the fence is within our property line so nothing we are doing could block the alley i would appreciate your approval of this variance request if we could hold that picture there appears to be a gate there ms yes there is there is a gate here there even be two gates to be honest i drove around the property but there is definitely one here in the front for their ingress and egress are there plans to extend that six foot fence to the west and put a larger gate across the driveway ms the existing gate is all they have right now to their mind the deal is finished except for the paving ms exactly are there any questions did they just put the six foot fence up in error ms yes i involved i know that they came to commercial site review and walked through the thing and just quite understand what was going on not even sure who their contractor was but its kind of been piecemeal and they thought they were doing the right thing by expanding on the property but were unaware of the six foot on the corner lot deal the three foot on the corner lot i do have to agree a three foot fence would not offer any security are there any none ms turned off ms okay going to defer to you and your expertise on the plantings ms inaudible ms okay so you would request that ms inaudible ms and i guess to the extent the variance is the request for the fence to be six foot tall i assume that they can prune those back on the corner there is there a motion for approval motion was made and seconded call the roll ayes ms would you take back to the owners our concerns about letting those bushes get too tall and not restrict visibility ms yes special use docket no applicant
