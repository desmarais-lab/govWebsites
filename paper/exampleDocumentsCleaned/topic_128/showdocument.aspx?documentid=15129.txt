development the site is in an older area of very mixed use predominantly industrial to the west of grove street and predominantly residential use at this location along the east side of grove the area

motion for approval motion was made and seconded call the roll ayes colter ms ms there being affirmative votes docket no recommendation for approval goes forward with a county rezoning docket no petitioner fellowship church common address complete legal on file road nature of case petitioner requests change from an agricultural zone to a zone with a use and development commitment fellowship church is requesting to rezone a part of their church property at road from agricultural to with a use and development commitment the use and development commitment included as part of this rezoning ordinance limits use of the site for signs only the county zoning code chapter requires approval of a special use permit by the board of zoning appeals for all electronic message boards signs with flashing moving rotating or intermittent lights or animated messages special use is permitted with approval only in commercial or industrial districts the applicant proposes a new electronic message sign for the church along the road frontage this is a request for zoning to allow the church to file for the electronic sign special use the rezoning site on the submitted survey is the location proposed for the new sign the small size of the rezoning area will limit the size of the proposed new sign the existing church on this site is located on the north side of road between and roads access exists on the site as was approved by site review the proposed electronic must not interfere with traffic by reducing visibility for egress onto road staff will address compliance with all code requirements upon submission of plans for the erection of the new sign on the site after approval of the rezoning of the site for the sign the church must file application for approval for erection of the new electronic sign to be heard by the board of zoning appeals all those who will speak on this petition raise your right hand do you swear or affirm that the testimony you will give is true and accurate so help you god those persons have been sworn in ms my name is with sign inc i am representing fellowship church to get a certain spot rezoned so they can have their new sign ms thank you are there any questions the setback on the sign is that adequate enough because road will probably be widened at some time i would assume in the near future so is it set back enough ms yes the setback on it is according to the setback per the city but its basically where the sign is going to be located really what they are wanting people to see as they are coming in and out from the church thats who they are wanting to be able to read the sign the people entering and exiting the church so it is going to be far enough back so it wont hinder anyone from road even if that were to become a road down through there ms then i guess they would probably have to move it back because they just got through widening it and doing all that work there thats currently a road its two wide lanes with a left turn lane in the middle because they redid all the curbs and widened the whole thing right there ms so thats why they waited so long on getting a sign until all that work was done ms other questions i have a comment i would ask if this goes through as an administrative matter you need to submit a new use and development commitment ill show you how to fix it on the last page nothing substantive but you wont be able to record it in the format that its in ms anything else are there any ms i live at place which is directly behind the church really just needing clarification that we are only talking about a small portion for this sign that the whole acreage will not be rezoned commercial or that in the future that wont make it easier to rezone what they submitted was just a foot area so thats all we would be approving tonight theres nothing else that would be zoned for commercial ms and on that same size they would have to keep it that size sign and not increase the height or anything without coming back is that correct they would have to come back to our office and i believe they would have to come back to the for approval so they would have to come back in front of someone ms there is no slippery slope on this one good question anything else is there a motion for approval motion was made and seconded call the roll ayes colter ms ms abstention there being affirmative votes and abstention docket no goes forward with a recommendation for approval ms the rezoning portion of the meeting is now over and we will now hear the proposed subdivisions that are on our agenda as stated earlier the area plan commission is the sole authority on subdivisions state law and our subdivision control ordinance dictate the issues the plan commission can consider when reviewing a subdivision application unlike a rezoning consideration of a subdivision is limited to whether it complies with the standards and requirements in the local subdivision control ordinance if a subdivision application meets the requirements set forth in the subdivision control ordinance the area plan commission must approve the primary plat courts have indicated that plan commissions have no discretion in this regard and that our role in reviewing and acting on subdivisions is purely ministerial seven affirmative votes are needed to approve a subdivision plat and conversely seven negative votes are required to deny a plat in the event that there are not seven votes for or against this is considered a no action vote and the plat returns to the next meeting for consideration the guidelines for testimony on subdivisions will be the same as those explained at the onset of this meeting petitioners and should remember that the only testimonies the can consider are facts that prove whether the plat complies with the specific standards in the subdivision control ordinance copies of the subdivision control ordinance are available in the area plan commission office in room or on our website at now lets move on to the subdivisions enclave at eagle creek section township map co lots location located on road south of expressway the enclave at eagle creek revised plat is a lot residential and commercial subdivision located on a acre site west of road and south of expressway on the area plan commission granted primary plat approval for the original lot version of this subdivision the northern acres of this property was rezoned from to with a use development commitment by the county commissioners on this area for commercial development was part of the original plat and was proposed as smaller lots originally designed for home sites the revised plat now shows this area as lots presumably for commercial development the public streets that were planned to extend through the area have been removed from the plat eliminating one of the two public subdivision entrances on road this change in the plat requires review by the the subdivision review committee reviewed the plat revisions on the plat shows an eastern subdivision entrance on road at drive and a second western access at stellar drive near the eagle village apartments the subdivision streets extend from these access points into the site and connect to the internal subdivision road network if a commercial entrance on lot is planned within the line on road at the northern end of the site this access will require approval sidewalks are required by comments on the revised plat from the county engineer indicate the following erosion control measures will be especially important due to the extensive grading anticipated and steep grades on the site any driveways on road within lot and north of the line marked on the plat will require approval utility or drainage pipes under any existing roads must be bored instead of open cut trenching concerns about sight distance stemming from the curvature and grade of and the embankment on the west side of road at the road intersection removal of the classified forest designation for lots and determine sidewalk alignment to connect the existing sidewalk along stellar drive with road and meet all sidewalk requirements the comments also addressed the need for sidewalks to connect this development with stellar drive to the west so that the area will have pedestrian accessibility to the mets bus route on road and to the campus two of their other recommendations were comments on the original plat but were only slightly changed to reflect lot renumbering on the revised plat comments from require that any connection to road within the will need approval and submittal of a traffic impact study for the development plan city water and sewer are available by extension at the site a letter of credit is required the water and sewer department comments state that the existing water line might need to be relocated for lots this water line continues through lot the required easements need to be granted on the plat from the approved utility plans the preliminary drainage plan was approved for the revised enclave at eagle cliff subdivision by the county drainage board on the required drainage easements must be shown on the plat prior to recording if the enclave at eagle cliff subdivision is approved primary plat approval should include the conditions listed in the staff field report all those who will speak on this petition raise your right hand do you swear or affirm that the testimony you will give is true and accurate so help you god buck has been sworn in buck my name is buck the developer bucks lane i think the staff report pretty well summoned up why back we deleted some roads and some lots so they said i needed to get ms thank you are there questions for buck are there any none is there a motion for approval with the following conditions prior to recording revise the plat to provide written documentation that all water and sewer department requirements are met if driveway permit approval is sought provide documentation that the required traffic impact study has been approved by both the county engineer and include any required improvements resulting from any traffic impact study in the subdivision letter of credit provide to the satisfaction of the county engineer that the sight distance concerns at the intersection are addressed provide documentation from that the classified forest designation has been removed from the property based upon this documentation revise the plat by deleting the wording and line work for this designation provide documentation that the water and sewer utility easement shown on the plat in lot has been vacated motion was made and seconded i seconded the motion do we need to do it again just confirm that you meant to second it with those conditions ayes ms colter ms there being affirmative votes docket no is approved just to explain why i jumped on that our ordinance says that you cannot add conditions after approval and i want somebody to come back and say thats what happened docket no poet square section township map co lots location located along peck road south of baseline road request to remove condition of primary approval the poet square plat is a lot residential subdivision on a acre site located on the east side of peck road between baseline road and old state road across from the new north high and middle schools primary plat approval was granted by the area plan commission in since the subdivision approval two sections of poet square have been recorded in the northwestern portion of the primary plat totaling lots these two sections access through the residential subdivisions to the east the primary plat for poet square also shows an access to the west of the subdivision on peck road in the primary subdivision approval the area plan commission placed an access condition on this plat as allowed by state law based on comments about the original plat from the county engineer and the the condition states that access to peck road should not be allowed until the roadway is improved to a standard facility from baseline road to old state road the road was widened south of the north high and middle school entrance which is the southern half of the road segment specified in the condition the county recently resurfaced the road north of the school entrance and added an approximate rock shoulder and a section of guard rail however this portion of peck roads pavement has not been widened from its original size the applicant now requests to eliminate the condition on the primary plat approval restricting access to peck road until it is widened the proposed subdivision street to access peck road road on the primary plat is highlighted in the picture shown on your screens and will connect to peck near the southwest corner of the primary plat the existing access to the two sections of poet square that have been recorded is a westward extension of the existing drive into the site from the place subdivision adjacent to the east the members have been provided a copy of the county engineers comments on the proposed removal of the access condition due to safety concerns about the inadequate width of peck road the county engineer is not in favor of allowing access to peck until it is widened from north high school to baseline road his conclusion is that peck road cannot accommodate additional traffic at its current width the recent resurfacing and guardrail improvements to the narrow portion of the road have not changed the safety concerns about the width of the pavement county plans to reconstruct this road in the future but no schedule has been determined for the project and no work will occur until funds accumulate to be able to pay for the upgrade comments on the original primary plat agree with the county engineer and state the following peck road north of the north high school entrance is currently of substandard geometry peck road narrows to feet at the drainage culvert just north of the proposed development peck road is functionally classified as a local road and therefore would not have access to federal aid for needed improvements there are currently no plans and no funding for improvements north to baseline road we would expect approximately vehicle trips per day from this development at access to peck road should be allowed only after the roadway is improved to a standard facility from baseline road to old state road the access limitation recommended by the county engineer and the will result in poet square temporarily having only one access through the place and subdivisions to eventually reach old state road the county engineer indicated that it could take about years for enough money to build up in the highway north to complete the improvements needed to peck road and that assumes all the funds generated would be dedicated to the peck road project over this period based on the county engineer and comments staff recommends that the condition of approval and the corresponding plat note on the access restriction to peck road remain on the plat to protect public safety on this narrow road the subdivision access to peck should be installed once peck is widened to a standard facility giving the development a second access option all those who will speak on this petition raise your right hand do you swear or affirm that the testimony you will give is true and accurate so help you god has been sworn in my name is haiku road the managing partner of new urban investments who is the developer of this real estate does anybody have any questions of me before i start my presentation to convince you all that we should remove the condition upon the property okay this is just a plat of the subdivision from this is at old state road and this is looking north up peck road so this is basically a video of traveling north on peck road you will see the school entrance on the left side so theres the one way in one way out of the high school still on the high school improvements then we are on to the area where we are assuming is substandard geometry there is the roadway guardrails on the right the video will stop where our entrance and exit will end up being accessing peck road which is right there so i think one of the areas probably everybody has an issue with there is a bridge as you travel further north that actually compresses traffic a little bit more which creates a yielding effect between the vehicles that travel through there here is the bridge you can see the yellow highlighting the sides of the bridge i think it is actually approximately feet this is just a bigger blown up picture i was anticipating having a laser pointer here peck road obviously from maps the north complex heres our site as it relates to the rest where we were at in that previous picture is approximately right here heading north into that bridge geometry here is a video of two vehicles actually crossing through that bridge area the bridge way we are referring to is approximately here where this video will be taking place at thats the narrowest that it gets there vehicles somewhat yielding the one moving through i think you saw them both on the bridge where they passed so essentially what the claim is is that this road is unsafe for standard traffic but my contention is that it is actually helpful that these measures are on this road that it actually slows traffic down okay that it is a calming effect you will see i have an example from another county road so road basically does the same thing even to a greater extent because you cannot drive two vehicles through that road everybody know where road ends up at spring lake valley lot subdivision passed with no restrictions no conditions put on it at lots poet square has the same similar geometry that road does any questions this picture here this is a design technique utilized by traffic engineers urban planners city planners that actually their effect again is to calm traffic they actually put the yield point in to force cars to yield as they move through the idea is not to speed traffic up which is what standard facility geometries do wherever you go sometimes they say that it increase it is for traffic congestion but what ends up happening everybody drives on that road and it gets more congested well when what used to be a slow country lane all of a sudden becomes this wide country highway with curb gutter lanes high school kids traveling down it what do they do they speed up so again both instances those cars were doing something that the road is making them to do they are not being told there is no to say stop there is no flashing signs there is no traffic engineer telling them there are actually studies that correlate speeds and road widths to increased accidents increased fatalities one of those studies residential street topology and injury accident frequency done by an engineer actually out of he makes the point that the safest residential streets are feet or less you can say this a residential street it is either an arterial or a collector okay moving to traffic counts now when we started talking about the kind of traffic counts that are going to be affecting this road this is from back in a hour period so i just took both lanes because they actually put a counter on either end of the road one southbound and northbound added those together cars thats in hours compare that with road from that data i collected was that was only hours but i just doubled it to come up with the remember thats data so i am only going to assume there is more traffic on that road today than there was in just some general comments on potential case law issues the denial of the peck use substantially devalues the land at poet square resulting in a taking without compensation violation of fifth amendment of the us constitution article sec and in fact supreme court has recognized that ingress and egress to and from a public highway is a public right and cannot be substantially or materially interfered with without due compensation land owners suffer damage that is particular rather than that suffered by the general public a taking be found to have occurred the county cannot impose a severe restriction on real estate which devalues the real estate just because the county has not accepted the responsibility to improve said public road the denial of the use of peck road by devaluing poet square is also illegal or an exaction roughly requirements that provide the party to give up something in favor of the public need but by public law exaction needs to be related both in nature and extent of the impact of the developer in this case the overwhelming impact to peck road resulted in the construction of north high school and subsequent school bus traffic generated as a result thereof not the development of the subdivision supreme court has held inaudible by the government and those interests to be served in this case the public interest is that peck road should be improved and prohibiting poet square from accessing the public road does nothing further that interest five counties allowed other developments on less than standards shows unequal treatment and also a violation of the constitution so i would encourage the removal of this condition ms okay thank you very nice presentation are there questions for this petitioner are there any none is this the only access that you can have for this particular development no there is another access that goes to the two other single family subdivisions i see court to yes it moves east and then south and then east and then south its a left right left right thank you colter what has changed since the approval was given with the conditions previously in regard to colter well you had approval for the subdivision with the ingress and egress through and wanting to know why now we need to take a at this access to peck road probably a good deal of it has come from comments from individuals who have had a hard time finding the development and also from who say it is hard to get people back there to show the homes and also from people who are starting to buy homes there who use the construction entrance as their primary means of in and out as its a lot more direct than driving through other neighborhoods i would imagine the other neighborhood like it too much either when school gets started i could probably count at least four cars that will drive through the neighborhood to use the construction entrance some of those people know and use it but others i think their habits are already defined either through the elementary in and out if thats the way they are going instead of coming that direction they are probably purposely going toward the high school or middle school i was thinking that if you deny access to peck road there are a group of people that will be going back through these two other neighborhoods i think the majority of them still do can you describe the development of the school and the traffic using peck road now after the school has been built and is being used from all of that is designed to load basically the line up of the buses they line up the buses right through there you cant drive anywhere else but there turn and come back out well what happens then they improved this down here for the one lane only traffic to head back south out of the high school because thats all they had to do well what happened is these buses instead of turning left going all the way around the school and coming out this entrance they will come down make a right to baseline and then come down peck road so the drivers of those buses drive back around the school they actually go to baseline and then come down peck i know that thats one unintended consequence that occurred thats based on design that forcing traffic to go down peck that the school want to begin with and been there all times of the day if you pull up traffic studies the speeds are on average between miles an hour there its posted mph except when school is in session help me with the time line the condition was put on there before the road was improved by the school for the sections before the improvements that are there now so there was no pavement that you saw from my video there were no guardrails that you saw per my video it was a pretty rough road i wont deny that at the time it was rough but where it is now with the pavement the markings the guard rail and in addition to the effect that that road itself has on drivers that narrowing effect i know there are hundreds of roads in that are substandard that literally thousands of cars go down everyday just north of deaconess the neighborhood is just chopped full of what is basically one lane streets with cars parked on both sides and all day long those cars come and go with no incident but the part trying to get at when the condition got put on to the subdivision it probably was realistic to expect that when the school goes there it is completely expected to locate there that that peck road would have been part of that improvement it just kind of smacks of something not right that they did those improvements like that and then they still come down and around on peck road with the buses i wonder has there been any thought to widen peck at all i totally understand the traffic velocity to get them to slow down but wondering because the school is there now just because of the sheer volume of traffic that is there now that there before that has been a topic of conversation since researching this that goes all the way back to or when an initial plat of what we developed now was a completely different development but that was one of the things that was brought up at that time that peck road needed to be improved and that was long before there was any conversation of north high school or middle school ever even being there do you know if two school buses can pass each other on that road i believe they have seen concrete trucks and other delivery trucks pass each other on that road they are going slow they have to the road forces that which i think is a bad thing i think that is something to acknowledge and not say well everything has to be a geometry of foot wide with a bicycle lane and six feet of sidewalk and three feet of easement yeah that would be great but there is not enough space or easement or county to make that happen anywhere in addition we have already granted in front of all that property at no cost two questions first did you say that you already got people using the construction entrance they do unintended consequence yes but the ones that they are winding their way through the subdivision going up and probably coming down to peck to go through the high school anyway thats a possibility i guess right but the way the southbound exit or entrance only coming from old state to the high school its have to have a monster truck to jump the curbs even is you came out of peck and headed south out of my development you could never turn back into the high school can they do it from the north though they can get in the high school from the north right from baseline road they can yes thats my point got people in your subdivision that if they cant get through to the back then they are out old state up baseline and coming down peck anyway right they do the second question i know there was some comments about vehicles if everything was developed the big lots that you have you have four lots back there are those currently zoned to be just the way that it is set up right now and you are referring to the three bigger ones i think when you start looking at traditional neighborhood planning and we approach this as having a master plan with it but essentially we do we want it to be a traditional neighborhood design with new urban principles behind it between walking community we would like to see and as the neighborhood grows either a shared green space and possibly as you come in around that entrance having that be like commercial retail a mixed use space and we are getting a lot of positive response about that from talking to homeowners people buying into the community people planning to buy into the community but the current zoning on it right now its all the entire thing is which was done to accommodate our subdivision layout if this condition stays on there and you are not allowed to access at that point somebody living in the subdivision would have to go through then through get on old state and they can go up and down peck road as much as they want yes that was my point they still could get in there anyway the other point i was out there the other day and i got lost since this email came from john saying that peck probably needs to be widened from north to baseline but i guess my question is for or commissioner has asked to widen that yet is that in the works at some point its supposed to be there is a long story on this basically when the school corporation wanted to build out there they lobbied the commissioners to use the funds to do baseline and and i went no we were going to use those funds i thought on peck road well finally they wanted to get the permits and the other two commissioners decided to go ahead and let them have the permits to do that that took all the money so the school corporation was told they had to at least improve the road up to their entrance and that thats where that came but there any money in the fund right now so its not even on our drawing board right now but what we did do because we passed the resolution or something here that we should go back and do what we said in and widen that road at least we told we needed to go ahead and pave it do what we can by putting some rock out and stuff to make that better for the people driving up and down here because of this condition that was put on that you agreed to at the time but that was before any of the improvements that are there now was done i understand but that was part of what you agreed to knowing that we have that money for awhile but i was also not aware that the improvements were going to be asphalted striped rocked and then a guard rail put on there was never any conversation that thats what was going to happen no we did that because i asked and if we could do that to try to help area plan and show them that we are concerned about peck road so we moved it off of some other roads to put it on that road to help to do that for the school kids anyway so basically we tried to work with area plan but until we get some more money and that thats when well be able to do it and i think we gotta replace the bridge and thats gonna cost some more money i just wanted to make sure everybody knew that the zoning on this is an not an just so everyone is clear ms other questions turned off if you look at the tires almost on that white line there is no way that thing can go over the gravel inaudible thats not going to do it ms but that really the question is it that was one of the things he brought up about the school buses going side by side and passing each other ms but either then can or they cant that really have anything to do with do you anticipate school buses will come and go through that entrance is that why thats an issue there at some point be right now i have houses there with six families living there out of lots the total traffic count there was estimated at and we are at ms three hundred and something i think what is saying is that the school buses can have that trouble right now i mean there are spots on harmony road that are just as perilous right next to the hornets nest before you can get to the intersection at daylight we could go all day talking about spots where buses cant pass all over the county this occurs maybe minutes out of the day ms right and those bus drivers know there were buses on there before anything was ever done to it before there was a school there before there was ever poet square there ms anything else colter yes i got back to what i feel is probably more important to myself and to the community is that we address the health safety and welfare of all parties concerned yes traveled a lot of roads in the county where its tight harmony is a perfect example winding and narrow in certain spots but to continue to compound that to me is not acceptable i sit out there and watch the traffic and drove it several times yes its been widened to accept additional traffic load but its just not adequate to me and i agree with the county engineer on that condition i can also appreciate where a developer is coming from wanting to provide for new residents and whatever and the county is growing its ironic that we have been talking about this for years after years i come from an environment where impact fees addressed this problem as developers get properties develop them expand them whatever else that addressed the infrastructure impact so again i go back to the health safety and welfare issue a fee is going to fund it way faster than impact fees are going to be and thats still not working in this situation i think there was money in the it just got put somewhere else if we really want to talk about where money goes if thats going to become a conversation its not just this one issue my point is that we have had several issues where the orchard was and got rezoned before it was the orchard it was a requirement to do something where that curve is donate land so it could be straightened out to my knowledge it been done there have been lots of places where we have made it a requirement of somebody to do something or turned it down and then the government side come through for it its just frustrating i think its got to be double for us waiting for the commissioners who end up with a thats not funding ms are there any other questions directly for the petitioner is there any way to encourage more discussion on expediting the improvement of peck road would days of discussions help at least know where we stand with funding such improvements ms i think thats why asked kind of where things are will that help move it up on the time line any faster if you read john report it does say take about five years which i think take that long but thats what he said he is our engineer but i know and the funds went to baseline road and for the school corporation the county paid for that they of but they did and a forced sewer project i know about the sewer project you vote for a forced sewer project on the north side just south of the interstate well that would probably through the water department or something i believe it was through the county engineers office but it will get turned over to the water department it could be as far as that being planned but that is not me it was just an opportunity for more discussion if we continue till next month to give a chance to discuss it and find out where things are better i know if thats a possibility or not no but what i can do i can bring it up to the commissioners i know there is one commissioner against it already because of the ditches thats gonna cost money if were gonna pipe them they are worried gonna go off the side of the road into the ditch so the only thing i can do is bring it up at our next commissioner meeting which is and maybe get john to get a better estimate on how much money we got in the and how money it would cost to do that and we might be able to get a better time line than five years thats about the best i can do ms are you amenable to that sure one of the other questions i have is regardless of whether this goes through or not we still have an issue of school buses and it seems to me like the school board should be addressed on why are the buses running down this road to begin with seems to me there ought to be three buses a day each way grade middle and high school to pick up whatever kids are on there and if this road is that bad the buses ought to be going through north high school the way it was designed one of the problems i have is we are focused on this whole issue of these buses going down this road that maybe be on there to begin with extend the conversation for days one of my questions would be is there any way the school board could be convinced to keep the buses off this road and use a wider road into the entrance of the developer gets told all the time to try to make a turn around within your subdivision a loop so they can get off the busy street pick up or drop off the kids and not be on a busy street here got a couple subdivisions that did exactly that if the issue is the ditches and everything now if you drive that and start where i started that video go from a runway to that unimproved area of peck what is that doing to the speeds down through there like brought up before whether or not they come out of my access that is already existing and is a constructing entrance they are still driving up and down the road colter which direction would you project your residents would use when they exit onto peck north to baseline or south i ask that as the commissioners look at funding what would happen if the widening was continued going north incrementally until you can reach the entrance that he is proposing sure the majority of the people would probably take the better road but i cant predict which way traffic will go it seems like the majority of the people head south towards old state but thats not when school is in session when school is in session they go towards baseline because thats the only way they can access the north high and middle schools i guess a little confused here we have a bunch of adults who own this land and the amount is going to increase if people sell this area we got a bunch of hot rod kids coming out of this thing i see the problem i think this is the most direct way to get on a road that is acceptable by everyone as a place to drive i personally am in favor of this thing thats just my opinion ms thank you what is the pleasure of this commission the reason why i brought up the days i know if there was a penalty if we voted it down is he not allowed to apply again or can he apply right away its not the same as zoning ms thats a good question with that in mind i think to echo and that goes back to something that said when he was here when we first started this process if you want to build a the residential has to be there if the residential is not there then the get built down the street because they are going to check and see wherever they can draw the vehicles that come through their store if they get that number they build the residential draws the commercial without the commercial you get the strip center the local this and that its just the way it works so you get one without the other its all interconnected in that sense ms we are known as a city where it is hard to do business and people really feel encouraged to come here and do business because of the obstacles and here we are with a business that is trying to succeed and we are standing in its way ms would you like to make a motion for approval ms alright i move approval ms we have a motion and second call the roll during roll call i think its not going to be less safe i think the traffic can come from the same subdivision drive up and down peck road i agree with and i vote yes ayes ms ms nays colter abstention there being affirmative votes negative vote and abstention the request is ms i would like to thank again for a great job the undersigned secretary certifies
