to these guidelines when there is a group of individuals remonstrating against a petition we strongly encourage the group to designate a spokesperson if it is necessary for more than one to speak the group should meet out in the hall before the area plan commission discussion of the agenda item to coordinate the information presented so that each speaker addresses a different issue of concern in order to expedite the meeting should refrain from repeating the same concerns already expressed by another speaker about a particular development proposal the plan commission appreciates the cooperation of all participants with these guidelines if the commissioners have questions about issues that we feel have not been sufficiently addressed by the applicant we have the option to request a continuance until the information needed to sufficiently answer our concerns is available or provided by the applicant or technical staff the county rezoning considered today will be heard by the county commission on now lets move on to the rezoning oliver on all matters before the board do you swear or affirm that the testimony you will give is true and accurate so help you god oliver has been sworn county rezoning docket no petitioner common address complete legal on file road nature of case petitioner requests change from an agricultural zone to a zone with a use and development commitment oliver is requesting to rezone her property located at road from agricultural to with a use and development commitment the commitment limits use to the existing residence and kennels plus adds dog grooming as an additional use which requires zoning the commitment also states that ms will rezone the property back to agricultural upon the transfer of ownership rezoning the residence and kennels to makes those uses legal nonconforming and subject to the restrictions regarding legal nonconforming uses a copy of the use and development commitment was included as part of the staff report ms has a acre site on the west side of road north of upper mount road a rural residential street that approximately feet north of this site the only access currently available to her site is a residential driveway that into road no parking or access is detailed on the submitted conceptual site plan compliance with commercial access and parking will be addressed by site review committee prior to issuance of required permits for the proposed new use a pet grooming business requires one parking space for each sq ft of the business the residence requires a minimum spaces the existing kennel business requires one parking space for each employee plus adequate spaces for visitors and customers compliance with parking will be addressed by staff after submission of plans for the establishment of the new use on the site parking and access in commercial districts must be paved with a hard and sealed surface road is located in an area identified on the future land use map in the comprehensive plan as an area of residential development surrounding is a rural residential neighborhood this is a request to rezone a acre site from its agricultural designation to a classification which would be limited to the existing agricultural uses and a dog grooming business the comprehensive plan discourages spot zoning all those who will speak on this petition please raise your right hand do you swear or affirm that the testimony you will give is true and accurate so help you god ms has been sworn in ms i really understand the parking ms whether you are going to be required to add more parking is that your question ms yes oliver at a minimum depending on the size of the pet grooming you would need one space for every square feet i know how large that is so we will determine that once you have submitted specific plans we will determine the parking based on how large that is you will have to tell us how many employees the dog kennel has that will factor into the parking so it would be a minimum of four spaces you would have to have two for your residence and one for the dog grooming and at least one for the dog kennel ms well what i was told i am only going to zone the building as commercial not everything just the building i have any employees just me people bring their dogs a stop and drop basically so it is not a lot of traffic oliver people wait for the grooming ms no they drop them off i tell them how long it will take and in two hours they are back and pick them up oliver your area is zoned agricultural so if there is parking that is required that area would need to be rezoned as well or you would have to get a special use for a parking lot just passing that along is telling me that the legal description for the zoning describes the entire property so it is not just the area where your business is going to be that you are asking to rezone you are asking to rezone the whole piece ms i want to rezone my house my house is on the property oliver that is whats been submitted before this body you can either ask to amend that and we could continue this discussion or if you want to go ahead and rezone the entire piece thats up to you ms it really matter ms what about the parking that she already has does she already have driveway parking oliver she has a drive is there parking within that garage inside of it ms yes oliver is that a ms yes oliver so those two spaces would count and then it looks like you have two or three outside the garage there ms that little off building there is just a little storage place oliver again it would depend on how large the pet grooming business is to determine if what you have there is enough it is possible that it is enough but what you have asked to rezone includes that area that is not an issue right now but if you wanted to just zone the actual business itself ms i have a problem with any of it if it is everything thats fine my neighbors are great they have been very supportive my neighbor her son has an excavating business behind their home everybody is very supportive and i have no problems with it oliver thats good not seeing anyone here to remonstrate i guess what i explained in my comments is if you rezone the entire property your residence and the dog kennel portion would become legal nonconforming uses those are uses that would not conform to the new zoning but they are still allowed legal nonconforming is a little bit scary because it sounds like when you say nonconforming like you have to take them out but the more important part is that it is legal is this something that could be done between this meeting and the county commission meeting i think the neighbors might be more comfortable if the house was not included i think ms might find that there be some issues insurance wise and other things if her house is zoned commercial versus residential we have come across that in houses that are built in industrial zones there are issues that come up so my main question is is this something that she could take her house out and just do a strip that would include the existing garages the parking and the dog grooming building proposed in the back ms kind of like we do a sign for the school corp i would think that it would become more specific so that would be allowed by the law or the policy that we passed last year then number two is can we keep in mind as the site review looks at this situation that the parking issue addressed in a way that just the area that is used for the dog grooming be considered in the square footage towards the parking requirements meaning if a large parcel were rezoned for a great big building it be all the land it would just be what the building would be for oliver the parking requirement for the dog grooming is based on the square footage the parking requirement for the dog kennel is employees and adequate for customers so the square footage of the dog kennel would not be counted towards parking ms the question is now its up to you ms whether you want to i know if you were following what was talking about but if you just rezoned you would have to come back to another meeting we just do it between now the county commission meeting its not a matter of the use she would be changing her application ms where this would come in for you if you did rezone your house it could have ramifications on your insurance because it has gone from residential to commercial also when you are ready to sell your house i know this all converts back but if it is zoned commercial the next people not be able to get a residential loan on it it might become more complicated so it might be worth it to you to come back to us next month ms i plan on it oliver what we see often is peoples property in the past the city in large chunks zoned to manufacturing when they thought they were preparing an area for industrial development and that never came to pass then homes have been built over those types of sites so we see people their homes from manufacturing back to residential so they have this legal nonconforming issue so if you would go ahead and take the house out of it you be facing that issue later ms not going to conduct any business in my home anyway ms i would entertain a motion to continue this petition without fees motion was made and seconded is that what we are doing i think what was mentioning was starting over this a continuance she is just going to start over oliver it would be under the same docket number ms so we just call it a continuance i think your motion would be to allow her to come back waive the fee to amend ms is saying you need to have a new legal description drawn by a surveyor or somebody who can actually give you the meets and bounds to the actual description of just that building that you are going to use so you will come back to another meeting go back to area plan to amend this petition with a new description of that property and we wont make you pay all the fees again it might have been nice to know this before you got here but thats okay since this is a public meeting does she have to the motion is to waive the fees for her to reapply and come back through its going to be a new petition ms call the roll ayes ms there being affirmative votes docket no is continued one month code amendments amendment of chapter standards for principal structures and uses on individual lots amendment of chapter setback requirements oliver our next item concerns the proposed amendment to the zoning ordinance it has to do with the averaging of setbacks in pigeon township for front yards we have here from who we listened to last month to explain why we needed such an ordinance we discussed this last month in finalizing it there were a few more wording changes as it went through the various steps but basically what we are doing is trying to make it easier to use the averaging to allow for setbacks to be more consistent with the historic setbacks in the older area of town the reason why we are sticking with the averaging and not going with a or foot you have certain areas in pigeon township that are built with foot or even larger setbacks in some instances so there are some kind of traditional suburban pockets within pigeon township so we are trying to amend the averaging so that it is easier to use in the older area of town it would be easier if we could just skip over the averaging but if we do that then you could potentially be creating a situation where somebody could build a new house in one of those areas where the setbacks are or feet and they are building feet from the line and that is not going to be consistent with the existing homes in those areas either so if we stick with averaging we have that problem you also have the ordinance a version that shows exactly what the changes were then you have four exhibits that show the different scenarios where you have more than of the homes that have homes on them ms we have the red lines we have the example of the setback oliver those four diagrams are showing the different situations where you have over of the lots built on you average on both sides of the street within the block also there is a provision there that if you have dwellings constructed after a lot of those dwellings are going to be meeting the foot setback that we have had for pigeon township up to just a couple years ago when we amended the code to institute the averaging so in those situations where you have dwellings built after you can take those out of the averaging and just average the older homes that helps to some degree to stick with the historic setbacks then you have the situation where you have less than of the home sites built on in that situation you can jump to an adjacent block and average what is in your block that you want to build in and also an adjacent block along the same street again the idea being if the homes that were still there were set farther back but the homes in the next block are all at about feet you could take advantage of that if in our redevelopment efforts the example shown if the city were to go in and tear down a complete side of the street on one block you average anything you can automatically go to feet or feet depending on how much how much green space you have existing in the in front of your house the fourth example shows what we are asking for is feet of green space we are letting people count five feet of green space within the if they have that so it is kind of a unique concept thinking outside the box because usually our measurements are from the line as you probably know so if they have some green space in the which there almost always is some green space outside the curb line or outside the edge of the sidewalk you can count that i took a nine block random sample area of pigeon township and i was looking at the and out of those nine blocks there was only one area that looked like it was right about five feet everywhere else the green space was wider than five feet within the so this going to come into play very often in some instances the road might not be exactly in the center of the for whatever reason there might be only a few feet of green space but in the worst case scenario you are still about a few feet instead of a setback of you might have a setback of something to that effect so its not a drastic change that is in the code now the green space in the from the sidewalk so that is not something that is being amended here all that is being amended is really to be able to use the averaging better or more easier and also to allow for homes that were built after to be thrown out of the average so it is kind of complicated but i hope with the drawings and my explanation i hope you understand it ms i understand it and i have no problem voting on it but for those of you who have it in front of you does anybody have a problem with not seeing the red line the red line comes from what are currently footnotes to the table what we did was move the old footnotes and that were footnotes to the table up into the body of the ordinance ms so that part change it just moved does this still only apply to a certain geographical area it is only pigeon township in the city my understanding is this relaxes the setback and probably makes it more likely for somebody to build there it makes it more able to them to build with setbacks that are appropriate and consistent with the closer setbacks they have in the historical district rather than having to shove them back like some of the more modern homes had to oliver it was suggestion the averaging paragraph that was a footnote to table a that lists the development standards in the zoning code that footnote was a whole paragraph long that really was too important to have it hidden in a footnote at the bottom of a list of seven footnotes so that was a good suggestion to put in the body of the ordinance so thats what we did we took three footnotes that were sentences and put those into the body of the ordinance pretty much with no substantive change ms so do you need a motion to make this amendment oliver yes we need a motion to approve and a vote ms back to the question are you all comfortable voting on it does anybody have any hesitation this would then go to the city council for their approval ms okay we have a motion and a second please call the roll ayes ms there being affirmative votes the proposed amendment goes forward with a recommendation for approval oliver some of the members indicated that their security passes working i think there was an email that should have gone out from the sheriff to all the members that has a form to fill out if you will get that to either us or the sheriffs dept we can follow that through for you if you get that email then let us know and we will get you a form can you go ahead and email that form to us oliver i have the form inaudible oliver if thats the case then i can email it to you another thing i wanted you to be aware of and get some input from you we have a gentleman who has acres on the west side that wants to put in a winery right now under our current code we have winery specifically listed in our use groups but what it is most similar to in the list of uses are breweries and distilleries those are listed under zoning he has a site out by university parkway that if he goes through the normal channels he would have to rezone to he want to have to do that and we agree with him that is excessive what he wants to put in initially is a small winery he has five acres of vineyard on the site already that are well established grapes and he thinks he has enough there to make a certain amount of wine bottle that and sell it throughout the year he is talking about having limited hours of operation and he is only going to use grapes grown on the site he is not going to sell off site he will only sell from a structure he is going to build to process the grapes and it will have a small wine tasting area so my suggestion is we are looking at the agricultural portion of our zoning code to make some overall changes to that portion of the code to address the mouse house issue to possibly address confine feeding operations it would probably involve adding new zoning districts in agricultural like an agribusiness or we could maybe put the mouse house into an maybe a winery like the oliver winery up in would be an agribusiness a small winery like this one maybe we could do with a special use ms what does an orchard come under oliver that is just the vineyard is fine but once he starts processing the grapes there ms but like they have to have it zoned commercial for their store oliver they do because they are selling products that grown there so my suggestion is this if we wait and include this little special use if thats what we decide to do that would be a quick and dirty thing that we could do just throw small wineries limit it throw it in as a special use and this guy is on his way he has a very tight schedule he wants to use his grapes from this next harvest in he wants to start on a building in i see us getting through the whole agricultural section and the changes that we might want to make concerning the mouse house and adding districts and all that i see us getting through that in time to meet his schedule so my recommendation to you and i talked to and she agreed and agreed that we should go for a quick and dirty zoning change i use the word dirty oliver sorry that was just a figure of speech strike that from the record a quick and clean inaudible portions they also do apple cider over there but there is not much difference in a winery producing wine and producing apple cider they are zoned oliver they are zoned and the code right now distinguishes between nonalcoholic beverages nonalcoholic takes an alcoholic beverages takes an to manufacture so there is a big difference between the two i think the question is why an if they are pressing apples to make apple cider we know the details of all of that but obviously the problem that we have here is that there businesses as your society progresses entrepreneurs come up with different way to make money and different ways to offer one of the ways that has come up and certainly other counties have dealt with this and the staff is busy looking at the ways that other counties address this but we have different kinds of businesses that necessarily fit within the definitions of what is currently provided under either the use group descriptions or the special use descriptions so we are not doing all of this just for one guy to make a winery nor would we do any of the other changes just for one guy to raise mice but it brings to light the fact that there are categories of businesses that fall through the cracks you as a commission and the legislative bodies have both the opportunity and the obligation to kind of look at these and say well where and how do we want to accommodate these kinds of businesses where do we want this to fit in our plan into our zoning arrangement so there are probably a dozen more examples we could come up with and that come before the commission in the coming years but we are trying to hit these as we find them ms as was describing that i thought can we look at other areas maybe that are a bigger city than ours and try to plug them into our zoning code oliver we have a chart here of about different counties in since we are all dealing with statute and enabling legislation for our zoning we have a chart that shows vineyards how they are defined wineries what districts they are in ms right but what else have you looked at other things besides wineries and the mouse house oliver yes confined feeding operations for example our ordinance right now says the raising of any kind of animal is okay in an agricultural district it is a permitted use but what if you are raising some kind of exotic tiger or something is that really an agricultural use or is that an agricultural animal so those are the things in the ordinances that we have seen throughout the state that are making distinctions of what is agricultural and what is not what could fall in some of these other agricultural districts that are really type operations or really a winery kind of has some processing involved so it is somewhat industrial you are selling the product from the site so that is commercial you are growing the vines so that is an use so as said a special use is something that fit well into one of your land use categories i think rather than shoehorning and inviting litigation why not just take the opportunity to create some places that they could truly fit inaudible portions and some of these guys are going legit inaudible i think we should open the door for an opportunity oliver i think state law allows people to make a certain amount within their basement if you are making wine or brewing something else without getting approvals you see that some but when you get above that amount and i forget what the amount is you are going into a different realm as far as regulations by the state and even by the feds you have to have certain licenses to produce alcohol over certain amounts wondering if it would be more expedient for this guy if he wants to make use of this years grape crop to be in that category and then he could at least get started ms i think it would be very difficult to get an passed i think he would have a lot of oliver he is in a very rural area with no zoning anywhere near him so it would be a spot zone he is in an area that has some homes that are up in value so they might be very concerned about an zoning so what would be the time frame to get this all revamped and do what you want to do oliver i think we could do an ordinance amendment and get that done within three months then he would have to go through the special use process so that would be another month and a half so we are looking four and a half months out before he could get permits to start construction thats if you did the special use way so if we go the other route we might be talking six months or longer ms could he do an with a use and development commitment oliver he could and we suggested that to him but he said he want to have anything to do with the he want to go that route the other problem is it just creates a lot of spots thats the main thing i think even if you have the use and development commitment we still see people who understand it trust it think there is some loop hole that is going to get opened up i think he is worried about that and i also think that this is something that ought to happen because if you look at the use groups the special uses and the nature of what he is doing it really be an oliver hes got family that also lives around his acres so he is concerned about the neighbors ms going back to what said i believe we need to be as progressive as we can and where i was going with my comment earlier was to look at not just but to look at and and and north what kind of things has come up that their zoning has had to change and deal with we have just recently just seen two breweries in the last year but to address and to get to your need what do you were you just making us aware of this oliver making you aware of it number one but also asking for your permission to proceed with an ordinance amendment for a special use so we can try to be as business friendly as we can with this gentleman and try to meet as best we can his schedule to use his grapes otherwise he is talking about getting a huge freezer and freezing the grapes and he want to have to do that ms the only caveat i see in this is then somebody else has some special real important need and some compelling reason why we should give them a special use leaning towards being fine with doing this but i just wanted to bring that up oliver as mentioned we are addressing issues as they come along just like we just did for on the pigeon township front yard we are tweaking that just like we would be for not just this guy but anybody that wants to do a winery in the future ms because this is a public meeting just so everybody understands because it fit now because we have a place for it so somebody else coming in here going to be able to give us a story of need if it fits this is an unusual circumstance but it comes up from time to time we are looking at this more as a matter of wineries becoming an expanding industry as you can see all along the i corridor there are probably half a dozen wineries between here and it is a great economic a tourism builder and provides jobs we are not looking at this just for this one guy i think we are mindful we want to be helpful and the staff always wants to be helpful to particular businesses that need assistance and ideas but this is a larger issue the reason why is bringing it up is that we want to go through the process of doing something here if the plan commission have the appetite for it ms i think if somebody comes into the area plan office and our zoning code fit what they have we need to accommodate them i think that is what we are trying to do here as part of that we need to find a way to accommodate more of those people which is also what we are doing here inaudible oliver certainly there are other uses that fit our current code so we can look at the possibility of doing other uses with a special use the thing about the special use remember the underlying zoning change so if you are in an area already that zoning stays the same with the special use you just go to the board of zoning appeals to get approval ms i think it makes the most sense to do a special use in the interest of being good stewards if we could make this decision in the next four minutes we wont get into another half an hour i think we can so i just want to make sure everybody is okay with what we are doing here i guess a question for all three of you in front does need a motion from us to proceed with this all inclusive modification i now that a motion is necessary the staff can certainly as long as it gets on the agenda then you have something to vote on but the idea here is that i think that what you were looking for is basically a blessing to pursue this ms lets just say all those in favor of blessing this signify by saying i get a chance to jump in here so i will we have had some tricky situations but i really think that we need to be really careful when you start talking about what uses are allowed on for seeing ideas and maybe they will help but i really think that what we have here probably can work we just have to be a little more creative with it we are concerned that we want to spot zone with with a use and development agreement because it will be the only one in that area but if you have a winery on type zoning it is going to be the only one in the area also so by definition that is spot zoning all for this business but i think that changing these tools is not going to necessarily be the magic wand for it just be careful when you start messing with the zoning ms i agree with that bill but the other thing i would say there is a bigger window open with in terms of things that can happen in a residential neighborhood not with a use and development agreement because we understand that and some other people it change the fact that it is going to be a one type zoning and you are just going to deliver another one type zoning in that same area you really solved anything except for how people feel about it so i know if that is a good use of legislation oliver the special use change the underlying zoning bill so it would still stay thats why open to seeing ideas and i would hope the special use would be limited to the smaller uses versus the as was referring to thats when we need to get into the zoning for sure but i think if we limit the building size or the gallons per year or something so that it is a fairly small operation so it is not going to explode into a square foot building with semis coming in to pick up the product ms because you could argue the mouse house on the same premise you could argue the farmer making eggs ms any other business oliver no the undersigned secretary
