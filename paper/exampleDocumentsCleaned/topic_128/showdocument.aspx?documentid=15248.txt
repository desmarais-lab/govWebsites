this sign ms long that is already approved and is on oliver thats a permitted monument sign that sign will be replacing the fascia sign on the building are there any questions of the board ms where does the proposed sign go ms long by the front entrance where people would enter the building on it is just a small entrance sign showing them where to go to the door area entrance i have a concern i wanted to express but i wanted to leave it open to the board for any questions i understand this one has already been permitted when i looked at this this looks like it runs north to south if you are northbound on attempting to make a left or right turn to as it exists right now that is a very dangerous intersection made worse by the shrubbery that is there this picture looks like it is going to reduce the view of oncoming traffic from west to east even more ms long we have moved the location closer to the building and closer to ms long and it is staked we have called to verify where everything was so we could move it a little farther back closer to and closer to the building but basically it is for traffic going up and down i understand but you are aware of that it is a dangerous corner ms long thats one of the reasons we want a smaller monument and not a taller sign there also and i was going off this picture any other comments or questions are there any none is there a motion for approval motion was made and seconded call the roll ms during roll call yes and i will say that if you cut the bushes down it will be even more safe ayes ms docket no applicant common address complete legal on file newton avenue nature of case applicant requests relaxation of maximum front yard fence height from feet to feet for maintenance of a privacy fence oliver is requesting variance approval to allow maintenance of a foot privacy fence in her front yard setback on her property at newton avenue ms has erected a foot privacy fence along one side of her property extending into the required foot minimum front yard setback the zoning code states that maximum height of any fence in any required front yard setback not exceed feet on corner lots the maximum front yard fence height is feet this is a request to relax the front yard fence height to allow the foot fence to remain as constructed ms was contacted by staff after a complaint was filed regarding the fence this is a request for relaxation of the maximum front yard fence height from feet to feet for maintenance of a privacy fence erected along the property line separating this address and the property at newton avenue all those who will speak on this petition raise your right hand do you swear or ms my name is newton avenue we are not here to mediate any neighbor problems so we will try to keep the focus on the matter of the fence so as diplomatically as you can can you explain why you are before this board and what you need ms i have lived there for three years my son and i my neighbor has called the police on us numerous times nothing has ever happened when the police were called my neighbor literally comes out the door she has security on both sides of her house so she can see my driveway every time i come out my door she is out there too she has even seen me come in and stood between her window and the blinds in her bedroom to watch me go in i even have a notarized letter from my friend that this happened actually officer gray was aware that i was putting the fence up at the time i put the fence up i did call the area plan commission i guess i explain myself well enough because i knew my neighbor would complain to you so i thought i was in code but it was a misunderstanding when i did call so i put it up and my neighbor called and i was out of code so thats why i came for the variance but i have had no further issues with my neighbor since then because she cant see my driveway every time i come and go so the purpose of putting up the fence is to reduce her view of you coming and going ms yes she does come out every time she even has her area marked on the curb where she wants to park at right there by my fence there is a white line she want anyone to park on her property she has a monitor there that goes right into my driveway oliver can we see the photographs i will pass those around to the members am i correct that your house is the one south of the tall fence ms yes do you own the smaller fence on the other side ms no they own the smaller fence but i put that up with intentions of diverting neighbor issues it is feet from the curb her four foot fence when i back out of my drive i see over it anyway so it like it obstructs my view and i have plenty of room to back out are there any questions is there anything in particular about your property or the property next to you that makes this fence necessary for you to be able to use your property not talking about the people who live there ms i understand the question usually when we do variances it is because there is something unusual about the property itself no theres nothing unusual except for my neighbors are unusual so this have anything to do with the particular circumstances of your actual ground or the buildings ms no it just diverts issues i understand is your front yard open to the view of anyone driving by on newton ms right theres no fence in the front yard what are the signs on your neighbors side of the fence ms they are no trespassing signs she has about four on my side ms she put those on your fence ms no originally she had four on the back side of her fence then when i erected this i went ahead and put the sign up just like she has four on my side who put your fence up ms we put it up ourselves ms how long has this problem been happening ms for three years officer gray has mediated she even said to me that i turned into the victim ms did someone suggest to you to put the fence up ms no i did it myself so i could have some privacy ms how long has it been up ms since like or the end of ms how many times have the police been called in the last three years ms a bunch probably or so that the worst this lady kept going to officer grays office and there is a rash of burglaries on the east side officer gray said she came to her office every day of the week complaining about me and my son they even put the guardian in front of my house thats when officer gray told me the reason why she did it was because she deal with this woman coming to her office every day of the week so they put the guardian in front of my house ms the neighbor is not here correct ms yes ms i will want to understand the nature of the complaints that she is making to the police officers so you can tell me or i can ask her ms in the most recent thing it was a few days after when we had that big snow my grandsons ball or something went across the fence into her yard my son should have never allowed this to happen but another neighbor boy went across the fence to get the ball then they came out and words were said and the police were called they accused my son of spitting on her husband it was right in front of the video on the tape but nothing ever came of that it was on tape i feel like almost a disgrace in the neighborhood because she walks the block and talks to everybody and gossips i have time to do all that chairman could we do something to limit the discussion this is a property issue we need to keep the record clear for that ms sorry i think we get the point are there any ms my name is newton you are the property due north of her ms yes before you start this was on the tape but i want to explain what the requirements for a variance are and the chairman has asked that we keep comments to those that pertain to these there are six criteria the approval will not be injurious to the public health safety morals or welfare in other words the fence wont be injurious to the public health safety morals or welfare of the community the use and value of the area adjacent to the property will not be affected in a substantially adverse manner in other words you are talking about effect on property values and things like that the strict application of the terms of this title will result in practical difficulties in the use of the property the variance is not a variance of the use of the property which it is not it is not in a which it is not the need for the variance is not created by the applicant so i can tell that this is something that i will have to review the record on i am asking that the comments remain limited to those issues you understand that we want to get into conversation about who said what and this and that we just want to hear your good argument as to why this fence should not be permitted ms okay i do have something to submit can i do that it is the petition i have a petition from the neighborhood there is about names on here that it is not just me this fence is it stands out in the neighborhood its like an eyesore it blocks the view of the adults and the children i bought my house in i have been there ever since ms has lived there for three years i of course am requesting that this illegal fence be taken down along with the posts from the side that is right next to my four foot fence number one it is illegal it was put up on a weekend so the inspector could not come out and tell her to stop it changes the whole view up and down the street and it really blocks my view personally because i am right next door it causes a safety concern for the whole neighborhood got the petition here and pictures it causes a problem for the police fire department the ambulance they cannot see up and down the street on the west side of newton it is an issue for everyone on this side of the street when trying to back in and out of the drives you cannot see a car or truck until it is too late it is an issue for the children they run they play in the street they cannot see over this i cant see over this six foot fence it degrades my property it takes away from the value of my home and thats i want to say thats number one but it does degrade from my property it is an eyesore and if this was approved then other people follow the law i had to follow the law when i put up my fence i had to follow the law and i did i collected the signatures and the addresses and my husband and i want this fence taken down immediately i took them four hours to put it up you could take it down in two hours i do park my car out front got three vehicles i have to park one out front i do leave space for the mail lady the paper lady so therefore it is up from the mail box it has to be as a courtesy but got this to submit a couple other things the guardian was put out there during that time she put her fence up so these pictures have the guardian in it because thats when she put the fence up i was told by the prosecutors office and by the police after her son did what he did i was told to put no trespassing signs up on my fence i told the prosecutor they will steal them take them down and they did they put them on their fence so yes the calls i bet have been over calls in the three years over i cant even sleep in my bedroom it is so loud over there it is an ongoing nuisance that is why officer gray put the guardian there it is between not me and ms it is between her and the police follow the law and then you wont be in trouble just follow the law what do you mean by guardian ms the guardian is a tool the police use to put in front of a problem home its to say straighten up or we will bring it back thats why it was put there it just me it was anyone who called in and voiced their opinion it took a group effort to put this in front of their home calls are overwhelming and thats not even the time that we call they put the fence up it is feet from the corner of my house when i look out my bedroom window and i have a right to look out my bedroom window and i have a right to look out my front door but this fence used to you could see all the way down to the end of the block but now you can only see across the fence encased like in a cubicle these pictures will show that why you bring those up and unless you have something to add i think in the interest of time we need to turn this over for questioning from the board to you are there any questions oliver i would just like to clarify one thing it sounds like she is requesting that the fence be removed but the owner would be allowed to have a four foot fence just like you have so one option would be for her to use a saw and just cut the fence down to four foot in size to be in compliance ms if i have a four foot fence if she was to put a four foot fence the other argument is i cannot even maintain my fence i cannot go over there to even stain my fence i have spent probably all around my house for a nice fence then right here i cant go over there to maintain it i would like the fence taken down and the posts removed oliver i have one more clarification that would be there is a five foot setback but that applies to structures like a building there is no setback for a fence so as long as she is putting the fence along the property line or on her side of it thats legal to do even though i understand it give you room to maintain the other side of the fence ms i have been there since never had a problem with any neighbors never until the last three years are there any other ms griffin my name is griffin newton avenue so you are south of this property ms griffin yes i have lived in the neighborhood for eight years i have known for at least seven we have always got along never had no problems she keeps an eye out for me because i had a problem with her neighbors son in night so we have been trying to keep an eye on each other like a neighborhood watch but since they put that fence up i cant see down that way i feel like i used to walk around my neighborhood me and my kids we want to do that no more because we are scared once you go down newton avenue towards their way you cant see on the other side of that fence if we walk the other way we still cant see so i know you know if her or one of her sons are going to come out and say anything or start anything so to me its a safety issue for walkers and the kids are there questions thank you ms actually not sure who the other lady was but she lives totally on the other end of the block we have a double block but this is my friend byers other than the mark on the her marking her territory on the curb and everything i had my employees i own my own business reliable care adult day care and i had my employees over for a cookout this lady my neighbor was actually had a flashlight out there writing down license plate numbers now this normal these are my employees two nurses and some other coworkers this right to be truthful the only thing that has happened after i put my fence up was she down at the corner two times waiting for me to come home the one time she backed her car into her driveway there is an empty spot here against her house here is her driveway ms i think we are getting off track ms the other lady i have never even met ms byers byers i just got one thing to say since the fence has been up there been any trouble at all from anybody police been called shes got piece of mind and everything has been just fine i think the board has heard enough to see if there is a motion to approve the variance motion was made and seconded call the roll ayes nays ms there being affirmative vote and negative votes docket no is denied so they will take the fence down to the four foot level or remove it i would ask that you do the best you can to get along we resolved this in what we think is the best interest you have the right to come back in a year docket no applicant ray common address complete legal on file avenue nature of case applicant requests relaxation of side yard setback from feet to foot for a

all okay are there any none is there a motion for approval ayes ms docket no applicant glen common address complete legal on file first avenue nature of case applicant requests a special use for a parking lot oliver the two residences at and first avenue were rezoned to in to allow conversion of the houses to office light retail uses the property at is currently a dental office glen law office is located at first avenue the law office is requesting to redesign and expand the existing parking lot for the office into the zoned property to the south to provide additional parking chapter of the zoning code requires approval of a special use permit by the board of zoning appeals for auxiliary parking lots for nonresidential uses located within residential districts this site is on first avenue between and avenues there is a residential driveway and curb cut which served as access for the residence formerly occupying the site there is no alley or other access available at the rear of the lots law office has purchased the zoned lot adjacent south of the law office and is proposing to utilize the existing access as an exit and is changing the current commercial access to an entrance only site review approval of the new parking plan is required prior to issuance of required permits for the parking lot parking lots in or adjacent to residential districts require a minimum solid fence or other natural green barrier along the parking areas adjacent to residential south and west lots the law office is required one parking space for each sq ft of gross floor area of their office the existing office requires a minimum of parking spaces although the existing law office complies with the minimum parking requirement the existing paved parking lot is substandard for traffic flow law office states that they employ employees and employees the additional parking is requested to allow sufficient space for clients and visitors the addition of this new lot for parking affords the opportunity to have entrance and exit circling around behind the office building this is a request for approval to allow installation of a parking lot on the property at first avenue one of the major problems with zoning residences for conversion to commercial use is the substandard parking that results from the residential driveways and the lack of space for expansion of the drives on small formerly residential lots this request for approval will allow a redesign of parking for the law office which will make access to and from first avenue more compliant with parking and safety all those who will speak on this petition raise your right hand do you swear or cravens my name is garland cravens the attorney for the petitioner box my name is glen first avenue its clear to me what you want does the board have any questions cravens i would just say that everything you said oliver is all good we are improving that location out there i see any negatives whatsoever how does traffic that is northbound on first avenue get back to your place without making a its very difficult and its been a problem for years because there is a divider down the middle of that road i usually tell people to come in through the back come through or in that direction if not i tell them they have to go past my office and turn in and come back i know how you could correct that i if that is something that could be removed it is a problem any questions from the board ms it looks like the property immediately to the north of yours that a continuation of your property is it because it looks still like it has a parking lot configuration to the north is a dental office he actually uses if you look there mine is the darker parking lot the lighter one is his parking lot and he has permission to use the access and parking that used to be the years ago it has been closed for years so he uses that to get out to second as well as first i have any type of access through his parking lot asked him that before we have a fence between our parking lots so i cant access through his parking lot well this will help the parking flow for sure yes it will really help the traffic flow i deal with a lot of older clients and do a lot of elder law i deal with a lot of people in wheelchairs and situations like that it is very tight when people come in and go out so what we are proposing is that they will come in through the current entrance and park and they can go around the building and exit out through that driveway right here so it makes it a lot safer for the public and for my clients to access and exit after appointments any other questions from the board are there any my name is i live at oak hill road not really here to remonstrate to his parking lot i think its an alright deal but i will give you back history i own the lots at and second avenue a few years back i came in front of the zoning board and asked for it to be rezoned to to build duplexes on it there was a lot of bugaboo about right behind his parking lot he has planned theres a storm drain in the back of second avenue when we have a big heavy rain the floods up and gets pretty close to this womans back yard well when i was getting my zoning for they were worried that my water coming off my buildings and my parking lot would exacerbate that condition so they asked for me to push all the water that would ever come on my lot which all these lots on first avenue drain towards this and his law office drains onto my lot drains onto my lot i talked to the city engineer and he told me at the time that he would help me to make a retaining pond to slow that water to get down there so i have to hold their water if i build these buildings and all my gutter drains have to go to second avenue so it can circle around and go back to this drain when i talked to the city engineer he said he had some problems with this before he went out there and looked at it and said that the pipe very good or sufficient because this pipe drains towards second avenue goes past third avenue and if you know diamond avenue the big high rise apartments there is a lake back there this pipe goes in there it is usually under water so when you get big rains it just cant get out there fast enough and holds in there and there could be three or four feet of water this this mans doing or anything like that it was poor design probably when they built first avenue but all asking is if he would drain his water towards first avenue instead of to this hole that would help out the neighborhood and help out the situation a little bit i was asked to do this i have talked to the man before the meeting he talked to me and said he would talk to his blacktop person and see if that was an option he went on vacation he said thats no problem but i heard back from him but all i know is talked to the engineer and the engineer said he come to the meeting really because he comes to the next meeting that you have and he said his lots big enough to make a drainage plan so i even see where they proposed to push the water because right now where it sits that lot drains towards the back to that hole so does his office so does dental office the that extra drive that uses it drains towards my lots so basically if i build these buildings got to hold approximately five or six peoples runoffs and hold it there if he would help me out by just holding his lot it would probably help out the situation now i know the other people i think they are here i want to contact the other neighbors because i want to cause him any trouble i just ask you to think about it and ask him if he would drain it towards first avenue so in a nutshell you are asking him to retain his water and not spill it on your lots yes if he pushes it to first avenue i got no problem i think the man is an honorable guy i talked to him on the phone and he seemed like a good gentleman not trying to be a thorn in his side cravens i think thats better addressed at site review we want to be a good neighbor and will accommodate him as best we can i drove through there yesterday does your building sit up off of first avenue where the elevations are such that the water that would be on the far west end of the lot could drain i talked to at jerry enterprises who will probably do the pavement work i should have gotten back to him i was on vacation i got back and i get back to him but they said this would not be feasible where it is slanted toward first avenue because it tapers to the west he said it would be very difficult to do that behind my lot there is only about feet or so that the parking lot would come across the back it is actually slanted and sloped down there is actually a large drain in this corner right here so i think his concern is i am going to add water into that drain that will add to his potential water i guess thats the concern oliver i would just point out that before they can do construction on this they are going to have to do a site plan that will have to go before the site review committee and the city engineer sits on that committee so he will be looking at the drainage aspects of this if theres anything he thinks is required he can require it at that time but i think because is his parcel is so small it is under the radar for the drainage ordinance it require a drainage plan but it still goes to site review oliver it still goes before site review i talked to pat or about this site specifically but i think that they can look at the total amount of pavement with the lot next door i know whether it would trigger a drainage plan or not if one of them told you that it then maybe thats true but i know that for a fact they will have to determine that when they look at it at site review but i do think you should be cognizant of your water running onto somebody property i know if it would be feasible to put a concrete curb along the west side that would run north and south to stop that or redirect it ms just an observation in our neighborhood the city spent a lot of money but not sure if it costs a lot of money but installed porous concrete in an alley and i know the city has done a whole lot of that to accommodate the trees and tree wells downtown so perhaps there is a different kind of concrete in the alley that they put this material on is driven on by lots of garbage trucks and so its definitely able to hold the weight of vehicles so i would just suggest that you look into something like that if you could mitigate the water problems i know the minute you put in anything that causes more water to run you are going to be in a situation like some of the folks we saw here tonight in my opinion at the end of the day this just comes down to a site review issue so i make a motion to approve as presented motion was made and seconded call the roll ayes ms again i would encourage you to work with your contractor to take some elevations shots out there before they do the final paving when will that site review meeting be oliver it is not scheduled yet that will depend on when they file site plans but its not a public meeting it is not a meeting where you could come and remonstrate or voice concerns inaudible oliver what we could do we could have pat call you if you leave your contact information with us but as far as when it will be i know that will depend on when they file site plans docket no applicant john common address complete legal on file old highway nature of case applicant requests a special use for a one operator beauty shop in the residence

commercial use of the old highway site is terminated or additional parking is provided on that site no sales of merchandise are allowed in beauty shops which operate within a residence in a residential district sales of beauty supplies and equipment require commercial zoning all those who will speak on this petition raise your right hand do you swear or old highway so living in the house yes do you own the shop across from there yes we both do is there anything you wanted to say just looking to scale back now had a wonderful run over there at for the last eight years and its me by myself there i have run of that whole beautiful building but just looking to make some changes going forward so i thought it would be a good time to just scale back we have a really lovely room downstairs in the house at that would be just perfect for my need again just one operator that gives me the ability to maybe do something else with the building at thats the existing salon but we will revisit with you on a later date thats not going anywhere right now but i wanted to ask a question to be sure about something as far as selling shampoo and things like that that would not be allowed in the residence as i understand it okay i know that thats something that has given me a good income i think thats one of the stipulations i have not talked to other people who actually have it in their homes thats been a mainstay for me but if thats the law i want to do this legally i want to break any codes or laws always been legal with everything done okay are we allowed to waive that one part for the hair products that would be awesome oliver that would be a variance of the use i was just going to say keep it in a cabinet in that room its not like i want to turn my downstairs into a shop very familiar with that area it is very mixed there is lots of commercial in that area in the past we have had some people come to us to put a salon in their house and we have upheld that stipulation that you cant sell products in fact we had one last month similar deal to what you are asking ms she could rezone the house rezone the house to commercial i want to do that thats not even an option id have to give up the products first but the other building is staying a so you could walk across the parking lot i want to be the one to say it but that is an option leave the product there and if they want to buy something say lets take a walk so what is currently zoned as residential i think for the time being that might be the best i understand if other people cant get it i want to be singled out but thats great that you brought it up i am on an industry boulevard i can walk across the street and do that i can keep it that way i guess you could display what you have in the shop and then just sell it across the street thats not a big deal again scaling down so theres a purpose in that i want to keep going for maybe another year or two it would just be so much simpler to have that small business its still a pretty good sized business but going down to about three days a week instead of five because i have other dreams that i want to pursue so i can work with that are there any none is there a motion for approval ayes ms thank you when can i make changes i done anything yet when can i move my bowl over is that now anytime yes as soon as you get home oliver interim
