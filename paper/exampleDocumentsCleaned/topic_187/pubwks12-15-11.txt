expanded the list to show the council districts in which they anticipate doing work he stated that there are several items where the council district is to be determined they want to provide the

public that they are appropriating the last of the citizen energy funds that were paid to the city for the water and sewer utilities hunter stated that looking at the exhibits a lot of these have been in the works for quite some time and his concern is managing the need but not micromanaging the process he stated that he hopes this passes so that the board of public works can do the job that were hired to manage asked from the standpoint of appropriating this money why it was not included in the budget program manager stated that the ordinances that created the funds where the money landed from the transfer of the assets was approved by the council the night the budget was introduced he stated that it was not appropriate to include funds that had been approved into a budget asked if these projects were developed before the money was approved or were they determined after the sale he stated that this was not included in the budget because it would have been inappropriate because the transfer had not been approved and in reference to that he is curious about the timing and determination of these projects chair stated that she has been on the council for years with a billion dollar backlog that has been categorized by the engineers stated that there is an ongoing list of projects and the overall need to bring the system up to fair conditions is billion so they are pulling from that universe of needs councilor stated that they are talking about substantial amount of money and that to his knowledge there has not been a comprehensive survey done of the quality of the pavement throughout the city parks stated that the county is required by federal mandate to do a study every two years of the bridges as far as the streets there was a comprehensive study on the thoroughfares last year he stated that they have not started the development on several of these projects they are listed as buckets of money and how they would like to package them however they leave that for the needs that are brought in on an annual basis hunter stated that this is no different than what they have always done he stated that he feels part of the communication problem is that he and councilor get the large packets and that has helped them be effective in knowing what the process is he stated that the studies have been presented to this committee in slides he stated that he does not want to take away the flexibility from the board to change within the buckets by attaching things to projects parks stated that any contract entered into will be a request for proposal and publicly bid on this just sets the money aside to allow the board of public works to use it clarified that there would be a long planning process done before any work is started he stated that he is happy to see that it will be appropriated to move forward stated that he is advocating to depoliticize this completely and to not leave it to active and effective councilors but to instead have the professionals evaluate the need across the entire county he stated that there has not been a study of neighborhood streets and sidewalks on a comprehensive basis and that he does not see any information before him that assures him that that will happen asked why there was a comprehensive study done on the thoroughfares but not do one on the neighborhoods chair stated that it is because there was not funding parks stated that they have received federal funds to do a sign inventory and they are using high end technology to maximize and also inventory the residential streets he stated that every time they create a project someone from the or an engineer has gone out and inspected and analyzed the condition to what needs addressed stated that her understanding is that the complaints that go through the mayors action center are investigated scored and prioritized and then once funds become available they are addressed parks stated that is correct and they have gotten behind because the needs have outlasted the funding stated that it is important to think about the really critical infrastructures pieces which are the thoroughfares and bridges the things that impact a lot of citizens he stated that he does not think it is cost effective to go out and say this street is worse that this street stated that he knows that they are needs all over the county councilor stated that he knows they are prepared to spend money to make sure that they do the right thoroughfares first but we are unprepared to do the same kind of comprehensive studies with residential streets he stated that the waste water utilities do no ask him which water mains should be replaced that is done by engineers the pavement should be done by engineers they should that and allow those decisions

escalate to he stated that per the current ordinance they recommend to affix the fuel surcharge at this time ms stated that the second agenda item the fuel board considered was the matter of some proposed modifications to the existing ordinance she stated that the existing ordinance is fairly short and brief in the detail that is provides and does not address issues that you would typically see on ordinances on the books today that tell you how boards and committees should operate in order to better clarify the operational structure of the board some of the proposed modifications the boards intends to bring to the council are outline procedures for use of and identify what a quorum is most city boards have that but this ordinance is silent on that matter the proposal would add the chief of the fire department as a board member she stated that there was no language that determined the index how you determine the fuel price is an issue that affects the emergency services
