to take a minute and update the board on an outage we experienced yesterday i have a correction to the report we indicated that we had completed the regional operations center phase over the last month this was incorrect phase which included moving portions of and homeland security to the facility role in this was simply from a standard move perspective phase is currently on hold pending additional build outs of the facility we are not sure if the budget for this phase has been approved or not at this point in time one project turned yellow this month and that would be the disaster recovery disaster recovery upgrade phase the project has been delayed for a number of reasons primarily as we work towards updating the data center and our focus on a new backup strategy we have postponed making any major decisions on our long term disaster recovery changes we are however continuing to leverage existing relationships with the state and looking at ways that we be able to utilize their facility in since the data center project and are so closely tied we will be combining these projects next month we have added two new projects to the report this month windows office

ongoing projects include that i want to mention this month and they include implementation we continue to face some challenges as expected on a project of this magnitude complexity but as maintained all along we are getting successes outweigh the struggles but we will continue to work through the struggles its important to remember we set an aggressive schedule to try to maintain lower implementation costs that certainly presents risks if we look nationally projects of similar size scope its easy to see that we have done a great job comparatively are things perfect no are they where they need to be not yet while we believe things are overall going well it mean that there some bad major frustrations within the user community so heres the current status of things payroll time and labor continues to be an issue the auditors office payroll staff continues to feel like things are not getting better with time as one would expect we had major bumps team accepts full responsibility with getting the election workers setup for correct payment ahead of the election we got them paid timely but it was a fire drill that could have been avoided caused a lot of stress frustration we are ensuring we have a much smoother process for as rolls out it adds a new different element each time to payroll so this also is part of the reason that we seem to be improving the entire payroll process currently the team believes once we have all rolled out time frame and then things should begin to stabilize level out thus improve from there payable still working through some challenges as they modify business processes configure the system accordingly with the changes to try make things more timely some of our customers have had vendors not paid in a timely fashion but we are working as hard as we can to iron out any pension has faced some recent bumps but looks to be in good shape soon has also struggled with time and some duplication of effort between their existing wise system
