regarding how much income a property can produce what would the return on investment be how long would it take to recover the initial investment what should the value be what would competition be explained the reason county has a need for this service is that as of yet the county and assessors have not developed a data base that contains that type of current information there is a need to have a base of what is going on in the market the capabilities do not currently exist internally and is a very important piece to do assessments well expressed concern that over time should the vendor no longer provide current information a new source would need to be considered additionally the enterprise should be working internally in the county and township assessor offices to keep that kind of information and have the tools resources up and running within a year or two requested keep the board updated ms white asked if a year contract is necessary or should a one year contract with option

plays a critical role in delivering applications and services to the today the has an elaborate network infrastructure spanning approximately locations and serving about desktop and laptop computers this infrastructure is complex and is supported by nearly a thousand devices from large core routers to small edge switches in remote locations ensuring that the network is up and running at all times is critical however with this many devices it is inevitable that we will experience hardware failures in order to minimize the impact of these failures we maintain support of some of our network devices through there are four different levels of coverage and depending on the device cost impact due to failure and redundancy different levels of support are chosen the support levels are premium xx hr response for parts chosen for critical infrastructure devices which would cause an extensive outage while down there is a short list of devices that we maintain this coverage on typically devices that are too expensive to keep our own spares this would cover devices standard business day for parts selected for devices which need hardware and software support but are inexpensive enough for us to keep spares to reduce outages significantly less expensive than and we are still guaranteed a response this would cover devices business service offering which provides basic software and hardware coverage with no guaranteed response time devices that we need support for software but maintain spares would be covered under this would cover devices software application support software only coverage provided for the network registrar product which we use for dynamic host configuration protocol services no coverage many of the devices within the environment are no longer able to be supported through or we are choosing not to cover the devices instead relying on warranty for hardware replacements or replacing the devices when they fail typically inexpensive devices are not covered and instead we maintain a stock of spare hardware to swap out in case of a failure devices in the environment are not covered under maintenance there are two options for the maintenance contract pay on an annual basis or lock in pricing and sign a year contract there are several benefits to the year contract pricing is locked in for the year period thereby avoiding an annual increase in cost an overall discount on the total annualized payments for the year term allowing the to pay for the contract annually at a predetermined cost worth of training credits from for signing a year contract potential other vendor benefits potential consulting services at no additional cost selection process bids were solicited from certified vendors capable of providing the maintenance contract several of the bidders included other incentives which were factored into the decision the lowest benefit bid was received by costs through this vendor for a year contract are for a year contract are per year this represents an overall discount of approximately off list price the most recent support contract was approved by the board in of for a year period at a total cost of maintenance costs for support have been included in the budget for however this renewal will be an increase over past years the network infrastructure is essential to the delivery of applications that support the as they perform their work at the or citizens accessing information recommends signing a year contract with to provide support for selected hardware board resolution to approve the maintenance contract between and whereas the previous agreement between formerly and the information services agency for maintenance on the data equipment expired on whereas the performance of this equipment is integral to the business operations of the enterprise and the proposed contract would provide continued support throughout the contract term and whereas solicited bids for this service receiving five responses from providers who are partners and capable of providing the maintenance contract and entered into contract negotiations for this service and whereas determined that best addressed the cost reduction

project connectivity from the cameras to the network is required site surveys at the desired locations revealed that wireless connectivity via the network used for the siren project is not feasible for most locations in addition some previously deployed cameras connected via wireless have experienced video quality issues including and shadowing to provide a wired connection to the cameras an existing wireless connected camera was tested via the use of a cable modem the test was successful producing improved video quality and acceptable connectivity levels this test included the deployment of a cable modem at the camera and a peering connection between and the building over existing fiber the signal was encoded using a to ensure that the signal was secure cable modems offer several distinct advantages over other connectivity solutions traditional frame relay and other leased circuits typically require installation costs higher monthly fees and termination fees should the cameras be moved fiber though providing the best video typically has a significant installation cost and little or no flexibility to move the connection to another location cable modems have a low installation cost and no termination fees should not incur significant over construction costs to connect them in addition the cable infrastructure already spans most of county offering this service to most locations of the locations for neighborhood cameras will use cable modems from the other two are in areas and the possibility of using for connectivity is being explored in order to move forward with the deployment of cameras using cable modems there were two contracts with one for the peering connection and one for the cable modems themselves the peering contract has an initial construction and installation charge of with monthly costs of over a year term resulting in a total contract amount of the cable modems have an installation charge of each plus recurring monthly charges of for modems the installation costs are plus a total of in monthly charges assuming the cameras remain deployed using cable modems the entire years this brings the total contract value to this amount could change if additional cameras are deployed using cable modems or if cameras are removed or redeployed into areas funding for the construction and installation costs plus first year of service is provided by the neighborhood camera project funding cable modems provide wired connectivity for cameras deployed in most locations thereby improving video quality with the added flexibility
