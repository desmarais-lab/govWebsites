the last month and all remaining projects are currently on schedule and budget land bank property management this project was to develop a new application to track information about the current land bank owned parcels and buyers both prospective and actual this application was moved into user acceptance testing earlier this month and is planned to be deployed in production on additional updates disaster recovery site university i am very pleased to announce that we have successfully implemented our secondary at our site which is university as a reminder the secondary contains a replicated copy of all of our unstructured data such as home drives shared drives and a great deal of the static data we will be implementing the secondary data domain at our site this coming weekend the data domain contains the replicated copies of all of our structured data such as application database and email data i would like to thank rusty and from john bates john chuck and from and the teams from our vendors partners and network storage inc this implementation will allow us to begin planning for the next phases of our disaster recovery plans which include moving toward a more active data center for mission critical applications physical move the move of our system is well under way as a reminder it is currently being hosted by in ma we have purchased the necessary infrastructure to bring this enterprise system into our data center and it is currently being implemented it is our plan to begin testing in mid both internally and with our customers we will be scheduling the final production move along with the business owners in the coming weeks for a targeted move of late new standard for dell has been the standard for desktops and laptops for the for many years and we have leased them using the state dell lost the states hardware in and hp secured the new hardware we will be changing our standard from dell to hp starting in we will have a mixed environment for an approximate year period until all that are refreshed to an hp model our desktop and laptop standard with hp is resulting in a bigger and faster machine for less money the standard machines have more memory a faster processor as well as more local storage and the approximate savings per device is the existing dell that we are deploying in our environment today as still quality devices and they will be supported throughout the life of their leases hp is our existing standard for servers and will remain the standard the project continues to move along albeit slower than we would like we are currently deploying in the following agencies community corrections probation auditors office council clerks office and forensics we have a new devices that is imaged and setup with agency specific packages in almost agencies as each agency approves the device we begin deployment within that agency the main reason that this process is slower than we would like is twofold all cc users have been administers of their own devices for so many years this has allowed our users to install whatever software whether licensed or not as well as whether personal or professional on their device so instead of having a singular or just a few for an agency each device is proving to be individually unique many users have installed software at some point in time during the use of their device but no longer have the software or recall where they received it historically devices were assigned to an agency instead of to an identified user as we begin conducting the refresh in each agency it has been at times challenging to locate each device identified to be refreshed while we are making progress it is again slower than we would like we are working with during this process to change our standards in terms of inventory device management and device identification so as to simplify the refresh process moving forward this process has also further validated for us the need to increase device security and standard device software where this is the st month reporting on the and service level agreements for the new set of contracts that began on has additional and revised in this contract as

migration to the physical server equipment for the system will be moving from its current location in ma back to the floor data center in the building benefits of this migration will be alleviating system performance issues and a cost reduction associated with the system this project will identify the information requirements for the criminal justice system since many of the agencies are moving to new systems with the replacement of the new disparate systems will need to exchange information to maintain current level of service and will use the dexter integration engine to the data exchanges as part of this project requirements will be defined and a governance structure will be developed for the initiative going forward false alarm tracking reporting develop a new application to replace the legacy application developed in vb to track monitor and report on false alarm runs add the functionality necessary to allow to track their false alarm runs as well accurate tracking and reporting of these runs could result in significant revenue for the respective departments this project will be deployed in multiple iterations using the agile methodology component will be developed first
