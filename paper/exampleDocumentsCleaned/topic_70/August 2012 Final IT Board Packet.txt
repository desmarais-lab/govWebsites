budget for our newest board member has charged back only about of its budget for about the last years from a customer satisfaction perspective this is a nightmare and we have already started receiving complaints from our customers regarding the increase in charges we have offered to meet with any department to review their charges but the core issue is simply the million difference that is spread amongst the departments the good news out of all of this is that we are getting closer to charging back entire budget which should lessen this problem in the future both and met all their for quarter

rights reserved findings and corrective action overall no silver bullet but several key procedural changes that adopted followed and managed consistently will net sizable positive impact finding data conversion specifically the effort level required appears larger and more complex than estimated sizable historical data from multiple packaged homegrown and customized systems has proven challenging to convert scrub and accurately convert into the new system action properly scoping identification and vetting of data and customer is key the customer must be leveraged early and consistently throughout the module development cycle to go live finding system configuration customization interfaces it appears the original workbook the implementation was not fully vetted creating gaps and broadly written requirements action additional time must be taken during to properly vet the build the system plan and prepare the organization for the change business process change is also a key
