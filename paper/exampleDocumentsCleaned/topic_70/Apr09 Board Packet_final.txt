historically we have had a year agreement with and at this time a year agreement with the opportunity to renew for another year term is being requested board discussed year year contract moved to amend the contract to years with the option of renewal for another years ms white seconded that motion asked what the downsides were of moving to a year contract he stated that he thought the only downside would be the cost and time involved in the process going forward if the end result was again the same asked if based on market fluctuations if the contract itself anticipated fluctuations in the market or if with the contract we were locked into a set price agreement ms responded by stating that in the past if a price point has gone down with a piece of phone equipment that we need to order will adjust that price point to give us the lower cost asked if the contract language specifically stated that would lower cost if the market cost lowered or if they have the option as stated in the contract to stick with the price that they quoted us at in the contract ms responded by stating that in her last conversation with the president of they preferred the year agreement as it locked in their prices however currently they are still writing that contract language ms reiterated that the year agreement was an preference as is such a valued vendor judge young requested that in the future the board be presented with more information as to the background of the contracts that are due for renewal judge young asked what the cap was before this renewal judge young asked if we reached the cap were we not even close to the cap have we ever been able to not order something because we were over our limit ms responded by stating that in the past two years we never reached the

consideration what would be occurring in the future with the devices ms advised that would be able to take care of our future needs ruby asked what cost was involved in doing the for this type of contract ms responded by stating that she had asked purchasing in the past to come up with a figure for that so that that knowledge would be available going forward ms advised that from her perspective the time involved for each individual to go through this process was an issue as well when you have a vendor that you know provides a great service and you know getting the best pricing to go through the process every years seems inconvenient and costly ms ruby asked how much time specifically on this project that ms and ms had spent ms stated that she had spent hours over a two month period on this project restated is motion to amend the contract to a year contract ms white restated her second and the motion passed unanimously by the it board resolution award of rick service delivery manager for applications for presented resolution the enhanced access review committees award of the to inc judge young asked what the term of the contract would be responded that it was a year contract judge young wanted to know what the difference would be in leaving in the court revenue that was taken out of the projection due to the supreme court ruling regarding free public access to court records stored on odyssey stated that the decision to place this out for bid was not based on losing the courts revenue it was based on the fact that the contract had not been rebid on in years time and included the possibility that there could be a loss from the courts revenue occurring in stated that he was on the review committee and that the revenue that or not come from the court records did not have a bearing on choosing which would be a better vendor continued by stating that one of the important things to him was the idea that we should have the freedom and flexibility to choose which records should and should not be provided for free and that language is in the current contract and would want that flexibility included even if the supreme court had not mandated it in the current contract the would be able to select which type of a court record would carry what type of a charge and be able to determine what the financial impact would then be on the vendor from that we would be able to determine what the enterprise receives back from the contract as the current model is that the enterprise receives a percentage of the current user charges made to continued by stating that the shows that the transactions made to are growing in the form of traffic tickets permits etc and that the more transactions there are the less we can charge per transaction over time judge young made a motion to table the discussion of the resolution in order to gather more information or judge young stated that he would vote against the resolution advised that this contract was set to expire in of the it board extended the contract through of in order to complete the process including the best and final offer negotiations judge young repeated his motion to table the discussion and chief deputy seconded that motion stated that he believed that the took into account everything that needed to be taken into account including whether or not the court revenue would be available continued by stating that besides the flexibility that he spoke of earlier that is included in the current option with is not included in the second which basically says that the enterprise would be entering into a contract owing the vendor money where the enterprise gets that money is of no concern to the vendor technically thought that would mean that there would need to be an appropriation in the budget for that type of agreement explained that is a vendor who has been with the for years this vendor has developed and written programs that work within the enterprises agencies the downside to the other vendor is that they would have to come in to the enterprise and completely rewrite what has already been in place for the past years stated that he did not believe that the board needed to table this as they are in the final stages of negotiations ms white stated that she is also against tabling this resolution ms white being the clerk of the court the keeper of the court records has been at the table and by ordinance is a member of the review committee and reviewed all of the bidding documents and as such is very comfortable in the way the proposal is moving forward stated that he did not believe that the issue was germane enough to table the motion called for a vote on the motion to table resolution assenting votes were made by judge young and chief deputy forestall nay votes were made by ms white ms and ms ruby made a motion to allow the continuation of the negotiations with assenting votes were made by ms white ms and ms ruby nay votes were

was not passed on to the other agencies continued by stating moving forward into in order to abolish the problem we will need to manage the problem and challenge the agencies to plan ahead and work within their budgets baker continued his presentation noting that staying with we maintain a very experienced and highly skilled team as well as a very stable partner commended baker and his team in
