and verify the work eligibility status of all newly hired employees through the program as defined in the contractor is not required to participate should the program cease to exist additionally the contractor is not required to participate if the contractor is and does not employ any employees the contractor shall not knowingly employ or contract with an unauthorized alien the contractor shall not retain an employee or contract with a person that the contractor subsequently learns is an unauthorized alien the contractor shall require subcontractors who perform work under this contract to certify to the contractor that the subcontractor does not knowingly employ or contract with an unauthorized alien and that the subcontractor has enrolled and is participating in the program the contractor agrees to maintain this certification throughout the duration of the term of a contract with a subcontractor the city terminate for default if the contractor fails to cure a breach of this

addendum optimization of south bend collection system phase dear the board of public works at its meeting held on approved the above referenced professional services agreement addendum in the amount of enclosed is a copy of the professional services agreement addendum for your records also enclosed please find the city employment eligibility verification form required by the state for your signature please return the fully executed form as soon as possible additionally enclosed please find the city minority and women business enterprise diversity if you have any questions please contact me at sincerely martin clerk enclosure engineering tel avenue fax suite com water system optimization assistant city engineer department of engineering subject request for additional budget to finalize the south bend optimization dear is seeking approval for additional budget to finalize the south bend optimization the additional budget being requested is for all outstanding tasks yet to be completed for the project some of the outstanding tasks such as the report and animation are already included in our current scope of work and while there is some remaining budget for these tasks a large portion of the budget allocated to these tasks has been utilized to undertake work items that were essential to develop the current solutions fortunately a number of in scope items have been completed for less than the allocated budget so the additional fee request is less than the cost of the additional scope items individually below find lists of both out work completed and tasks to still be completed a table of all of these tasks with requested fees shown and a fee breakdown table showing team fees work completed re optimization only no lid scenario this scenario was evaluated in phase a and the solution review comments were included into the phase optimization of all alternatives including green and infrastructure performing additional optimization runs for the no lid scenario was not included in the original phase scope and budget however this scenario has been re optimized in phase to enable an apples with apples comparison between optimized solutions with and without lid using the final phase input data several iterations the with lid scenario the lid scenario was run multiple times for different version of the lid input data as various anomalies in the input data provided by new were identified and corrected conveyance refinement in lid solutions all optimization solutions with lid have been refined such that conveyance infrastructure is adequate for no lid flow conditions the purpose of this refinement is to provide confidence that overflows will only occur at controlled release points with provisions for screening and chemical dosing page of single conveyance solution optimization results from the no lid and with lid scenarios demonstrated distinct trends in the overall conveyance strategy for the system rather than presenting solutions with only slight differences in the conveyance strategy a conveyance strategy was selected that well regardless of the lid strategy several iterations were performed to ensure the conveyance strategy was cost effective and hydraulically robust for the full range of potential design conditions sensitivity analyses additional scenarios were completed to demonstrate how the optimized solution is affected by the assumed effectiveness of lid technologies an additional scenario was included to evaluate the effect of not including rain gardens and or politically sensitive lid technologies sensitivity analyses were also performed for the assumed cost of river crossings the following tasks are still to be completed interim solution memorandum this memorandum will be completed in and will present the current solutions and recommendations for finalizing the project it will provide the team with an opportunity to digest the work that has been completed and to comment on what should be done to finish the project the memorandum will provide a basis for the draft final report to be completed efficiently in perform setup optimization will review the current optimized solutions and include structures which can then be optimized by to ensure existing and future infrastructure is fully utilized and the size of future storage facilities capitalize on the use of effective structures works schedule the optimization model will be used to prioritize capital improvement projects based on which projects achieve the greatest reduction in volume within the available budget for each planning horizon lid solution details spot check hydrological modeling and will develop additional metrics and figures to help present the lid solution spot check detailed hydrological modeling will be completed for cs and cs to help demonstrate how the recommended optimization solution be affected by detailed modeling remodel optimized solution in the optimized solution will be remodeled and
