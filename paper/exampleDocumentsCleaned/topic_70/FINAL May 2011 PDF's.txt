meeting interim presented the report as follows thank you chairman good morning board members good morning welcome peter as legal council one initiative completed this month implementation human capital management phase last we went live with the first phase of one of the biggest projects that the has undertaken in years if perhaps ever things have gone well and hood the project director will be up in a little while to give us more details in his one project went yellow this month sheriff deputy tracking for clock rounds when we initially planned out this project we set a pretty aggressive time frame that we are finding some challenges in hitting most of the current challenges are behind the scenes as we work with our partners in finance to ensure that the funding is in all the right places we believe that this will be resolved shortly and we will update the and report back to the it board next month one project remains yellow this month enhancements phase this project continues to be yellow as we continue to deal with interface changes associated with the upgrade we are also running into the situation where the same resources that are working on this project are working diligently on the one project has been placed on hold disaster recovery plan upgrade phase while this continues to be important to and the enterprise as a whole due to resources issues this was my responsibility as deputy and who we brought in to work on this has been solely dedicated to the move for public safety once the permanent is determined we will be able to put some focus back on this no new projects added this month brief updates on other projects phase iii business licensing we continue to phase challenges with the upgrade which is being done in preparation for business licensing the upgrade has been delayed about three weeks and we believe that there be an impact on the date for business licensing we hope to understand the complete impact in the next week to ten days and we will keep the board updated as we have new information mainframe hosting with the state of project is moving along well with the upgrade to the state mainframe to be completed next weekend the teams are working well together and we continue to be pleased with the progress of this project talking about the mainframe is a good transition to update the board regarding the power outage from a couple of weeks ago th power outage the city county building experienced a sudden loss of power on the west side of the building at approximately pm loss of primary power to the data center is ordinarily mitigated by the use of a diesel generator to supply emergency power in this case due to the nature of the failure the path for power delivery was interrupted rendering the generator ineffective the end result was a failure of several key systems that affected the enterprise over the last several years has made a number of changes to the data center in an effort to extend the life of our data center by reducing the power load on the primary ups and by creating a better environment from a temperature perspective as part of this initiative we removed a number of key systems off of the primary ups and placed them on their own ups a number of these ups failed when we lost power the team quickly assessed the situation placed our disaster recovery partner on alert and began the process of communicating with the enterprise and mitigating the issues power cables were rerouted in the data center and we systematically shut down non critical servers to prevent overload of the ups and allow critical infrastructure and business critical application hosts to be brought back online the plan was executed and the critical functions brought online within ninety minutes the loss of power was experienced in other areas of the building and several of those areas experienced complete network outages when the power to the network closets on the floors was disrupted this caused the networking equipment in the affected closets to shut down and users connected to that equipment to lose network connectivity even if power to their workstation was not disrupted power was restored around pm and we had most systems back up around pm our next steps are to take some of the issues we have identified and find ways to mitigate these if possible in our current environment and if not look at what the other possible options are we will be adding a project to next months report where we will keep the board up to speed on our progress i want to take a quick moment to thank the and team that worked this outage they showed excellent team work and a lot of creativity as they worked together to bring systems back up quickly and to keep things working in a very difficult situation both and met all their for total expenses was budgeted for was used which equals used overall revenue was budgeted for was received which the main service areas show a total of spent for compared to for last year at this time this made for a variance due to a different payment schedule this year on the contract resolution for renewal of the oracle software license maintenance agreement rusty

update hood project director presented the update pp slides for discussion item update is available for viewing in the it board packet online at adjourned the it board meeting at am is a resource utilization study phase moss and enterprise mainframe hosting with state power outages risk implementation phase operations center resource utilization study phase is twofold drive increased efficiency via the rightsizing of mainframe resource utilization and output creation and to provide information gaps on transitioning data to the state supreme courts statewide system mainframe hosting with state of this project originally conceived in early will leverage existing budgetary resources to transition current mainframe hosting activities to a model with the state of hosting transition will result in significant shared benefits across governments while specifically furthering strategic goals of simplifying service provision via the consolidation of agreements delivering increased cost savings and accelerating transition from the increasingly expensive to mainframe platform moss enterprise the purpose of this project is to leverage our investment in moss technology we will accomplish that leverage in two ways first we have engaged apparatus to manage our moss services second we will work with apparatus to deploy to the enterprise in phases with enterprise and portals processes impacting single implementation the scope of this phase includes the implementation of general ledger procurement and power outages risk mitigation the purpose of this project is to take short term steps and initiate long term solutions that mitigate the risk of critical services being disrupted by a power outage within the building as was experienced on the afternoon of implementation the scope of this phase includes the pension and payroll and the association of static addressing the project is focused primarily on enabling field reporting and is not meant to provide sufficient redundancy to completely mitigate current operational risks stemming resource utilization study the superior court seeks to undertake a thorough documentation of the system source code use cases operational aspects and reports generated the purpose of this comprehensive study from vehicle radio modems future enhancements will include the implementation of a new wide area

infrastructure approximately weeks net changes a reduction of approximately per year is anticipated through housing these documents on existing city county hardware and leveraging existing enterprise licenses for the software the primary purpose for funding this initiative is to bring the online contracts currently externally hosted by imaging office systems back and hosted in doing this will reduce our expenses related to making contracts available to the public by approximately and purchasing launched an initiative in of to create electronic copies of contracts and make such contracts available online through an externally hosted solution the scope was subsequently expanded to include all contracts from forward the current software as a service solution incurs a monthly cost based in part on the volume of storage used and in part based on the number of pages scanned into the system to take advantage of the economies of scale made possible by having an enterprise document management solution already in place worked with prescient and to migrate the documents from provided and hosted by into the cost for prescient and to export the documents from and import them into and to install and configure the software to be used for loading additional contracts into will be an additional will be spent scanning documents from and importing those contracts into for subsequent and publishing by has estimated that the cost to continue externally hosting the online contracts to be per year based on the current contract with and the expected growth in documents stored in the system this would be a hard cash outlay our estimate of the internal costs are approximately per year taking into account all the software hardware and administrative costs incurred by funding for online contracts migration executive summary resolution to approve the maintenance contract for support of automated fingerprint identification system whereas to ensure continuity of service and
