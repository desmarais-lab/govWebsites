flight date stated this contract is time critical there is a short window to do the aerial flights they need to be done when there is no snow no leaves blooming and a clear sunny day the beginning and end time are fairly short which makes this very time sensitive from the assessors perspective decisions are based according to the condition of a property on a certain date which is what makes it critical to stay in advance of that and suggested the board move quickly asked what the difference between oblique and digital photography is and does the enterprise do the entire county every two years explained digital photography or traditional photography which is straight down and oblique photography is taken at degree angle which provides a better perspective by using cameras the end

them explained the goal is to make a decision on what to do with them pm added that the worse case be to script them and eliminate them later but the users need to make the decision judge commented that the potential time invested and costs associated with odyssey would be the same with discussed the comparison of odyssey versus and the different cost factors that go along with each of those

help desk level two support and higher will be provided by through the help desk how would county handle issues or bugs at this time issues and bugs would be reported to the help desk how will changes enhancements be handled in order to best answer this question and others throughout the document a few definitions should be noted enhancements enhancements are projects that require development changes by and have a very detailed plan to handle requested enhancements configuration configuration changes are controlled by in some instances in which business practices vary from one county to another a change in the configuration of odyssey can be made that will accommodate the business practice needed for each county information services agency memorandum memorandum has a list of enhancements that were created upon completion of the process the enhancements have been prioritized so that they can be handled through scheduled releases in addition to these enhancements will work with each scheduled for implementation to review their current business practices and evaluate any enhancements that might be deemed beneficial these requests will then be routed through the statewide governing board and the committee of judges who will make a final determination regarding additional enhancements will also work closely with each to ensure any local changes to configuration that are needed can be made before implementation will customizations by county be allowed customization recommendations from counties will definitely be considered by through configuration the counties will see some flexibility in the use of the system who pays for enhancements or customizations at this time is paying for customization and enhancements additional enhancements will go through the process defined above since the system is intended for statewide use and enhancements will be implemented throughout the state will most likely handle these costs with some potential exceptions in the area of local interfaces law enforcement and clerk questions does have a law enforcement solution and what are the capabilities odyssey has a law enforcement module however this module was not purchased by law enforcement will have access to the system as defined by their county and through public access odyssey will also interface with other applications currently being used by law enforcement these applications include but are limited to and the protective order registry does functionality provide for arrestee processing bookings case initiations warrant issuance hearing scheduling or traffic violations odyssey does track the information taken at arrestee processing data field names vary odyssey also handles case initiation warrant issuance serving expiring recalling etc hearing scheduling functionality is much like it is in outlook odyssey has a citation initiation process and will interface with the project does functionality provide a financial package including cashiering information services agency memorandum memorandum odyssey has a financial package that allows for tracking of case fees cashiering end of day balancing and disbursements including check writing odyssey has a financial manager module that includes a chart of accounts and reconciliation works with the state board of accounts to ensure the are approved and the reporting needs are met if odyssey does not meet all of our needs will we develop interfaces with odyssey has always been interested in working with county to ensure their data can be shared with other counties whether through an interface or by using the odyssey case management system who will pay for interfacing this will be a future policy decision implementation questions what is the implementation plan is currently working to implement in county and township small claims court implementation is scheduled for phase is scheduled to begin in mid and run through early an announcement of those counties is scheduled for early how would approach specific needs as to county courts realizes that county courts will have specific needs if they decide to use odyssey at that time will work closely with county to determine resource needs and a realistic for implementation believes that by the beginning of phase odyssey will meet almost all of the needs that county expressed to under the prior contract with computer associates one area that is working on that does not fall into this category is bulk filing is working with to decide how we want to proceed to accomplish this functionality what will the state contract cover our contract with covers the licensing and maintenance costs for the software the contract also provides that will lead our efforts through phase and then provide support to through phase during phases will take the lead deploying odyssey throughout the rest of the state has expressed their willingness to be available whenever needed throughout these phases information services agency memorandum memorandum will we have to have a contract for county specific implementations the division does not have a separate contract with for individual county implementations if county is interested in other odyssey modules that are not included in our current contract with we can begin a discussion about this interest what is the proposed is currently in phase this phase involves developing the software for county and county small claims courts this phase should conclude by the end of the second quarter or the beginning of the third quarter of phase will then begin phase involves additional counties will continue to help with deployment and data conversion efforts this phase will run from the beginning of the third quarter of through the end of the second quarter of intends to deploy to the remaining small claims courts in county following completion of phase as these courts indicate their readiness phase and phase counties have not been determined at this process questions is a included in the current contract conducted a analysis with county and township small claims earlier this year are there any consulting services planned for individual counties plans to utilize several deployment teams throughout the deployment phases of this project the number of deployment teams vary depending on the availability of funding these deployment teams consist of some consultants who will work with staff will the state or assist with or workarounds has worked closely with and court user to develop any workaround necessary for using odyssey the goal being as few workaround procedures as training questions whats provided by the current contract under the current contract responsibilities are to provide training and training materials for system users on the new judicial software by role and area of responsibility information services agency memorandum memorandum what are the logistics of training under the current contract training is to be
