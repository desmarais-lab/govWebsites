chapter of the code regarding the duties of the general counsel and caucus attorneys with regard to representation of council members on private matters by an vote the committee reported the proposal to the council with the stated that the proposal was amended in committee to address instances where the caucus attorneys could represent in matters brought about by virtue of their office she said that there remains some concerns about associates in the contracted attorneys law firms representing a on a private matter she said that she believes the rules of professional conduct for attorneys would cover those instances speedy stated that he supports the proposal and thanked for addressing this initiative brown asked hypothetically if was the general counsel he could not represent a on a private matter but his son or wife who also worked in his law firm could said that the rules of professional conduct for attorneys addresses this issue and these rules are clear that when there is a conflict of interest attorneys associated with the same firm cannot represent that individual in private matters either brown asked if the rules of professional conduct do not cover the way the council currently does stated that she believes the attorneys for the council are covered in the rules of professional conduct for attorneys specifically in and she said that she has been a lawyer in since and served as a hearing officer in for attorney disciplinary matters she said that this proposal is overly broad unenforceable and beyond the prescribed ethical limitations in the professional conduct for attorneys she said that it is unclear what actions are addressed in this proposal that are not already in the rules of professional conduct for attorneys and if there is no conflict with actual council business she does not understand the need for this proposal she said that she opposes the proposal on these grounds said that the rules of professional conduct are very clear about conflict of interest but nothing precludes this council from holding themselves to a higher standard he said that as elected officials they are often under a heightened level of scrutiny and this proposal addresses the appearance of a conflict and not just an actual conflict of interest speedy agreed with and said that although the council be forfeiting a bit of a right to hire the counsel they wish the perception of the public warrants it asked if the conflict of interest issue is already covered in the rules of professional conduct is this proposal really needed or does it simply do the same thing he asked if there are repercussions to the attorney and the if such a situation should occur general counsel stated that if there is an actual conflict of interest the rules of professional conduct state that he cannot represent a unless he has the consent of the full council and the individual he said that the rules are clear on this issue and have been in place forever but is where the rules of professional conduct end he said that this proposal goes one step further and states whether there is a conflict or not a contracted attorney for the council cannot represent any in any private matter he said that the proposal only applies to the contracted attorney by its terms and theoretically his partners could represent a member of the council in a private matter if there is no actual conflict he said that if the reasoning behind passing this proposal is to avoid the appearance of a conflict then he believes it is not solved by allowing a member of his firm to represent a in a private matter either brown asked if feels then that this proposal does not go far enough responded that the rules of professional conduct are clear in this matter but only when an actual conflict exists this proposal however does not care if there is an actual conflict or not and makes the appearance of a conflict an ethical matter he stated that should this proposal pass as long as he is retained as general counsel no one in his firm will represent a on a private matter brown asked if believes this proposal should then cover everyone in his law firm said that with regards to actual conflicts of interest the rules of professional conduct prohibit anyone in his firm from representing an individual where a conflict exists in his opinion the appearance of a conflict is still there if he were to turn over personal representation of a to another member of his firm gray asked to speak to this issue said that in her opinion this rule is unnecessary the overriding concern of an attorney is to represent their client to the best of their ability and zealously she said that the appearance of a conflict does not exist in the rules of professional conduct and this proposal also could prohibit a contracted attorney from representing a on a personal matter because of their role as she said that this goes too far and if passed the council will have to live with it for a long time said that the idea is to eliminate the appearance of any impropriety and this will simply insure that there is no conflict he said that the other issue regarding representation by law firm members is covered in the rules of professional conduct for attorneys asked how this would be enforced if passed said that the council or the president of the council would have to take action president said that contracts for the attorneys are signed by the president and the president could then take action to terminate that contract asked how the involved would be affected or reprimanded president said that he is not attorney but another member could file a complaint if that were the case said that his contract states that he will comply with the rules of the council in performing services he said that if he breaks those rules he then breaks the contract he said that he has counseled president to take such a matter before the full council instead of terminating such a contract on his own he said that there is nothing in the rules of the council or in this proposal to provide for censure of a if this should occur but the council could do so if they wished moved seconded by for adoption proposal no yeas day hunter plowman scales smith speedy nays brown gray sanders absent oliver proposal for a general ordinance to amend chapter of the
