day gray hunter lewis oliver plowman sanders smith nays scales speedy not voting absent asked for consent to explain his vote consent was given said that he would normally oppose such a proposal but

perform a review and it was frustrating to get information in a timely fashion and in detail he said that they then made recommendations that the boards could either incorporate or not incorporate this requires a lot of work on the office of finance and management and the council committee but was a waste of time when it produced no results he said that with property tax caps now in place there needs to be one local body looking at how those caps are spread out he said that reviews are ridiculous he said that he is apprehensive about sending anything to the other end of market street said that this proposal is about local decision making he said that he believes this body is elected to make tough decisions with the pool of money given he said that the townships are doing their job but they are only looking at their township and do not see the big picture asked if township boards are elected officials said that they are asked if the process has changed with trustees said that there is no change that he knows of but that there is not communication that he knows of between the trustees to see what others are doing said that they wasted a lot of time on a ceremonious review of township budgets and none of the information received was consistent she said that this body is penalized if they do not timely review these budgets and they are stuck with the prior levy yet there is no impetus on these boards to make sure they provide the information in a timely manner she said that it is not in this best interest to continue to review budgets over which they have no authority or regulation she said that in the future she would also like this body to look into the surplus in some of these budgets said that the funds right now are very limited and one fiscal body needs to review all budgets to make sure priorities are covered asked to be added as a cosponsor on this proposal moved seconded by for adoption proposal no a proposal for a special resolution requesting the
