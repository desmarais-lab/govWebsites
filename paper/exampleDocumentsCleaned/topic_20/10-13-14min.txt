freeman and approves the issuance of revenue bonds in an amount not to exceed to finance certain street road curb and sidewalk improvements and approves and authorizes other actions in respect thereto by a said that as amended this approves borrowing million to fund million of improvements and allows a maximum of interest for five years he said that as amended this proposal pays a bunch of money for something they are not actually buying moved seconded by for adoption proposal no was hunter lewis miller oliver scales nays asked for consent to explain his vote consent was given said that this was originally for a million bond and then it was cut and postponed yet these proposals go hand in hand he said that the council leadership seems to be getting into the micromanagement of what streets and roads need repaired the most and that is why he voted against it heard proposal no on and the proposal sponsored by miller hunter freeman and appropriates the proceeds of the revenue bonds in an amount not to exceed to fund the cost of certain street road curb and sidewalk projects and the incidental expenses in connection therewith and creates a new fund by a vote the committee reported the proposal to the council with the recommendation that it do pass as amended moved to amend proposal no by deleting the amendments approved by the committee to restore the proposal to its language as originally introduced seconded the motion general counsel said that there is a technical problem in doing that as the proposal as originally introduced appropriated proceeds in the amount of million and the proposal just passed included language not to exceed million said that they can still not exceed that amount said that this offered amendment does not correspond to what was just passed in proposal no the amendments made in committee changes the million to million and section stipulates that proceeds not appropriated by proposal no go into a fund freeman said that million does not exceed million he said that as amended the democrats want to borrow million and leave million in the bank to pay interest on something they are not using and this does not make sense he said that based on last winter he believes anyone could come up with a of million worth of road projects he said that he does not understand why they want to hamstring the department of public works in getting these roads fixed and it has become a political process with the committee being used for choosing which roads get paved he said that he voted in favor of the water deal that provided most of these monies and even though every democrat voted against it they were adamant about having money allocated for their projects he said that this process should have been done properly through instead of making it a political process he said that why his colleagues are not willing to allocate money toward something any member of the public would tell them is drastically needed makes no sense hunter said that they are requesting million in marketing bonds and they have to disclose putting half of that into escrow he asked how long it can remain in escrow when they do not even know if they have an agreement to appropriate the dollars the following year brown chief financial officer said that this was a strategy that first brought to the table to ask for authorization to borrow up to a certain amount they planned not to issue the full amount at first and tonights action would give them the authority to issue bond anticipation notes and then they can come back and ask for other bond anticipation notes hunter asked if there are fees associated time they go back to the well for more and what that added cost would be he said that this would be money that would not be going toward road improvements brown said that this was idea and that is a good question he said that there would be some fees but a lot less than a bond issuance would be doing bond anticipation notes first they can then do some more planning and then do a second amount of notes and then just have one bond issuance some time next year hunter asked if city controller is aware of the fees in this process and if disclosure is required to bond entities that the money is not being appropriated said that they are charged interest as soon as the bonds are issued and it would depend on the time difference between when they take out the bond anticipation notes and go to market on the bond issuance he said that million will have to go to pay off the bond anticipation notes depending on the action of this council it could be a minimal cost if the time frame is small but if it is longer that would cost additional interest and a premium that would be paid for holding that money hunter urged his colleagues to support the amendment in order to insure less administrative costs if the full million were appropriated at once brown said that this is incorrect and the bond anticipation notes idea was the plan that was brought to them by there will be fees and costs no matter what and amending it back will not save them any money if wants to do one bond issuance and get all the money quickly that is a different plan than what they presented and if that is the case then they need to start all over from the beginning said that even though a voted against the water bill the expense of is shared by all of county equally and therefore they have the duty to make sure all neighborhoods benefit from that miller said that he met with director miser and the list he saw was for million of projects and not million while it have been the plan at one time some residents are now going to have to wait another year he said that they need to work together with the team and if they do not get the funds now they cannot spend them now moved seconded by to call the question and end debate the motion carried on the following roll call vote viz yeas gray lewis oliver scales nays freeman hunter miller the motion to amend proposal no back to its originally introduced form failed on the yeas freeman hunter miller nays gray lewis oliver scales citizen said that she does not know the cost of borrowing this money but thought looking out for the citizens and counting the cost is what the council was paid to do hunter asked if they will be disclosing to the bond holder that half of the money will be put into escrow brown said that if they do the bond issuance immediately yes they will have to disclose that however if they do a bond anticipation note first and hold off on the issuance to do it all at once they would not have to hunter asked if this amended proposal and new process has all been checked out and is in compliance with state and federal statutes responded in the affirmative said that this proposal in no way mirrors the proposal introduced in they talked about borrowing a certain amount of money in order to leverage federal dollars he said that people are suffering because of the condition of the roads yet the committee has held up this proposal for three months in order to control and dictate which streets get attention oliver called for a point of order president lewis stated that is in order added that a solid engineering recommendation came from the staff and they should base projects on a priority basis and not a political basis he asked ms miser to speak to this amended proposal ms miser said that are ready to spend every penny of the million if approved tonight they have had to substitute some projects on the list based on input and can design and bid on these projects by early next spring they already have million of emergency work that was approved by the council recently and these will be more costly than normal estimates because this is not the optimal time to bid if they divide these projects and delay the bidding they will indeed pay more for the projects and they are ready to go for the full million if it were approved she said that they do need money in order to match federal dollars but they can do that at the million level as well moved seconded by to call the question and end debate the motion carried on the following roll call vote viz yeas gray lewis oliver scales nays freeman hunter miller there being no further testimony moved seconded by for yeas gray hunter lewis miller oliver scales nays freeman freeman and asked to be removed from the proposal as cosponsors as this is not what they signed on to support freeman miller and asked for consent to explain their votes consent was given freeman said how any member of this body could live through last winter and hear director misers testimony that there are easily million worth of projects that need to be done yet vote this is beyond him he said that this vote is the telling people they do not need this money and they are playing political games and he cannot support it cannot design projects and bid them because they do not know if the council will allocate those dollars it does not make sense to borrow million and only spend and they look like they do not know what they are doing and are making it up as they go along miller and agreed and said that there is no practical reason to appropriate only half when so many needs need addressing now and this infrastructure process is more politicized than they have seen to have been postponed for three months and then cut in half and asked to be added as cosponsors on the proposal proposal no oliver and reported that various committees heard proposal no on various dates during the months of and the

dollars found for that do not go far enough she added that they also need to address the dying trees in the that are also causing a public safety hazard she said that with reservations she supports

and their staff for their hard work added that a commitment was made in the public safety and criminal justice committee to look at finding some additional funding for fire apparatus and with that commitment he supports the proposal lewis said that she will abstain on questions and as her husband works for the assessors office and her employer the dove house receives dollars from crime
