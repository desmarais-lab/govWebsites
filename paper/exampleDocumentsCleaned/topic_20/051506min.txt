anyway which takes money away from vital programs he said that they had hoped that the general assembly would take action to help the counties not incur these increases but that did not happen this is a case where the state decides how the local government spends their money executive director of the bond bank stated that when they realized there was a shortfall in they felt this was the best mechanism to pay it off with a tax rate levied in asked if this tax will only be levied for one year ms said that this is correct she said they are allowed by state law to issue bonds for a year

years to get changes but this is an issue with problems on both sides of the aisle said that they could have included extra funds in the budget last year but instead kept it level he said that they could have still been short because there is no way to make a prediction because of the increase in people being serviced and the lack of control even an increase in appropriations might not have been enough asked if there is any way to insure that this additional amount will be enough said that there is no way to accurately predict depending on the number of children serves if the numbers stay level they will not have to ask for more said that this is one area where both parties need to really work together on he said that dynamics are changing in the legislature and they need to continue to dialogue with the state regarding this matter he said that it is not fair that the state spends the money but the city has to pay the bill said that he does not see the bills going down as there is an increase in the number of chin children in need of services cases every year he said that they need to be prepared for the worst and save as much money in reserve as they can in case there are
