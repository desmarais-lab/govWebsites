its passage by the council and compliance with ind code miller and amends the code for vacant building standards regarding homes with a foreclosure complaint filed against them by a vote the gray asked who will put this in place and who will enforce it miller said that there is nothing really to enforce but banks will be responsible for maintenance he said that they are not really able to enforce this but by codifying it in the law they are making the statement of intent very clear to the state legislature in the hopes that they will correct the state said that this makes a statement that this body supports and stands with neighborhoods in holding owners accountable for those properties and upkeep hopeful that the state law will also be fixed freeman said that there are times and places to make statements he said that he has no idea why they are passing something that does nothing they are enacting an ordinance that is unenforceable will not be followed and does not do anything he said that they can call their senators run for state legislature but this is not anything they can do something about at this time he said it makes no sense to change sections in the code when they cannot actually make those changes said that a lot of constituents support this effort while the banks have asked her not to support it but it is frustrating that this action cannot be enforced she said that this body should instead work together as a group to go to the state legislature to resolve this issue said that he does not disagree with freeman on many issues but this city is made up of many neighborhoods and when neighborhoods are weak the city is weak he said that they not have enforcement authority but this action will empower neighborhoods the general assembly took this power away from local government in the final days of the last session and the only way to get this done is to make a statement and have constituents contact their representatives to ask them to allow the residents to have the authority to deal with problems in their neighborhoods said that he respectfully disagrees even though he attends community meetings regularly where residents provide information and complaints about these properties however to pass a law that has no actionable parts to it is a big waste of time and they should instead be talking to legislators he said that to pass this means nothing and he cannot therefore support it scales said that this is putting the cart before the horse and they need to first go to the state legislature she said that neighborhoods do need help but passing legislation will give residents hope that something will be done when nothing can be she said that this body needs to be more concerned with passing laws that can be enforced she said that she would be happy to help work toward a solution but this is not the way to do it said that the legislature knows this is important to but at the th hour they put changes in place because of that he said that citizens overwhelming support the council taking action anyway said that the general assembly had the opportunity to act and instead acted opposite the residents wishes he said that he would like to continue to work with them but he has not seen any cooperation on their part he said that they have started to put together a neighborhood toolbox to help build strong neighborhoods this is just one step in a sequence of many to demonstrate collaboration and the importance of building strong neighborhoods said that she is concerned that this needs to be further negotiated she said that she feels for the neighborhoods but she wants to see something strong in place that actually does something miller said that the only other thing they could do would be to offer a special resolution to urge the state to make changes if this ordinance is just paper and ink then he does not believe he would have received the emails from bank lobbyists asking him not to support it he said that it has gotten the attention of those who asked for local power to be taken away at the general assembly he said that they did not want to talk to council members before but now are begging them not to act on this he said that this sends a message that they care about neighborhoods and the only thing they can do is urge the assembly to fix it i move to amend section sec of proposal no

on the bank if they do not do it and if there is no way to enforce it said that there is not gray asked if this is just a show to say the council did something answered in the affirmative and said
