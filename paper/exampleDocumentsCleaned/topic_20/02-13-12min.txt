sponsored by concerns procedures for redistricting hearings read the proposal and moved seconded by for adoption asked besides the fact that redistricting has already occurred and was signed into law on why this proposal was not assigned to a committee and vetted properly through the committee process he asked if there is an urgency that warrants cutting out public input said that they are not cutting out the public from providing input on the redistricting process they are simply telling the public of their intentions with this proposal he said that they are simply saying that they will redistrict and will be acquiring tools and setting deadlines the public will receive adequate notification and they are not doing this in the dark or quickly said that he would like to be the first to go on record as saying that this is a perfectly legal exercise to redistrict at any time other than from to of an election year he said however that he does not understand why they must vote on this proposal the same night as it is introduced and why it was not referred to committee president lewis asked general counsel to respond said that the proposal is properly before the council for action according to sec of the code which provides that any internal action of the council can be designated as a council resolution and voted on at the same hearing in which it is introduced moved seconded by hunter to refer proposal no to committee said that this proposal is outside the bounds of internal policy and makes a decision that impacts state law he said that he believes it speaks beyond internal policy of the council and does not fit the parameters just mentioned by counsel said that there are no set guidelines for internal policy and this proposal does not affect state law moved seconded by to end debate and call for the question debate was ended on the following roll call vote viz yeas brown gray hunter lewis miller oliver nays freeman absent scales the motion to refer proposal no to committee failed on the following roll call vote viz yeas freeman hunter miller nays brown gray lewis oliver absent scales stated that she appreciates offering the proposal as this is the type of procedure they went through years ago with an open manner approach to redistricting she added that under state law the council is required to do redistricting this year said that while this is a perfectly legal and legitimate process it is unnecessary as new districts were adopted and signed into law on which technically was this year he said that there are portions of the proposal he can support as it is within their right to redistrict when they wish but with factually inaccurate partisan language needlessly included he will have to oppose the proposal brown said that he supports the proposal as it outlines a good process with a lot of public input and there is no contract involved for any personal friends miller asked if during this process they can address what is so inaccurate about the current redistricting now in place said that he does not understand why the democrats are complaining about the new districts when they went from a favorable ratio to maybe a favorable for republicans he said that he thinks this is a tremendous waste of money and the redistricting had nothing to do with contracts but was to make the districts more competitive now which they are he said this is an unfortunate waste of a substantial amount of taxpayer money and he would urge his colleagues to oppose it freeman said that in his law practice even when there are contentious issues no one goes personal and he would hope this council could adopt that mindset he asked that members please simply vote their conscience and let personal attacks subside as these are not serving anyone nor the city well said that there were public meetings already held and the one she was at was well attended as public meetings go and people asked a lot of questions and had those questions answered she said that she feels that it is wrong to infer that the process was disingenuous as it was not brown said that it is public record that entered into a contract with a friend of his and it is not a personal attack but a matter of public record yeas brown gray lewis oliver nays freeman hunter miller absent scales a council resolution concerning procedures for redistricting hearings whereas a requires the county council to adopt an ordinance establishing new council district boundaries during the second year after a year in which the federal decennial census is conducted and whereas the redistricting process which takes place only once every ten years is a critically important process in which the public must be given a meaningful opportunity to participate and whereas the council district maps adopted by vote on as part of proposal no are needlessly and unfairly partisan and arbitrarily divide communities of interest and whereas the public deserves to have an orderly redistricting process that allows adequate time for the preparation of alternative redistricting plans including plans offered by members of the public based on a common set of census data and precinct building blocks and whereas the process should allow adequate time to evaluate all proposed redistricting maps for compactness population deviation respect for precinct boundary lines compliance with nondiscrimination laws respect for communities of interest and other relevant factors and whereas the lawful establishment of such new districts in will require the use of certain computer software capabilities and demographic data from the federal decennial census now therefore section the committee on rules and public policy shall supervise the redistricting process and

president lewis stated that it will take votes to override a mayoral veto miller said that while he supports the measure and did vote for it originally he is not comfortable overriding a mayoral veto and would like to further understand the concerns expressed in the mayors communication said that the mayor continues to be a moving target on this issue and this is the exact same language proposed last year yet at the last minute an outgoing offered an amendment to protect a clubs discretion to allow children she said that it is shameful for the mayor to again not say whether or not he would support it even though he ran for office on the platform that he would support a proposal she said that it is also shameful and dishonest for other to say they support the measure but then not be willing to vote to override the veto said that he offered an amendment in committee eliminating all the exemptions except for offtrack betting facilities as those are preempted by the state but that amendment was defeated and although it is against his gut to do so he would move to end debate and call for the question freeman seconded the motion yeas freeman gray lewis nays brown hunter miller

pass stated that since the meeting it was brought to his attention that this developer was out of compliance with a former abatement and he moved seconded by to return proposal no to committee for further review stated that it was his understanding that if this was not approved tonight it would go away he asked if the proposal is time sensitive and if postponing action on the matter will put jobs in jeopardy said that this information was not provided at committee but he would rather make sure they have all the information they need to make an informed decision asked if information could be provided this evening so as not to put jobs in jeopardy asked if the administration could be allowed to address the point of time sensitivity he said that if postponing this matter would cause the retention of existing jobs and the creation of new jobs to be jeopardized he cannot support it rick assistant administrator for economic development department of metropolitan development said that the company agreed to the prior abatement and due to noncompliance they agreed to pay back that abatement which wiped the slate clean asked why there was no testimony in committee as to their lack of compliance said that he was not asked about compliance for any previous abatements said that this answer deeply troubles him as consideration to grant another abatement performance from a previous abatement should always be considered and provided for full disclosure he said that he just received this information late this afternoon and this is unacceptable asked if knew they were in noncompliance when they came before the committee responded in the affirmative and said that the abatement was terminated by the commission in and a memorandum agreement reflects that termination brown asked if they are essentially paying back the first amendment and then being given another responded in the affirmative and stated that the commission has already wiped their slate clean said that the abatement was terminated and the city was refunded for the terms of that abatement which demonstrates an ability to pay when an abatement fails director said that the information did not come up in committee because the original tax abatement had already been dealt with by the commission and the developer agreed to pay back all that they had received in abatements he said that since it had been remedied they did not realize it needed to be addressed asked if the abatements have been paid back said that they will pay in two payments one due and the next one due next year asked what assurances they have that they will meet these thresholds said that they have the provisions and can terminate the abatement he said that there is an annual assessment of everyone who receives abatements asked what the harm will be if this is postponed sunshine manufacturing said that they cannot commence with the investment until they receive approval and they would appreciate moving forward he said that they are in negotiations with the landlord but they appreciate the councils desire to learn as much as possible and will comply with whatever they decide asked with the if this means there was no harm to the city or taxpayer said that once those payments are made then it will be as if there was no abatement from the beginning said that while the city not have lost any money on this they have not recovered any either he said that they have lost something more valuable than money and harm has been done through loss of public confidence in the procedure he said that there was no full disclosure and noncompliance with prior abatements is relevant testimony and should have been shared said that the matter went before the commission there was a public hearing the took effect and an agreement was worked out and signed and therefore the process was followed said that with such a tight schedule they should be more forthcoming about past performance and they should send a message that if developers are not forthcoming with past failures their be in jeopardy he asked if of current employees are outside of county responded in the affirmative miller said that it would be better to be upfront but he thought the plan presented was fine he asked if other projects were denied abatements because of granting this one responded in the negative added that the first project failed because of a business line that was not core to that company there is growth in the areas of the company identified for this project he said that they have a very strong business base and they want to be transparent if the council wants to further discussion even though it affects their they will welcome the opportunity for additional dialogue said that the total abatement requested is to create new jobs to support families and he feels this is well worth the abatement gray asked how many of these jobs will be created in the first year said that they anticipate new jobs by the end of and by the end of gray asked if there is a contract compliance person to make sure these goals are met said that they monitor all abatements gray asked if there are any minority hiring requirements said that he does not know but they are not construction jobs said that since the company has testified that it will probably not cost the creation of the proposed jobs he will support
