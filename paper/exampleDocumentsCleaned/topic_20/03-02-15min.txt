as amended oliver asked if united way was chosen as the administrator said that they have been and that is addressed in a later proposal oliver said that he would like to hear from them president lewis said that they can ask questions of united way representatives during the discussion on that proposal hunter said that the sign of a great community is one that invests in education prekindergarten education is shown to boost reading skills and is critical to future academic success he said that he agrees the state should be doing more as it is their responsibility ultimately but they cannot continue to stand by and do nothing he urged his colleagues to support and he thanked those donors in the community who have made great investments and commitment to this program said that it is true this is the job of the state but it is too important to just wave their hands in the air it does not solve every problem but it is a great start and they have the capacity to do it and therefore he believes they have the obligation to do it said that he agrees appropriate numbers are needed for police staffing but it is also important to look at public safety in a holistic manner and address it longterm as well he said that this program could help prevent problems instead of just solving them he supports the proposal and thanked deputy mayor for all his work on this initiative said that he is not sure how is tied to crime and does not know how they started up this road he said that he is still opposed to this proposal because his people want streets and sidewalks and street lights the council should not be in the business of and the voucher system that is said to help poor or minority children will end up going toward more he said that there is no way to prove it will do anything different and so he opposes the proposal miller said that studies show repeatedly that if a student is behind in the third grade they most likely will drop out and not succeed in life he said that all children need a level playing field so that they can succeed in life he thanked his late wife for making him put his son in preschool because at the time he thought it was glorified daycare however he believes this is fiscally prudent and a moral imperative said that ranks as one of the worst cities in the nation with regard to poverty he asked how this program will assist low income families and children said that they outlined the structure of the program in to insure that the neediest families in get served unfortunately they only have so much money to invest into this program but the program is designed to serve families at of the poverty level and is not concentrated in one part of the city but is dispersed widely said that has become poorer and poorer in the last years and of children live in poverty he said that consistent structured oversight is needed to make sure they are supporting the neediest families to put kids on a pathway to success said that he supports the proposal he chose not to vote in support of eliminating the homestead credit because it would hurt schools even though they are not in the business of education they need to provide some options clay said that this has been purported to be a crime prevention initiative but it is not it be a good program but it is not a crime prevention program right now the crime issue is so prevalent and if this passes tonight no one is going to feel safer in their home at the mall or grocery store or walking to their car he asked why is it they can find million to fund but cannot find money to help agencies that combat crime while this program might be it will not prevent crime and therefore he cannot support it said that she supports the concept of as she comes from a teaching family but this is the states responsibility not the she said that they have to draw the line at some point the state rolls out unfunded mandates all the time for the city to maintain and therefore she will have to oppose the proposal because it is the states responsibility said that she agrees that does great things to help kids succeed but public safety is the biggest problem right now she said that this is a pilot program that not even be sustainable neighborhoods have greater needs with city employees who have gone without raises for years they need to lobby state legislators to fund and not duplicate some services already provided by the state she said that if they want to fund a pilot program it should be geared toward unemployment as parents who have steady employment usually have kids who are more likely to succeed in education this city needs more public safety and infrastructure most said that as a former st grade teacher she was aware of children coming to her unprepared for first grade even some of those who attended she said that many did not have good did not interact well with other children and did not have a positive experience in school she said that they will not see results with this proposal tomorrow but they will see a difference in a year from now she said that a good start in school provides skills for better jobs in the future and she is glad to see them raising the bar with and not just providing a daycare or babysitting program said that they do not have enough money for everything they want to do but research shows the city has jobs but do not have educated citizens to fill those jobs kids who start out behind stay behind she said that to not do anything because they cannot do it all is not a good answer she said that education is longer lasting than sidewalks freeman said that saying this is not a issue is not really a good excuse as they just voted to spend money to hire officers who will not be on the street for a year he said that it is the right thing to do there are not many issues that come before this body where the private sector comes with money to invest willingly he said that his district needs more sidewalks than any other district but unless a child is they will need an education as an attorney he does not see nearly as many people with degrees and educations getting convicted and he sees the benefit of education luckily he can afford to send his kids to preschool but this will allow everyone that same opportunity oliver said that this proposal has been presented to fight crime but he does not see that he agrees early education is essential but who is this program targeting and how will it fight crime by providing preschool in zones heavily populated with crime and violence deputy mayor for education said that these areas have the highest percentage of children living in poverty and coincidentally also are high crime areas this program is intended to reach the neediest students possible said that will be getting a return for every dollar they invest and this is a phenomenal return on investment dollars said that if they want to plan for a year they plant rice if they want to plan for years they plant a tree if they want to plan for years they educate their children he urged his colleagues to do what is right for the young people of this city said that no one is arguing against the value of education but this is a state issue and the state does not even have mandatory kindergarten let alone it would be great if the city had excess funds for programs like this but they do not even have the funds to cover the services they are responsible for like sidewalks street lights sidewalks it does not make sense spending money on when there are so many other needs not being met that the city is required to fund asked how this will affect the fiscal stability fund and the credit rating brown council chief financial officer said that some of that fund has been used for and they were downgraded to after those funds were used he is not sure it is because of that expenditure or because standard poor was recalculating the way they rate cities across the country and was not bringing in enough revenue for expenditures he said that they remain rated in the other two major credit agencies he said that it could hurt their credit rating but they just raised revenues due to the and expanding the district so those will also be factored in he said that he does not think it will affect the credit rating in the next five years said that he is fortunate to be able to take his child to one of the best in the city because he has a good job and can afford it it is a privilege he has however it should not be a privilege it should be a right for all he said that they need to support their kids having a pathway to success this is something they will look back on in five years and say they did the right thing supporting needy families and kids strand executive director of city mosaic a partnership of churches in the city said that they are committed to mobilizing the community to help address the issues of those living in poverty he said that they should not wait a year longer to give kids an opportunity for success and the urban midtown areas desperately need this crystal citizen said that she is tired of ducking and dodging potholes crime starts with teenagers and they need to find programs to target them instead she said that she would prefer this money go to roads and junior high programs citizen said that she came here from for a new start for her kids but could not find many good options for she said that she is educated and has a job but is still poor and if she had to place bets on anything in her life it would be on her kids she said that this city has not created a better infrastructure in the seven years shes been been here and she does not want to wait around another seven years she said that it is disappointing to see members not supporting this initiative to give kids a chance she said that they should give this money to the kids because they will figure it out and give all of them a better future there being no further testimony moved

administration already does today this bill of rights is an attempt to define rights for everyone he urged his colleagues to find a way to help combat homelessness with their time talents and resources however they can he said that there are a lot of good organizations out there to give the homeless not just a handout but a hand up hunter said that the definition for camp is completely broad in this proposal and the city is defined as the department of public safety in one area but referred to as public works in another this is poorly written and he cannot track everything that it

vote the committee reported the said that there have been many denied jobs simply because they have no place to call home and live on the street and this should not be happening said that most of the equal opportunity protections are with regard to attributes a person is born with and more inherent to the individual with the exception of military service which in the case of a draft would be mandatory the others have to do with religion which can also be inherent because if a persons mother is the child is considered automatically she said that this provision is not inherent and involves a long set of circumstances it is not really about being homeless but is based on appearance this kind of discrimination can happen with any person who is not dressed properly or who looks a little different but this is not really a protected class she said that it is a slippery slope to head down this road and she fears to approve this proposal would end up in litigation said that all people
