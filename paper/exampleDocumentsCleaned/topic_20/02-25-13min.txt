they are still waiting on tax credits for the design phase asked if this means there are no time constraints attorney for the petitioner said that they would not meet all the requirements to get those tax credits which will be awarded at the end of this week if this zoning is not approved asked if these tax credits are being awarded for the purpose of providing affordable housing responded in the affirmative miller said that he has been emailing the petitioner all day and this is the first he has heard of this said that this was made clear in many previous meetings miller said that his neighborhood is firmly against the project and he wishes he had known of this time constraint earlier today asked if they do set this rezoning case for a public hearing there could be further discussion and depending on the outcome it could be a situation for everyone with the petitioner applying next year for credits miller said that the goal is to get the neighborhood together for a he said that they asked for this at the metropolitan development commission and it was postponed and then did not take place this call for a public hearing is a way to make that occur he said that his hope is that they will not have to hear this matter on the council floor and it will be solved before it reaches that point said that this is an opportunity to bring both parties together and reach a compromise asked if there is only one opportunity to submit an application for tax credits said that the application deadline was in and the credits are awarded asked if it is impossible for the petitioner to receive credits without this zoning approval said that this is correct said that he cannot speak to the entire project but he is distressed that there is no lack of luxury apartments downtown but yet an opportunity for affordable housing in the mile square has to be postponed for a year he said that there are many high density luxury apartments in proximity to this project yet the neighbors did not oppose those developments he said that they need to start thinking of developing downtown amenities that are available to every citizen and not only those of financial means he said that in deference to the process with this case having gone through meetings and the time sensitiveness he cannot support a public hearing because there have been no citizens reaching out to him about this project he said that the process has taken its course and they should err on the side of caution with faith in the process that this project has been properly vetted miller said that it is his idea do have the parties meet and resolve this matter before a public hearing he added that this neighborhood already has three affordable housing projects and they would love a fourth asked what the concerns are from the neighborhood miller said that density is their biggest concern as the comprehensive plan calls for medium density residential or a mix of residential and commercial he said that tried to meet with the petitioners but they refused he said that this project proposes too many units on too small a space another developer owns the parking lot behind the property and another development could come in causing even more density he said that otherwise the project is a beautiful design asked the petitioner why they refused to meet with residents said that they have had a number of meetings with neighbors over the last six months including a meeting with the historic preservation commission at the hearing a continuance was requested because of the asking for reduced density from units to units they came back two weeks later and each side stated their case as to why lower density could or could not work before the and the voted to approve the rezoning asked what the neighborhood wants said that they want units instead of he said that across the street are three luxury apartment projects at their same level of density or more the project was submitted to the mayors office the department of metropolitan development and went before the at first the project had the neighbors support until late in the approval stage when a group came out against the project asked if the other luxury apartment projects have the same density said that they have the same or more with having the highest density asked if they have compared density with actual footage said that they have taken a site footprint considering the number of units square footage underground or surface parking all of these developments have more total units on their sites than they are proposing hunter called for a point of order and said that the discussion should relate to the procedure of calling this rezoning down for a public hearing having a debate on the matter here on the floor with no time limits being adhered to gives one side an unfair advantage as it relates to a public hearing general counsel agreed and said that it requires a majority vote to schedule the matter for public hearing and they should not be debating on the merits of the project in case there is a hearing said that he does not disagree with those comments but a concern was raised as to a hardship on the petitioner if is a delay the reason for this testimony is to find out whether or not this project could proceed or would be delayed for a year they have to be mindful in voting that if they do not approve this rezoning this evening the petitioners would automatically lose proposal no was scheduled for public hearing on on the following roll yeas freeman gray hunter miller scales nays lewis
