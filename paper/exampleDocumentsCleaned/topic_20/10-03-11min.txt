easiest of circumstances and these new charters will triple the amount of students who have access to this opportunity he encouraged his colleagues to support the proposals oliver asked where the new charters are located said that they will most likely be located somewhere in the meadows neighborhood he said that there are no specific locations yet and end up building new structures he said that they cannot make those decisions until they have the charter in hand oliver said that when charters are being relocated around other schools it is important to inform the neighbors he said that administrators come into an area and do not inform the neighborhood associations with their intentions he moved to return the proposal to committee until the neighborhood can have some input lewis seconded the motion scales said that the current charter of this entity is in her district and she would prefer they move forward with this and embrace these new projects as this entity has an impeccable history and record with excellent results she said that she supports their mission and while she sympathizes that there be some hurt feelings on the part of some neighbors she has to trust

realizes there is some consternation about the movement of charters throughout the community but he believes is not one of the charters most are concerned about he said that is very connected to the community and if they did not embrace them they would not be there he said that this is the reason there is more demand than they have spaces to accommodate and the reason for these additional charter applications brown applauded for the job he and his staff has done he asked to continue dialogue with oliver and the concerned community groups about proposed locations said that more than just dialogue they hope to continue partnerships in working with the neighbors as they always have he said that they believe these charters belong to the neighborhood and hope what they do will spur growth and further said that she would like to see these projects instead of postponed and she cannot support the motion said that while he understands concerns he knows this school to be an outreach school and very involved in their community and he would encourage the council to move forward with approval gray said that in light of some issues maybe can commit to getting together with oliver and some of the neighbors this week to iron out their differences said that he would love to process any concerns and commits to doing whatever he can to help them feel comfortable with these endeavors oliver
