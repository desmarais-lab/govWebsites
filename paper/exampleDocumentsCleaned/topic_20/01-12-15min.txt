and is paid per piece of business the other subcontractor included in his contract portion is based on a percentage asked what the contract has paid for the last couple of years said that he cannot say for sure without looking at his records oliver asked if this would not be a matter for the ethics committee said that is asking that the council vote on this and it is no different than the disclosure of a contract asked the council to vote on at the last meeting for one of his family members said that this is simply a new requirement due to a new state law and he is complying with the
