asked the dollar amount being spent in administrative costs chairman of the board of directors for the arts council of stated that will go to administrative costs asked if any of the board members approving these grants serve on other art institution boards said that there are about four or five members that serve on other boards but they do not weigh in on these matters and recuse themselves from voting on approval for those organizations on whose boards they serve there are board members total scales said that some of these organizations are quite successful in their efforts and she asked why the city is giving more tax dollars to the organizations that seem to be flush with cash and revenue in these difficult times said that there are no arts organizations that are truly flush with cash in this economic time he said that all arts organizations are faced with reduced contributions and even those with endowments are seeing tremendous cuts he added that attendance at art venues has also decreased and every dollar these entities can get is vitally important to the health of each of these organizations scales said that in comparison to what every family and business is experiencing at this time in this economic climate it seems some of these organizations are in better shape than other organizations and have a group of donors in the community who have the ability to donate to their cause said that it is important for a healthy city to have arts organizations of all shapes and sizes big and small to provide community outreach programs scales said that she appreciates these organizations contributions but in this difficult time feels the city needs to take extra care in prioritizing their needs and said that in times like these it is important to recognize the economic development that the arts bring to to attract businesses and improve the quality of life she said that this is just a fraction of the budget and is a good use of funds to help keep a vibrant downtown she said that this also shows other donors that the city is supportive and the funding will encourage more donations stated that these are public tax dollars and the arts council and all of organizations are private organizations he said that there are thousands of small private businesses that are not asking the city to fund their operations with tax dollars and he asked why these organizations are asking the administration to help fund their operations said that arts help to improve the public safety of a community and offer an educational component hunter stated that what the arts do for economic development in is very vital and even board members are expected to contribute to the organizations financially for which boards they serve he said that the city needs to show some commitment to support the arts as well and he supports the proposal stated that these are tough economic times but all parts need to be working together for the health of the community he said that arts do not just affect downtown such as in pike township with the museum of art and hall by butler university but it provides the citizenry with an overall rounding of personalities arts help shape the vision of the city and what folks around the world think of and helps with economic development and quality of life to attract new businesses said that one of the greatest frustrations of this body is that it has no jurisdiction over the schools funding these types of activities allows the council to have input in making sure children who cannot afford specialized training or education they cannot get through the schools have access to these opportunities he said that he supports the proposal commended the arts organizations for already taking steps to tighten up operations and making hard decisions like laying off staff because of the loss of endowment money as well as public dollars she said that the city has not had to make some of these tough decisions yet in their own departments she added that many in the business community continue to support arts organizations in these difficult times because they believe they are critical to the quality of life in the community and the city could learn from the example of the business said that the arts council has been very and has been on the for many years and continues to be forthright about what it does for the community he said that the arts affect the entire county not just one area and he appreciates all these organizations do for the community brown thanked the arts organizations for all their good work and said that the democrats supported arts a couple of years ago when the republicans did not and now through education efforts the republicans are recognizing the worth of the arts he commended for supporting the arts funding even though she did not support funding free lunches for poor kids earlier said that kids who are engaged in the arts and other extracurricular activities are found to do better in academic areas as well he said that budget cuts are usually made in the arts but without support for arts programs in the inner city many kids would not experience these gray said that it is good to see his colleagues from the other side of the aisle finally supporting the arts day moved seconded by for adoption proposal no was yeas brown

solicitation at intersections by a vote the stated that the current panhandling ordinance already prohibits panhandling in roadways and with traffic she said that this ordinance would prohibit people standing passively outside a business establishment on the corner holding a sign to advertise she said that this is unconstitutional and conflicts with state statute she added that if citizens do see someone distributing materials or soliciting money in the streets they should call the police as this is already prohibited by current law she added that there is obviously an enforcement issue with the current ordinance and therefore making it stricter will not solve that problem brown asked if there is a current panhandling ordinance on the books said that there is brown asked how many violations have been cited since said that he asked for that information and was told the outlying districts do not keep record of those violations brown asked plowman if he could testify to the amount of violations plowman said that he does not work in the records division and records are kept by officer on those types of offenses brown said that this body spent a lot of time on the ordinance and met with many groups including the nation of he asked if has met with such organizations said that he has seen representatives from such organizations stand in the medians of the street and enter the street to interact with occupants of a vehicle and this is a public safety issue and should not be allowed he said that since he introduced the proposal he has had numerous calls in support of the effort brown asked if the metropolitan police department asked to introduce this ordinance said that they did not and he felt the need was there and offered it himself said that state statute prohibits panhandling but not passively standing with a sign he said that local law cannot overrule that statute and panhandling is a form of free speech he said that solicitations and panhandling disturbs him also when individuals get in his face but this proposal is taking it too far in limiting free speech such as with a recent incident where a public safety officer told a youth ministry group at the black expo that they could not talk about said that she respects views but this ordinance does not limit free speech it simply stipulates where free speech can be done without becoming a public safety hazard she said that it is against the law to yell fire in a because of public safety issues and this is no different she said that a foot zone still allows a person to stand away from the traffic and practice free speech safe from a hazard zone said that after talking to some of her constituents she supports the proposal because the practice is disturbing distracting and dangerous and often children are involved and used to actually solicit in the middle of the street she said that she has heard that on some corners and intersections a panhandler can make up to a day but they need to protect the children and those driving so that no one has to live with the guilt of seriously or fatally injuring another individual just for a few dollars said that if officials start legislating away every single thing that annoys them one day they will find that city government will be legislated away said that the examples that have been cited so far are already against the current ordinance going into the street and knocking on a car window is already prohibited and the foot language will not solve the enforcement problem she said that it will however prohibit an individual from standing peaceably and on a sidewalk with a sign brown asked how individuals could solicit money from feet away when most cannot even read a sign from that distance said that this language gives another weapon in their to keep people from obstructing traffic and causing safety hazards hunter said that by law it is a criminal misdemeanor to stop people in the middle of a roadway this proposal prohibits people from standing in the street along the sides of the street and causing hazards and further obstruction he said that it is not unconstitutional currently a police officer would have to lock up a person standing in the street impeding traffic and this would give the police another tool and give citizens a warning before an arrest he said that this in no way flies in the face of the code and instead moves people out of potentially harmful situations brown said that there are already tools in place and police can give citations to people already for blocking traffic and since is not pushing the ordinance he does not see how it affects public safety hunter said that as the elected body if this council only did what was pushed by the administration then they would not be doing their job he said that this is a hollow argument as brown has brought forth many such proposals not being pushed by the administration he said that this will give police officers more tools for a community policing approach and it has been proven that moving window washers out of the streets in new has reduced crime said that he has serious concerns about this being unconstitutional and limiting free speech he said that in many intersections traffic is backed up feet and this would be out of the and people have a constitutional right to stand on the sidewalk next to an intersection said that does not have the manpower for speed reductions and to enforce the current ordinance and he does not know how making it stricter will help that situation he said that many poll workers and campaigners have to stand feet away from a polling location on one day a year and this is regularly disputed so he does not know how this random distance will be enforced the other days a year said that she also has some frustration about the behavior in the community of panhandlers especially at two intersections in her district however she said that she has not had discussions with public safety officials and there be some unintended consequences of this proposal she moved seconded by to return proposal no to committee said that the proposal has already been thoroughly vetted in committee and he does not see any valid reason to send it back encouraged her fellow to vote to return the proposal to committee she said that she would like to have come before the committee to speak to this proposal with regard to enforcement statistics and the areas where it is needed most she said that it would be a waste of time to pass if it could not be enforced oliver said that he was disappointed in the amendments made in committee president said that the discussion at this time is only with regard to the motion to return the proposal to committee oliver said that he would like to see it returned to committee in order to further help those who cannot help themselves yeas brown lewis oliver nays day gray hunter plowman scales smith absent sanders speedy oliver said that he was disappointed in the form of the proposal and how it targets the poor simply because people do not want to see them standing by the roadside holding up a sign he said that this is targeting a group of people and condemning the poor attacking those asking for help and a handout he said that instead of helping them the administration wants to give them a citation and fine them and it is wrong that this body is even considering this action smith said that he has through many neighborhoods and there is a very diverse mixture of people out there with signs panhandling and some of them are actually raising enormous amounts of cash daily he said that there are legitimate programs around the county to help those who are truly in need but this is a public safety issue when drivers cannot tell between who legitimately is in need of help and who might be preying on them to carjack or cause them harm he said that this ordinance not be the perfect solution but they need to solve some of these problems instead of acting passively he said that there are many organizations and churches helping those in need but there are some standards that need to be set and this council needs to give public safety officials all the tools they can in their arsenal to fight crime and ensure the safety of the public said that she is disappointed that this discussion has become about targeting a specific group of people as she would not be in favor of such legislation she supports the ordinance because it is truly about keeping the public safe agreed and said that this ordinance is all about making the streets safer and has nothing to do with restricting free speech moved seconded by for adoption the motion failed on the following indecisive roll call vote viz yeas day hunter
