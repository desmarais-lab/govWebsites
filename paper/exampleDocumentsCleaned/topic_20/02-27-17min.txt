as authorized by the voters approval of a local public question on by a vote the committee reported the proposal to the council with the recommendation that it do pass as moved seconded by clay to postpone proposal no until the council meeting asked his colleagues to oppose the motion and support passage this evening the motion to postpone failed on the following roll call vote viz yeas clay coats gray oliver scales nays fanning lewis miller ray clay stated that against what he believes to be a orchestration of support for this tax increase is the nearly undetected voices of residents of this fair city who cannot be heard above the clamor of those who seek to profit the most from this proposal he added that even more painful is that there are those in the community who have been convinced by distorted messaging that they will be the immediate beneficiaries of a better and more frequent bus service he said that there can be different opinions but there cannot be different facts first of all this tax increase is not going away once it is enacted it is here to stay the areas in the city with the highest unemployment rate and the greatest density of need have once again been relegated to a later design and a later time clay added that there is a bond issuance that will need to be considered to make this project a reality this tax levy must be viewed against the backdrop of other looming tax considerations that are surely to come from the state with respect to cigarettes and roads and from utilities by the time the effect of this increase hits the mailboxes of citizens the people will be disappointed by yet another tax levied by this council he read a letter received from a widow living on a fixed income who is concerned about this increase as she can barely afford anything additional after paying her bills and purchasing her medicine and groceries clay said that he will be voting against this proposal for those voices that cannot be heard over the orchestrated symphony of those voices rounded up to support this action said that he is still waiting for some answers to questions that he had raised especially with regard to the requirement of a match in private dollars he asked if there will be consequences if this requirement is not met and where the money will come from to make up the difference he asked how it will affect budget if they have to make up that difference mike terry president of stated that this has been a very healthy deliberative discussion and process and he thanked the council for providing the platform for that he said that the board is already working to create a foundation which will work toward raising funds to assist in the budget going forward there is a matching contribution of private dollars required by statute and the fiscal plans they submitted were deliberately conservative and did not take those matching dollars into consideration he said that any shortfalls would come from existing revenue sources that has available and not from additional requests asked what would happen if they have to fill that gap terry said that they would build a financial plan into future budgets which the council would have to approve each year miller said that he realizes there is a risk involved if they do not get the million federal grant or fulfill the ridership models this plan assumes he said that he also understands the concerns of those who do not like the plans along college avenue however the bottom line is that the cost of doing nothing is far greater than the risk of doing something the transit system needs help and they need to do something an improved transit system will create a climate of inclusive growth where everyone has a chance to succeed it will not fix the poverty issue but getting people to the workplace is critical in addressing poverty he said that they have waited years for this to happen and he fully supports proposal no scales said that an option was offered this evening to provide an alternative to doing nothing a motion was made to postpone the proposal so that they could tweak the plan and come up with something that prioritized those who are most in this community and reconsider the should they have to proceed without the small starts grant she said that she has wanted a more efficient transit system for a long time but the focus for her has always been on those who were whose lives would be affected the most who faced greater transit challenges and whose transportation needs were greatest those are the people who should be the priority in any transit plan for this city and a postponement could have allowed them to work toward that she said that a few years ago they realized that there were major problems with the proposed criminal justice complex as well as some financial challenges that needed to be looked at more closely even though a lot of work had already been put into that plan they put the brakes on the process and decided to go back and look at it more closely they were wise in that decision and because of it she believes they will have the opportunity to vote on a much better proposal coming in the next few months due to that further consideration she said that there is no harm in waiting and looking at this more closely and taking the time to craft something that really addresses the needs of those who are most reliant on public transportation if they pass the proposal this evening they have no opportunity to consider some changes that could be for some in the community who need the most help said that they have the opportunity this evening to do something for this city this would be a vote for economic competitiveness to give employees access to jobs employers access to an adequate workforce and this city the ability to retain exceptional talent this is also a vote for seniors who do not have to worry about growing more isolated as they age and for those with disabilities in order to make this city a more accessible community he said that it is a vote to stand with the majority of this city who asked them last to support this initiative he said that has provided an adequate plan to make this work with or without federal funds he said that they do not need to tell this council what their priorities should be for their city he said that it is time to move this city forward and transit is a key component of that progress and he will join in supporting this proposal oliver said that early on in this process he held a joint forum with fanning and then also held a subsequent forum where he was asked at that point where he stood and how he would vote on this issue he said that he would go with the will of the people in his district unless something new came up that was not disclosed previously he said that his constituents voted to support the referendum but he did vote in favor this evening of postponement to get some answers he felt were important he asked if the increase to fund the purple and blue lines will be used to fund the red line instead if the federal grant does not come to fruition director of public affairs stated that the revenue from the tax increase can be used to build out the red blue and purple lines and the rest of the system and plan he said that with or without those funds they can accomplish the entire plan oliver asked how it will change the schedule however if there are no federal funds said that it would delay the red line one year and would result in a delay on the rest of the plan with a target of complete by oliver asked if this would change the fare structure said that the fare structure is still being evaluated fanning said that this plan has been in the works for more than a decade and this is about job connectivity and connecting neighborhoods she said that this is necessary for those on the lower end of the income scale while construction be challenging to some of the neighborhood businesses along college avenue during this process she would ask those in favor of improved transit to support those businesses during that time she said that she is still trying to get her head around the federal funding issue but congresswoman brooks and congressman have made it clear they will support the funding and do all they can to make it happen which has helped her to remain cautiously optimistic she said that her district overwhelmingly supported the referendum and she will trust in their ability to make that decision and support the proposal as well since they are the same people who voted her into office said that he had a former employee who relied on the bus system to get to and from work because of the timing of the bus routes that individual had to leave much earlier than most in order to arrive early to work and then had to leave work early in order to catch the last bus home he said that this plan will take the transit into the future and it will be a positive thing for this city said that he would like to hear those districts where the favorable percentage votes were highest in support of the referendum mark fisher chamber stated that those in the districts of fanning scales coats gray lewis oliver clay miller and voted in support of the referendum and the remaining districts did not support the referendum stated that he will be voting against this proposal he said that this will greatly affect his district along college avenue and he received an email from the businesses along that corridor who are very disappointed that college avenue will be torn up during this process he said that they are already scarce on parking for their customers and employees and this will further exacerbate the problem and hurt their business even though they all pay property taxes he said that he wishes everyone would stop saying how much this plan will help poor people because this room is filled with people in support of the plan who do not fit into that description and those who will be most affected did not get the email to come out and voice their opinion if is going to borrow money through a bond issuance and will be using this tax to pay it back for over years terry said that bonding is built into the financing plan asked how much the bond will be for and the length of the bond terry said that depending on federal dollars it would be between to million and would not be longer than years said that bonding for to million to make this plan work does not sound like people are getting the great deal they think they are said that she has stayed relatively quiet on this issue even though her district voted in favor of the referendum she said that in answer to clays concerns about the seniors in his district if these are retired individuals they would not be paying this tax increase as it will be paid by people who are working she said that a packed house this evening shows what an engaged committed group of people can do and she wants to make it clear that a vote in favor tonight is not the end of it once the vote happens tonight the council needs to continue to monitor what happens with this plan going forward to make it the best it can be for all constituents said that the current transit system is woefully underfunded and he said that there is a horrific poverty level in this city and connecting people to workplaces will aid in addressing that problem he added that during the election process he out near the bus stop on capitol avenue to register voters and almost all of them noted the lack of adequate transit in the city as a barrier to them having a better quality of life he said that this became a driving force for his election campaign he said that his district voted in favor of the referendum and he supports the transit plan clay said that he appreciates observations about how this will affect his constituent but he believes those who contacted him can best judge whether or not they will be affected by this increase he said that the problem is that it has been touted that this will result in better and more frequent service but with this plan the people who need it most will not get it first and the people who do not want it are having it forced on them he said that he is not against mass transit but the story that and its supporters tell at each presentation continues to morph and change and this plan will not mean any real change in bus service any time soon for those who need it most he said that he supported the motion to postpone the proposal to review this plan more thoroughly and could have possibly supported it with changes but he cannot support it as it stands now said that this is not only about bus service the frequency of rides and the number of buses she said that serious improvement is needed for the open door service and she asked if that will be expanded she asked if there will be better bus shelters put in place as most stops have no shelter no benches no adequate lighting no trash bins etc she asked if the plan includes putting more sidewalks around the bus stops so that people can walk to the bus stops safely she said that there are residents walking down the middle of girls school road to get to the bus because there are no sidewalks terry said that the open service is an extremely important and vital service and will continue to grow and expand as needed as the issue of accessibility is very important he added that all fixed route vehicles are now accessible vehicles he said that they are working closely with the department of public works regarding sidewalks and the department is taking concerns into account in prioritizing projects he said that they have implemented an program and there will definitely be new shelters he added that these are all important things that they will address as they expand the system said that several years ago this city had one of the most robust transit systems in the country but they are now at the bottom and sorely in need of an investment in transit he said that multiple transfers long wait times and ride times to and from work all affect the quality of life for those who rely on mass transit he said that at every committee meeting the overwhelming response was that the citizens of this city want this if they want the city to grow they have to invest in transit he said that of his district voted in favor of the referendum and like fanning he will trust that they know what they were voting for since they supported his election he said that there are elderly in his community who want to get out and about and seeing them stand outside for minutes waiting for a bus is not something he can bear he said that he is sure there will be some hiccups as there are whenever anyone takes on a big task but that always happens with growth and he will be supporting the proposal said that she has had a lot of heartburn over this proposal as there have been multiple fact changes and she does
