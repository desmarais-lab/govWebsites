shared the following remarks president lewis vice president leaders gray and let me begin this evening by thanking you for the opportunity to come before this body to present the proposed budget for eight months ago i asked all of you for your help in tackling the major challenges that plague our city and i come before you tonight to thank this council for answering that call with your help we are attacking the root causes of violence in with your help we have begun demolishing more blighted homes in seven months than in the previous two years with your help we ended a year moratorium and began installing new streetlights in neighborhoods and with your help we have launched the reform of our criminal justice system pledging that we will not simply focus on constructing a bigger building but that we will build a better system for keeping our kids out of jail altogether these things that we have done we have done together passing real change with and and sometimes or more votes you have shown time and again that there is no divisive barrier before us that cannot be surpassed by those things that draw us together so it is in that spirit that i come before you tonight to discuss perhaps the greatest barrier of all that stands before us on the path of progress our financial health the facts are clear and undeniable in the decade since our state enacted property tax caps has consistently operated under a structural deficit in which our expenses have outpaced our revenues to cope prior administrations sought creative ways to ensure that could continue to grow even as we spent more than we could afford our water company and parking meters were sold bringing in hundreds of millions to fill the gap the public was twice asked to shoulder an additional tax burden for our public safety efforts and in recent years our reserves were tapped to ensure a budget whether you agreed or disagreed with any or all of these items they were never anything more than fixes to a longterm problem ladies and gentlemen of the council tonight i present a proposed budget that does several important things first this budget does something unheard of in government today it proposes spending less money than the year before second this budget dramatically reduces our structural deficit to million dollars effectively cutting in half the longterm fiscal challenge i set before you some eight months ago third this budget also reduces our dependence on reserves by nearly million dollars compared to last year restoring the fiscal stability fund to more than million dollars and preserving nearly million dollars in the rainy day fund but this budget just about reducing spending its also about ensuring that we are still able to do more with less on behalf of the taxpayers thats why this budget funds two recruit classes hiring new officers next year a net gain of beat officers participating in our new community policing model thats why this budget includes funding of our newly created office of public health and safety which will dedicate itself to addressing food insecurity and the need for reentry services thats why this budget includes the engagement center which will save taxpayers money by ensuring that we just incarcerating those suffering from substance abuse and addictions over and over again thats why this budget moves our parks capital and maintenance funding out of the department of public works and back where it belongs in the parks budget where we will invest million dollars more than last year to continue to strengthen our parks and thats why our capital investment plan submitted with this budget will propose million dollars in infrastructure spending over the next four years this plan will fix roads and build sidewalks while also investing in the transportation infrastructure of the future with improved and but there are more steps to take before we ensure our fiscal stability thats why tonight i am announcing that our administration will propose the reform of our pension plans for all new city employees starting next year simplifying benefits for the next generation of public servants while saving taxpayers millions a year starting in but we stopping there tonight i am also announcing that beyond the budget submitted to you my administration will be launching an effort to smart size city government over the next calendar year were going to be taking a hard look at the executive branch examining all city departments and services to see where efficiencies can be found and bureaucracy can be cut i know that for some there is a solution to our fiscal challenges raise taxes first ask questions later in fact had many people suggest to me that eliminating waste and inefficiency has become just a trite political phrase void of meaning void of purpose void of reality i stand here tonight to say that they are wrong thats taking the easy way out and that what this administration stands for it wont be easy but together we can restore faith in city government i know we can do this together because we have done it before we have made hard choices in the past and there will be more to make in the future we have a responsibility that requires us to look beyond today to look beyond ourselves to ensure that the city that we pass to our children is not burdened with the prospect of insolvency president lewis leaders gray and members of the in submitting this budget i discharge a fundamental duty of my office it is a budget that spends less than the one before it it is a budget that cuts this structural deficit in half it is a budget that makes fiscal responsibility a fiscal reality it is a budget impartial to the expediency of political pandering by simply spending more i now offer it to you let us keep the faith with the great people we have been elected to serve i thank you proposal no the proposal sponsored by and ray recognizes grassy creek elementary robotics team read the
