the total year period of the exemption asked what the prior abatement amount was that was granted to inc said that he is not sure asked if it was similar to this said that it would have been somewhat proportionate said that they just considered a proposal to study increasing residential property tax bills in a time when the budget is tight and they cannot afford to hire more police officers yet proposals like these hand out millions of dollars with complete total tax forgiveness when revenues are so scarce he said that there is already a tax increment financing district downtown and therefore an already heavy tax burden he asked his colleagues not to support the proposal miller asked how many jobs this proposal will bring or maintain and said if this does not occur exact target could take their dollars and investment anywhere where deals might even be better said that they created jobs with their last project and propose jobs will be retained and new jobs created with this project said that exact target has their world headquarters downtown with employees and they have invested in this city and are committed to staying downtown she said that this investment is sure to garner even more and they will hire up to employees this year alone keeping downtown viable said that they are committed to bringing new jobs to county at an average salary of an hour this will help to stimulate the economy and the abatement does not exist because property taxes on this do not exist yet with the abatement they are essentially shoring up more tax revenue for the future asked if there is a in the agreement if commitments are not met responded in the affirmative and said that the abatement could be terminated or repayment demanded if they fail to retain or produce the jobs or make the investments promised said that they will either get jobs or their money back so it seems like a situation to her asked if exact target reached their goals in the previous abatement said that they reached their goals quicker than projected and exceeded their goal of jobs with jobs at an average of per year brown asked how many of those workers are county residents said that over half live in county brown asked how many of the county workers are making the higher amounts if the total jobs average out at an hour said that he does not have that data with him but there is not a big spread in the employment ranges brown asked how much it would cost to move their company said that it is not a matter of moving because they want to continue to make investments in downtown asked how people can go about applying for these jobs said that he can get the information to the council said that the government is run by property tax and income taxes the testimony has been that half of these jobs will not pay income tax in county that means some will live in property whose taxes do not support the infrastructure downtown he said that it is nice to say so many jobs were created but they need to hold these businesses feet to the fire he said that they have already partnered with them and now as long as they are here they will want the city to invest in them every time they want to create another job he said that this is not sustainable and he strongly opposes the proposal said that the ratios of gain versus cost were talked about in committee and asked what the cost is versus the gain in income tax even with only of these new employees contributing in county said that he does not have those numbers said that he thinks it was for every dollar they give up they gain said that she is torn about abatements but being realistic they are spending about per employee hunter said that the study has nothing to do with this proposal and has offered legislation for many bipartisan study commissions he said that it is a good thing and sometimes there is a fine balance when competing with the region for stated that exact target is scattered all around downtown and in many historic buildings keeping certain areas strong they could move to other areas where there is more engineering talent there are other tangibles at play because the feedback is that they are attracting talent from the cost and keeping graduates from and university in when they might otherwise go elsewhere agreed and said that the technical community is beating up the city all the time for not protecting these technical companies in a very competitive environment he said that just this evening they honored young technical minds at arsenal tech high school the reading rock stars and through catchings foundation he said that they need to bring jobs to to keep the brains from going elsewhere gray asked what happens when they give up all their tax dollars and the streets deteriorate and everyone moves out to county he said that this could happen if they continue to give away tax dollars asked what meant when she said it was costing them per taxpayer said that it was costing them for each employee based on employees oliver asked if they will no longer pay taxes downtown said that they will continue to pay taxes downtown and the abatement is just for the additional investment he said that the estimated value in the new investment is million he added that of current employees are county residents oliver said that he does not support the said that the total projected is per year and the investment is million with the result of in assessed value in the first year of during the abatement they will pay annually on their existing property and then annually after the abatement expires
