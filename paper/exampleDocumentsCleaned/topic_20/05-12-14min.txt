only addresses about of the damage from the heavy winter and there is much more that is not being addressed and he hopes they can address this in the near future with some upcoming initiatives citizen stated that inspectors and engineers are using a mix of asphalt and chemicals to patch potholes and there is no use in giving them this money when the life expectancy of what they are putting down is only two months he said that the state requirements are for materials that last years but these fixes are lasting two months in his community he said that before spending more money they need to get the engineers together to come up with material that will last longer than three months said that made the representation that this money will only meet of the needs yet it is only of the handout given to the pacers he said that this shows the priorities of this administration toward the community tonight they took the time to recognize for tourism month yet they need to focus on residents and not tourists and make every other month a give services to citizens month resident of the community said that her neighborhood was skipped over in the list of project originally she added that she saw workers filling one hole and skipping the next just today and when she asked why they were not filling all the holes they answered that this is what they were told to do she said that resurfacing is needed not temporary fills for every other pothole she said that people drive through to bypass the interstate and this takes its toll on their residential roads she said that she has a petition from neighbors to show the council they are fed up brown said that ms did appear before the committee and her points were well taken he said that the original proposal was delayed so that the department of public works could restructure their list and address some of the concerns from neighborhoods that were originally left off the list said that she is not an engineer but when contracts are let the contractor normally has to put up a bond and if the streets are really degrading that fast then the bond should be visited and there needs to be a redress in place she said that there is hardly a day that goes by when she does not receive a request for pothole repairs or resurfacing she said that there was a prior proposal for a million bond to leverage an additional million in federal government funds which was not even granted a hearing in committee however this would have gone a long way to address these vital needs said that the council votes to give money to but does not choose the streets or potholes to be repaired she said that they are all feeling the pain in every part of the city and she hopes will spend these funds on the projects they have recognized before the committee unfortunately they have seen money in the past spent on frivolous things that could have been used for streets and potholes she said that there was talk about postponing this proposal due to a recent traffic death and the thought that a pothole might have contributed to it unfortunately it will still take some time as every pothole cannot be done tomorrow and they need to act as quickly as they can miller said that it is critically important that citizens report poor road work immediately to the mayors action center mac he said that his neighborhood reported handicapped ramps that were not up to grade and it was addressed and fixed he said that when these jobs are done right they do last and if it is a matter of workmanship then it needs to be reported he asked his colleagues to support the proposal brown said that a engineer testified to the committee that the standard is to last for to years not years as the bond proposal would have them paying for he said that they are still moving forward with more funds being introduced this evening to address the roads due to a harsh winter said that he understands the revision of the original list but this million was removed from the budget last year as part of the money and was told they could come back and ask for a reinstatement the first quarter he said that the original proposal was to pave million of the worst streets and roads identified through a systematic grading process of thoroughfares and residential streets this list targeted the worst streets and the most streets including east street from southeastern to which is falling apart he said that the proposal was tabled and then reappeared with political changes and a list that was given to based on preferences he said that he voted against the proposal in committee because he cannot vote for political influences dictating where funds get spent he said that all of the roads need dramatic improvements and million will only go so far but the original list was based on a scientific grading and rating system instead the committee leadership decided to interject politics he said that he is sympathetic to the community as he grew up there but they need to look at the bigger picture and should not be handpicking roads to surface based on politics oliver thanked ms for her comments and said that it was politics that kept his district from receiving any of these dollars he said that he was told there was a grading system and the worst streets were addressed first but he cannot understand why there was then zero appropriations for his district he thanked brown and gray for helping to insure some adjustments were made he said that judgments are made repeatedly to omit certain neighborhoods and he appreciates that amendments were made so that his district was not left out he said that he hopes the administration follows through to use the money as promised scales said she recently did a with an metropolitan police department officer through the lower part of her district and district which borders hers she said that they were repeatedly stopped by individuals asking the patrol to urge the administration to fix their roads the officers took her to areas where cars had been damaged and she observed firsthand many needs in the area she said that there is no way zero dollars should have been allocated to this neighborhood that has been ignored for far too long said that on mayor introduced his first presentation at a boys and girls club in his district he raised his hand to ask a question about the dollars and he was not acknowledged he said that he tried to debate the mayor and he walked away moved seconded by gray to end debate and call for the question yeas brown gray lewis miller oliver scales nays freeman hunter

downtown developers there will continue to be unmet needs and political infighting he said that they will not find any potholes downtown because investments downtown are the ones profiting in this city but the money does not make it out to the neighborhoods he said that any neighborhood in county outside the mile square will continue to be neglected until the administration stops giving money

regarding fire safety requirements for smoke detectors by a vote the committee reported the proposal to the council hunter thanked for her hard work and patience on this issue he said that they received lots of input from many different neighborhood groups and special interest groups they decided that the ordinance should not dictate a specific technology since technology changes so often and this also keeps the cost affordable by not requiring a certain kind of technology he said that this has been a long process and he encouraged his colleagues to support the proposal said that she has serious concerns whether this is really about public safety she said that homeowners remove batteries from their detectors because they are overly sensitive if they are not willing to replace a battery then she does not understand how they expect them to replace a to unit they will just remove the entire unit eventually she said that the key thing is education to make sure people have working units in their homes if they cannot afford a battery they cannot afford this equipment scales said that on the surface this appears to solve the problem of fire fatalities technology however has to be addressed if this ordinance is truly being considered to protect public safety she said that ionization alarms cause the alarms and are super sensitive if they do not specify the use and need of ionization or photoelectric technology they will continue to have the nuisance alarm problem instead of removing the battery people will destroy or disassemble their she said that ionization technology is shown to be flawed and has contributed to many fatalities most people die from smoke inhalation in a fire because ionization alarms do not go off in time to save people from smoke inhalation photoelectric alarms respond to smoke faster and are less than a minute slower than alarms in detecting flames she said that even retired fire department chief agrees that photoelectric alarms are better she said that by not specifying the technology they are leaving out a major component that is needed to keep the public even manufacturers are going away from ionization most residents will not know the difference and will buy ionizations alarms cause they are cheaper but if they are creating this ordinance to protect the public they need to approach it in a different manner scales made the following motion i move that section and section of proposal no as previously amended in committee be amended by deleting the highlighted language that is and adding the

prevention and building safety commission or as otherwise permitted by law seconded the motion freeman said that he is not a firefighter and does not know the technology behind the different alarms but after watching a special on channel regarding the difference between ionization and photoelectric alarms he installed both kinds on each story of his house however he believes they should let the public determine what smoke detector they want and this council should not be picking and choosing winners and losers by deciding what technology is correct he said that this is a public safety issue and not only for homeowners but also for the women and men of who risk their lives to save others he said that he personally does not understand a homeowner not replacing a simple battery and doing all they need to do to save their said that she opposes the motion for amendment she said that the current amended ordinance allows individuals to purchase the best kind of smoke detector for their home she said that this new language excludes ionization as well as any future technology yet many fire professional recommend citizens have both kinds of alarms with a year life new technology could easily come along and this amendment would exempt future technology and other kinds of smoke detectors the reason for this ordinance is to save lives and keep people from removing their batteries from their in a recent study of fires had missing or removed batteries while another had a malfunctioning battery in their alarm this exemption would allow for the problem to persist and pushing out the effective date would mean another months scales said that ionization technology is the main reason for nuisance alarms and the reason homeowners remove their batteries she said that many firefighters are not even aware of the difference in the technology so to think that a regular consumer would not know the difference is unrealistic she said that a house would have to be in full flames before an ionization alarm activates while the people could already be dead inside from smoke inhalation she said that photo electronic technology is more advanced and most of these firefighter organizations say it is better than ionization moved seconded by to call the question and end debate debate was ended on the following roll call vote viz yeas gray hunter lewis miller oliver scales nays brown
