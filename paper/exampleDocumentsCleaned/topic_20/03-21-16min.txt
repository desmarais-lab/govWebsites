full council by a vote of with the recommendation that it do pass the proposal was subsequently postponed in council on the proposal sponsored by and lewis reappoints kirsch to the metropolitan development march fanning said that more attention needs to be paid to those who make such important decisions for this city she said that the metropolitan development commission is responsible for making decisions about future development and redevelopment projects in county these decisions influence hundreds of millions of dollars in this economy including thousands of public and private sector jobs and result in both positive and negative consequences for neighborhoods client roster includes companies that directly or indirectly benefit from the financial investments the makes in the city this presents a distinct conflict of interest because kirsch simply cannot serve both the and his clients objectively at the same time fanning said that with a new administration working hard to build a bipartisan team this is a misstep just as the pay raise issue at the end of last year left a sour taste in voters mouths this appointment by the council majority sets a tone antithetic to the new direction of new leadership under mayor she said that she would propose that her colleagues the proposal and that the majority caucus appoint another qualified person to serve on the such as former state representative who is willing to serve if her colleagues decide to continue with the appointment of she would urge them to make this appointment contingent on him agreeing to discontinue serving any organizations that benefit directly or indirectly from decisions or stipulate that he must recuse himself from all votes that have even a hint of impropriety fanning said that kirsch will not be surprised by these objections in fact he allegedly withdrew his name from consideration after ethical questions were raised by miller in the metropolitan economic development committee meeting regarding comments kirsch made on social media that reflected his loyalties to his client that were deemed offensive to some fletcher place residents and seemed to indicate his judgment was affected by his relationship with that client she added that in as a spokesman for the county democratic party kirsch himself fought a appointment to the capital board saying it violated ethics rules particularly when individuals seek work on matters which they personally and substantially participated fanning said that she hopes her fellow recognize that appointing kirsch is incongruous with the mayors priorities and that the city deserves an that can make critical decisions for future in an objective and responsible manner miller said that kirsch made some public comments on twitter following a case in his district last year and this is a dangerous move to put these comments on social media for all to see and kirsch was insulting to the neighbors and the historic preservation commission he said that he asked him to acknowledge that he had handled the situation incorrectly but he refused to do so therefore he cannot support this reappointment these individuals can change law regarding the legal use of land and this is a step in the wrong direction to approve a commissioner who openly mocks the decisions of higher bodies and the will of the neighbors moved seconded by
