that she received concerns from several constituents regarding the demeanor of board members and the treatment citizens receive when they come before the board she said that ms pings name came up most often she said that this is nothing personal but people come on their own time to appear before these boards to express concerns about what happens in their community and instead of being given respect are treated with impatience cut off and asked not to provide public testimony she said that she will not support the proposal said that he has known ms ping for five or six years and what people do not seem to realize is that this particular hearing that was referenced was a three and a half hour discussion he said that the comments being made by citizens were zoning in nature and this was not a zoning board he said that he felt the chair which was not ms ping was prudent in curbing such testimony and not prolonging the hearing said that before he was a member of the council he came before the alcoholic beverage board and his experience was not at all similar to that which is being represented this evening he said that he found that ms ping treated citizens respectfully and they were allowed to present testimony he added that ms ping also asked good questions and was more than professional said that the alcoholic beverage board is made up of three members two of one party and the other a member of another party he said that the board is chaired by a democrat individual appointed by the county he said that it is the chairs responsibility to allow or disallow testimony he said that he watched some of the particular referenced hearing and there were other members in the community who spoke in favor of the license as well as the district he said that he watches these

about ms ping himself and would like to support the proposal however if still have questions it would behoove ms ping to appear before the said that she believes it is a good idea for appointments to appear before the committees she said that it seems inconsistent among different committees as to whether a reappointment is approved without those members present she said that while some chairs think it is not it gives committee members an opportunity to ask about past said that he does not want to send the proposal back to committee as the next rules and public policy committee is scheduled for and the next board meeting is set for he said that while ms ping continues to serve until a replacement is appointed he would rather see her officially appointed so that there are no questions he said that gray himself said that he has heard nothing but good things about ms pings performance in the past and he sees no reason to prolong this gray said that it is not uncommon for people to continue to serve until a replacement is appointed he said that this is not a political plot and he has always spoken highly of ms ping in committee but he would prefer to go forward with a clear understanding president said that most appointees can serve beyond their term ending date but this particular board expires at the end of the year which is unique to this and a couple of other boards yeas brown gray lewis oliver nays day freeman hunter sanders scales said that he has no personal opinion about ms ping but because questions could not be answered he cannot support the proposal

sponsored by hunter authorizes the city controller to offer an early retirement incentive program for city and county employees by a vote the committee reported the said that she would usually support such an initiative but she is concerned that the date has already come and gone sanders said that she is not opposed to giving employees this option but she is opposed to the process as little information has been given to the council to make this decision and there be some people or information that falls through the cracks as a result said that he was unable to attend the committee hearing but he is disturbed that decisions are being made regarding a program that is not authorized yet by an ordinance he asked why that process was followed said that no particular address was made to that question in committee but it is her understanding that human resources thoroughly vetted this process and the unions are in complete support of it she said that dates were extended to allow for this discussion john council liaison mayors office said that this information has been out for a month and city and county employees have had time to think it over and decide whether or not they want to participate sanders said that the letter was sent out and the ordinance was introduced at the next council meeting yet the letter said they had to respond by th she said that employees therefore had to make a commitment by th for a program whose corresponding ordinance did not get introduced until she said that these employees have no representation or a pension office to receive good advice before making a decision said that this proposal was introduced on and was postponed in committee for further review and that is why it is not being voted on until this evening brown asked how many people have signed up for this option said that there are employees currently signed up asked if there have been any employees contact human resources that they wanted to take advantage of this option but could not because of the time frame said that she is not aware of any said that she had some concerns about the timeliness of this program and the legalities but those concerns have been resolved after talking to outside counsel and the office of corporation counsel she added however that she would admonish the administration to give employees more time to make considerations and choices with more information made available longer said that if the administration had come to the council with this proposal before the information was disseminated to the employees the council would have wanted to know how many would take advantage of the program he said it is a matter of which comes first the chicken or the egg he said that all union representatives testified that employees were given proper notice and consultation sanders said that those with union representation had advance notice and consultation but employees did not she said that another issue is that this was not budgeted for in the budget she asked if departments with underspending will be able to retain those funds to assist in other areas she said that the answer from the office of finance and management was that they might consider it but that the general fund might recoup all underspending and assist various departments in making up any deficits she said that this seems a complicated and confusing way to do it and she believes the departments should be able to retain the underspending said that more input from the council is needed in a decision like this so that they do not make meaningless votes he said that such a program might benefit the employees but he feels the council clearly needs to weigh in and the process needs to be respected moved seconded by for adoption

abatement for property located in an economic revitalization area by a said that she has attended several meetings of the property tax assessment board of appeals and is fascinated at the number of properties where tax exemptions are being challenged in light of recent court cases she said that she is surprised to see an exemption and not an abatement and asked how long this exemption is for said that this is something new and out of the ordinary he said that this process provides an opportunity for to retain jobs in a competitive environment and impact the city economically he said that this is a new tool that was given to them by thinking outside of the box deputy mayor stated that the general assembly created this tool to provide a tax exemption for data centers the rationale is that data centers support work all over the nation and the world but would provide jobs that reside in that might otherwise reside elsewhere he said that the return on investment is estimated at more than to one he said that the exemption is limited to years added that the total exemption is projected at million with the return to be times that asked if this is just the enabling ordinance said that it is and the final resolution was introduced this evening and will be heard in a public hearing on asked if this is not putting the cart before the horse president stated that the state statute outlines the process and requires multiple public hearings and this is phase one general counsel stated that this process is treated like the economic development bonds where there is an inducement proposal and then a final resolution he that this is a declaratory resolution if it is adopted then there will be further hearing on this issue and after that another resolution will need to be acted on before the exemption is actually granted he that by nature of the statute this is a sanders thanked the legislature for providing the city with a new tool and a process by which they can in turn provide them with more revenue she said that the state benefits from this practice as they will get more money but there is no guarantee these individuals will locate brown asked if they can identify which of those jobs reside in county and how many of those employees reside in county he said that he would like to know that information when giving away tax exemptions to create jobs said that a private company cannot dictate where their employees live or ask them where they live for a job interview or hiring requirement he said that it is simply important to have people working and making money to help the economy situation added that the company currently has of its employees living in asked if this is a complete and utter exemption for years or if some taxes will be paid said that the exemption is on data center equipment that qualifies and most of it will qualify said that he would not think data equipment would be around for years so asked if it was safe to assume taxes would never be paid on that equipment said that this is probably correct but the benefit comes in the locating in instead of another location providing jobs and property taxes added that this data center will bring in more jobs as they continue to grow and while they do not know how many employees will live inside county the fact that of their current employees reside in county is a good indication said that the discussion has been revealing and while she would like these employees living here in the community she is not hung up on whether or not they live across the county line she said that it is a very competitive world out there and she asked the administration to redouble their efforts to provide with information about proposals like this she said that if they want their continued support they should bring them in on the conversations earlier and to a greater extent moved seconded by for adoption proposal no yeas day freeman gray hunter lewis by hunter approves certain public purpose grants totaling from the drug free community fund by a vote the committee reported the proposal to the council with lewis asked for consent to abstain to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest said that he normally supports these types of grants as a libertarian but he is employed as a nurse and does not think putting so much money toward education will help as much as putting it

committee was eliminated because so many committees were unnecessary but now they are adding another committee president said that they eliminated community affairs because it was a committee that never considered anything of substance the public safety and criminal justice committee however is responsible for of all proposals and of the budget that is a very heavy workload and it would be better served being split into two committees hunter said that he agrees it is too heavy a workload to handle and he believes a balance can be achieved and they can address sanders concern said that
