property taxes go through the statutory abatement process by a vote the committee reported the proposal to the council with the freeman said that any proposal that begins with the words urging the general assembly is a bad idea he said that the council has no power or authority to tell the legislature how to do anything if they want something changed he would urge to call their state legislator like any other rational citizen would do he said that the impetus for this proposal seems to be the contract and that no public comment was allowed however there was documented public comment on this in he said that he is befuddled by this council leadership and when they decide that public comment is warranted and when it is not he said that the council attorney just ruled in favor of violating council rules earlier this evening based on it being the practice of this council to do things that way the counsel to the council arbitrarily goes against the law and this is frustrating and concerns him greatly said that he did reach out to general assembly members and they stated that they could take a resolution from the council as a planning tool to reflect the councils voice on this matter he said that the public comment that took place was prior to the release of the contract and it was scheduled purposefully as to not let the details of the contract be known said that he did not have enough information available to him in committee to make an informed vote he said that made several statements and he asked for a postponement to look into the matter further so that he could cast an educated vote he said that the committee however did not allow that action and seemed to be pushing it for introduction at the opening day of the general assembly he said that he still does not have the information he needs that was promised to him by said that he heartily supports the proposal as he has always been outspoken about abatements and granting an abatement without proper public comment or not calling it an abatement needs to be brought to light said that the terms of the contract were not disclosed prior to the public testimony and instead it was presented as a simple amendment to an existing contract however it went well beyond a simple amendment and resulted in lawsuits preventing the progress of clean recycling going forward she said that this contract has taken this city backwards instead of forward and to have public comment without the facts being known is a disservice to society hunter asked to copy him on the with he said that he be able to get behind it when that information is forthcoming but this proposal is poorly written and there is not sufficient information for him to support it he said that he does support curbside recycling but would like more information scales said that it is important this body be careful and judicious in their use of council resolutions but this is one she can heartily endorse and support miller said that he is in favor of public comment in general on most things but he has not had time to vet this particular issue thoroughly he said that he worked closely with members of the general assembly on the landlord proposal and while it took much more time to do it right and allow for public input he generally agrees that public comment is important president lewis said that as much as she appreciates the opinions of other attorneys in the room there is one counsel to the council and that is the ruling that is recognized on the council floor moved seconded by for adoption proposal no yeas gray lewis oliver scales nays freeman hunter miller absent a council resolution urging the general assembly to require that all local unit agreements to pay a contractors property taxes go through the statutory abatement process whereas the recently approved amendment to the agreement between the city and inc provides that the city will pay up to of real and personal property taxes on the proposed new advanced materials recovery center arc and arc site subject to certain annual caps and an aggregate cap of whereas the practical effect of that provision is that will receive a property tax abatement of up to the million cap without having to satisfy the requirements of the abatement statute which include in this instance approval by both the metropolitan development commission and the council and whereas the executive branch should not have the unilateral authority to decide to pay someones property taxes for them without the safeguards contained in as that increases the burden on all other property taxpayers now therefore section the council urges the general assembly to amend state law to require that all local unit agreements to pay a contractors property taxes go through the statutory abatement process section the clerk of the council is directed to distribute copies of this resolution to the governor of the state of and the members of the general assembly entitled a

problems this year with transparency and the understanding of data and she thanked the office of finance and management for providing such good communication she said that she has concerns about the department of public works taking over some parks department functions and the parks money and personnel seems to be all spread out with no clear protocol with all the focus on crime prevention needs more resources to promote a better safer quality of life for citizens and positive programs for this youth she said that remains concerned about outsourcing certain functions of the department of metropolitan development while this save some money in the beginning it will in the long run cost more money and the city will lose experienced knowledgeable personnel she said that they need to work together to find a solution to the inmate issue she said that they have some questions and concerns about the metropolitan police departments budget and their overtime costs and the amount of time their officers spend on second jobs she said that they have asked for a comprehensive list of the costs laid on the backs of taxpayers for economic development in this city and hope it will be forthcoming she said that they are confused about the recent tax hikes purported to support the capital improvement board and questions whether they were actually needed she said that all government units need to work more openly and honestly with each other because property tax caps and circuit breakers are here to stay and squabbling over who gets what money does not serve the public good citizen said that it is too late to salvage this budget but they need more people coming down to meetings commenting on actions this body takes he said that they are getting ready to spend billion of taxpayers money and this room is empty he said that a prayer vigil or fallen officer tribute is not the place to make the citizens voices heard and they need to come down and get involved in making

even though earlier tonight the counsel to the council said that at least six times in the last three years they have not complied with the law because of precedent said that she has concerns about where this will take them down the road there be occasions where the district does not truly represent the constituents but their own agenda instead or where something severely impacts an adjoining district where that should have a voice she said that she thinks especially in light of the positions being eliminated that this needs to be revisited going forward hunter agreed that they need to look at it again and the issue here was really with respect to special use variances he said that he is open to looking at it and tweaking it further as this is unique for county as explained in the general assembly asked if there is authority under the state statute for them to modify this to allow adjoining district to call something out for public hearing as there was one case where a district had their own agenda and then did not succeed in getting reelected because of it said that that if the intent of the general assembly was to limit it to the district he does not think they have the authority to make that change and they would have to ask the general assembly to make it moved seconded by for adoption proposal no yeas freeman gray hunter lewis miller absent proposal for a general
