metropolitan police department merit board by a vote the committee reported the proposal to the council with the hunter said that he has no doubt that reverend clay is an honorable person but the merit board is a judicial body that needs to be impartial recent headlines of rev clay leading protests casting on the city and the police department concern him greatly he said that the political statement has been made by rev clay that the mayor is to blame for all of faults and he has not seen this kind of unethical in years he said that he feels rev clay would be casting judgment prior to hearing a case based on his bias toward the mayor and department he said that even though this is a political appointment and he recognizes that it should be a small and not a large one he moved seconded by to return proposal no to committee for further discussion said that everyone has a right to protest and to send it back to committee because rev clay does not fit their type of appointee is unfair he said that rev clay has a right to say what he wants and to judge his character by articles about him on the internet is unfair oliver said that he disagrees with the characterization of rev clay as being unfair he said that rev clay is a pillar of the community a fighter for reform in the police department and he can assure the council that rev clay will listen and make his judgments based on facts he said that hunters comments are political in nature hunter said that he never said rev clay was unfair but actually said that he believes him to be an honorable man gray said that he would think they would want someone on the board with a different opinion who would not just go along with the status quo he said that rev clay is willing to speak up and take a position for the people and for police officers he said that the earlier appointment of miser was a political appointment and to not support this appointment is wrong oliver said that his colleagues across the aisle seem bent on any reason that someone who disagrees is unfit he said that rev clay is well prepared intelligent and experience and can do the job yeas freeman hunter miller scales nays brown gray lewis oliver absent brown stated that rev clay is a community activist and is not a rubber stamp for mayor he said that they tried to modify the makeup of the merit board to make it more diverse and the mayor vetoed that he said that seven members are all republicans with a big versus a small and the last appointee was mark a candidate for prosecutor he said that rev clay is an outspoken man but intelligent and will judge each petition on its merits freeman said that he practices law for a living and his prayer during a trial is always that the jury will listen to the evidence and base their decision on facts anyone sitting in judgment probably does not want an activist deciding their fate he said that to do something just because the majority of the community wants it is not always a good idea in the case of john and the tea party they would have said to hang them in the public square if that were the case he said that this is not about politics big or little it is instead about appointing someone who is not an activist he said that he also did a search and there have been some very serious comments made by rev clay regarding the police departments taking these preconceived ideas into a meeting usually means a persons mind is already made up said that he served in a judicial capacity for years in small claims court hopefully he made his decisions impartially based on the testimony presented he said that an individual serving on this board is sitting in judgment of the actions of police officers and holds that officers career in their hands therefore these decisions should not be based on predisposition he agreed that rev clay is an honorable man but given the statements he has made in the press over the last few years he does not feel this is the best place for him to serve said that there are real problems in public safety and pastor clay has been outspoken as a number of other individuals have been he said that if the criteria for serving on the merit board is to not acknowledge problems they have then they most likely will not find a candidate to serve he said that those who operate outside the system view things differently than those who operate within he said that he was somewhat critical of the council before he was seated but then set about doing things differently when he became a member brown said that judging a man on prior conversations is not open and objective as his colleagues across the aisle do not even know rev clay he said that he attempted to amend the merit board to make it more open objective but the mayor did not want to lose control and vetoed that effort instead the mayor wanted no independent voice on that body miller said that he agrees that they need someone who is open and honest about the problems in public safety and that is why he supported the reappointment of for public safety director but yet so many of his colleagues are upset with for doing exactly what they are now claiming is laudable in another person doing more openly he said that he does not have a problem with someone being against the status quo but he would like the opportunity to ask a few more questions of rev clay hunter said that while he appreciates browns view this is not a popularity contest he commends rev clay for his activism yet he would challenge brown to find any quote from former appointee mark or other appointees about a case in progress he said that seems to be confused about what the merit board does the merit board has to be fair and impartial as they are charged with making decisions the council is a political body and they are held accountable through elections but the merit board is a completely different type of body he said that he is not saying rev clay is not intelligent or honorable but his past activism is indicative of his predisposition to talking about cases in process and that concerns him he said that if some of these comments took place years ago he could look past them but they have all been in the last six months with one of them as recent as last week moved seconded by gray to call the question and end debate the motion carried on the following roll call vote viz
