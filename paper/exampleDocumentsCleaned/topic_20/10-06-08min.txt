committee reported the proposal to the council said that after reading the minutes she does not feel there is a clear enough understanding of why they would need this much money and she feels this is excessive said that she appreciates that the city is getting away from but believes is excessive she said that they cut the parks budget and did not add monies for crime prevention initiatives and she feels there should be a more efficient way of achieving this oliver said that this is an extraordinary amount of money taken away from fighting crime and used for other purposes he said that this adds another layer of government without any more information he moved seconded by sanders to return proposal no to committee sanders agreed with oliver and said that it could be done less costly and she believes the true purpose of this funding was for programs and not evaluation said that just because is set aside there is no expectation in her understanding that this entire amount would be spent

and is a reasonable insurance hunter stated that he opposes the motion to return the proposal to committee he said that this is the result of a poorly written ordinance last year with no

board will be letting these contracts and the real review should be done by those accountable to the public she urged her colleagues to vote against it without further said that the grants will still need to come before various committees for approval and another layer of accountability said that he expressed some concern about the amount but it was explained that is a reasonable amount asked why staff people could not be hired versus giving away a half million dollars instead creating jobs and helping the economy hunter stated that by bidding out the contracts people will be given jobs and they will be helping the economy he said that they would have to create ongoing salaries and benefits instead of contracting it out to those with expertise asked how the bids will be done and if there will be participation she said that it seems a lot of money for something that could be done she said they wanted of that money to go to crime prevention programs hunter said that this bidding process would be no different than any other contract letting process the city does and all those regulations for requirements apply said that he was one of the lone democrats that voted against the county option income tax increase because his constituents could not afford it however this proposal would take money out of constituents pockets and there is no way to know if this money will be spent locally brown agreed that more oversight is needed and he has no problem with an outside agency doing the evaluation however of the money should be going to crime prevention programs as originally intended and taking away is a step backward he asked what thinks of this proposal hunter asked executive director of to explain their opinion said that the money would go to an outside evaluator for a request for proposals that would be issued and some of that money would go to hire a crime prevention staff to provide technical resources to the organizations that receive the money he said that this money is also being invested in crime prevention to make sure the money is being spent wisely he added that by adding staff through and a contract this does not need to be an ongoing budget expense for the city he said that the staff would work for and the board would be approving such brown asked if these would be county residents said that he does not understand why they would not be county residents oliver said that he does not agree with the amount and others spending this money he asked if it is customary to spend this type of money for evaluation city controller said that those decisions have not been made and this provides administrative costs up to but does not set a definite amount he said that he believes it is good practice to provide oversight of grant monies to make sure they are being spent properly and providing the outcomes the city needs he said that if he can get the job done at he will make sure it gets done for less asked if these employees will be employees said that he believes if they are city employees there is not that outside evaluation element and hiring staff within the city these employees would be more favorable toward city agency proposals said that she feels city employees could be objective she asked how many employees would be hired and what it might cost said that until the request for proposals goes out there is no way to tell but he estimates roughly that it would be approximately the cost of maintaining a staff would be approximately which would include equipment supplies and facilities he said that they anticipate approximately three people plus an urban fellow sanders said that she appreciates the information they are receiving this evening but it would be more appropriate in the committee forum and a budget should have been submitted at that time she said that this is new information presented this evening and no staffing was indicated in committee but now it seems there is a plan in place said that this is similar to the arts council grants process speedy asked if will present the proposal back to the rules committee at a future date said that they will and there would be transparency involved in the process he said that sending the proposal back to committee would slow the process in getting this money out and the crime prevention board is doing a good job screening these grants speedy said that this proposal needs to be passed to get these dollars into the hands of those who can do the most good in the community with regard to crime prevention said that has cleared up some questions she had about the minutes and asked why the department of metropolitan development was not asked for their model on the community development block grant process as it works well and the wheel does not need to be reinvented she asked if this proposal is a way to staff up then they need to just say so said that it is not to staff up and this is solely being used for the crime prevention program asked when

provide said that he was not with at the time the ordinance was drafted but was intended to provide guidance and is willing to help however they can said that the original ordinance was written poorly
