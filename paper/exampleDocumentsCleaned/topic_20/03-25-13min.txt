a unanimous received an indecisive vote from the full council on and was postponed by the council on the proposal sponsored by and oliver directs the department of public works to use million of its appropriation from the of the consolidated county fund for the purpose of financing infrastructure improvements in the meadows area by a vote the scales said that this area is in her district and she does not believe this is the optimum package in play for this area she said that she sponsored a tax increment financing proposal that would meet all the economic needs of this area but it was tabled without much of a hearing she said that it would be better to support that proposal than to support this stopgap measure that the mayor has already indicated he would veto she said that she therefore cannot support the proposal and would advocate for being open to helping this community by bringing the proposal back said that there is no question there is a need in this area he said that it is that he is the least biggest fan of yet he feels this proposal is not the best remedy for this area and he does not have the proposal to compare it to in order to determine what is best for this area he said that this approved recently that were extremely wanting taking existing property and capturing it borrowing and creating all kinds of debt he said that he cannot make an informed decision about how to improve an area if he does not have any comparisons he said that a hearing should be granted for an area where there is the most need and this area should be entitled to the same treatment as downtown and broad ripple urged his colleagues to oppose the proposal he said that this area is in dire need of redevelopment and there is a great synergy spirit and energy in the people of this community he said that this goes back to the philosophy of teaching someone to fish versus giving them a fish he said that the tools in this area are abundant and they need to implement the correct tools to promote long sustained development in this area while the grocery store might be an integral part to redevelopment it is still only one part he said that diverting money from the fund might be but it is shortsighted he added that he also believes it is an illegal use of the funds and is a direct contradiction to ordinance gray said that he is amazed how his colleagues talk about inappropriate use of these funds yet they are simply asking for this money to improve the community to resurface streets yet these same people supported a million investment in a portion of street that they now do not know what to do with he said that opposing the proposal is a bad way to say this help is not needed when it truly is said that there was a public hearing with lots of testimony regarding the proposal mentioned earlier he asked to address the illegal use of funds as alleged by said that he would disagree with assessment and legislative bodies always make exceptions to ordinances he said that the notwithstanding language is already included in another proposal offered by the administration proposal no so in his opinion there is no legal impediment and it is simply a question of policy and there is really no chance of any lawsuit with legal standing miller said that proposal no is actually being amended to remove the notwithstanding language and funds have been found elsewhere for this project due to the administration realizing that this was not a precedent they would like to set he said that he had asked previously what roads are being repaved and where these infrastructure improvements will be made and how much money is allocated for each one he said he also asked where these projects fall in the current priority list he said that this information would help him to make an informed decision about spending this money but without it he feels he does not have enough information and he is disappointed that he has not received that information said that the language in section of the proposal is taken directly from the ordinance he said that he sent millers request for information to director miser department of public works and he is also disappointed that this information has not been provided to them miller said that did not initiate the proposal and he was looking for this information from her as she does not know what the who initiated this proposal have identified as priority said that he has seen the use of funds for a transit study charter schools and the city market and it is disingenuous to say proposal no is illegal when it is about infrastructure needs especially when they have already established the use of funds for other things gray asked where miller was when this council passed the proposal approving the improvements on street miller said that he was not a at the time that proposal was passed freeman said that he practices law in his profession and he has never in his legal career used words such as always never and no chance he said that it is dangerous when a lawyer uses these words in advising this body when things are challenged all the time he said that is also a lawyer and has voiced his legal opinion that it is illegal and so it is not good sound legal advice to say this would not be challenged gray said that they should pass the proposal then and see if it is challenged moved seconded by for adoption proposal no failed on the following roll call vote viz yeas brown gray lewis oliver nays freeman hunter miller scales committee heard proposal no on and the proposal was returned to committee by the full council on and again referred to the council by committee on the proposal sponsored by amends the code by adding a new sec prohibiting fraternization under certain circumstances by a vote the committee reported the proposal to the council said that he offered this proposal last because he was concerned that no clear policy had been established he said that he agrees with many of his colleagues that it would more properly be handled through a personnel manual instead of an ordinance he said that it is his understanding that the personnel handbook has not been distributed which contains this same effect therefore to demonstrate that this is not a political initiative he has no legitimate reason to move forward with the proposal he moved seconded by hunter to strike proposal no the proposal was stricken by a voice vote proposal no who acted as temporary chair of this proposal reported that the community affairs committee heard proposal no on the proposal sponsored by and amends chapter article vi of the code by adding a new sec relating to council oversight of turnaround academies said that he believes money is best spent in the classroom and he has a concern that they could have subsidies flowing from former districts to the charter schools he made the following motion i move to amend section of proposal no by adding new subsections and under sec to read as follows all funds received by the city from the state for the mayors oversight of the special management team of a turnaround academy shall be distributed quarterly to the turnaround academy if the mayor is overseeing the special management teams of more than one turnaround academy and to the extent the state funds are not allocated to a particular turnaround academy then the state funds shall be distributed quarterly to the turnaround academies pro based on each turnaround student population subsection shall apply only if the mayor chooses not to collect an administrative fee as authorized by from organizers of charter schools sponsored by the mayor oliver seconded the motion to amend said that this amendment is unrelated to proposal no and its intent asked if is saying that state funds are not allocated to a particular turnaround academy and are allocated instead for a certain program or special education said that this not be the intent of the proposal as introduced but unless the proposal is modified the city will receive the money for oversight but could use it for something else such as charters he said that while the initial proposal not have dealt with funding when the city takes over these schools they will receive money from the state without a policy in place they run the risk that money for these turnaround academies could be used to subsidize charters said that did not answer her question said that his amendment simply says that if the city receives funds because of a turnaround academy these funds should go toward that turnaround academy miller asked if this amendment has been vetted by the administration he said that he cannot imagine the state does not already have something in place indicating the funds are to be used for turnaround academies brown charter school director office of the mayor said that these funds are in the budget of the department of education they have never been intended to go to the classrooms and are intended to go to the mayors office for oversight and administration and will go toward salaries he said that they are not taking money from classrooms said that she believes the amendment goes beyond the scope of the original intent of the proposal and the discussion taking place illustrates that even she encouraged to offer his suggestions in a separate proposal and urged her colleagues to oppose the amendment motion failed on the following roll call vote viz yeas brown oliver nays freeman gray hunter lewis miller said that there will be a new person in the mayors office in the charter schools division that person will be paid for their services and the money will not go to a classroom that very same person will oversee charter schools who do not pay an administrative fee even though district schools have to pay such he said that the number of charters being overseen is yet turnaround district schools are struggling he said that he intends to introduce another proposal to deal with this issue to create a parody between the district and charter schools hunter said that the council does not oversee school districts charters are public schools but are under the mayors offices authority the department of education is endorsing this and it is a good partnership said that for every or a charter receives public schools in the same area receive or this money is transferred from the doe to the mayors budget and is never used in schools miller said that these funds are coming from the state and are not being levied from those district schools to begin with thanked the council for their support and urged more openness and transparency as the education system grows in county he thanked the for their support on education issues moved seconded by for adoption proposal no proposal for a general ordinance amending chapter article vi of the code by adding a new section relating to council oversight of turnaround academies whereas pursuant to the mayor is authorized to petition the state board of education to oversee the special management teams of turnaround academies and whereas on the state board of education approved the mayors petition and whereas the council desires to participate in the oversight of the turnaround academies within county section chapter article vi of the revised code of the consolidated city and county is hereby amended by adding a new section to read as follows sec turnaround academies a whenever pursuant to the state board of education has granted the mayors petition to oversee the special management team of a turnaround academy the deputy mayor for education shall make periodic reports to the council committee designated by the council president these reports shall be made on the same

sponsored by miller and provisionally designates certain real property as a high technology district area and specifies that qualified property owned by exact target inc is exempt from property taxation pursuant to by a vote the committee reported the proposal to the council with the miller said that this is a good example of trying to use all the economic development tools available he said that this will bring a to one ratio payback to the city in benefits new jobs and new money he applauded exact target for staying in and the administration for finding creative ways to keep them here said that exact target has been a strong employer with a commitment to stay downtown investing in a historic building and employing a lot of downtown residents said that an economic incentive should be applied to get someone to do something once it becomes a business practice or dependency if they keep doing it over and over again he said that exact target was given a previous abatement for years for information technology equipment when information technology changes much more rapidly than every years he said that they are already located in a district and already do not pay real property taxes he said that they claim to have of their hires inside the city but they do not really know if that is accurate he said that if the administration is so eager to offer incentives why they do not offer incentives to locate in places that really need it he said that businesses want to be downtown already and this is no real incentive he said that incentives need to be tied to parts of the city that need real economic development help pouring more money into downtown makes no sense as it is already booming moved seconded by for adoption proposal yeas freeman hunter lewis miller oliver nays
