property tax value and the retail component will reactivate the canal after hours he said that he does have some concerns in light of the recently passed workers bill of rights that this project is the creation of poverty wage jobs which leads to crime he said that the project has a lot of good virtues that outweigh this concern but as a council they need to get behind the new mayor to combat

council with the asked housing services specialist department of public safety to share costs and other answers to concerns requested by the committee ms said that the gallon bins are each and they estimate a crew working up to hours to handle the process due to a displacement she said that they estimate it would be about in personnel and equipment she said that medication would be inventoried as ordered under the auspices of a medical doctor and there are protocols in place for issuing medications with double locks in securing them miller applauded for working to craft a proposal that protects both the homeless and the city said that the emergency definitions seem to conflict in two different sections said that the first definition is straight from the health and hospital code and is intended to be broad in order to give authorities flexibility due to a public health or public safety issue he said that the second definition was added because of the notice of provision of days because an emergency would preclude that and provide for whatever notice is reasonable under the circumstances asked about insufficient housing in the case of an emergency said that the operative language is available transitional housing is to be provided unless an individual refuses but there be situations where transitional housing is not available and an emergency be one of those such situations asked if the city will have to wait to close the camp in an emergency if there is insufficient housing available said that those are different situations and he does not see the conflict ms said that they would get those individuals into whatever housing they could including an emergency overflow shelter she said that when the street camp was closed they got those people into temporary housing even if longterm transitional or permanent support housing was not available said that she wants to make sure this is comprehensive ms said that there is a large group that works on this to find adequate housing in such an instance asked where the buck stops and who makes the ultimate decision to close a camp ms said that if it were a public health emergency it would be health and hospital corporation she said that she is not aware of a civil sheriff every being involved in these cases but she can look into that she said that it would mostly be a decision of code enforcement health and hospital the health department asked why it is not before the health and hospital corporation instead ms said that she does not know said that two city agencies are involved in this process with the department of public works taking care of the displaced individuals personal items and giving notice and actually closing down the camp he said that the council legally cannot tell the health and hospital corporation what to do in the event of a public health emergency fanning asked what the total city liability is with regard to storing said belongings in case of any items being lost or stolen said that before the city could be liable they would have to have been negligent he said that it would have to be a negligible act for the city to be liable and he believes they have precautions in place for that ms said that the containers each have a flex cuff which are very secure and there is a process in place so that staff cannot get into a container without the owner being present and aware that their container is being opened freeman said that he will be voting against the proposal because there is no question that the city is creating for itself a duty with obligations and liability under this proposal he said they should instead leave this to private groups and and support them in their efforts creating an entire ordinance that does not jive with tenant law is a mistake tenants who are evicted from their homes do not get some of these same courtesies he said that the emergency definition also causes him concern he said that they need to work together with private groups to handle these situations and this is not an appropriate role for the city said that the city is the one closing the camps down and injecting themselves into this process therefore they have a moral obligation to aid those who are displaced clay said that the bible says what they have done unto the least of these they have done unto him he commended for being sensitive to the needs of the least of these and bringing to the public a venue to address that need he said that this insures that the city will not take upon the initiative to close a camp without making sure the residents have some place to go he said that safeguarding their personal effects and securing them to a time certain is the minimal gesture they can make he said that the proposal has come a long way from the original version introduced last year and he feels the council has a moral obligation to advance it forward asked about camps on private property such as a persons farm in franklin township ms said that the process would be the same if a private land owner comes to the city and indicates that people are squatting illegally on their land with the street camp had rights to that and wanted that property returned asked how the same can be done on private property said that one of the new mayors initiatives is to help those living in poverty and they have an obligation to look out for the least among them she said that a lot of the homeless issue stems from closing down the mental hospital and not making accommodations for those people and addressing their issues she said that this is one step in correcting that problem she added that this city gives millions of dollars to professional sports teams and other things not under their jurisdiction or purview and they need to address those things that are miller said that the street camp was on private property and that is what required the city to act that is the reason the city needed to do something because to ask a private organization to address a problem on private property would not be appropriate as they have no authority he said that this is the minimum they can do as a city and they must address this in a humane way moved seconded by for adoption proposal no yeas clay coats fanning gray lewis miller oliver ray scales nays freeman proposal for a general ordinance amending the revised code to add certain protections for the homeless whereas on outreach workers counted persons in county who were homeless and whereas based on national research the number of persons who experience homelessness at some point during the year is three to five times the number counted during a count such as the count and whereas the estimated number of persons in county who experience homelessness during the course of a year ranges from results and results and whereas county has a shortage of shelters that can accommodate individuals and families victims of domestic violence and unmarried couples and the county therefore provides limited help to those experiencing homelessness and whereas there is a shortage of transitional housing as well as permanent housing for those experiencing homelessness and whereas there is also a shortage of emergency shelter space operated by secular entities for individuals and families and whereas the persons experiencing homelessness should be entitled to protection from arbitrary and capricious treatment by local government now therefore section title i chapter of the revised code of the consolidated city and county is hereby amended by adding a new article to read
