district maps as provided amends the regulations regarding development within the flood control districts and economic the proposal by and miller said that he supports moving these maps forward and after some discussion he understands that every property owner affected received notice well over a year ago also he understands there have been several public meetings and they theoretically should not be surprised by this action however once this is passed they will have zero chance of changing it he said that his concern is that they received these last and were told that if they do not approve these maps then the city could lose flood insurance and homeowners need that flood insurance the changes have to go in this week and if any amendments are made then the federal emergency management agency could come back to them and say this is not what they agreed upon he said that he does not fault the new director of the department of code enforcement for getting these at the last minute because is new to his position but this has been poor project management he said that he was not aware that this would be the last opportunity for the public to talk about these ordinance changes he said that while he has no issue with the change in the administrative fee he does have concerns about approving it without the public having any say in it since it was a amendment he said that has committed to him that he will not apply that fee as long as the council recommends which for his comfort would be at least a month he said that this is not the normal public process and he hopes that this fee will indeed not be charged until the public is educated and understands it however if they were to remove it this evening it would have to go back to and the metropolitan development commission for approval again and homeowners would suffer without insurance coverage in the meantime said that even though she supports the proposal she does not believe one member of this body would say this was handled in the proper normal process she said that she wants it to be made clear that the council is basically being held hostage by because in addition to homeowners losing flood insurance the county would also lose emergency assistance if this is not passed in a timely manner asked if can explain why they are here in this unusual circumstance so that the public has a better understanding and can grasp the importance and necessity of this action said that in remapping began in all of county this mapping ensures that federal assistance is available to those with federally backed mortgages to compensate for flood damage in case of a flood updates those maps and maintains them but they require the local body to adopt any amendments to these maps as well as language within the zoning ordinances regarding construction in flood zones the revised maps were received in and were published in the star to make the county aware public were held in and of at which over people were in attendance there was then a period allowed for the property owner appeal process in the final determination letter was received from requiring the city to adopt it by and the department of natural resources approved the final language on and the had to approve it once that took place which they did on the maps were then presented to the metropolitan and economic development committee on even though it was not yet in proposal form he said that they were informed by that it would be too late if they introduced it tonight and then waited until for action which is why they heard it early in committee and are asking for a vote tonight said that she agrees with miller and and she questions how many houses have been sold since this was communicated in she said that this was a year and a half ago and new owners not all be aware she asked if owners do not have a mortgage if they will still get a letter said that all parcels impacted in the flood plain have received regardless of whether or not they have a mortgage asked where the public meetings were held said that he is not for sure but believes there were three and one was held on the west side of town one out east at the community life center on east street and one somewhere north said that the locations of these meetings not have been in areas where citizens would feel the most impact as it seems nothing was held on the south side of town she said that while constituents seem to be duly notified a lot can happen in a year and a half and she hopes they will not have to come back and do this again she said that this process concerns her and she is not thrilled with it but she will support the proposal freeman said that it is one thing to have put a gun to their head to do this but there are things in the ordinance that have been added by the staff such as the fee and he cannot support that he said that they should address the federal government requirements in one ordinance and then the fees should be a standalone ordinance to go to committee for an adequate public hearing he asked why items are included in this ordinance that are not mandated by said that he was not a part of the drafting as he has only been in position for a little over a month he added that he would not have added that language if he had been a part of it and he agrees with freeman he said however that the current language before the council this evening has been approved by and by eliminating part of it or revising it tonight they would put themselves at risk of not approving the ordinance he said that if there is anything in the ordinance the council wishes for him to review he will be happy to refrain from imposing any aspects of the ordinance until the council determines how they should be handled freeman said that he is not blaming and he should be offended that he is being asked to defend this action but they were notified of this action five days ago and have to go through with it he said that he has concerns that the staff that drafted this legislation is not doing right by the city said that it is his understanding that the fee is not imposed on everyone and it is only imposed if the staff has to go back and correct mistakes the second time around miller said that he does not think the fee makes sense he said that he does not blame the current directors but this was not handled well by staff and is not fair to the public moved seconded by for adoption proposal no yeas clay coats fanning gray lewis miller oliver ray scales nays freeman proposal nos introduced by

and management said that only goes toward contracts and those contracts are to run the facilities provide security food services etc asked if these will all go toward work release facilities or other criminal justice facilities said that they are all work release facilities said that there are many of these facilities in his district and they lack funds to transport residents to their places of employment so he supports the proposal asked if these are contracts already in play or if they are new contracts and what percentage of them are minorities said that he cannot speak to the minority percentages but he can find that information the funding covers the base grant contracts said that she is amazed no one ever seems to know the percentage of minority involvement when the city goes to spend money on contracts asked if there are goals already currently set for contracts said that this is ongoing department of corrections doc money and they are funding to the base level said that he understood that the city operates with goals of and disabled percentage participation he asked if these contracts fall under those participation percentages brown council chief financial officer said that he does not know that answer said that this would be good for the entire council to know gray asked how long has been in this position that he does not understand that they need to be better prepared when coming before the council and anticipate the information they need to know to make a decision agreed and said that they will strive to do better said that if the council passes proposal no this evening that legislation will take away all their oversight of public safety so this conversation regarding contracts will no longer take place in this chamber pastor missionary baptist church said that he is appalled that a professional would come forth and make no concessions for people against the wall as it is people in and out of prison he said that these proposals affect the quality of life for families and feed the rise of crime more consideration needs to be given to the human aspect of these proposals instead of just casually saying they do not have that information he asked them to be more aware of the humanity involved in their decisions yeas clay coats fanning freeman gray lewis miller oliver ray scales miller said that he hopes they can get the information that was requested development committee heard proposal no on it was then postponed in council on and received an indecisive vote on the proposal sponsored by and lewis reappoints kirsch to the metropolitan development commission by a vote the committee reported the proposal to miller said that this is the third time this proposal has been heard and he will not repeat his reasons for opposition as he has stated all of those times however he would encourage his colleagues that if they truly feel this individual best represents mayor and this councils vision for neighborhood revitalization then they should vote for it if it does not then they should oppose the proposal he said that people watch what they do as a council and they trust them to put the right people on these very important commissions moved seconded by for adoption proposal no yeas clay gray lewis oliver ray nays coats fanning freeman miller scales justice committee heard proposal no on the proposal received two subsequent indecisive votes in council on and the proposal sponsored by clay amends chapter of the code with respect to merit board member selection and the hiring promoting and disciplining of police officers by a vote the stated that there was extensive discussion at the public safety and criminal justice committee and public safety director was present at that meeting and did not support the proposal he said that he had a long career in and worked under the consent decree and he believes this was a great tool he worked with a lot of officers of many different ethnicities and he thinks the department needs that diversity however with this proposal he believes they are at risk of eliminating the opportunity to have a diverse workforce and could actually void the system they are operating under by state statute by making these types of changes he said that they are mandated under the state system down to the list of hires but this provides no opportunity with the rule incorporated by the merit board and puts the system at risk he said that he cannot support the proposal clay said that this proposal is comprehensive and provides greater efficiency and opportunity for metropolitan police department officers he said that it is critical that they stand as a party and caucus to support this action and not just a portion of it he said that this has been around since and was introduced first by former brown and then gray he said that it provides greater transparency one problem this proposal seeks to address is with people who have turned an appointment into a career this would implement tenure on terms with terms not to exceed two terms those individuals could come back and serve but after sitting out at least one term he said that this would not be dictating a person but a policy and is well within their purview he said that he hopes his colleagues can come to the realization that this proposal is comprehensive and that they would not try to dissect it to go in the wrong direction made the following motion i respectfully move to amend proposal no by the substitution of the following language for that which appears in the proposal general ordinance no

ordinance be declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid for any reason the remaining provision or provisions shall not be affected if and only if such remaining provisions can without the invalid provision or provisions be given the effect intended by the council in adopting this ordinance to this end the provisions of this ordinance are seconded the motion asked what this does said that this strikes everything except for the rule and actually makes that a rule by putting it into the ordinance if it is passed instead of just a practice clay said that this is nothing more than an attempt to purge themselves of the appearance of supporting diversity and is much like an expired national association for the advancement of colored people card said that she does not support the motion to amend she said that this is about control and power and there is no money attached to this proposal she said that it is funny how this body talks about laws and government and legislation in the good boys state where the governor reverses the roe vs wade decision she said that members say they care about diversity but they just passed a million appropriation where no one could tell her the percentage of minority participation she said that the same people have been serving on this board for years and continue with the same process she said that she has tried to support the recruit classes and attend graduation ceremonies but she cannot support these anymore said that when he came on this council there was a shortfall of police officers the rule was taken out and taxes were raised to get more police officers with a promise that minorities would be a goal of the recruitment class last year he asked how many out of officers were minorities and the answer was he said that he felt betrayed and lied to and the citizens whose taxes were raised were lied to he said that is a smokescreen and this proposal is trying to bring common sense to the equation to make sure the merit board works he said that outside of this building all boards work on a term limit basis he said that the merit law needs to be changed to better reflect this community and he asked colleagues to support proposal no as it is oliver said that this subject has been discussed for quite some time when then director troy came for confirmation in he admitted that it was a broken system with structurally set to produce the outcome there is today he said that many have been dissatisfied with the outcome in terms of recruitment and the merit board they have reverted back to the data and statistics of when the police department was corrupt and a black officer could not arrest a white citizen in this city he said that proposal no will change how operates and will move them forward while this amendment seeks to move them backward he said that the system is broken and they need to make this a progressive city said that he supports the amendment which recognizes the rule which is already done in practice and actually solidifies it in ordinance form he said that the amendment eliminates his concerns regarding conflicts with the existing state law that have been previously discussed scales said that the composition of this current merit board is more diverse than it has ever been with an female black female black male and white female all serving she said that it is very diverse and she is not sure how people can say decisions are not being made with due consideration with this proposal as introduced any officer charged with violating some kind of department policy that goes before the merit board if the vote comes down to a tie the chief of police makes the deciding vote that is like having a prosecutor in a criminal trial determining if the offender is guilty in the case of a hung jury she said that this feature alone is one reason she cannot support the proposal as introduced she said that the merit board is currently a good board with a lot of institutional knowledge and experience as well as diversity said that as the chair of the public safety and criminal justice committee he has received a lot of feedback from the police chief members of the mayors office the fraternal order of police fop and caucus members from both sides of the aisle he said that the one consistent part of this proposal everyone favors is the rule therefore he will support the motion to amend gray said that they have had the rule for years and there is really no reason for debate on that he said that they need to instead debate on all the things that are needed to make the rule work without the support needed to make it work this city will not make any progress he said that the mayor has said that public safety is number one but he has not made it clear that he supports this initiative and without his support he cannot support the mayor clay said that this amendment walks away with of a comprehensive document to make the police department more reflective of the community it serves it provides an opportunity to make equity equality and diversity become the center to this growth and success during slavery everyone had a job but not everyone truly had a job he said that to move forward proposal no needs to stay as it is said that this has been on the agenda for several meetings without resolution an effort was made to compromise but the proponents would not even move a little on some of the smallest issues and now others are finding it hard to support it he said that if the rule is pulled out of proposal no it changes absolutely nothing he said that is at the heart of it and he would ask the caucus to support his amendment said that her good boys reference was to the system and while the current board is diverse the people controlling it are not she said that one example is with the case of officer and how the system protected him then he was arrested twice more on driving under the influence charges she said that either this board or the people behind the board covered it up said that he is concerned that they are invoking the issue of race far too often to the point that when it is really needed it cannot be applied he said that three of the seven members of the board are and one more would make them an actual majority he said that everyone on both sides of the political aisle supports the rule and these other aspects can be worked on later down the road freeman said that he takes absolute pride in anyone who would serve the community in this way and strap on a badge and gun for the amount this city is paying them he said that his heart is full of gratitude to all of them white black man woman gay straight etc he said that this conversation has gone down in a very unproductive way the council voted to raise taxes to put more men and women on the street because they need more officers while he agrees that the force should look like the community they police and diversity is critically important he hopes his children will judge people more on the content of their character and not on the color of their skin when a police officer is needed at his house it does not matter to him what color skin they have their race or their gender moved seconded by fanning to call the question and end debate debate was ended on the following roll call vote viz yeas clay coats fanning freeman gray lewis miller ray scales nays oliver the motion to amend carried on the following roll call vote viz yeas coats fanning lewis miller ray scales nays clay freeman gray oliver said that proposal no was

division by a vote the committee reported the proposal to the council with the made the following friendly amendment motion i move to amend section of proposal no specifically sec a on page of the proposal by deleting the language that is stricken through to read as follows sec division established powers and duties a the division of animal care and control is established within the department of code enforcement the division shall be managed by a deputy director who is appointed by the director in consultation with the mayor the deputy director be a sworn officer detailed to the division the division shall have the powers and duties to operate the animal shelter and to enforce provisions of statutes and ordinances relating to the care treatment and control of animals or as be assigned by the mayor including but not limited to enforcement of chapter regarding animals said that chief convened efficiency teams during this transition and he was fortunate to be a part of one of those teams he said that the animal care and control division has had directors in seven years while the director could be a veterinarian he does not think they should be the veterinarian for as both jobs are demanding the director position is highly demanding as is the job of an active duty police officer and splitting time and energy of one person between two jobs is a disservice seconded the motion and proposal no was amended on the yeas coats fanning lewis miller ray scales nays freeman not voting clay gray oliver made the following motion i move to amend proposal no as amended by deleting section in its entirety general counsel said that this has to do with firearms and asked if as opposed to deleting sec of the code the intent is just to delete it from the proposal which in effect means it is not repealed said that this is correct and it will stay in the code and this proposal simply will not repeal it miller asked about the impact of leaving the vernacular in this section for a role that does not exist anymore said that a few years ago there was controversy with this section about what constituted the police special service district as it was essentially expanded to cover the entire county this just changes the public safety director to the chief of however it is likely that there will be a bill introduced at the next session to clean up some other things that are not in proposal no at this time so it makes sense to clean that up also in that legislation asked special counsel to the mayor for his input on this amendment said that he has not had a chance to look at it but he feels it will be a technical change and he has no objection to it said that this simply strikes out the director of and inserts the chief of and asked why it needs to be deleted said that if they read through it it talks about discharging any weapon inside the at that time was center township but now covers all of county and this would impact all firing ranges and clubs throughout county and could potentially put them out of business said that he does not see anything regarding the discharge of weapons said that a refers to any use other than protection of life said that this section of the code was originally passed in the when the old city limits were referred to as the he said that since that time has expanded to the entire county by readopting this language now they are getting into an issue they do not need to get into since there will be a bill introduced at the meeting he would recommend they go ahead and take this out and then discuss it and address it in the proposal he said that it would not delete the section from the code but would just take it out of this proposal coats agreed and seconded the motion he said that there are still some rural parts of county with livestock and guns are used to protect livestock sometimes from prey he said that the redefinition of the might prevent a property owner from protecting his livestock the motion to amend carried on the following roll call vote viz yeas coats fanning freeman lewis miller ray scales nays clay gray oliver not voting said that while he appreciates the time spent with him and the presentations made in the various committees he still has some concerns about this proposal he said that with the level of reorganization they are looking at he expected to see a much broader plan with a lot of parts and pieces there has been no evidence that shows this will be effective and although they are projecting in cost savings he does not believe that will be the case and actually believes this reorganization will cost more he said that they need to fund more in according to last years budget and they will have the added cost of setting up a new organizational structure with information technology services stationery and other administrative costs he said that he has not seen enough depth in the background findings to support this proposal miller applauded mayor for this proposal and said that this definitely shows that public safety is his first priority he said that he has received nothing but support for this measure from his email list and feels it is an important direction for the city said that brought up the subject of accountability in committee and with the passage of a new structure for the office of audit and performance he pledged to bring forth a
