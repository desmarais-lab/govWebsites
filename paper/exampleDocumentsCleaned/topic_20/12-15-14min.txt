of proposal no general ordinance no stated that the digest for this proposal is very broad but she wants to make it clear that it is a very narrow ordinance and is only related to deer hunts she said that this is an effort to be transparent as they are responsible for the actions of the city in this regard said that he supports the override he said that people felt they did not have time to give any input into the deer kill decision and they were just being told what would happen instead of being given an opportunity for feedback said that eagle creek park is in her district and she feels strongly about issues in the park although she is not an expert on environmental issues this does not address all the problems they have been having in the park and the deer population is just one item she said that the district should be made aware of actions like this and they should not be hearing from their constituents or reading about this kind of news in the newspaper she said that she hopes they can work to make sure district are notified in advance before these types of actions go before the boards although the council does have appointments to these boards for oversight they still need to be kept abreast of decisions coming before the boards echoed statements and said that the park is also in his district and it is embarrassing to get calls from constituents and know nothing about it said that citizens need information about these kinds of actions and it becomes a public safety issue scales said that board members are not elected but are elected to represent the desires of the people and they need to listen to the public on these types of issues said that they are made aware of decisions after the fact and there is again no transparency she said that board members are not held accountable but are this affected a lot of people and they should have been made aware echoed the sentiments expressed by his colleagues miller said that he agrees communication is critically important while he does not want to be responsible for every decision and bog down the process unnecessarily he hopes the administration hears them and keeps them informed of decisions that affect their constituents oliver said that this was a hot item and the administration overreached its authority the public was not allowed to give input on a decision that was already made with of the vote required the motion to override the mayors veto of proposal no failed on the following roll call vote viz yeas clay gray lewis oliver scales nays freeman hunter miller sponsored by and

council passed fiscal ordinance no originally introduced as proposal the annual budget of the consolidated city of and for county budget ordinance and whereas section of the budget ordinance as approved by the council reads as follows whereas the department of metropolitan development of the city of department of metropolitan development has presented the consolidated annual action plan a document submitted to the united states department of housing and urban development which sets forth the goals and intentions for using federal dollars in fiscal year to the council and whereas the consolidated annual action plan identifies the amounts locations and programmatic operation of each project that will be funded by community development grant funds which are summarized in the summary of proposed activities attached hereto as attachment a and incorporated herein by reference and whereas council now finds that the amounts locations and programmatic operations of each project listed in the consolidated annual action plan including insubstantial amendments thereto should be approved now section that the amounts locations and programmatic operations of each of the projects included in the consolidated annual action plan which are summarized in the summary of proposed activities attached hereto as attachment a and incorporated herein by reference are approved section this

revitalization area by an vote the asked where this is located said that it is in her district on th street asked what the cost of giving these benefits is versus what they are getting in return hunt department of metropolitan development said that this is a abatement and the initial estimate is that the company will realize a savings of but will be paying of taxes in that same period and then will be paying in additional taxes annually after the abatement expires he said that the project will also provide new positions at a salary of approximately an hour and will maintain existing jobs at an hour asked for the net benefit to county as it is close to the county line and she is worried many of these new employees will live in county and will not generate the revenue for county worth the abatement hunt said that over of their current employees reside in county and they are committed to working with employ to bring county candidates into the pool and they plan to make the best effort to employ county residents asked if there is a penalty if all the employees are hired from county hunt said that there are penalties if they do not create new positions or retain the existing but there is no penalty regarding residency however they do have a memorandum of understanding with employ to make every effort to hire county residents for these positions gray asked how much it is costing county for these jobs hunt said that they will be foregoing of taxes over a period but if this project was not taking place they would not have some of that additional of taxes generated in the same time frame said that they are not giving anything away and if this company chooses to move across the street and do the project in county then they will be losing taxes they are instead getting tax revenue on property that is currently not paying any taxes asked if this is worth of taxes that are not being paid now hunt said that this is correct and this is tax revenue that would not be paid if the project does not happen asked if other counties also have guidelines and requirements for tax abatements hunt said that they do but county has more asked if this is an industry on the rise and they could expand further hunt responded in the affirmative and said that this is a firm and there is lots of growth potential said that they are not talking millions of dollars and this is an additional in six years and then another a year after that if only of the employees lived in county that would be some jobs available to residents and could result in more jobs in the future hunt said that there could be some service industry jobs generated because of the project but those are not included in these estimates scales said that she tends to view these very judiciously on a far too often these are projects with huge giveaways this is a positive for the far as too often they see businesses cross the county line for more favorable incentives this is a growing industry with lots of potential for more growth and they need to do what they can to insure this business and others like it stay in county said that this is a startup company and asked why a company that grows algae is located here in the heartland and not on the east coast hunt said that the owners are from this area said that these businesses are typically seen on the coast but this company is already here and is growing and expanding they are about to corner the market on a patent that could yield vastly more growth than this after the six years they offer exceedingly well paid salaries and even if half of them were county residents this is an extreme jump in some residents income bracket he said that their presentation to the committee was outstanding said that the company grows algae in tanks and does not need to be located on the coast thanked for the open discussion and said that this kind of information helps change their minds and make good decisions it is also good for the public to hear these comments and understand why this is a good project she thanked everyone for their comments and said that because of them she will support the proposal and feels this is a good use of incentives like this miller encouraged and the public to watch the committee meeting as there were tough questions posed with good answers and an excellent discourse moved seconded by for adoption

revitalization area designation by inc sponsored by scales and approves the statement of benefits of pk partners an applicant for tax abatement in an economic revitalization area by an vote asked how this became an economic revitalization area this property is located near keystone at the crossing which is a wealthy economically thriving area hunt said that the designation was adopted by the metropolitan development commission as per statutory requirements he said that some things considered are a lack of normal growth and development if this property was in the middle of keystone at the crossing he might agree but it is acres to the north east of keystone at the crossing it is a property that has vacant for a long time and has not developed as other areas around it have developed because of its size and shape and drainage issues it has been challenging to develop there are no other large tracts in that vicinity that have not developed so it meets the test for economic revitalization he said that the developer is committing to a significantly greater investment than the portion that is subject to abatement asked if the property would not develop because of drainage issues then if it were not for the abatement hunt said that it could possibly still occur but probably not the high quality nature of what is being proposed he said that one day some type of development could occur on the property that would be financially feasible but he doubts it would be as prosperous as the proposal before them now miller said that he had the same question in committee and if saw a map of the proposed site he would understand how desolate the property is scales said that this is in her district and this land has vacant for years while all surrounding properties have been developed she said that it has a very unusual topography and it is hard for her to even visualize this project on that piece of property she said that it is important to maintain company headquarters in county whenever possible and pk partners is a good company to hold on to pk partners is involved in the community and will work with to lease office space she said that this is a major development and in a cost benefit analysis there will be millions of dollars coming in on the tax rolls because of this asked if the abatement is only on a portion of the planned buildings and not included for the hotel hunt said that this is correct and the abatement is only on the office building for the headquarters of pk partners and and the garage the hotel is not eligible for deductions said that she will support the project because of the tax dollars it will bring in said that this proposal does not make the decision as to whether or not this area is designated as an economic revitalization area that has already been decided this is just about the abatement and the committee felt this project had an enormous return on investment for county he said that he does have concerns about appointed positions on the as the commission was once populated by individuals from many various sources but now most of the members are appointed by one individual this sometimes makes it hard to rely on the result of their decisions yeas clay freeman hunter oliver scales proposal for a general resolution to approve the statement of benefits of pk partners hereinafter referred
