the agenda this evening he added that public testimony was taken during the committee meeting hunter said that the president just indicated the proposal was properly noticed for public hearing yet no

terms for changes she said that she would like to see a more economical approach than spending another said that they are required to redistrict by statute in and the maps drawn late last year do not meet that state mandate said that the redistricting ordinance was signed in and therefore it meets the requirements and they do not need to spend more money on something they just did less than six

that undermined that duty said that he was not here last year he asked if still have access to the software or if they paid for what they do not have said that years ago the software was purchased by the council and made available to the minority party and the public she said that last year the council did not have the rights to the software and only one individual had rights to the license said

has already been done asked if president lewis would allow public testimony this evening since there has been no public testimony on this proposal president lewis said that this item is not under
