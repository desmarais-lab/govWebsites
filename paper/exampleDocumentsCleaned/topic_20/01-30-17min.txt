proposal no the proposal sponsored by lewis miller ray and imposes an additional local income tax rate for a public transportation project as authorized by the voters approval of a local public question on she stated that the proposal has not yet been heard in committee but is scheduled for hearings next month mike terry president and chief executive officer of introduced brown vice president of operations and chief operating officer coo and director of public affairs who provided a brief presentation regarding proposal no brown stated that of county voters approved of the additional tax to help fund public transportation upgrades as a result of the referendum placed on the ballot currently has limited evening and weekend service with long wait times they have a limited capacity to address capital needs such as benches shelters and an aging bus fleet the transit center has helped by adding hours and miles of service as well as amenities for riders operators and the public is committed to maintaining a diverse workforce which is currently minority strategic training and workforce development and permanent jobs said that the referendum for a local option income tax increase was on the county ballot last and was authorized by this proposal would approve that increase and create a public transportation fund that would be controlled by the council and appropriated to through the annual budget process if passed the increase would become effective and would provide longterm dedicated funding to build and operate the public transit network said that in order to fully implement the plan they would utilize the income tax increase dedicated to transit in addition to existing property taxes public mass transportation fund revenues from the state federal taxes and fares they have also applied for a small starts grant for rapid network which would speed up the contribute to infrastructure investments and decrease the bonding required to build stated however that with or without the small starts funding can still build and operate the plan he said that the increase will raise approximately million annually which will allow them to expand operations so that buses are coming more often every day to increase wages and benefits of employees and to provide adequate fuel and maintenance to their fleet capital investments would include new buses both additional and replacements shelters sidewalks and payment technology and bus rapid transit infrastructure such as stations and dedicated bus lanes showed existing route maps and proposed route maps and said that this is about increasing freedom of choice and access to opportunity he showed several graphs of increased bus service in certain areas of the city and stated that the new bus network will provide more frequent trips on every route every day including weekends will allow for faster transfers due to the grid design and will provide rapid lines on high ridership corridors he showed the projected funding and completion dates for capital investment projects both with and without small starts funding bus replacement shelters sidewalks and facilities red line phase purple line blue line phase and red line extensions said that this tax is necessary to implement a new transit network in county and will be a dedicated funding source to build and operate the transit plan president lewis asked the councils general counsel and chief financial officer brown to explain the councils role in this process stated that once such a referendum passes it is the role of this body to decide whether or not to go ahead and impose the tax they are not required to impose the tax regardless of the outcome of the referendum and if they do they are not required to impose the entire amount he said that if the council decides to impose the tax the new rate cannot be more than or less than these new tax revenues would then go into a dedicated fund that can only be used for transportation projects and the council controls the appropriations from that fund brown said that if the tax is imposed it would be available this spring and they could form a budget to be deposited into a special account appropriated by the council if any debt is issued against this tax the tax has to stay in place until that debt is retired as they have to continue to support any debt service they would also have to fund any bus lines created by this plan and continue to fund them every year therefore whatever these tax proceeds fund the council is committing to continuing to fund those services into the future miller said that he is strongly in support of mass transit he said that in order to advance as a city they need to keep in mind that there is a large group of who do not want to rely on transportation by car he said that currently these individuals cannot survive without a car in he said that mass transit is also a major poverty issue and this would make a huge dent towards inclusive growth for the city as mass transit is a critical piece in addressing poverty levels he said that they have to be strategic and have to connect people to their workplace if they ignore this now it will be a long time until they can address it again and he hopes there is overwhelming support for this proposal said that he represents district and although he is not against mass transit he has deep concerns about this proposal he said that he does not believe this plan responds to the individuals in this community he said that they are purporting that this plan will create better jobs and help the poor but this will not help the single mother with two or three kids trying to get by he said that he has never been contacted about the red line he said that college avenue is a great street but he feels that this proposed red line will destroy a good street in this city he thought originally this was supposed to go down keystone which would make more sense but when questioned the planners got arrogant and said they were not going to change it he said that the bus down college avenue travels empty most of the time while a majority of voters overall in county have voted in favor of this increase there were some areas where the majority clearly did not support the increase he said that and individuals are deciding what is best for the in his neighborhood and that does not set well with him said that he is speaking for those who cannot afford this increase he said this plan will also result in raised fares and so individuals who rely on the bus for transportation and have to get their kids to day care and school before heading to work are hit twice and these are the ones who cannot afford it he said that says they can still accomplish this plan without the federal money but he does not believe it and he asked where they will get that extra funding he said that this is not a fiscally sound plan and he wants to see a more fiscally sound proposal that will not leave the city in debt it is not doing anyone any good talking about a few new jobs when this city has so many living below the poverty level starving and homeless and he asked what good this transit plan will do for those who simply cannot afford it said that has detailed financial documentation and he is happy to meet with to talk about the assumptions contained in that paperwork he said that there will be some adjustment of fares over the longterm but only about a cent adjustment possibly over an period asked about the date this tax goes into effect and why it was selected he said that he is wondering how the blue line phase ii could be moved up he added that he does support the mass transit plan brown said that if they pass it by then an effective date would give them three months to notify all affected businesses before it takes gray said that has said that of the funds for this plan must come from fares he asked if this is realistic said that the fare box recovery in the statute covers the direct operating expenses of the expanded service he said that in their current operating budget they sit at approximately to of total cost from fares they believe that these improvements will attract more ridership and they will easily hit that requirement he said that there are several requirements per statute that they must comply with and they are committed to doing so gray said that he chairs the municipal corporations committee and when came before their committee to present their budget last fall they were short and could not make ends meet now all of a sudden they are telling the council they have all this money he asked about private dollars included in this plan said that they are working to establish a foundation to offset expenses but for sake they did not assume the availability of this money in their financial projections he said that they are required however to provide of costs to come from nonpublic revenue gray asked if they have already started raising money for this foundation said that the foundation will not be created until after this is approved gray said that he does not believe the numbers add up and would also like more clarification on the financial analysis said that he represents franklin township and their greatest need is stronger infrastructure he said that he feels these tax dollars can be better spent and he believes as governor has said that if they are going to ask for any more dollars they should make sure they use what they have already been given in the way it was intended he said that there is a lack of mass transit service to his constituents and the new plan does not provide any substantial increase to his constituents the residents in his area overwhelmingly voted against the referendum and he will stand with them scales said that she has not been able to fully support this plan because she believes the routes that should be first on the list for service enhancement are th street and street which are the purple and blue lines these areas have the highest population that is totally dependent on public transportation and those should be the priorities instead of enhancements on routes in value areas she said that adding bus lanes in narrow roadways should be reconsidered as this will reduce major roadways to one driving lane in each direction and will only increase automobile congestion and hinder arrival time she would recommend that they employ curbside service before millions of dollars are spent on permanent infrastructure that leaves limited flexibility for future advancements in transportation she said that she represents an area where the blue green and purple lines were set aside for years as a priority in mass transit plans but now the green line no longer even appears in the proposed plan and is no longer considered any kind of priority she said that millions of dollars went into these previous studies and north college avenue was never a priority in any transit plan prior to now it is deemed the highest priority and the green line does not even factor into the plan she said that she believes they need to consider what level of a tax increase is warranted and they need to fully vet the transit plans presented and investigate how they might achieve intended goals with a lower cost to taxpayers and allow for adjustments with future technologies in mind oliver said that he held two town hall meetings before the referendum and it seemed the red line was the main emphasis he asked if the red line has already been funded or is a part of this increase and how much impact the federal funding has on the building of the blue and purple lines said that the income tax will fund the of the blue purple and red lines the federal funding will allow them to do that quicker but they will still do it without the federal funding oliver asked for an explanation of the purple and blue lines said that the purple line begins in near ft and continues south on post road turning west on th street over to meridian street south he said that the meridian street corridor comprises of their ridership and overlapping the red and purple lines on meridian street will meet that demand with quicker travel times the blue line begins in and travels along street through downtown with branch rapid transit opportunities extending to road one branch further west to high school road and one branch line operating express to the airport oliver asked if the blue line is the only one that travels to the airport said that this is correct oliver asked about the frequency of the blue and purple lines said that without federal funding the blue line would operate at minute intervals at the airport and every minutes east of road the purple line would operate every minutes but the overlap of the purple and red lines on meridian would mean a frequency between buses oliver said that of his district voted for the referendum so he will be supporting the proposal fanning said that she agrees that infrastructure is a big concern in this city but it is her understanding that this dedicated funding could be used for street improvements along the bus route said that this is correct and the role of the federal funding is that it grows the overall pot of investment he added that of the red line project is for street repair curbs and sidewalks and this will mean a bigger impact for the city fanning asked if even without the federal funding they could use this tax for infrastructure said that this is correct but the impact would be more modest as they could do less without the added federal funding fanning said that there are a lot of misconceptions and misinformation about this plan this is not a flippant plan as it has been years in the making and has been and it is true that some districts will benefit more and this plan is not perfect but a plus increase in bus availability is huge she said that college avenue was created as a transit corridor to connect midtown to downtown and it makes sense to use that connection she said that her district supported the referendum and she will support this plan she said that this increase represents a median increase of about a year per person and that is much cheaper than buying an automobile fanning asked to be added as a cosponsor said that he is fairly supportive of mass transit even though his district voted in majority against the referendum he said that he does see some overall potential for the city but still has some concerns about infrastructure the proposed funding and the possibility of debt issuance however he is keeping an open mind and will reserve his questions for upcoming committee meetings president lewis asked that not call for a vote on this matter this evening to give time for public input as well as more information and input at upcoming committee hearings she called for public testimony at pm of chamber said that the chamber represents businesses and was part of the coalition that supported this as a priority issue for this city they have worked on it for over a decade beginning in under he said that their members view this as a top priority is the th largest city in the country but only has the rd largest bus fleet ranking below mission and on investment per capita he said that of business leaders list limited transit services as a key reason for limiting the regions growth he said that this is about getting people to work and they have heard from employers such as who have struggled to fill open positions at the airport because of long bus commute times to the airport he said that this transit plan will significantly improve transit access to the airport and many other places of employment around the city and the chamber wholeheartedly supports this proposal metropolitan board of stated that mass transit has been the longest running issue has worked for that has not yet seen the light of day he said that this city needs to do a better job of connecting people and jobs providing better access to housing and promoting neighborhood redevelopment an efficient transit system is an essential piece to the quality of life as it eases the burden of transportation costs for residents allows the aging population to stay in their homes longer and attracts looking for communities with reliable mass transit he added that will pledge funds to the requirement of private sector funding he urged the council to support the advocacy chair for the exchange at the urban league said that the urban league supports mass transit as it is ultimately about access more reliable mass transit would allow a janitor at the convention center access to broad ripple a downtown resident young professional access to entertainment on the weekends and a government employee access from one side of town to the other without going downtown for a transfer he said that mass transit is not just for working people but for individuals trying to find a job or wanting access to the amenities he said that for those returning home after incarceration who have difficulty obtaining a license mass
