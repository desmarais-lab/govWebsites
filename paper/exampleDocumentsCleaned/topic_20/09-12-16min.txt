specifically sec manner of parking be and the same is hereby amended by the addition of the following senate avenue on the west side from street to avenue proposal no reported that the administration and finance lewis expresses the intent of the consolidated city and county to issue bonds in an amount not to exceed million to reimburse prior expenditures of various city departments and county agencies with bond proceeds by a vote the committee reported the proposal to chair asked ms and city controller to briefly explain the intent of the proposal ms said that this proposal does not issue bonds but that is something they hope to bring back to the council to issue bonds before the end of the year this proposal is simply asking the council to approve reimbursement of expenses on certain approved projects if these bonds are eventually approved for issuance said that they are proposing a viable option for the budget to remove certain capital expenditures from the operating budget he said that they will introduce another proposal with the actual bond issuance and projects detailed and this proposal simply authorizes reimbursement if the bonds are ultimately approved by the council brown chief financial officer for the council stated that these reimbursements are for expenses already approved through the budget process and are not for any projects not already in the budget he said that they are simply reimbursements for projects such as the system which is already in the sheriffs budget freeman said that this makes absolutely no sense he asked why they are considering bonding for funding for projects that have already been approved he said that this is not all already approved spending the controller told him that the fire department was getting million more to build two new fire stations yet they are closing two fire stations that are already paid for to build new ones and these expenses are not already approved the mayor likes to tout a balanced budget spending less money than last year but they really cannot say that they are spending less money or being fiscally prudent when they are bonding million in order to be able to sustain this lowered budget he said that the city should not be in the business of bonding he said if they need to bond to fund specific projects that are desperately needed such as the cad computer aided dispatch system then they should come to the council show them the need and the justification and ask for approval he said that this is giving the administration a blank check and he cannot support the proposal miller said that he watched the committee meeting and was planning to support the proposal but he has some real concerns about the wording official intent in the proposal this is more than just saying they are okay with reimbursements should they choose to issue bonds he agrees they should be proactive and smart and the reimbursement makes sense but he does not know why this wording is included he said that if he agrees to officially declare his intent to issue bonds and then later finds out once the details are provided that he does not like the idea of bonding for these particular projects he feels he cannot go against the official intent he said that he would be able to support the proposal to allow for greater flexibility in reimbursements if they could change that language but with that language he cannot support it before saying he intends to do he would like all information up front and a description of possible projects is not enough information and he feels he said that he understands they deal with the public works projects separately and he does not object to that but these are still a part of the budget as million worth of projects are needed general counsel said that this is not binding and the proposal is phrased that way because that is the way the internal revenue service regulations are phrased he said that this proposal does not endorse or the bonds in anyway it simply says if and when the bonds are passed it is to go back days from today to reimburse such capital expenditures as the voting machines which have already been approved for payment ms said that this is not binding and it cannot be enforced but simply sets it up so that ongoing expenditures can be reimbursed if and when the council decides to issue bonds in order to take pressure off budgets next year she said that many of the projects will have to be paid for anyway but if they choose not to issue bonds the expenditures will be paid out of operating budgets and they do not have as much flexibility bond counsel stated that they are simply complying with treasury regulations in order to issue bonds they will have to come back before the council with at least two if not three different resolutions and ordinances which will involve a lengthy process with several meetings and public hearings stretching into in a scenario if this is passed this evening and bonds are not issued then this proposal has no effect gray said that all administrations and council members have an opinion of how best to do things but this is a good deal for the city as they are not creating any new debt he encouraged his colleagues to support the proposal and move forward with a flexible reimbursement plan coats said that he cannot support this proposal specifically because of the inclusion of million bonding for public works projects he said that the city received an additional distribution from the state of million million of which must be used for roads in talking to various legislators he has no reason to believe they will back off the requirement that this million must be used for roads gray said that they are talking about two different things and this has nothing to do with the million distribution chair encouraged his colleagues to read the minutes of the meeting as there are eight pages dedicated to this proposal he said that the committee did a good job in thoroughly vetting this proposal and asking tough questions and they did not shortchange this council said that he cannot support this proposal he said that this proposed bond issuance is for million with an approximate year bond life as relayed in testimony at the committee hearing he said that the document given to regarding what this bond would fund includes the cad system which will cost million for a system with a year life span he said that the voting machines are on the list and they have already been financed and approved but there is million on this list for equipment with a year life he said that he is not sure any technology equipment has a year life expectancy anymore he said that there is million for police vehicles and fire apparatus he said that the proposed aerial truck is suggested to have a life but most have a year life he said that he finds this list to be inaccurate and they are talking about bonding for years for things that will not even last the length of the bonds he said that they cannot pay bills today using future dollars that outlast viable assets he said he knows the city is in a tight financial situation and this is an attempt to be creative in solving some of those financial woes but he cannot support this solution said that he will support this proposal this evening but wants to go on record that as it has been presented today he will be voting no on the issuance of bonds for roads projects when they have million already available to them for those projects miller said that the committee did do a great job vetting this proposal but he is not a lawyer and his constituents will not understand this kind of commitment even if the does ask for that specific language he said that something this important should go to all council members and not just one committee clay asked if he is correct in his understanding that this only provides a provision for reimbursement and in no way binds the council to issue bonds he asked if the city will come back later and drill down on particulars brown said that this is correct he said that this is not a fiscal ordinance and does not authorize the spending of any money he added that the term is not necessarily years and the council will see separate bond issuances and the term life will depend on the life of the assets clay asked if when this comes back in the form of a fiscal ordinance if it will go through the normal committee process brown said that it will and that it can be amended if the council so wishes throughout that process coats said that he is fully aware that this proposal is not about the million in the rainy day fund but it makes no sense to borrow million which is proposed by this bond issuance plan for road infrastructure when they have in the bank ready to go dedicated for that purpose he said that it makes no sense said that this does not authorize the council or the departments to spend money and she supports it as it will free up operating monies she said most corporations spread capital improvement projects out over several years and do not include them in their operating budgets she said that she agrees it would have been nice to have more details on the projects but if they do not approve this they cannot reimburse monies for some projects she said if ultimately the council does not agree with the bond issuance plan they can scratch this whole thing said that the plan proposes bonding million for roads she does not understand why they would be willing to pay a debt service when they already have money in hand that could be spent without paying interest she asked how much interest would be paid on this million bond over its lifetime ms said that it would be difficult to precisely calculate she said that there is favorable borrowing right now and it would depend on the principal amount interest rates now are between and but there are too many variables to predict exactly as the bonds could be structured in many different ways such as paying more upfront or at the end asked if issuing the bonds piecemeal for these projects would increase the issuance costs ms said that it would said that from her experience the interest usually equates to the original amount of the bonds she said that this is like her daughter asking to borrow but she does not know if she is going to spend it at or at freeman said that he appreciates the need to come up with new ideas but this is wrong he said that giving agencies the ability to spend money and tell them they will take care of them later is not good practice he said that some of these agencies have already spent the money he said that this reminds him of legislation back in or when they were told they must pass the flood insurance proposal or citizens would lose their flood insurance he said that he does not want a gun pointed to his head making a decision down the road they are giving them the ability to spend money and they will come back and say the council told them of their intent to reimburse them back in and then the council will have to come up with the money to pay the bill that is why he opposes the proposal said that no one buys a car or house and then goes to the bank and asks them to give them the money to pay for it after the fact she said that the state already gave the city money for roads and she feels they could give some range of expected interest to be paid on these bonds said that what they are considering with this proposal is disgraceful the mayor has been touting unprecedented budget savings but nothing has really been cut now that they see the full picture the mayor wants to spend an additional million off the books in the form of issuing debt ninety minutes ago members were given one sheet of paper with a thumbnail sketch of how these bond proceeds will be spent one of those items is road infrastructure there is over million in additional distribution from the state with million specifically earmarked for road infrastructure it would be fiscally irresponsible for them to mortgage their future when they have the money in the bank he urged his colleagues to oppose the proposal gray said that for four years the republicans spent money like water and they still do not know how much was spent or where it all went agreed and said that this is about transparency and the council had no say in money spent on or a cricket field he said that he supports the proposal said that this is not about past administrations because if it were they are still paying on a million debt from former mayor administration it is best to look forward and it is not wise to take out bonds in this amount for something they already have money for asked his colleagues to tread lightly on this new show of fiscal conservatism by the republicans when it was absent the last four years he said that this bond issuance will come back in multiple proposals and will get the opportunity to vote on each priority as
