ruling this year by a federal court ruled that a portion of sign ordinance are likely unconstitutional due to the recent passage he said that these portions of the ordinance need to be fixed so that the federal district court does not strike them down and leave without rules in place or open to lawsuits passage of these two proposals will allow them to meet those requirements and will not interfere with the comprehensive review of the sign ordinance which will continue in the works asked if this affects digital billboard regulations at all said that it has no impact on digital billboards freeman said that there was some original language that was included that caused him some concern and he tried to get that discussion regarding digital billboards to progress he said that they have to fix this issue the supreme court has said they have to pass these initiatives tonight but a bigger conversation about billboards needs to occur he said that it seems when something fits a desire of the right people it is allowed but if not it is not such as the digital billboards allowed at the state fairgrounds but not at the county fairgrounds said that those constituents who reached out to him have expressed their support of this proposal and he therefore supports it miller agreed and said that the county alliance of neighborhood associations has reviewed it also and supports it

of a general revenue note in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed for the purpose of providing funds to be applied to pay a portion of the planning costs incurred in connection with a proposed criminal justice center and appropriating the proceeds thereof by a vote the committee reported the due to some recent communication with office staff moved seconded by to postpone proposal no until asked if someone from the administration could explain the time sensitivity of this issue chief of staff office of the mayor said that if a vote is delayed until the council meeting then funds to pay these bills would be delayed until the day before their ability to acquire funds before the end of the year and pay those invoices would be very difficult he said that they have agreed to work with the councils general counsel and chief financial officer as well as county auditor to review these bills before being paid but there is definitely a time sensitivity involved and the quicker they get approval the better said that he has concerns about brown and general counsel not seeing the invoices he said that this is a lot of money and they need to make sure that what they are approving for payment they have seen and have had time to review it and ask questions he said that he supports the motion for delay to be sure what they are voting on said that this proposal would allow the city to move forward and secure the proceeds but brown and would still be reviewing the invoice before any are paid he said that he gave his assurance that they would have to sign off before any dollar walks out the door said that personally he feels they need to do their due diligence at the minimum before approving this action asked if brown is comfortable moving forward with the information he has brown said that he has no reason not to trust the controller and even though he has disagreed with some things the administration has done in the past neither of them have ever told him one thing and then done another he said that if they agree to work with ms to be the final clearing house to make sure the invoices also meet her requirements that is the only way he would feel comfortable going forward by having that additional check in place asked if is okay with that stipulation said that they are and he has no problem including ms for multiple checks and agrees to do so said that during the they were given assurances that no money would be moved and then a wire transfer to regions back to showed up he said that they be able to have some trust but with all due respect they need to still lock their doors asked if the auditor does not already review those bills brown said that she does and with the lawsuit she actually stopped payment and has the ability to do that he said that this is a little different than the incident as the word was directly given to them this time by both the office of corporation counsel and the office of finance and management as well as he said that the auditor does review all bills that go out of the city with the exception of tax increment financing funding gray asked if any of these funds are coming from funding brown said that it is an option and is an example where the auditor would not have oversight freeman said that he longs for the day when they are not put between a rock and a hard place he said that he does not believe enough due diligence was done on the front end and now they are contemplating paying bills for something that did not get built it drives him crazy that they are in this situation he does not disagree that the situation is awful but these are invoices that were charged and the city owes this money and they have an obligation to pay it it is ridiculous that they have to pay it but they have to honor that he said that he would like to see this passed so that there is no threat to defaulting on these bills if the auditor is reviewing the charges he believes this is a step in the right direction the thought of delaying payment and risking being sued does not make a lot of sense to him he longs for a day when they all work together and things like this do not happen anymore like they do at every level of government from congress on down said that with congress there is a difference as the council did not approve these expenditures asked for clarification that ms has control of the checkbook on these invoices brown said that if the million goes into this fund the city can draw off those monies but the auditor would have to sign off on them all of the invoices would have to be signed off on by him and the auditor asked what would happen if they did not agree with an said that if there is a concern about an invoice an audit can be conducted he stated that they are in complete agreement with that and and the council staff can work with a vendor to insure the city got the services they were billed for asked who would make that ultimate decision said it would be the auditor brown agreed and said that they would get an outside auditor for an opinion on the bill asked if this is the case why it would hurt to postpone the proposal said that some can be paid immediately and instead of a delay and possible default they would prefer to get those items paid he said that if they delay with the other bills they will take some time to review them and that process will also be longer asked if brown agrees with this assessment brown said that he does and if there was further questions they would ultimately come the council asked why they do not have the numbers already said that they do have copies of all the invoices and a summary of high level versions have been shared he said that he thinks the issue is regarding the actual agreements from some of these law firms and city controller simply dropped the ball in getting these to and brown before this meeting oliver asked if an undocumented bill is submitted if that is fraud said that if someone submitted an invoice for work they did not do it would be fraud brown said that in that case they would not pay the invoice said that he was told an original contract for million had a final invoice of million he asked how they can make sure they are paying what is actually due he said that his support of postponement is so that they can get a look at it the taxpayers deserve to know what they are paying for miller asked how they could not know already if someone was owed million or million said that this issue is with regard to two original contracts with law firms with amounts one had an amount not to exceed million but was billed for million and the other had a not to exceed amount of million and the city was billed for million he said that this is the reason they asked for supplements and amendments to those contracts they cannot legally increase those amounts unless a supplement or amendment was done in writing and he does not know if they exist to justify the increase miller said that he is totally lost as to why they have not gotten this information at this point said that the original contracts were signed at the beginning the first of additional work was required after that and those amendments and were sent to them but have not yet been forwarded to he said that he assumes they will be in his hands by tomorrow miller asked if they will not pay this additional however until they do get the information requested he said that he cannot understand why something this important was not important enough that it was overlooked said that they will not be paid until brown and ms agree that they should be paid asked if the million amount includes the million invoice or the million contract said that it includes the full amount of the invoices gray said that here they are at the midnight hour trying to pay bills he asked why they did not submit this earlier to have these debates and time to review these invoices more carefully said that when it was first discussed they were asked for supplemental information and dropped the ball in getting that information to council staff gray said that because the controller dropped the ball the council is now being asked to pick it up scales said that she understands million was already paid to some of these law firms she asked where those funds came from said that they came from multiple sources and some came due to the rent for this building being deferred as discussed during the referred to monies and asked who will decide where the money is pulled from brown said that the metropolitan development commission can authorize payments from and they are paid by the controller and do not have to go through the auditors office said that if they use million of money they will then have not checks and balances on this amount brown said that he assumes he and the controller would still review them for these bills but the auditor would not said that she is aware of the time sensitivity but she would prefer that checks and balances discussed actually be written into the proposal adding the auditors signing off on payment of these bills president lewis said that such an amendment would need to be in writing on the council floor for consideration said that he does not have anything in writing at this time and is not sure what such an amendment would say gray said that such an amendment would not address the million that could be spent from funds said that this proposal is essentially to get the funds lined up and prepared to go so that they can then be paid if approved brown said that passing this proposal means they could go ahead and issue the notes deposit the funds and hold them in the account they would then be subject to review by himself the controller and the auditor he said that everything can still be reviewed and an outside auditor can be hired if needed asked if the motion to postpone fails if they can consider the option to pass with certain assurances in place urged his colleagues to embrace idea and vote against the motion to postpone asked if further discussion will be allowed if the motion to postpone does not pass the president answered in the affirmative the motion to postpone proposal no failed on the following roll call vote viz yeas clay gray lewis oliver nays freeman hunter miller scales absent asked if it would be possible to recess to consider an amendment suggested that alternately since the agenda is lengthy they move proposal no later in the agenda and those who wish to draft an amendment can take time to work on that together moved

that it helps cover character for the th pay and overtime costs citizen asked when these dollars are appropriated who has jurisdiction over how they are spent said that the and agency heads would have that authority asked if they are truly for public safety purposes and if the mayor has any jurisdiction over these dollars said that they are allocated within a character within a department and cannot be moved for another purpose wade citizen said that history has shown that this mayor can do whatever he wants and he has access to this money he asked that the council freeze any appropriations until the first of the year and do an investigation and audit of everything he said that he is deeply bothered by further appropriations citizen said that he works in the area of finance and the city is already operating on shoestring budgets and they are dealing with these proposals he said that foresight makes good business and makes terrible messes and he asked them to

neighborhoods where the median income is below what is the median income said that he does not know offhand what the median income is but the intent is to help impoverished areas arts council of said that they are working with partners to look at additional neighborhoods targeted for increased community develop he said that these projects can help address issues of blight crime and employment opportunities as well oliver asked about the projects said that they will work with neighborhoods and the projects could be a mural a sculpture a performance or even a neighborhood festival he said that they will work with neighborhoods and artists to develop something that specifically benefits that particular community the best added that all ideas would come from the neighborhoods not the council or the arts council oliver asked much money will be in this account said that it would depend on how many projects are done based on the last four years of project this fund would have had about a million dollars oliver asked if the project does not have to happen in that particular district to get the funds but if other areas could apply for them responded in the affirmative and said that the funds can be used said that this is why he offered a resolution earlier for the poetry slam he said that he is excited about this program because it could cultivate young peoples ability to communicate the arts are an excellent way to communicate and they can be a stabilizing force for this council has given enormous subsidies for luxury housing in the downtown area and the arts could benefit from this he said that communities are struggling economically and this could bring some very positive things into the communities clay said that they often use poverty and children at risk to generate great ideas but often the idea ends up one place and the implication ends up elsewhere he asked if the arts council would serve as the fiduciary agent for these dollars said that this is correct and they would serve as they do with the arts grants and would report to the council clay said that the qualifier is a median income at less than yet no one seems to know what that median income is said that he just looked it up on his phone and median income is clay said that those making of that would then qualify said that it would be neighborhoods where most of their residents make less than that clay asked what neighborhoods that would be said that he does know specific neighborhoods that would qualify at this time he said that the intent is to make these projects available to the entire community to enjoy freeman said that he has no issue with the arts and voted to fund the arts however this is one more restriction being placed on developers by charging of the value of the project to fund the arts the cost of this however will get passed on to the person buying a home or renting an office he said that a lot of this is going on already and they are putting a lot of restrictions on the people who build and develop this county while it is this places another burden on business and development and therefore he opposes the proposal said that they have public parks in shambles no source of food or grocery stores in neighborhoods and communities without sidewalks whose citizens are getting killed from walking in the street he said that if they want to identify extra resources to fund initiatives they have bigger needs that greater affect the quality of life in the neighborhoods he said that arts are a great thing but they should be prudent and allocate their resources to bigger priorities scales agreed and said that it was testified that various neighborhoods are standing in line for projects such as this but they already give a million dollars to arts for public use every year and in the past couple of years have been the beneficiary of million from the foundation in addition to that she said that there are more important needs to be addressed in this city and any new revenue source should go toward the most important needs hunter said that the arts council grants have shown that arts has the ability to look at reentry possibilities crime prevention and other quality of life issues he said that this is a smart innovative proposal and the make sense he said that this is already going on and there are some developers who are already doing this however this formalizes the process and provides one central point with a real focus and strategy instead of errant strategies especially with regard to programming he said that he supports the proposal said that he also supports the proposal and instead of talking about all the other needs this community has some of his colleagues need to fashion their own proposals to meet and address those needs that they feel strongly about said that the arts do so much more than just arts and he is very proud of this one thing that makes people feel good is something positive in their neighborhood and that is what art does scales said that she cannot believe is urging his colleagues to come up with their own ideas when her proposal in his committee tabled for two years and he would not allow it to be heard and would not give her even the respect to return her emails or phone calls about it that proposal would provide a grocery store in a food desert and she had to it after he let it fall of the calendar she said that she has initiated proposals to address real needs clay asked what they can do to insure that the targeted people are recipients of these dollars said that this will be a similar approach as with the prekindergarten proposal these dollars will go into a reserve fund for those who do not have access to these kinds of resources the parks and recreation committee will have oversight over that fund and although he will no longer be serving on the council to make sure that is happening he would encourage his returning colleagues to withhold funds if it is not happening that way clay said that this body does a great job in appropriating dollars for city services but they need to look at the accountability after an appropriation has been made oliver said that he is concerned about reporting and disclosure he asked if he can go by the arts council office at any moment to find out what is going on said that are welcome to do so at any time and they will manage these like the arts grants program and keep record of every dollar he asked the council to help them meet some needs they cannot meet now and said that he is anxious to get started said that each has special interests and it would be wonderful if they could fund them all she commended for creating a new funding source and encouraged other to continue to look for other ways to fund other initiatives and asked for the rationale behind excluding affordable housing projects from this proposal said that the specific intent was to be supportive of low income areas said that this causes him some concern he supports the arts and the arts councils management of grants but to say it is important and then excluding some developments causes him some concern moved seconded by gray

by law asked for consent to abstain from voting on this proposal due to a possible perceived conflict of interest with his new law firm asked if it could say to insure it is not diverted for other uses said that the language already provides that it not be used for any other purpose said that she would still want this language included to support it said that the word can be added between the words separate and account if that makes more comfortable asked if and brown are okay with this amendment as amended and brown indicated that they are said that this language is irrelevant because once the money is transferred as in the past mayor does what he wants with the money he said that this is an operation in futility and these bills are fraudulent and should be prosecuted yeas freeman hunter lewis miller oliver scales nays clay gray not voting absent miller said that he hopes they have learned a lesson from this that if they put this amount of time up front they would not be in this situation the president called for public testimony on the amended version said that this is a misappropriation of funds and there were sections in the contract referring to contingencies that if the project failed they would not get paid and they should not get paid said that he is surprised they are contemplating paying this fraudulent bill he said that he does not understand the urgency and it seems there is someone from this he said that there is a connection between an individual and one of these law firms and he hopes that is not the reason they are passing it he said that what they are doing is illegal said that he agrees with miller and this council should demand that the administration not take advantage and communicate better they are now spending million on a deal entered into unilaterally said that million has already been paid out he asked if that is included in this million or if that is on top of that million said that in addition to this million million has already been paid up the invoice totals on these is actually million but it was rounded up to include interest and a possible audit he said that the full bill is about million asked what the original contract totals were brown said that they were million but some had built in additional payments if the deal closed asked why they are paying out million if the original was million brown said that this insures that they retain the work product and this amendment gives them the ability not to pay some of these extra costs if they do not receive adequate documentation of additional work hunter said that the language is moot as it has to be used for that purpose as per the department of local government finance guidelines said that this is correct as it is a dedicated fund hunter said that this project blossomed so out of control that he could no longer support it but the work was done and employees worked on projects he said that it is a hard pill to swallow but government should also pay their bills said that this would have been a bill even if the justice center project went through it just would have gone into the loan she is not happy about it but it has to be paid and they should move on oliver asked what work was done to accumulate million in fees said that the additional fees were stipends to pay the three bidders buying the work product they created such as design specs documents sketches financial analysis technical and legal analyses he said that they will then be able to use some of this work product if they decide to proceed with a criminal justice center in the future oliver asked if this is customary for a project said that it is in line with a project of this size and the bills were incurred over a two and a half year period oliver said that it makes no sense to spend million for nothing said that there were studies done on mental health needs and other areas of the sheriffs department that will be beneficial and all that information is the to keep and can be used in the future said that they would have paid million in contract fees if the work got done and now are paying million for work that did not get done brown said that this was always going to be the amount they had to pay regardless if the project panned out or not the cost was about million and the additional million were the stipends to the bidders for their work product there were some increases in some of the contracts land costs and other smaller contracts said that part of the problem with the project was that financial numbers did not add up it makes sense in theory but not in reality he said shame on them if they pass this and instead they need to investigate the person who penned this lopsided deal asked where in have they ever paid for any bid said that the overall project costs were pretty common for a project of this size he said that the stipends were an option the vendors could select in exchange for the city retaining all the work they had done and they all selected to opt in for that additional stipend said that he will vote against this and challenged anyone to show him another bid that was this high for any project in moved seconded by to
