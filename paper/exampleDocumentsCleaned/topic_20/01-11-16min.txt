living units proposal no reported that the rules and public policy was adopted by the full council on and subsequently vetoed by former mayor on the proposal sponsored by former amends the code by adding a new sec regarding the reporting of lost or stolen firearms moved seconded by to override the mayors veto of proposal no oliver said that the federal government has attempted to regulate an cold medicine because it is used to make drugs that have proved deadly to people he said that weapons would fall into this same category and he would think that a responsible gun owner would want it known if their weapon had been lost or stolen he said that the only reason he can think of for not reporting it lost or stolen is if they are sharing it with a person who cannot get one legally and they are shielding that person miller said that he has been anxiously waiting to hear from the new mayor or the new police chief on this issue and has not heard any comments from them he said that he does not feel it is necessary to vote on these issues until they hear from them and he would prefer they work with the new administration to see if they concur with this action clay said that this proposal is reasonable proportionate measurable and logical he said that individuals report animals that are lost and other items of value and he would imagine that reasonable gun owners will not see this as an additional burden but rather as a responsibility and he does not think that this action is overreaching in any way said that it was testified that this would help identify where guns might have come from if they were used in a crime but there is already a mechanism in place now to research that information he said that they have a group of detectives now in the metropolitan police department who track this on a regular basis he said that while people do report valuable items or animals as lost or stolen there is no law requiring it and no fine associated if they do not report it he said that he does not see value in this proposal and the way that it is written makes it the responsibility of to capture the data and enforce it even within the excluded cities he said that it is not the national rifle association that will engage in suing the city but rather an individual exercising their rights he said that this proposal impedes on state statute and the deputy city attorney testified in committee about the risk the city could incur should this pass he added that the reasons articulated by mayor for his veto are valid and the way to prevent gun violence is to educate people on gun safety said that it is amazing that members of this body can act like crime is not an issue in this community maybe it is not happening in some districts but it is happening in his community and he is tired of the killing wanting to know where guns are coming from seems like common sense and if the violence was an issue in every district they would feel his pain he said that they do whatever they can to prevent suicides and overdoses but if it goes against the all of a sudden they are afraid to do anything fanning said that the violence in crime is in all their districts and almost all areas of the county have had fatal shootings in the past year it is a huge issue and very important however she recently participated in a with some officers and it was their unanimous opinion that this legislation would not help them combat crime but instead would be one more piece of administration they would have to deal with she said that in actuality it does not prevent the use of weapons or crime from happening and it does not really allow them to adequately track the weapons she said that they need to instead strengthen the penalties for those who commit crimes with illegal weapons and address drug addiction and other crime factors said that he agrees with clay and oliver and urged his colleagues to vote to override the veto said that she is elected to speak for her district and her credit union was robbed at gunpoint and she can hear gun shots from her home she said that crime affects every district however before she can support this legislation she needs to see some data about where these guns are coming from that are used in crimes she said that she does not believe this will have any real impact on crime and therefore will not be supporting the vote to override the veto oliver asked if an owner of a handgun can be charged with a penalty or held accountable if it is used by someone else in an unlawful crime and was lost or stolen said that he does not know he said that there be some civil liability but he assumes there would have to be some proven fault on the part of the owner oliver asked if the prosecutor could not charge the owner in this case said that it would depend on the level of the owners knowledge and participation and they would not be charged simply because they were the registered owner oliver asked if they could say they did not know it was stolen or lost and therefore that would be enough to satisfy the prosecutor said that it would be subject to circumstances and there is no way of knowing gray said that it seems a double standard that they would favor the three strikes and out approach with the crack cocaine epidemic a few years ago and now are supporting clean needle programs with the arrival of heroin but can be so against something that might solve the problem of violent crimes and homicides he said that it amazes him that elected officials would be so negative about prevention and so positive about punishment president lewis called for a vote on the motion to override and stated that yea votes are needed to override the veto the council failed to override the veto on the following roll call yeas clay gray lewis oliver nays coats fanning freeman miller ray scales absent proposal no reported that the administration and finance committee heard proposal no on the proposal was adopted by the full council on and was subsequently vetoed by former mayor on the proposal sponsored by and increases the compensation of the mayor and the council moved seconded by to override the veto said that he finds irony in the mayors reasoning that this took place after the election in the dark of night when the redistricting plan was handled in the same way in coats said that he has talked with many city employees who have not received raises in over seven years he said that the city is struggling with a million structural deficit and while this seem a small amount in the grand scheme of things voting to give themselves a raise is not a picture he wants to paint miller said that it is interesting that the mayor refers to the council as doing this in the dark of night when it received lots of news coverage and certainly more coverage than when he gave his senior staff a year increases he said that he had no problem with the mayor giving his people a raise because competitive salaries are needed to attract talent he said that he is a single dad and it is tough to do this job while raising a young son without raising the salary they are creating a job that no one can hold unless they are independently wealthy he said that some employees might have gone without raises for seven years but it has been years since the councils salary was raised which is over twice that he said that being a is a lot of work and it is infuriating that the mayor would take away their home rule this is the council budget and should be an internal decision he said that with four positions dropped there is some funding for this action and he believes the mayors veto is out of place said that this raise was brought up at the last minute even though there was plenty of opportunity to consider it earlier last year giving the community time to comment on it and giving them the time to work it into the budget properly he said that he was under the impression that due to the elimination of the four positions that the personal services character funding was reduced during the budget process however in committee it was testified that this money was in character in order to fund an increase they would need to transfer it back to character and then still find extra dollars to fund the rest he said that he would hope they would be better stewards of the taxpayers money and allocate funds more appropriately he said that the information the fiscal staff presented at committee was good information in regard to comparison with other cities but this information was not distributed in the community if this body decides to raise their own pay they need a detailed analysis of their finances to go out to the public for input and documentation of such an important decision president lewis called for a vote on the motion to override and reminded members that yea votes are needed to override the veto the council failed to override the veto on the following yeas clay gray lewis miller
