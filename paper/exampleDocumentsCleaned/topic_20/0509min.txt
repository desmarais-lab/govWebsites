reported that the health and environment committee heard proposal no on several occasions holding four public forums and several other informational meetings culminating with a vote on the proposal sponsored by and amends the code by establishing nonsmoking areas by a vote the committee reported the proposal to the franklin moved seconded by to return proposal no to stated that there have been nine committee hearings including four public forums and the committee has heard a lot from the community he said that the proposal started out very strict and was amended twice in committee as a result of concerns expressed by the public he said that this new amended version reflects what the community wants although an amendment was proposed in committee to extend the effective date it was heard loudly that citizens do not want a delay on this issue any further he said that with the amendments the proposal has gained the support of the community the editorial board of the star and the editorial staff of the business journal he said that the committee has heard plenty and does not need to discuss it further said that returning it to committee would mean that more people are exposed to secondhand smoke and of the community overwhelmingly supports the proposal according to statistics given from the council staff of the phone calls received the past few days he said that it would be a travesty not to consider those lives that might be saved by quick support of this matter oliver stated that children need to be protected and justice delayed is justice denied he said that sending the proposal back to committee is equal to a vote in opposition he asked council members to consider the overwhelming support as evidenced by the percentage of calls received in favor of the ordinance stated that he supports the motion to return proposal no to committee he said that he has probably spent more time in the hospitality industry than most and understands their concerns last channel news walked through broad ripple to consider the effect of the foot rule on that area he said that this regulation would greatly hamper businesses from thriving he said that he still has concerns about an exemption written in for tobacco bars that really only applies to one existing bar he added that there are still many unanswered questions with regards to the board of health and enforcement as well as this effect on excluded cities he said that passage of this proposal expects a lot from the hospitality industry with the coming to town and an extra tax being proposed the restaurants and bars are being asked to do more but yet having more regulations forced on them he said that three to four of the sponsors of the proposal make up half of the committee and the four public forum venues were held during spring break and in venues like schools and health facilities and therefore these do not really show the full range of opinion on this matter brown said that he is against returning the proposal to committee he said that hundreds of hours have been spent on this issue and he has received over phone calls and over emails and he believes the public has spoken and simply need to represent those people they serve he said that this council dropped the ball last week on the human rights proposal and the least they can do is move forward with another issue affecting lives of citizens said that it is correct that a lot of time has been spent on this proposal but most of the feedback was related to the original proposal as introduced he said that a very substantive amendment was passed just four days ago on night and this is not enough time for the public to review and see how these changes will further impact their business franklin said that she is not a smoker and she is not saying that she does not support a ordinance but she represents both smokers and nonsmokers she said that she believes the council owes it to restaurant owners to have sufficient time to look over these amendments said that she supports returning the proposal to she said that if it comes to the floor she will support it but she feels if a vote is taken this evening it will fail said that he joins the sponsors of the proposal in asking that the issue not be returned to committee he said that there has been adequate opportunity for public input and these amendments are in response to public input he said that sending the proposal back to committee will weaken it and he would prefer it be stronger he said that as elected officials council members are responsible to many people and his mailbox has been full with overwhelming support for the ordinance plowman said that he is not against a smoking ban but is against the proposal in its current form he said that phone calls in the council office and emails only equals people which is a very small percentage of the population of and is not really representative of the full constituency he said he believes in protecting children but as a parent it is his responsibility to protect his child he said that sending it back to committee for it to come out less strict does not make it a bad proposal he said that he has had very few calls from people in his district about this matter said that she supports proposal no and does not want to see it returned to committee she said that it not be perfect as currently written but it gives county an opportunity to lead the state in initiatives to protect the health of citizens said that he supports the motion to return the proposal to committee he said that he supports a ban of some sort but he does not think this language is quite there yet he said that he has trouble with some of the definitions and feels bowling alleys need to be further addressed he said that he feels that the proposal is about there and another month to get it right is not too much to ask said that he is not opposed to the ban but he believes it needs to be tweaked to make more palatable to some restaurants who will be asked to pay extra taxes for the new stadium said that he supports the motion to return proposal no to committee he urged the council not to pass a flawed law the government is being hypocritical asking these businesses to pay increased taxes and then regulating areas that affect their profit said that she appreciates those comments that have been made but these amendments were specifically designed to address concerns by those who came to testify and will actually help businesses not hurt them she said that some are still pushing for separate smoking rooms but testimony was given that the levels of chemicals in the air are just as bad in the attached nonsmoking rooms as in the smoking rooms and this does not work she said that it was testified that winds would be needed to clear the air and there are no technologies available today that would truly clean the air to safe levels she said that indoor air pollution decreased in new when they went and the bars and restaurants were not affected negatively she said that an entire evening was dedicated to testimony from the hospitality industry as well as the four public forums where many of these same people spoke again she said that the four public forums were held in venues in four separate areas of the county to gain as much input as possible and over people showed up to speak at these forums said that according to an university public opinion poll of county residents support a air act this is a quality of life issue and has been supported by the community and endorsed by the business journal and star she said that an exemption was made for bars and taverns but they do not want to see family dining choices disappear she said that she has contacted each and tried to give them as much information as possible but some did not even bother to return her calls she said that this issue has been beaten to death and nothing will be gained by prolonging the vote she said that the community has stepped up and said what they wanted and it is the councils job to insure their feelings on this important public health issue are heard yeas day franklin plowman
