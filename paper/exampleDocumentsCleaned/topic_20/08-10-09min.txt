officers sanders welcomed all those who have not been recognized specifically president recognized the honorable mayor who offered the following remarks regarding the proposed budget members of the county city county council i am pleased to introduce to you this evening a balanced budget for the city of this budget reflects our belief that can and should be a taxpayer affordable city one that crunches government not citizens to make ends meet if we are to be successful as a city both next year and in the next must create an economic climate now in which ordinary citizens can afford to live and live well and we must do so despite tough economic times we have known for quite a while that would be a tough budget year in this cycle we will feel the full effect of property tax caps we championed this relief in the legislature on behalf of county citizens because the people who live here deserve a consistent predictable tax structure it was the right thing to do and it is a positive measure for our city but it has a dramatic impact on the revenue structure and we have responded not by passing along the financial burden to citizens but by taking a closer look at programs and services to determine which are essential and which amount to an overreach of the function of municipal government money is tight for everyone right now private companies are working to overcome budget challenges too families are making tough decisions about the ways they spend money the individuals and families who live here are finding creative ways to make their dollars stretch and we owe it to them to do the same thing in the day to day operations of their government our budget demonstrates that we too are striving to live within our means with a balanced budget in which revenues equal or exceed expenditures we knew this year would be tough so we started preparing for it in last years budget strong fiscal leadership last year means we wont have to make the draconian cuts other governments are making this year our budget is based on a strategic model not an annual model and we must continue to be conservative in our estimates of incoming revenues and disciplined in our spending of taxpayer monies we began this process with an estimated million shortfall to overcome as a result of property tax caps reduced revenue from income tax and the general effects of a down economy we arrived at a balanced budget for the same way we developed one in through an unwavering commitment to create efficiencies reduce wasteful spending explore creative options and by gathering significant public input along the way transparency and citizen input are hallmarks of this budget people deserve to know how and where their tax dollars are being spent and frankly they have to wait until a budget is introduced to get that information or to make their voices heard through mayors night out events and our open budget reviews citizens repeatedly asked us to continue focusing on the basics of good government we heard their voices and created a plan for the coming year that keeps heading in the right direction to begin the budgeting process we asked city and county agencies to start at of their appropriations as a way to curb spending as sure recall they were asked to do the same thing in and as well within that remaining we set out to find ways to maintain or improve the level of service we provide to the public while taking into account things like union pay increases something we intend to continue funding in in part by asking city and county agencies to find of the contract increases through existing resources you will notice we have the budget for health insurance and we are currently working with insurance carriers to develop plan changes that will not overburden employees but with costs projected to increase we must all work together to control that cost this past year we were pleased to open a health clinic in this building to assist employees and their dependents with needs and that clinic will remain part of the benefit package we provide unlike last year when we provided a increase to nonunion employees there are no planned salary increases for nonunion employees with one exception in reviewing spending and budget options this year i learned and frankly was embarrassed to learn that there are city and county employees being paid below the poverty level that is not acceptable to me and i instructed our hr department to develop and adjust our salary scale to raise the and lowest paid employees to a livable wage this impacts employees public safety is and will remain job one in we continue to adequately and appropriately fund public safety agencies so they continue to do the same kind of good work that has caused crime to decrease this past year throughout county some of that public safety funding million to fund new police officers will come from federal stimulus dollars this is one piece of the federal stimulus funding the city has been awarded and will continue to aggressively pursue in and beyond the neighborhood stabilization program formula grants are another great example of this in been able to launch a program that will pump million into four areas of the city needing a boost to become vibrant neighborhoods again we have another round of funds for which were aggressively competing million and we have been awarded million already in grants for sustainability projects and more than million for public works projects the recovery and reinvestment act is allowing us to accelerate schedules on infrastructure and sustainability projects and i want to recognize congressman for his work in on behalf of our city we are also pursuing other federal grant opportunities to help us get caught up on onetime projects for example the imaging of historical maps that otherwise would have been collecting dust and deteriorating is taking place because our county surveyor sought out creative funding sources to make the project happen and i want to recognize her tonight for her leadership and persistence in finding a way to get the job done even when the budget was tight in this budget you will also find million in funding for the arts and million in funding for the crime prevention grant program an allocation that i believe will allow us to continue supporting that program in an effective efficient way we will also increase our investment in housing development for low income family units by expanding the housing trust fund as well as increasing funding for the demolition of abandoned and unsafe buildings this budget also funds a longterm vehicle lease plan for that supplements the existing purchase plan and creates a sustainable fleet solution many times a vehicle in our aging fleet is the only thing standing between a crew and potholes to patch or streets to plow a longterm sustainable vehicle plan is a necessity that will improve the way we deliver services to citizens consolidation and process improvements are also key elements to our success moving forward as you will see in our budget approach many of the hurdles we are facing have challenged us in a positive way to develop more sustainable solutions and to continue removing duplicative services within city and county government township fire department consolidation six sigma partnerships with our business community the creation of the central purchasing alliance retooling of our code enforcement processes and seeking creative marketing and sponsorship opportunities for city assets are but a few examples integrating financial operations is a milestone for this city that was contemplated in years ago but which was never implemented this budget includes funding for the first phase of development and implementation of an integrated financial management system that will eliminate over shadow systems and consolidate the back office accounting and management functions throughout city and county the township assessor consolidation we championed last year will mean a million reduction this year and an additional of savings in when the previously elected township assessors are removed from the payroll in addition to consolidation measures and creating efficiencies through process improvement basic measures of fiscal responsibility continue to provide big returns as well in well be able to minimize our borrowing simply by getting property tax bills out on time getting that process back on a normal budget cycle means cutting interest payments from million to million thats a reduction well realize simply by focusing on the fundamentals of good government there can be no question that we are in the midst of tough economic times most of us have been personally affected by the down economy in one way or another but at this significant moment in our nations history when cities and counties throughout the country are halting essential services laying off firefighters and police officers hundreds at a time and nonpublic safety employees by the thousands i am extremely proud that our controllers office and separate departments and agencies have demonstrated the will and the capacity to continue providing excellent service for our citizens despite limited resources my proposed budget sets forth a plan by which we can continue serving all citizens of county by making a safe livable city now

many people spoke to regarding this proposal said that he did not keep a tally brown asked how many poor people he spoke with said that this is not an issue of poor or wealthy said that there is an existing ordinance that specifically deals with people going into the roadways and that is already illegal and in violation this proposal would prohibit anyone within feet of an intersection to hold a sign for advertising or in support of a sports hunter said that as long as people are holding up signs to advertise on private property such as in tax season this does not prohibit that activity he said that he supports the asked if there is documented data of public safety concerns due to this activity president said that the discussion should be directed toward the amendment only said that referred to public safety issues and asked what data supports this stated that there have been arrests for panhandling so far this year compared to for the entire year last year he said that this information can be accessed via the public safety departments website he said that the majority of these occur downtown and they could not provide information on tickets written but there were over incidents of pedestrians being struck last year with some deaths and both bodily harm and property damage he said that there is data to support this effort he added that there was recently a carjacking incident perpetrated by a panhandler smith said that he supports freedom of speech but this recent carjacking shows that this issue crosses over classes races and social status he said that many of these panhandlers are not homeless he said that his church passes out tracts as well but it is definitely a safety issue sanders said that the incidents of pedestrians being struck were not specifically related necessarily to panhandling asked about the reference to the public in the amendment she said that many groups are organized to hold signs along meridian street on the curb or sidewalk to advertise events and causes said that restricting individuals to stand sit or move is restricting their personal freedoms he said that the recent carjacking was a carjacking incident and not a panhandling incident sanders said that the term public is inconsistent throughout asked john mays office of corporation counsel to review the amendment which he helped draft to address concerns mays said that the proposal is not infringing on freedom of speech rights to eliminate any type of demonstrating or advertising but simply adds safety measures to ask these individuals to move away from the intersection feet asked if mays is a constitutional lawyer mays said that this is one of the areas in which he practices read from sec and asked if someone who is lost and asking for directions or greeting a neighbor would be in violation brown asked if mays is giving his opinion mays said that they have researched the issue thoroughly looking at case law and the office believes the language is constitutional sanders said that due to the amount of conversation it is clear this needs more discussion and she would urge the sponsor of the amendment to withdraw the amendment and allow the proposal to be returned to committee she said that they recently lost a constitutional lawsuit that cost the city a lot of money and she would like to prohibit another such instance plowman urged his colleagues to support the amendment and said that he believes police officers will know the difference between panhandling and greeting neighbors said that of all the citizens that contacted her none asked her to oppose the proposal but instead encouraged her to support the measure oliver said that it was testified that this proposal was but not one police officer or public safety
