general fund for cash flow purposes by a vote the committee reported the proposal to the council brown moved seconded by for adoption proposal no yeas brown freeman gray lewis miller oliver scales nays hunter brown scales gray and freeman asked for consent to explain their votes consent was given said that she does not agree they should be taking money from the fiscal stability fund and risking the stability she said that with the previously proposed ii they could leverage matching federal dollars and pave over the entire county she said she does not understand why some voted against that in favor of this approach said that she is not against infrastructure repair but had difficulty using these funds and she felt that ii would address these infrastructure needs in a more fiscally responsible way and if it is not passed they will lose the opportunity for federal dollars to help brown said that ii is not before the body for a vote and borrowing money to pay it back with interest is not more fiscally responsible scales said that she had some concerns about ii funds and millions of dollars being used for projects that had nothing to do with streets curbs and sidewalks while she supports park improvements they should not be lumped in with road said that there is no proposal before this body for ii and million of emergency repairs were outlined by the department of public works the proposal at the last meeting addressed million of those needs and this proposal addresses the remainder said that borrowing money from the stability fund is not a proper way to do this and they should look for other opportunities to leverage and take advantage of federal dollars or those options will disappear he said that he voted against this in committee because of the refashioned political list that was amended from the priorities first identified by gray said he asked the director if these emergency repairs were covered in ii and she answered no he said that using money with no interest penalty is better than spending millions in interest hunter said that they are passing up on the opportunity to leverage to million he added that according to code the council is to have all additional appropriation fiscal ordinances signed off on by the city controller he asked if the controller signed off on these brown said that there was no objection from the controller to the proposal at the committee hearing freeman said that this is maddening and there are infrastructure problems all over the county over a billion dollars worth of need he said that it is a difficult position to take money from the stability fund as there could be repercussions with credit rating agencies but these issues need to be addressed and that is why he reluctantly voted for them he said that he considers it a public safety issue but it is disingenuous to say that ii is not before this body as it was in front of them but was quickly tabled and did not make it out of committee he said that he would prefer to vote for something that would make more of a difference and he wishes they would stop the political bickering and figure out a way to get still more money that is needed for roads sidewalks and bridges said that it seems the republicans received a list of projects that the have not gotten said that director miser gave him copies of the list and he handed out copies to his caucus and gave the clerk the other copies for the majority caucus president lewis said that administrators need to be mindful that they work for the full body and not just republicans proposal nos and on the proposal sponsored by lewis and approves an additional appropriation of in the budget of the department of public works transportation general fund for road and street repair and resurfacing projects by a vote the committee reported the proposal to the council with the recommendation that it do pass brown moved seconded by for adoption said that there seems to be some and he asked if director miser can explain where these funds will be spent brown said that when they passed a proposal for million at the last meeting they were made aware that there was a need of million so they had only addressed of the need and it was restructured to spread the dollars around to all districts brown council chief financial officer said that he spoke with ms miser and they agreed to amend the list because proposal and if this passes they want to transfer some of those dollars hunter asked if this is a separate pending proposal brown is referring to brown said that ms miser indicated another proposal would be coming soon hunter asked if he is referring to the ii proposal brown said that he does not know and his discussions were pertinent to this specific hunter asked what the next proposals dollar amount is president lewis said that they do not have that information asked how many cars have had their tires and suspensions ruined during this debate because of the potholes and horrible street conditions he said that he has heard that there is no money available to reimburse folks for damage to their cars and therefore they need to move this along speedily miller said that it is rare for him to vote against funds for but he is not sure this is the way to get it done however there are two main thoroughfares in his district included on this list that are badly in need of repair and they have to do something he said that the list of needs in the city however is not even remotely addressed by this appropriation and he hopes this body can come back with a plan to address residential streets as well said that district is only receiving in repairs and some of those dollars are shared with projects in neighboring districts and he does not believe there is anything fair about this allocation asked how much of these dollars can be spent this summer ms miser said that by the time they get the projects designed and bid most of these will not be done until late summer or early fall she said that they are moving as expeditiously as they can with all appropriations approved this year said that there is million in a backlog of infrastructure needs but ii is fiscally irresponsible because it pays in the future for a fix today freeman said he has the same dilemma with this proposal as he did proposal no he said that he thinks the council needs to work more closely with the administration to find a solution he said that the code is very clear that any fiscal ordinance needs the signature of the city controller and they need to work through their issues to address the nature and condition of the roads he said that the more they kick these projects down the road the more they will cost the price of asphalt has doubled in the last four years and they need to address it in a comprehensive plan and work together to get it done oliver asked if there is a criteria used to determine the streets that get attention and the ones that do not ms miser said that there is an extensive process with engineer examination of all major thoroughfares and this addresses the worst of the major thoroughfares to give them the most bang for their buck as these roads see more traffic and commerce and provide more direct routes for emergency vehicles oliver asked where the input comes from ms miser said that they have a lot of sources including traffic engineers the public and neighborhood associations oliver asked if ultimately ms miser makes the decision ms miser said that makes the decision in conjunction with the council oliver said that he have provided input but ultimately he does not make the decision ms miser said that makes the decision in conjunction with the wishes of this council as the list of projects was just recently changed to accommodate concerns hunter said that congress recently redid the transportation bill he asked if any of these dollars are leveraged in that funding ms miser responded in the negative and said that they have to million of federal funds available but more local dollars are needed to leverage those funds hunter said that he will support this proposal but is concerned that this in no way leverages additional dollars gray moved seconded by brown to end debate and call the previous question the motion failed on the following roll call vote viz said that she supports this piece of the financing for immediate repair for the streets without paying interest on it said that he cannot express his disappointment strongly enough that his district is only getting out of the total million and some of that is shared with other agreed and said that he is only getting and is also sharing part of that with other districts brown moved seconded by for adoption proposal no yeas brown freeman gray hunter lewis miller oliver scales nays and brown asked for consent to explain their votes consent was given said that the state statute says how things are to be done and he is concerned that the controller did not sign off on these important fiscals said that he recognizes that the streets need paved but he disagrees about how they got the money he did support it though since using that money had already passed said that she supports funding infrastructure but it would be more fiscally responsible to leverage other dollars like with ii especially for repairs that only last to years brown said that this is a continuing process and using a year bond to fund year repairs is not fiscally responsible proposal no as acting chair reported that the metropolitan and economic development committee heard proposal no on the proposal sponsored by and authorizes the issuance of economic development tax increment revenue bonds not to exceed to assist in the financing of the broad ripple associates canal project district and the issuance of up to in redevelopment district bonds to fund certain improvements to park asked about the job numbers browning investments said that there is the standard minority women and veteran hiring requirements as well as a new goal for the hiring of county residents said that they have been working on this for many years and the neighborhood leaders business owners administration and community are in support of this fully vetted project he said that the park community has from crime and they have worked together to reverse the decline and transform the park and the area into a potential gem with even more redevelopment and private investment he said that this project helps them get to overall goal for the entire district to rise or fall together moved seconded by brown to separate the broad ripple project from the proposal and only act on the park portion of the proposal this evening he said that tax increment financing is a tool that should only be used in areas that are economically challenged and he does not feel that broad ripple fits that qualification respectfully disagreed and said that the purpose of a is not only a tool to benefit areas in economic need although he would argue that broad ripple does fit that despite what thinks he said that it is used as a tool to spur economic development in an area if these two projects are not tied together then the funding will not be there for the park project it is exciting that this will benefit the community all the way down the college avenue corridor and without tying them together there is not funding for the park he encouraged his colleagues to vote against the amendment said that this smacks of horse trading as it is drafted and projects for redevelopment should stand on their own they should not have to accept corporate welfare in broad ripple in order to improve a park he said that there has been much politics as to why this proposal is drafted this way and he commended for offering this amendment he said that this proposal is just a fig leaf for another corporate welfare said that he also supports the amendment miller said that he had the same thoughts when he first heard broad ripple but this property is a former gas station that has empty for more than years with remediation issues and it is a blight that needs to be addressed the addition of the plaza for the canal will instead make it a destination site with an investment in public infrastructure of over million he said that financing is only half of what is needed he said that broad ripple needs this project as much as and he feels it is needed for both areas said that this was the whole point of the and it is the vision of the neighborhood activists that it not be divided he said that the is not just about creek park or broad ripple he said that they have to all rise and fall together and pull the same end of the rope he said that the project helps to fund the scales asked if there are any leaks in the underground storage tanks to be concerned about in remediation of the gas station site said that all tanks have been removed but the site has not been cleaned up to just to an acceptable level for the department of environmental management idem the covenants on the site require additional remediation efforts scales said that if underground storage tanks are not leaking it is easy to find a buyer for former gas station sites she said she understands the property is a blight to the neighborhood but it is less costly to give aid to a developer to demolish an existing building than to give away tax dollars to a developer she said that she is not convinced that the economic incentives the city is offering to some of these developers would not happen anyway she said that she believes in real incentives when needed said that without a in an area they do all rise and fall together this captures the organic growth of broad ripple and pulls it away from what the city would normally use to fund public safety and infrastructure he said that the city has a larger issue in dealing with gas stations in general which are popping up all over the city freeman said that he opposes the amendment and it is not often a republican and democrat work hard on a proposal to submit together like this it means a great deal to the district and there is a room full of people here to support both developments he said that he is not in broad ripple all the time but is aware of this vacant shell gas station site and it is in need of remediation said that the focus on this property being a former gas station is a bit of a red herring as they had such a property at th and ditch road and it was not an obstacle for redevelopment if someone is interested in building in an area it is not an obstacle she is not but she believes they should not be handing out dollars without a real need handing out dollars like this then coming back to ask her constituents for increases in taxes for various reasons is hard to swallow on the heels of projects like the market square arena development and other luxury apartments downtown the use of dollars needs to be in a smarter way said that this is one of the most vetted proposals she has seen since she has been on the council and she opposes the amendment she said that exciting and they should be doing more of this with one area of the city helping another this will give the city some great public entities with a parking garage a canal walk and a premiere park space she said that it will also be creating jobs for people who live in these neighborhoods and she is happy to support it as written oliver said that this is in grays district and he supports it and lives in the district and supports it this amendment changes the intent of the impact of the main proposal and the main proposal no longer exists he asked the intent of the amendment said that the intent is to separate this into two proposal and give an up or down vote to each part of the proposal it allows the members to take a position as to whether each separate project is a legitimate use for dollars general counsel said that the amendment actually strikes the broad ripple portion and does not create two separate proposals passing the amendment would mean the body would only vote on the park said that the amendment destroys the proposal and eliminates funding for the project said that he has lived within a mile of this site for years and if they do not do these projects together they will lose the benefit of the entire allocation area and will not have the funds to do the park hunter spoke against the motion to amend and said that an amendment like this should have been handled in committee and not on the council floor said that the amendment does not eliminate the allocation area or the it simply decouples these projects he said that he understands and struck a deal with the consent of gray but he feels they should be separated and they can then bring the broad ripple project to the next meeting to discuss by itself if the amendment does not pass he cannot support the proposal which is unfortunate because he wants to support the project moved seconded by to call the question and end the debate the motion carried on the following roll call vote viz yeas lewis miller nays brown freeman gray hunter oliver scales motion to amend proposal no failed on the following roll call yeas brown scales nays freeman gray hunter lewis miller oliver asked to explain his vote counsel said that explanation of a vote is only allowed after the final adoption vote on a proposal hunter encouraged his colleagues to support proposal no brown said he appreciates the effort that has gone into this proposal but it would have been nice to have a whole foods store for the people near park who have to settle for double people with transportation at their disposal can go wherever they want to shop but many of the people in this area are undernourished and do not have those options miller said that this was just created and has very little money in it yet by doing both projects at the same time it will keep the moving along and generate some revenue so that the project which will not generate any new revenue can actually take place commended the and residents for working on this for close to years she said that she voted against the rezoning but does not object to the project itself and she is thrilled to see the park improvements take place she encouraged the city to continue to look for more improvements in the southern portion of this scales asked about the additional million said that he does not know what scales is referring to director of the department of code enforcement said that the additional investment in the public right of way will be done by citizens energy who will create a frontage along with the canal wall for the walk to be built on this is a longterm effort to extend the canal to the broad ripple area said that broad ripples portion is more than five times the amount will receive and a better deal could have been reached for the project brown asked if the additional million investment is from citizens or the city said that this comes out of the i monies that were already approved for the canal project itself and it is separate from this property said that there are a lot of important areas in that could use improvement and this takes from the whole of and consolidates tax incentives in an area where it is an inappropriate use of dollars said that the city will be paying million to citizens for enhancements to a property that used to belong to the city they are spending money on property that used to be their own before mayor sold the rights to citizens said that crime will not be reduced by adding and they need real economic development and healthy food options he opposes the proposal moved seconded by to call for the
