together to break this down for more common terminology and for more clear understanding and make the information available for the common public said that she is here to speak on behalf of noble of she has a child that shes trying to get into noble of and she has just learned that noble of is potentially going to lose funding which will greatly affect her potential for growth john partner at and the former chairman of noble of recognized those in attendance here to support funding for noble nobles mission is to help heal broken hearts of mothers and fathers and help heal the broken minds of their children they have downsized over the last few years and tightened their budget they have let employees go through attrition and have moved two boards into one they have closed a number of their centers and operated out of their east side office all in hopes of tightening their belt so that when they came before the council it was apparent they were doing their share he said that the budget cuts caught them unawares and were extreme and they are having a very difficult time managing without those promised funds he said that noble has gone from a million budget in with approximately customers a month to an million budget in with approximately customers a month he said that noble takes care of people that cannot take care of themselves he asked the council to do the right thing and find funding for noble chair of the board of noble said that the board is composed of very active leaders in the community and he is here to represent the board and employees as well as the clients of noble to request funding as the council has honorably provided in the past don parent of a handicapped child and former board member of noble for years president for two of those years said that a small tax that is required to keep the doors open for these programs has always been very acceptable to the voting public in every survey or study that has been conducted throughout the united states the public has always supported funding for programs like noble no one questions the reputation of noble the level of service provided by noble continues to set the standard throughout the state and the country the people receiving services mostly cannot speak for themselves they depend on the sponsorship of this council the amount of money being spent for noble represents one of local governments best investments and mother and son receiving services from noble for almost years said that wants a normal life and noble helps give that to him by helping to provide transportation ms said that so much money is spent on rehabilitating offenders in the juvenile justice system so why cannot some money be found to spend on these children who are not offenders who simply want to live a normal life mother of a noble client for eight years said that noble has a great impact on the city she said that she is a nurse and her husband is an school teacher and they would not be able to serve the community as they do without the help of noble she said just like the report on homelessness and the tragic death of a police officer by a mentally ill person these are signs that there be holes in the infrastructure she asked the council to find funding for noble client of noble stated that noble has helped him get a job at citizens gas and become a taxpayer he said that if nobles funding is ended it will be hard for him to do his job well without their support parent of a autistic daughter who is a client of noble said that she was appalled when she received a letter from noble saying that their budget be cut and over people lose spots including her daughter and some of the staff she asked why it is okay to pay million but million cannot be found to help the disadvantaged of the community she asked the council to find funding for noble parent of a client of noble said that they have used nobles services for the last years she said that there are many things her son would not have been able to do without nobles help noble client said that she has a job and other activities and support from noble and could not live a normal life without them she said that the staff really cares about the clients and asked the council to find money to keep funding noble whose brother has attended noble east for more than years said that each skill and task that these children or adults learn saves the city money she said that staff goes out and spends their own money on supplies in an attempt to save and be frugal many of the teachers that have been there for years could make much more money elsewhere but do jobs that no one else wants to do if the city cuts staff and transportation they cut the heart out of noble she added that this is money and there is no group of people more deserving and less demanding than those at noble don fritz father of a downs syndrome daughter served by noble said that his daughter has been able to become a productive working member of this community and achieve a great amount of personal dignity because she has a job and is accepted and loved by her coworkers none of this would be possible without services provided by noble he said that it seems highly ironic that a city that can somehow find tens of millions of dollars to provide land grants tax abatements and outright subsidies to multimillionaire owners of football teams and malls cannot find a few million dollars to support services such as noble he asked the council to examine their consciences about the kind of city they want to be county extension director of county cooperative extension said that he is actually wanting to speak to proposal no which is not classified as a budget president stated that proposal no will
