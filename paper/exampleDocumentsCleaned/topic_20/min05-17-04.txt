since he said that the property has been for sale since and there have been no offers for a church project or residence on the property the property sits feet from boulevard and over feet from the neighboring residential area he said that there are mature trees in the buffer area from the residential development that the petitioner has agreed to keep as a part of their project clutter said that besides being located on the busy intersection of and there is a sewer easement that makes other uses next to impossible the petitioner sign design has agreed to install a privacy fence to shield the parking lot and add to the buffer from the neighborhood sign design is a small business that has been in existence for years on the west side of boulevard the company experiences approximately three to four customers a day only has four employees and operates with am to pm hours through with no weekend hours cutter said that while he can understand the staffs concerns this business is not a typical print shop operation and most of the work is done on computers and laser printers and is very quiet and does not produce the noise associated with printing presses he said that both the hearing examiner and the metropolitan development commission approved the project he asked the council to uphold the decision and support the petition resident of asher street said that he supports the petition if the project were to be developed under its current zoned use there would be more flooding problems in the area than there already are he said that the petitioner has agreed to every commitment asked for and will be a good neighbor bob resident of lane said that he has lived in the area for years and has been active in the neighborhood association he said that he has in the past opposed every other project being considered for this location but after speaking with the owner of the company and seeing their operating hours he feels sign design will be a good neighbor owner of sign design stated that cars pass along boulevard every day he said that there are already three churches on one block of road and the residents seem to simply want nothing developed on this property he said that this is a commercial corridor on a highway he said that as the property stands now unoccupied the property is useless to the city he said that he has agreed to all the commitments asked for by the neighbors and will be a good taxpaying neighbor cutter said that he would like to reserve the remaining five minutes of the petitioners presentation for rebuttal wheeler past president of the neighborhood association said that he continues to be involved in preventing this property from being sold for a commercial project rather than residential he said that the reason there have been no residential offers for the property is because the location has never been marketed as residential he said that he has supported other variances in the neighborhood but feels strongly that this variance should not be allowed neighbor said that the city planners have designated this property as residential or religious use she said that both the county alliance of neighborhood associations and the greater community council believe commercial use is not appropriate for the property she added that of the neighbors in the area are opposed to the project this area is a hidden gem of the city and she commended and for visiting with the neighbors and supporting denial of the variance silver attorney for the asked those in attendance who oppose the project to stand he said that this variance would allow for an industrial use on square feet of property he said that there are other vacant locations nearby and the neighbors do not want any further commercial encroachment he said that he will reserve the remaining six and half minutes for rebuttal president called for public testimony from anyone not already associated with the or petitioner reverend citizen stated that this seems to be a blatant act of discrimination and she is opposed to any act of discrimination against church or race she encouraged the council to consider use of land and elements within a community president called for rebuttal statements from the petitioner and clutter said that the staff is relying on an outdated zoning plan not many residents would want to live feet from boulevard and that is why the property has not been marketed as residential he said that the neighborhood could probably not achieve a better buffer than feet and the petitioners agreement to keep the mature trees in place he said that the attorney for the referred to this project as an industrial use but that is not correct the technology sign design uses is simply normal office equipment such as computers and laser printers and it is not an industrial company he said that the hearing examiner and the hear cases like these all the time and are experts in these matters and both recommended tom riddle resident of neighborhood said that he is a past president of the neighborhood association and he loves the neighborhood and wants to stay he said that the petitioner has agreed to all of the concessions the neighbors have asked for and a foot buffer is substantial he said that an intrusive commercial use would be a liquor store or fast food restaurant but not this operation he said that the current residential building has been an eyesore and nothing else has ever been even remotely acceptable to the neighbors in this location he said that and his wife are good people and this is a good business and they will be good neighbors he said that the empty contaminated building will diminish property values more than such a commercial project silver said that the district are asking for support in denying this petition and if council members do not support the district it is possible others will not support them when such issues arise in their communities he said that voting in favor of the petitioner would be saying that the neighborhood associations and district have no meaning said that he is always a champion of the concerns of the community but also feels development of small businesses is important he asked if the petitioner has looked at other properties on the commercial side of boulevard said that his desire is to remain on as his customer base is there he said that the only found two other commercial properties one lot was too small and twice the cost while the other is in an elongated shape with a billboard in the middle and it would be very difficult and costly to develop he said that he is tired of leasing and wants to own his own property to house his business he said that he did look at other opportunities and this was by far the best location said that the petitioner has testified that there will never be more than four employees at the business and he cannot see the situation getting out of hand he said that the petitioner has agreed to all the demands of the neighborhood and the petitioner even agreed to parking on the south side of the building as requested by the neighbors instead of on the north side as originally recommended by staff he said that there is a lot of commercial development in the area and he believes the petitioners will be a good neighbor sanders said that she did walk the property and visited with she said that this business is not an industrial use and there is no more noise in the facility than there would be in the council office she said that it was not smart for silver to suggest that oppose the petitioner in order to secure future votes in their district she added that the neighbors seem to want a residential use but the property is zoned for church use she said that she believes the council should vote on the merits of the project said that he supports the petition he said that the petitioner has agreed to a buffer and numerous other commitments to please the neighbors he said that he lived at st street and boulevard for many years and this is a very busy intersection and the property has been vacant for many years and it is obvious that the traffic is one reason he said that he is a supporter of small businesses and partnerships said that if he had not visited the property and seen the mold and mildew and disrepair of the current facility he would not know that a development was desperately needed at this location he said that for silver to talk about trading votes is an insult and each council member has a mind of their own said that she struggles with this project generally she is supportive of economic development and small businesses but if the property is rezoned then future variances would not be needed although would be a good neighbor if he does not continue in this location the next business not be such a good neighbor she said that the letter she received from silver was insulting by implying that she could not vote on her own conscience but would simply trade votes with the district said that he will share his allotted time for final comments with as his district overlaps this area as well said that of residents six neighborhood organizations and the staff all support denial of the project he said that he supports the homeowners and urged his colleagues to vote against business encroachment in residential areas said that he is not or but he believes that to approve this petition would set a dangerous precedent he said that proper land use needs to be considered and he believes the got this particular case wrong president stated that a yea vote would be to sustain the decision of the and approve the zoning variance petition a nay vote would be to overturn the decision of the and deny the variance he said that in order to overturn the decision a majority is required or votes he said that in the absence of votes the vote would be considered indecisive and therefore the decision in favor of the petitioner would
