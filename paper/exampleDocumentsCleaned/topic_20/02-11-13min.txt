the of the consolidated county fund for the purpose of financing infrastructure improvements in the meadows area by a vote the committee made the following motion i move to amend section of proposal no as previously amended in committee by adding the language that is underlined to read as follows section notwithstanding the first sentence of code section the council hereby directs the department of public works and the board of public works to allocate three million dollars of its appropriation from the of the consolidated county fund for the purpose of financing infrastructure improvements in the meadows area as defined by exhibit a hereto seconded the motion general counsel said that after discussion with the mayors council liaison about the exception being too broad he drafted this amendment the intent of the committee amendment was to just carve out the first sentence he read from the code and said that the intent of this language is that the approval for spending these funds by the director and board of public works is not needed asked if this amendment is then asking them to ignore what is in the law under sec said that it is only offering an exception to the first sentence gray asked if it still has to have the approval of the mayor and the mayor has the option to veto responded in the affirmative asked to explain the other proposal that also includes this language which is where they got the idea to include such an exception in this proposal said that proposal no also includes the notwithstanding language and it was drafted by the office of finance and management so it is not uncommon to have this type of language in a proposal said that they therefore got the idea to include this language from the administration confirmed that this is correct said that he is supportive of redeveloping the meadows area although he is not a big fan of tax increment financing districts they are the tool that is available for blighted areas he said that he is trying to understand this language to say a certain area is treated specially and differently than others said that this language makes an exception to the general rule oliver said that they are the fiscal body yet they lose their authority if they cannot decide how to expend taxpayer money without the override or approval by a person said that this amendment makes the exception that they can spend the money without their approval however the mayor can still veto the action oliver that his constituents call him and want something done but with so much watering down of the ordinance he no longer has any authority said that they have authority as a body she said that the majority of the council voted for the proposal and that is what is codified this new proposal goes against that which was voted on and approved by this body gray asked if this amendment means they can direct dollars to be spent without the approval of the board and director responded in the affirmative gray asked if they still are not gaining anything however because the mayor can still veto the action said that the mayor does have that right said that in response to this amendment does not direct any funds to be spent outside of what they would normally be used for he said that per statute they must still be used for infrastructure miller said that in committee he asked what these funds would be used for what roads are included and if they can get an estimate as the language does not say up to million he said that they ask these same questions of anyone who comes before them and asks for money to be appropriated he said that he has received no response to his questions and as a body looking out for taxpayer dollars he cannot feel comfortable supporting this measure without any level of detail provided said that miller did send him an email asking for this information and he responded that the director of public works and burns could provide that information faster and in more detail than he could miller said that they did not submit the called for a point of order and said that this discussion should remain germane to the motion to amend gray asked if the same language in proposal no was approved by the mayor said that proposal no has not yet been put on the committee agenda or heard by the committee asked what proposal no deals with president lewis asked that discussion be kept germane to the amendment motion said that the discussion on the amendment included the basis that this type of amendment was used in another proposal and he therefore feels it is germane said that it has not yet been heard in committee miller said that they are therefore proposing to use an ordinance as precedent when it has not even been heard yet said that the proposal deals with using money for transportation funding brown said that this proposal is the mayors plan to steal money to pay off a lawsuit called for a point of order said that the point of the comparison was to draw the illustration that the administration has also used the notwithstanding language as they have already crafted a proposal using such language the motion to amend proposal no carried on the following roll call vote viz yeas brown gray lewis oliver nays freeman miller scales absent hunter moved seconded by for adoption of proposal no as amended said that it was never the intent for funds to be used for private property or a grocery store even though it is a grocery store everyone agrees is needed he said that million is needed for site improvements to prepare the ground and give the grocery developer the incentive to do the deal in addition there are estimates of another to million in infrastructure that is needed in the meadows area including another phase of housing the first phase of housing funded by stimulus dollars from president looks great if the funds are used for the grocery store there is no further infrastructure that will be funded as well as no incentive to continue the housing effort he said that million of public funds are dedicated to this area including funds and home grant funds and the city has invested a lot of dollars in the meadows as it should with any ongoing need such as this however this proposal insures that a grocery store gets built and then synergy is lost to do all the rest that is so greatly needed he said that this quick fix will do more harm than good said that a no vote would mean a barrier to a grocery store that would provide jobs and generate income tax he encouraged his colleagues to support the said that she believes everyone is in agreement that this area needs support but there is disagreement on how this support comes she said that this body took an oath to uphold the law and she believes this proposal with its amendment violates the spirit and intent of the law that was passed regarding money she said that state senator jean also said that this was an area that needed support and she believes a is warranted to provide all the support needed for this area asked if there is a map that shows what qualifies as the meadows area said that the map was attached as exhibit a to the proposal asked if the monies already planned to be spent out of public works from the fund in that area will count toward this million or if that is only for the grocery store said that this million can be used for any infrastructure in that area he added that had asked about the estimated debt service on the million if the was adopted and that would be million a year scales said that everything that the sponsors of this proposal have said they would like to see happen in the meadows area could come about by passing proposal no yet those same people voted against that proposal she said that she does not understand why they are limiting the options for this area as there is more flexibility with a she said that many people did not get advised of this item being on the committees agenda until afternoon when the meeting was held the next and she like many others could not adjust her schedule to be in attendance yet the proposal was forwarded onto the council anyway without proper notification or vetting she said that the proposal has been around for many months and now the sponsors of this proposal are putting the onus on others moving this proposal forward quickly without much vetting when the proposal was given so much more scrutiny she said that she had come this evening prepared to vote for the proposal because if all they are giving these residents are crumbs from the table crumbs are better than nothing but these residents deserve better and the mayor indicated to their caucus that he would veto it if it passes so she has decided not to support the proposal oliver said that this is a good proposal and the intent is to repair this neighborhood he said that promises have been made to this community for years and he is appalled that the district would be against improvements in her district said that he would invite the mayor to the majority caucus meeting as well to let them know how he will act on ordinances passed by the council miller said that he does not believe they have had time to vet all the costs opportunities and consequences of this proposal he said that he believes they are looking at a bandage instead of looking at the problem holistically he said that he also has had no answers on what road will be included and so he cannot support the proposal moved seconded by brown to call the question and end debate the motion carried on the following roll call vote viz yeas gray lewis oliver nays brown freeman miller scales absent hunter republican council of said that she through several meetings where scales fought for a in the meadows area and it was voted down she said that mayor has not done anything for the black community but instead approves money for private developers she said that her people across this county have suffered while mayor gave his employees a she said that what the residents want in their neighborhood they cannot get the avenue and broad ripple went through yet scales has been fighting for a for this more deserving neighborhood and cannot get it to happen she said that white republicans living out of the county are voting for how to spend her taxpayer dollars called for a point of order there being no further testimony the president called for a vote on the motion to adopt no the vote was ruled indecisive on the following roll call vote viz yeas brown gray lewis oliver nays freeman miller scales absent hunter the president stated that proposal no will remain on the agenda for the next meeting under unfinished business said that he hopes to compare the votes on this measure with the votes on proposal no as they both include the same type of language invited everyone to a town hall meeting at the eastern star church next at pm lewis stated that proposal no which was referred to committee will tentatively be heard in the rules and public policy committee on all in memory of oliver and lewis in memory of little and in memory of and in memory of and in memory of and in memory
