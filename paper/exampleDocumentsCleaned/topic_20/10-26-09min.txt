item changing the percentage in to instead of to read as retail tobacco store means a retail store utilized primarily for the sale of tobacco and products including but not limited to cigarettes cigars tobacco pipes cigarette paper and lighters that is not licensed for the consumption of meals or alcoholic beverages on the premises or operated in conjunction with another business that is

from voting on the proposal to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest due to a previously scheduled consent was given stated that a compromise proposal was passed in and many have asked why this must be done because the compromise is working he said that many opponents say the council should wait but they are wrong he said that secondhand smoke is a serious health problem and there are no safe levels of secondhand smoke he said that surrounding cities have initiated comprehensive smoking bans and needs to follow suit and protect its workers more than of the population lives under bans and businesses have not seen a decrease in sales as has been testified he said that the playing field is not level and the current ban causes establishments to choose whether to be a bar or a family restaurant he said that freedoms should not jeopardize the liberty or public safety of others he said that he supports the proposal and waiting any longer will result in more hazardous health conditions said that people that enter bars are adults and can make adult decisions these individuals can make their own decisions for their own public safety and health and the government should stop telling people how to live their lives said that she was one of the original cosponsors on the current smoking ban and the intent was for a comprehensive ban at that time she said that other cities followed their lead and even went further with comprehensive bans she said that out of the top cities is only one of the two who have not gone and she feels this puts at a disadvantage in attracting businesses new residents and development she said that not all people can truly choose where they can work and in the current economic times people are lucky to get any job and cannot be so choosy she said that she would hope compassion would be shown to these workers and she encouraged all to support the proposal as a step in the right direction said that he is disappointed that the mayor could not show leadership on this issue and he is disappointed in his caucus members in not supporting the proposal said that she is committed to this effort for personal reasons watching her mother and

if it infringes on others rights she said that she supports the proposal and urged her colleagues to do the same brown said that of establishments were impacted by the current ban and he asked if there are statistics showing the number of workers that were impacted seeing no response brown asked if there are any statistics showing the number of workers that will further be affected said that if they affect one worker it is worth it brown said that through education he continues to support nonsmoking initiatives but he would like to see an accounting of the percentage of reduction in second hand smoke deaths since the ban to warrant a further ban hunter said that secondhand smoke deaths are down across the country by million sanders said that she agrees with thoughts regarding one worker being affected being too many she said that freedom ends when a persons actions inflict harm on another person she said that it is extremely important to recognize the issues the workers face said that the current ban leaves bar workers unprotected as the areas where people could publicly smoke were reduced smokers gravitated to the bars and other areas where smoking is still allowed and therefore those places are probably even smokier today he said that the risk those workers face is even higher today gray asked for consent to abstain from voting on proposal no to avoid the
