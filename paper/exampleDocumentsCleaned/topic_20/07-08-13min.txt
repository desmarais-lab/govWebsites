by oliver to return proposal no to committee proposal no was returned to committee by a unanimous proposal no brown stated that the public works committee heard proposal no the proposal was adopted by the council on the mayor subsequently vetoed the proposal on the proposal sponsored by brown and scales amends the code to allow monies from the fund to be appropriated to the department of public safety for the purpose of reimbursing the department for the expenses relating to the recruitment hiring and training of sworn police officers and to create a new police recruiting fund brown moved seconded by to override the mayors veto brown explained what the fund does and said that this proposal transfers money to a fund that can only be used for public safety he said that if the funds are not spent then they could be transferred back he said that this is to hire police recruits not necessarily to increase the staffing level but just to stop the bleeding from loss of officers through attrition he said that they are officers short now and by the end of they could be officers short due to attrition he thanked those republican who had the courage to vote to adopt the proposal since this proposal was passed there have been murders in and public safety impacts every district and should be job one he said that the administration has admitted to mismanaging public safety resources but more officers and resources are needed he read a letter from a white republican male who explained the effects of crime on his own family losing his son who was murdered in his home brown said that the safety of citizens needs to become the number one priority of this city freeman said that he does not think political statements made by brown will help republicans come to a consensus or solve the problem he said that this should not be a political decision he said that he is one of two that voted against the public safety budget because it did not fund a recruit class for the metropolitan police department he said that about three months ago he voted not to the mayors veto on a proposal because he pledged to spend the money from the sale of the water company on infrastructure which is a billion dollars underfunded he said that money is needed for roads bridges and sidewalks as children are forced to walk in the street to school because transportation budgets have been cut he said however when the mayor used million of these monies to fund a cricket stadium this plan for infrastructure went out the wind he said that he has full faith in director troy department of public safety and thinks his plan is innovative and direct but he wants to give him more officers on the street he asked fellow to tone down the political rhetoric and simply do what is right for the community asked how many children have to die before they can figure this out he said that this is a vote for the safety of children urged her colleagues to vote to override the veto she said that several hours ago a was killed in her district which follows an already lengthy list of murders in she said that solutions can coexist and this proposal is a start toward a said that no one is arguing that more police officers are needed on the street the question is how they get them there a recruit class that will put officers on the street months from now is too late director laid out a plan to put officers on the street now and they need to figure out a way to pay for new officers in an ongoing manner she asked her colleagues to give director a shot at fixing this and if they see no results they can address this later she said that infrastructure is a real need in the city too and also affects public safety said that when this proposal was introduced two months ago it was a reasonable proposal to address a hole in public safety since that time this council has passed corporate welfare for companies like exact target and other developers on avenue he said that this city needs infrastructure and taxpayers have already taken a hit and are getting less services and they clearly need to do more than just shift money from one pocket to another he said that they need to shift priorities because there is no funding for any recruit classes after this and this is not a simple problem with a simple solution they need to stop spending millions of dollars on the pacers and corporations he asked his colleagues to vote to sustain the veto not because he has confidence in the mayor or is criticizing plan but they should not have to come back and cut services or raise taxes to sustain this said that he has had extensive conversations with the mayors office and director plan is responsive and responsible as a longterm plan they need more officers but the real problem is to find jobs and activities for these young people and hold parents accountable because there are so many other aggravating factors gray said that it is not correct to say they have never had a revenue source for public safety or that there has been no plan to fund new officers because the democrats led the issue on this several years ago to fund more police officers he urged his colleagues to vote to override the veto scales applauded director for coming up with a viable plan and she knows that his hands are tied with only so many resources to rely on however they need to strengthen the plan however they can she campaigned with the mayor under the promise that public safety was priority number one and they are facing some serious issues with low morale high homicide rates and insufficient officer numbers she said that mayor promised to beef up the police force by officers and while there were hires from to there has been an attrition of officers leaving a net gain of only officers in four years if they keep going like they are going they will be back at the same place in another four years and they need to continue to add recruit classes in regular intervals she would prefer not to use funds but the mayor opened box when he used those funds for cricket fields a private enterprise that would have been happy to convert fields for tournament play she said that they did not need to use tax dollars for this and she believes the mayor has lost his way in terms of priorities she said that they need to do what they can to use whatever funds are available where they are most needed said that he has full faith in but they are asking a lot of a great leadership to do the impossible with staffing levels down this is a good reason why this murder rate is greater than he said that the plan revealed today is still inadequate and leaves citizens he said that it is an embarrassment to have such a small police force for a city this size and her urged his colleagues to vote to override the veto hunter said that he has not come to this decision lightly and the meeting lasted five hours he said that he has much respect for the mayor and leadership but this will be his one pass this evening he said that there is a lot more that can be done and they should use the sheriff more and he should be involved on the efficiency teams and at the table to solve this issue numbers are not realistic because there are many other departments that are not being utilized and there are some whole divisions and departments that could be put into patrol runs he said that he is willing to give director a chance but the next time this comes up he will be joining with others to find additional money in the meantime he would ask that sheriff john and other chiefs of public safety forces in the city work together with director to find efficiencies he said that it needs to be a team effort including universities and excluded cities as well as the sheriff and this cannot fall all on shoulders he said that he wishes they would have heard this last during the budget process said that new officers is a as only will be new on the street he said that is understaffed and underfunded and working at a efficiency they need to look at all the resources they have available including these monies and even at the federal level for more resources said that he is a big picture person and if the fire department could not handle all the fires this past year they would come together to get them the manpower they needed he said they need to do the same for and drop political feelings and make a decision that is good for the people he supports this proposal and said that it all cannot be fixed at once but this is a start said that he voted in favor of this proposal on the th and he is not against the mayor or director but he is for public safety he said that he supports the plan revealed today but not all officers added will end up on the street this is not about politics but about the safety of citizens visitors and officers he said that officers are out there every day risking their lives without adequate backup he said that he agrees that other departments could be called on to help he said that he also feels infrastructure is important and if they were using these dollars solely to build roads and sidewalks he might feel differently but since they are not he will vote in favor of overriding the veto oliver said that citizens do not feel safe and if someone is raped or murdered this week the blood will not be on his hands and a vote against this is a vote against public safety he said that these are misplaced priorities in the republican administration to say more recreation is needed as if the bad guys will go play cricket instead miller said that when he heard of the veto he began talking to police officers who were tired with low morale he said that there was mismanagement with the former director and he applauded director for his addressing the wrongs and coming up with a plan he said that these officers are not new officers but are officers who are not currently doing runs he said that overriding this would just be doing what they are already working on doing director has asked them to let him look at their departments efficiency before adding new police officers randomly and he feels they should give him that courtesy he said that this could then be reintroduced in a few months if what was promised does not happen he said that because he believes director proposed plan is sustainable and fully funded he will not vote to override the veto but if he does not see that plan being put into action he will bring the issue up again brown said that they cannot accuse director for mismanagement because he has not been here long enough but this is not about politics it is about telling the truth and doing the right thing he said that this plan move some resources but transferring officers without adding more will not work as officers retire they can replace those positions with new recruits making it sustainable by having savings through lower salaries said that this proposal originally passed with a bipartisan vote showing that all are impacted by the wave of violent crime the city has been subjugated to this matters to all constituents he lives in one of the hot spots with two of the four murders this month happening in his zip code he said that people in his neighborhood have lived there for decades and generations but now are forced to put bars on their windows and lock their screens he said that he appreciates this proposal to address of and there is no other way for him to be responsible in this respect than to vote to override the veto said that this has been a painful decision because crime is a serious issue in the city he said that in the community where he lives the crime rate is extremely low because families spend time together neighbors invest in relationships and in the youth individuals and groups get involved and care about their neighbors he said that he will not vote to override the proposal but not because of any political affiliation loyalty or allegiance he said that if he thought he could do an ounce of good to keep throwing police officers at this problem he would but even with a six and old in his home playing in the neighborhood that he worries about until this becomes a community that learns to respect each other as human beings crime will not go away he said that if he thought this would solve the problem he would do it but they cannot just keep throwing money at a more complicated problem like this moved seconded by to call the question and end debate debate was ended on the following roll call vote viz yeas gray hunter lewis miller nays brown freeman oliver scales absent the council failed to override the veto on the following roll call vote viz yeas brown freeman gray lewis oliver scales nays hunter miller absent scales brown oliver gray and miller asked for consent to explain their votes consent was given said that they need to focus on getting communities engaged in fighting crime said that while director put forth a decent proposal it is not sustainable scales said that she lives in the real world where people unfortunately do not respect other and they need to spend their money to address the important issues brown said that he is not sure director plan will work but a systematic reduction of police officers will not work the council cannot control social behavior but they can control the fiscal budget oliver thanked officers for being here this evening and said that if they were not in attendance this room might not even be safe asked mayor to look at the sheriff as a partner in this effort and while she is not opposed to director plan she thought it was appropriate for this money to be added to it said that he is surprised by some of his colleagues and said that it would take years to meet the minimum national standard staffing levels gray said that director plan is not bringing anything new to the department and they have many times taken people out of desk work and put them on the streets this did not help and they still did not have enough fully trained police officers said that they are short police officers today because of decisions made before today he said that the administration gave money away to corporations diverted property taxes away from city services diverted money from new properties to parking garages for a double subsidy and showered money on sports teams until those handouts this will keep happening said that he is proud of a process that works and this nonpartisan vote with from both parties voting both ways shows that members voted their conscience as it should be miller thanked members of the fraternal order of police for being involved in this process in absence reported that the administration and finance committee heard proposal nos and on
