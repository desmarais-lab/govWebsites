projects to receive these monies and then had a selection committee that selected recipients from those submissions for the regional organization to then reallocate said that this county still needs hundreds of thousands of dollars for sidewalks but yet he has been sitting in meetings for years where tons of money was spent on planning transportation he said that he feels they are continuing to spend money that seems to go nowhere said that he also opposes the proposal while he supports public transit he feels they have studied it to death and know what needs to be done because of the local

could be spent on a cricket park ms said that these are required studies they have to do to seek additional to make projects a reality and are a part of the federal process hunter said that they have

for transit administration to study line alignments streets traffic counts etc asked if after the study they can then leverage for more federal funds ms responded in the affirmative miller said that he supports as his district needs mass transit and he will support anything that furthers that he added that he also agrees with brown about the funds said that the local match is times the amount of federal dollars and some of these entities will benefit from tax increment financing diverting local funding to facilitate these kinds of developments he said that some districts have street names that have changed since the last time they had sidewalks and spending money on this means some other priority will go brown asked hope council chief financial officer for clarification on the local

continue to study a transit route when funding has not been established he said that they still need to spend public dollars wisely and prudently both local and federal dollars especially in light of the fact that they do not know what the state will do asked if they could table the matter until their colleagues on market street decide what to do with transportation hunter asked if there is a detriment to tabling and if they would lose these federal dollars ms said that these studies have started and are underway and if they do not move forward they would stop the and hinder any future

not needed but good public policy he said with regard to the concern about waiting for the state to pass legislation if they do not push forward with this the state could argue that the county has not developed the issue fully and therefore there is no reason for them to proceed miller agreed that they need to keep moving forward on this issue asked how much they would have to send back if they do

would be best suited to run it most efficiently a bi partisan group worked together to solve this issue and the parks foundation does not want this responsibility and he believes the central community foundation is a great organization that is in a position to leverage these dollars and is willing and able to run the process he encouraged his colleagues to support the proposal brown made the

would put crime prevention back on track as this proposal gets it off track said she opposes the amendment as it is not in accordance with the original intent of the program to provide these grants primarily to youth programs she said that of those in reentry programs are ages to and the incarceration of mothers and fathers also affect youth agreed and said that giving the responsibility to and then taking it back seems irresponsible and many of these entities affect children and youth by serving their parents said that he has been in education for years working with young people and while he is not opposed to reentry programs he would rather see a majority of these dollars go toward prevention keeping young people out of jail hunter said that he thinks these are passionate arguments for both sides and he wishes there were more money available for these programs however he would prefer they not lock in percentages until they see what can do in leveraging these dollars with other programs while these be good intentions he opposes the amendment and hopes the proposal moves forward to get this money out to these groups gray said that the stats they have heard prove what they are saying that prevention is needed on the front end and then they would not have so many teens going to jail he said that he is not against reentry programs but reentry programs have been a failure and prevention has had more success said that it is less expensive to keep youth out of trouble than to turn them around with limited funds they need to put it where they can have the greatest impact and do the most good said that remediation programs are needed but crime prevention has been too much about remediation and an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure he said that it makes sense to put the majority of their resources into prevention programs he wholeheartedly supports the amendment said that nothing prohibits grants from going to crime prevention programs over recidivism programs he suggested that they consider the recommendations of the reentry study commission which has worked extremely hard he said that he is a huge proponent of crime prevention at the youth level but nothing in the proposal as it is currently written prohibits these funds from going to those initiatives he said that they should rely on to make the decisions to put the money where it will do the most good brown said that gray was president when the first legislation was enacted regarding the crime prevention grants gray asked if there is a list of recommendations from the reentry study commission said that there is a list and it has just been finished gray said that city leaders came together fighting bitterly against adding more beds to the jail the intent of this program was for crime prevention and to give kids something to do to keep them out of trouble the administration changed and money got spent on other things than what was originally intended said that they are arguing about concepts and this is what is for to evaluate each program on its own merits said that prevention should be at least a half as important as dealing with the aftereffects of crime he said that a study came out that gauges how many prisons should be built based on the failure test scores of third graders said that his support of the amendment does not mean that he does not support said that there are five zip codes with an extremely high recidivism rate one of every children has a parent incarcerated one of every children and one of every children he said that there is a direct link between truancy and having a parent incarcerated he said that they need to be cautious about how the direct the allocation of funds has managed hundreds of millions of dollars and that is why they are entrusting this program to them asked if is only making recommendations to the council said that they would actually be making the final decision president lewis asked for consent to abstain as her employer often applies for these dollars moved seconded by to call the question and end debate yeas freeman gray hunter lewis miller scales nays brown oliver absent the amendment failed on the following roll call vote viz yeas brown gray oliver nays freeman hunter miller scales absent brown asked for consent to explain his vote on the amendment consent was given brown said that they do not have a copy of the reentry study recommendations and he does not know how they can vote on this without them he said that parents who are in jail now most likely went to jail as youth vice president ruled that there have plenty of comments on the amendment and it is time to move on to comments on said that is a great group of people but they need monies that go into strategies that reduce crime and violence on the street level and he does not think this will do that he said that these monies will not even be available until after and the summer will be almost over by then hunter listed some items that were funded last year and said that if they go back to the time when the government handled this process the list of grantees was not as effective or successful he said that he believes is a professional organization that can manage this process well oliver asked what programs sees as important they mentioned reentry and getting people ready for jobs but did not mention any measurement of the jobs themselves said that this is not really a proper question for as they have not seen the applications yet and cannot determine what is contained in them and how they would recommend allocation at this point said that he feels both sides are well intended and both viewpoints have a lot of merit tying the hands of those awarding the grants though seems counterproductive he said that he would personally like to see more money awarded to drug rehabilitation programs but he feels like is in a good position to make the call of which programs will do the most good said that these are public dollars and should be allocated toward what the public believes is priority it is not improper for this council to make requirements on the awarding of these moved seconded by to call the question and end debate debate was ended on the following roll call vote viz yeas freeman miller nays brown gray hunter oliver scales absent moved seconded by hunter for adoption proposal no yeas freeman hunter miller nays brown gray oliver scales absent brown and miller asked for consent to explain their votes consent was given brown said that he is disappointed that his amendment did not pass but ultimately thinks the program is a good program miller said that is an excellent organization and he respects all they do for the community said that she looks forward to working with and wishes them the best in this process said that he supports all these efforts but feels the community wants the majority of these dollars to go to prevention programs for youth proposal for a general
