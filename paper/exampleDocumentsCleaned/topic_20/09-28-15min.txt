oliver said that asked if there are any penalties now that section is crossed out stated that these are not used by prosecutors and this language simply reflects how the office of corporation counsel prosecutes they use state law to enforce these issues not the zoning ordinance he said that the city prosecutor does not object to this change as they base their violations on state statute and do not use the local ordinance to enforce freeman said that he started downloading this ordinance at pm and cannot even pull it all up yet as it is over pages long he said that he has major concerns about a lot of this including government employees being allowed onto property for inspections without consent this also encourages the public to be used for public or electric transportation and he has reservations that this is an around the blue program he said that so much has been added and tweaked and doing something this big at the last hour of this administration is not smart he said that it is his understanding that if this council takes no action this will pass therefore he moved seconded by to reject proposal no agreed that if they take no action the originally certified proposal goes into affect with none of the amendments made by committee or this council he said that to adopt it as amended the proposal requires at least votes to pass according to statute in order to reject the proposal it would also take votes said that this has been a very long and deliberate process and many individuals and neighborhood groups have been involved in this he said that as he understands it they are actually condensing this from the current code and therefore pages is more efficient said that there are different zoning ordinances today and they have combined them all into this one ordinance it is over pages because of footnotes to indicate where changes were made and the actual final ordinance will not include those notes he said that the draft has been available for over a year and a and every change that has been made can be seen in the footnotes said that a lot of work and time has gone into this and he commended in including the community in this process he asked if this includes any consideration for blue as freeman alluded to said that freeman referenced page adjustments to parking which applies to older parts of the city not already developed with parking now there will be variances for parking in neighborhoods where there is no parking in front of businesses the idea is to have less parking and this provides incentives to allow electrical charging stations in order to provide less parking spaces he said that this is related to parking only and has nothing to do with parking like the blue program miller said that if this does not pass then they need to immediately extend the recent moratorium on new gas stations as that legislation indicated the moratorium would be in place until rezone was adopted he said that meetings have been going on for years and this matter has been before the council for days the fact that some people are sending out emails at the eleventh hours is disrespectful to the work that has been done he said that they can always come back and make more changes and ask the metropolitan development commission to reconsider the matter he said that it is not the end of the world if this ordinance passes as it is said that if it passes it goes back to the with the changes and this body no longer has an opportunity to change anything beyond what is there he said that he is not in favor of doing that and he supports rejecting the proposal so that they can refine the process and get it right he said he doubts many on this body have thoroughly read all pages and they should not vote on something they have not fully vetted freeman said that he appreciates interpretation but he is not happy with the way the vision fleet and blue programs have worked so far and he is afraid this will cause more issues the only people who will win this evening if this ordinance passes are lawyers who provide services as they will get increased business he encouraged his colleagues to vote to reject the proposal hunter asked his colleagues not to reject the proposal he said that this has been a long three to four year process with a lot of public input they are combining different ordinances into one and the variance process is still there he said that at least two of the changes included in the footnotes he requested and he asked his colleagues to support the the motion to reject proposal no failed on the following roll call vote viz yeas freeman scales nays clay gray hunter lewis miller oliver asked for a verification regarding urban gardens and what is currently legal said that anything legal today will be legal going forward as they cannot take away any right with zoning law and nonconforming rights will be grandfathered in he said that nonconforming uses going forward will be proved with aerial photography and affidavits from neighbors the same as they are now asked if there is a cost to establish a nonconforming use said that there is not in this ordinance but might have been according to the ordinances asked what happens when a farm property is sold to another said that zoning is applied to the property not the owner so the zoning would not change asked if this would legitimize the blue charging stations said that there has been no discussion regarding anything to do with blue and this deals with parking not parking on the street said that he is glad to hear this as there is now way he would support anything that legalized any portion of blue asked what happens to this if it does not pass said that the has days to accept or reject any amendments made by the council they intend to hear those on he said that they could reject the amendments and then come back to the council for a confirmatory vote if the council takes no action the zoning ordinance would pass as originally certified to the council without the amendments president lewis reminded members that this ordinance requires votes for passage moved seconded by miller for adoption proposal no
