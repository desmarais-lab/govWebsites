proposal sponsored by hunter freeman miller and proposes an ordinance of the county income tax council to increase the income tax rate for public safety effective and to cast the vote of the council on such ordinance by a vote the committee reported the proposal to the council with the recommendation that it do pass as amended moved seconded by and to amend proposal no to its originally introduced version restoring all of the language that was amended out in committee she said that in order to fund more police officers they need both parts including the homestead credit elimination said that she opposes the amendment as many of her constituents have already experienced an increase in taxes which was not small due to the expansion of the police district eliminating the homestead credit will just add insult to injury to those constituents on the north west side said that eliminating the homestead credit will impact constituents far less than the increase of the public safety tax she said that this would average out to about a year and would go a long way to address this public safety needs said that it is misleading to say a citizen will only pay a year extra because this amount varies throughout the county her districts constituents will pay much more than that and this does not show a true picture of how her constituents will be affected freeman said that he supports the amendment he said that they should have eliminated this credit the year the state initiated the property tax caps they have been using artificial tax dollars for years as a scheme to pay down property taxes said that originally it was suggested that the additional revenue from this elimination be used to fund new officers however it is now being purported to be used for a program he said that a new proposal was just introduced this evening to deal with the homestead credit elimination issue on its own merit and he sees no reason not to send that through the process and see if it is really needed or if there are alternatives for a program said that many public meetings were held last year and she did not receive much feedback in opposition to eliminating the homestead credit she said that she is capped and it will not affect her at all and she knows a lot of her district is the same however this should have been eliminated when the property relief was provided by the state moved seconded by to call the question and end debate yeas gray lewis oliver nays freeman hunter miller scales citizen stated that the sponsors on this proposal are all republicans the same republicans who took million from the general fund and used it as their own personal piggy back he said that republicans got themselves in this position using public safety dollars as their personal piggy bank maybe they are wealthy and can afford another a year but most citizens cannot yeas freeman hunter miller nays gray lewis oliver scales said that in she voted in to support a large increase for public safety she said that it was very needed as pensions had not been adequately funded during the administration she said that she cannot support this proposal this evening because the current administration has very misplaced priorities and they continue to overuse tax increment financing dollars and continue to throw money at developers and she cannot trust that these dollars will go toward what they were intended freeman said that everyone needs to wake up to the reality of the world as it is today he said that he has just lived through the worst economy of his lifetime and unlike other cities they have not laid off police officers the force has fewer officers than he would like however and the city is already taking in less revenue and he has not seen a plan proposed by the other side of the aisle on how to fix this problem the president of the fraternal order of police asked him if this would pass and he told them to ask the democrats as they hold the majority he said that crime continues to be a problem in this county with too many young people running around without an education or constructive activities to do he said that to blame current mayor is a political game as funding police officers has been a problem for a long time through several administrations he added that everyone he has talked to has asked him to support finding money for more officers this is a year before the election and if anyone wants to run on the platform of not funding public safety they should go ahead and vote against this proposal he said that the fop has asked for it and two independent commissions of this council have called for it and they need to just do it said that there is a crime problem but priorities are messed up he said that this administration has spent millions of dollars on developers high rise luxury apartments and cricket fields and they have lost their way he said that the money is there but they are not spending it in the proper way hunter said that he was originally a sponsor on this proposal but it has been so eviscerated in committee he no longer recognizes it he said that they continue to debate this issue but he guarantees that if political tides change this will come up again and then the democrats will act on it two independent commissions led by the democrat caucus the police staffing study commission and the homestead credit elimination committee recommended eliminating this credit the democrats also claim to want a so it seems they should all be on the same page however they are a year from elections and would rather continue to play politics said that she is conflicted because she the mayor and chief rick say that they do not need more police officers she said that she cannot support this proposal because she cannot guarantee it will go where intended instead of becoming another slush fund scales said adding police officers should have been a priority a long time ago the did not address so they in essence were laying off police officers she said that she does not believe they should continue to tax residents when other suggestions have been made to raise revenues such as a special events fee and other revenue enhancements that have been ignored by this administration she said that they need to stop going to the residents for more taxes because of lack of planning on the administrations part she cannot support the said that she chaired the staffing study commission and that commission did recommend that apply for the cops community oriented policing grant and that the city raise the public safety tax and eliminate the local homestead credit the revenue from this was all to be used for public safety did not apply for the cops grant which was unfortunate and now the only part before the council is the increase in the public safety tax she said that has been underfunded and understaffed for years and they are not doing what they need to do to keep ahead of attrition and keep it staffed this money will also go to benefit other public safety agencies like the courts community corrections the sheriff and prosecutor she said that she does not like it but it is necessary in her opinion and therefore she supports it agreed with and said that he voted for the amendment to also eliminate the homestead credit and maintain the funding as well this is just one piece of the plan and they need more parts for it all to work together he said that he would have liked to see the original proposal passed but he still will support this piece said that only one of the commissions hunter spoke about recommended the increase in the public safety tax during the budget last year they asked the administration how many more officers were needed and no one knew for sure that is why the staffing study commission was created one thing they learned was that was woefully understaffed and does not have the staffing needed for true community oriented policing which is what is needed to fight the rise in crime he said that he does not see another way to get there without increasing the public safety tax he said that he also supports a program but they need to be cognizant of asking the taxpayers for more and he is working hard to find a way to maybe do the program without affecting taxpayers in this way said that he has a longtime career in public safety and the police force has always been underfunded and understaffed should be proud of the fact that they have not had to lay off police officers like many other cities around the country he said that members tonight keep bringing up and economic development dollars all of those issues come before this council and this body has a say in whether those monies are allocated or not even if all members do not agree those items have passed under a democrat majority he said that with regard to the cops grant these are to hire new personnel and then they have no sustainable revenue source to keep those individuals employed he said that he would have liked to see the original proposal pass but this is a critical step forward as there is a severe shortage of personnel and the current force is feeling the stress moved seconded by to call the question and end debate yeas gray lewis oliver scales nays freeman hunter miller said that officers were never rehired with the money that was saved from and it seems money has been and there should be funds to replace those lost with attrition at least bill president of fop lodge stated that politics sickens him sometimes and he takes exception to the comments that at least they are not laying off police officers he said that is exactly what has been done even though it is being called attrition he said that the control number and budget line went away when the force lost someone to death retirement or change in employment and every budget cycle number was then based on the number of officers they had current and active at that moment so essentially they have been effecting an organized planned layoff and the force is suffering for those decisions now said that stated that director and chief said that more officers were not needed but that is not correct as they have never said that he added that this is not a problem where they can snap their fingers and fix it the new hires this year will not be ready to take a run for two years and by then they will lose more officers through attrition he asked who would suffer then he said it will be this councils constituents because the police cannot do their job because the council is not doing theirs oliver called for a point of order and said that he takes offense to political comments being made the president asked for a ruling from general counsel said that he has not heard any comments that were not germane to the matter currently under discussion or out of order continued and said that he is sorry if oliver was offended but it might be time the council gets offended because they are dealing with peoples lives and batting the officers around like a football for adoption proposal no as amended in committee was adopted on the yeas freeman hunter lewis miller nays gray oliver scales miller scales oliver hunter freeman and asked for consent to explain their votes consent was given said that officers need more support and have too much responsibility for a single officer said that the council is the fiscal body and they should decide where the money goes and it is hard to raise taxes but the officers are stressed and this is greatly needed said that he could not support because there are too many misappropriations taking place like with the cricket stadium miller said that he does not know the history of how they got here but when director first came he did efficiency studies first and said he would not ask for more money unless he needed it and now he is saying he needs it he said that of the emails he received not one was upset about raising taxes for more officers and he respects what officers do and was proud to support this stated that to clarify her earlier statement and said that they tell them they need more police officers and then later say they need she said that she is against the way the proposal was written and they need to watch where the money goes and make sure it does not go for a slush fund scales said that she has heartburn for not supporting but the mayor promised new police officers when he campaigned and it has never happened although everything else gets funded oliver said that priority needs to be based on input and data and he would like to see a study commission established to determine the root causes of crime said that she hates raising taxes when the cost of living is also increasing but this rate was lowered at one time and she feels it is a small price to pay said that they need more police officers but people are already overtaxed and financially challenged they need to look for additional sources and ways to utilize the funds they have to invest in public safety hunter said that he greatly respects and the work of the staffing study commission and he still wants to see the homestead credit elimination get a fair hearing he said that this council is the fiscal body and therefore they ultimately decide where the dollars go no matter what the mayor says freeman said that he is glad to see this body supporting police officer funding and he encouraged the public safety and criminal justice committee to look hard at the sheriffs budget to find additional funding that is being wasted said that this body cannot insure how those additional homestead credit dollars will be spent a proposal for a special resolution of the council of the consolidated city of and county proposing
