tried to get answers on this issue and cannot seem to get any he stated that these increases only benefit the colts and not the citizens who need a tax break president of the fop stated that public safety officials had previously recommended increasing such taxes to fund many public safety and criminal justice programs that are in desperate need of funding and the suggestion was ignored tonight the city is asking that those same tax increases be used to benefit a private entertainment project the mayor is talking about laying off police officers even though crime is up yet taxes are being raised to fund private business he said that if this initiative is approved he hopes the council will fight vigorously to fund public safety and criminal justice so that there are no police layoffs citizen said that he supports the proposal and there will be a negative impact on the economy if the project does not proceed he said that most of these taxes are paid by visitors to the city but he would like the council to look at adding a sunset provision said that there is a sunset provision for the year rev said that the value system of this city is distorted and they are putting taxes on people that are already stressed out and burdened in order to benefit those who are wealthy tom president of the central building trades stated that the city has lost several important conventions because of the inadequate space and this will help to bring business back to the city fox citizen said that this is another example of government taking money away from to fund the life and entertainment of other citizens not all people paying these taxes will be able to afford tickets to games or benefit from convention business he said that this will only benefit a few private citizens he asked how the council can justify not raising taxes to fund public safety yet raise taxes to fund football stated that there has been a lot of discussion on this topic and at the end of the day the football component is a small issue and the convention center business needs to be considered she said that she is normally against raising taxes but will support this proposal franklin stated that she was prepared to vote against the proposal but will support it because of the economic benefits she stated however that it is hard to support when the police budget does not seem to be as big a priority said that she will vote against the proposal because she pledged in her campaign for office to not support any tax increases she said that she believes priority should be given to public safety and infrastructure before economic development while she appreciates the work of governor and others she agrees with and cannot support the proposal said that there are no free rides and sometimes the council is called on to make some tough decisions without this project a major league football team would probably leave town which would affect the city in so many ways he said that they need to look at the bigger picture and build a city where people are willing to come instead of standing in the way of plowman said that he will support the proposal but it seems a high price to pay he said that the city has homeless on the street water and sewage issues roads that need paved and a rising crime rate because however people can avoid paying this tax and it is not an tax he will not oppose it he said that the council needs to really look at their priorities however in the coming budget months said that raising taxes is always a tough issue and he understands those who will oppose this proposal he said that there are also however good reasons to support the proposal the mayor initiated a proposal that did not have adequate funding and the governor stepped in and helped to find funding and sold the increases to surrounding counties he said that of season ticket holders are outside of county and most of the people paying this tax are from out of town he said that it would average out to approximately a year per person to have all these amenities for the city he said that the project will guarantee final four competitions for years all three previous expansions have been a success and brought more business to the city he said that he hopes that they can find a comprehensive solution in the next few years to fund other areas of government said that this is the biggest economic development of his time and partisanship is out of place both the mayor and the governor are to be commended for helping to come up with this solution he said that comments are out of context as if the state had passed the mayors plan the public safety concerns would have been solved said that he supports this proposal because of the job generation it will provide said that he served on the council when both and market square arena were built and whenever a tax increase is proposed it is a very uncomfortable position to be in however knowing it is the right thing to do provides a level of comfort he said that of this will be used for the convention center and not just football he added that there are legitimate concerns about the councils continuing responsibility to other initiatives and budget concerns but not all dollars can be used anywhere he said that there have been many hearings on this issue at the state house and here in the building and the matter has been given a lot of exposure stated that she has concerns that this tax is actually outside of this councils authority said that the people in his district are greatly affected by the flood plan
