expressed in the committee hearing he said that he would encourage these workers to form a union should they so decide but he does not feel the council should be choosing their destiny for them said that this proposal simply encourages them by saying that they have the right to those things and is not imperative miller asked if they do not have those rights now he said that there is some confusion because it seems they have the tools to form a union already said that there have been demonstrations by janitors and they have made it pretty clear that a good number of them feel these are rights they are not able to exercise without the right to exercise they are no longer rights this proposal does not determine the outcome but just asks others not to infringe on those rights said that these individuals have the right to unionize and this is guaranteed under federal statutes this proposal asks the council to take a side in the matter and he would contend this is not what they should be doing he added that as a resolution this proposal should be categorized as a special resolution instead of a general resolution and he feels it is improperly before the council said that she is a retired schoolteacher and has been around janitors all her life she said that those janitors had health insurance job security if they did their job safe working conditions and a livable wage and she never heard any complaints she said that she does not understand what they are trying to do with this resolution oliver said that this proposal says the council supports and encourages these individuals rights that they already have under the law and simply asks that the law be carried out he said that a vote against the proposal is saying that they do not have the right to pursue these objectives and all should support everyones rights for these things miller said that a vote against this proposal is not saying that these folks should not have these rights but he does not like encouraging someone to pursue something specific each group or individual should pursue whatever is in their best interest and he does not like using the word encourage in this matter he said that this also limits this urging to janitors and he is not against their rights but does not think the council should be taking this action yeas brown gray lewis oliver nays freeman miller scales absent
