and to send proposal no to the full council with a do pass recommendation the proposal no amends sec of the code to establish additional procedures for committee actions on proposals said that one thing he has found to be true in the last four years is that reasonable minds can get through misunderstandings if conversations take place before a matter is put forward he said that in the past matters have been heard in committee unevenly with some chairs always listening and allowing for discussion and others summarily casting off an item with a motion to table without affording the sponsoring or the public to speak he said that he tried to show consideration in this regard when he served as chair and at least tried to let a sponsor know if their item would be heard in a meeting or not he said that with all of the meeting agendas being published on the website there be members of the public who have rearranged their schedules to attend a meeting and they should be afforded the courtesy to speak on an advertised matter that they feel strongly about he said that this proposal simply provides that within days of introducing a proposal a sponsoring should have the opportunity to present the matter before a committee and the public should be allowed the opportunity to comment before a matter is summarily dismissed with an action such as tabling he said that the proposal simply eliminates the uneven handling of such matters among chairs and puts a definite procedure in place said that she can appreciate the reasoning behind suggesting this proposal but she is not supportive of it for several reasons she said that this would take away the discretion each committee and chair should continue to have she said that there are times when only one item is assigned for action to a committee that a chair would prudently choose not to have a meeting to be more cost efficient adding this day language would not allow them to make that decision she added that while she generally believes that a sponsor should be able to present a proposal there might be circumstances where this should not happen it is also maybe not necessary for the public to comment on every proposal she referred to a piece of legislation offered a few years ago by mike speedy with language regarding dogs and animal control she said that this was a very volatile piece of legislation and taking public comment on the issue would have turned into a circus she said that while she understands what is trying to do she cannot support it stated that in the case of the legislation speedy was afforded the courtesy of presenting his proposal and airing his views before it was tabled he said that he believes it was tabled before public testimony was allowed but at least the sponsor was allowed to get their reasoning for introducing such legislation out to the public he added that he completely understands the concerns about the day language as it makes sense from a perspective not to hold meetings for one agenda item however something is needed to insure that a sponsoring at least has the opportunity to present a proposal that has been properly introduced so that the public and fellow are able to understand the thought process that motivated them to bring the matter forward thanked the chair for allowing him to present his proposal this evening and he moved seconded by to send proposal no to the full council with a do pass recommendation chair said that he agrees with comments and while he appreciates the effort a committee needs to exercise a broad range of discretion because the public trusts them to do what they are charged to do and they do not always need to hear every matter brought forward to say always or never removes the discretion the committee is charged with exercising and he cannot support such language stated that it concerns him when someone says there are times when the public does not need to hear what they are considering chair said that discretion is by every day even introducing this proposal is a form of discretion what committee a proposal is assigned to exercises discretion as does deciding when the proposal comes before a committee he said that there is a need for discretion especially in certain circumstances he said that they are not just charged with hearing and voting on proposals he said that has been recognized to speak twice and there has been vigorous discussion and they need to proceed to the vote and move on said that by its very nature discussion allows for debate he said that some good points have been made but cutting off debate is horrible public policy he said that he understands there needs to be discretion at times but if a sponsor properly introduces a proposal they should at the very least have the opportunity to present it if the chair chooses not to take public testimony he can understand that but if a has taken the time to draft a proposal and wants to present it they should be allowed to do so in a public meeting so that the public can see what is going on chair said that most proposals are aired in a public meeting but to take away the discretion and mandate always concerns him he said that once chaired this same committee and he is sure there were times that made decisions in that chairmanship that seemed prudent to him at the time he said that the committee structure works as it works and the committee and the chair are charged with that discretion said that he does not think he was perfect as a chair but even when attended his meetings as a nonmember he never cut him off even though he was not a member of the committee and asked to speak more than once on an issue he said all should simply be afforded that same courtesy lewis said that she thinks discretion is important she said that in her first term a majority of her proposals were tabled though the chair did have the courtesy to call her and let her know her proposal would be tabled so that she did not have to make the trip over to the hearing they were tabled nonetheless she said that she questions the timing of this proposal and understands trust does not come easily but something is to be said for leadership and committee chairs being afforded some discretion the motion to send proposal no to the full council with a do pass recommendation failed by a vote of with gray lewis and casting the negative votes
