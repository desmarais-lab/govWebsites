so i think we are going to be to park ice rink and at this point that is at it looks like we are going to be we have some work that was done a day of service and we want to showcase all the hard work that took place there and let the citizens know what had happened there a couple of months ago again and also as just made me aware again the date for next months meeting has been changed and moved up a week to the st of and so we will make sure that all the public notifications is out on that at this time board members you have the minutes before you and if he could a motion approval of minutes a motion was duly made by seconded by and unanimously passed to approve the minutes of board of parks and recreation minutes agenda item resolution approval by the board of parks and recreation of the consolidated city of for the acceptance of the intergovernmental transfer of real estate a part of boulevard from the department of public works to the department of parks and recreation of the city of chairman greeted don and smith don stated that what he has before the board today is something that has been in the works for quite a long time at overlook and we parks has been managing this property for several years and making it available to the public to access the white river the property is originally owned and is still owned by the department of public works and it was part of the old street right of way and we had kind of a use agreement with our sister agency over those number of years it really has been so well received by the community and it has been requested by the community that it should come into the parks departments ownership for future care and long term and the department of public works has transferred and they passed a resolution on their side to transfer this property over to the department of parks and recreation and what we have here before you today is a similar resolution as the department of public works for the parks board approval to accept this property within our land acquisition chairman asked the board members if there were any questions there were none a motion was duly made by seconded by greenwood and unanimously passed to approve agenda item resolution agenda item approval by the board of parks and recreation of the consolidated city of for the department of parks and recreation authorization for do representatives to stay overnight at town run trail during a special event on greeted the board and director welcomed and her guest as she introduced herself to the board and she mentioned that the board actually has three agenda items before them and basically they are requesting the same from the board but at different park locations and different dates and times stated that she is pleased to have with here a representative from mentioned that she has had the pleasure of working with for the last years on their various events that they have hosted at parks stated she is going ahead and let tell you a little bit about of who they are and what they do greeted the board and introduced himself as an attorney here in and he is here to represent and appreciated the boards time to hear their request is a small based in and basically what they do is put on running bicycling adventure races through the state usually at city parks or at state parks and have been doing this for about years and basically host about events a year which are trial runs and mountain biking events events usually have somewhere between to people who are always on the trails and never on the board of parks and recreation minutes roads they have been very successful and he would say that on the mountain biking area they are by far the leading entity within the state since there are not that many entities that do mountain biking events there are all kinds of entities that do running events but they specialize in trails and there are a few other entities that do it as well but he thinks their representation is spectacular they enjoy working with parks because they believe that brings parks a lot of new customers and a lot of repeat customers and they look forward to a long and prosperous relationship and he is here to answer any questions the board have and as far as he knows they have never had any issues whatsoever with having events at locations and he is basically here to answer any questions that the board have at this time greenwood asked what is the age group that will be staying there answered basically six to really anyone that runs but generally speaking they are looking at about to forty year olds his children do it there are not a lot of kids out there but there are kids and there are older people as well chairman asked greenwood to rephrase that question because if he heard her correctly you asked about the age group of the folks that will be staying overnight at the facility and answered all adults chairman asked how many adults will be staying overnight to and one of the things that he does want to make the distinction and he really know the legislative intent but his intuition is that these ordinances were not totally designed for what they are asking for they are not asking to be like the boy scouts camp out and have their attendees camp out at the park what they are asking for is permission to have a couple staff members be able to stay overnight to prepare and secure the trails for the upcoming events prior to the attendees arrival which allows them to put on a safer better event all of their events are on the trails and trails are a little more dicey than a road event because trails can easily from side to side and think about just how long it takes to walk a fifteen mile trail and if someone just tears down a piece of tape your runners are going off to the left instead of going to the right and it is a little bit harder to set up also the conditions can change it could rain over night and they have to all of a sudden change one of the trails and so the setup time is actually far greater than it would be on a traditional road race because the roads are not going to change you really just puts some cones out and redirect the racers and so the set up is a lot different their request is just to have permission to be able to prepare the park trails and track prior to the races and make those adjustments prior to the race event beginning again for the safety of the participants and for the customer service of their people attending these events their events start at am and runners start showing up roughly around an hour or an hour and half and believe it or not they actually have runners who want to run the course before the event so when people start running about an hour or hour and half before the event they are in what he calls customer service mode and they do not want to be setting up at that point we want to be answer whatever questions they have which could be where is the restroom to is it going to be hilly or whatever their goal is to be there again for the safety and customer service of their people if they could figure out a way where they do not have to be there at night they would prefer that board of parks and recreation minutes stated that just as a point of clarification it is kind of difficult to set up at to in the morning because it is pitch black you basically need someone there for security reasons from the time the event starts to the next day three to four people this is what you are asking because you cannot set up at in the morning replied that to be clear their staff usually arrive around noon or early afternoon the day before the event and security is probably the main reason but they do have to setup and reset up pretty early not in the morning stated that his point is that you probably need to be there as far as people coming in but as more security to protect your equipment and make sure you are ready to go when people start showing up at in the morning stated that he just needed to be clear because we got off on trails and all that and kinda so you need or people to be there for security to protect the stuff and be ready to go at in the morning answered yes mentioned that they set up their cones their timing equipment etc so they are ready to go asked who is securing the representatives safety this is a question to the parks department and one and there be any park staff on call on site chairman answered stating no we will not have any parks staff on site or on call asked if the representatives would be staying in the facility or just in the park answered that they will be staying in a very tiny camper added that typically what we have done in years past is parks gives them the permissions written and notify the rangers and notify the division that be in those areas that we have authorized the organization to stay in the park and they have a letter on site for that of course if this is passed by the board they will have the resolution that states that the parks board has given them permission to stay on site as well asked if this was the county sheriffs district at park answered yes stated that as usual when he asks a liability question is there anything that the parks department needs to do in order to make certain that in the case that perhaps something were to happen when there is no staff there and we have allowed people to be in the park although authorized is there anything we could do to mitigate any potential liability on the part of the parks department answered that it is probably worth having a release from them saying that they are staying at their own risk and that they are assuming a liability for anything that would happen to them because they are staying at their own risk and they have insurance for their event but they are going to have to make sure that their insurance is going to cover their equipment for the overnight portion of the event and they can draft releases for these events also added they do sign the special use agreement which has this waiver of liability information on it and they also sign a rental contract because basically they are renting our premises and then the insurance that we have on file for runs for the whole year typically it will run from say through and staff makes sure that this is up to date at all time greenwood reiterated that we have had this in the past answered yes it is a bit of a conundrum because interpretation gets in there and we have to rely on our board of parks and recreation minutes attorney and the director to lead in the right direction and in years past they were using the ordinance as far as park hours and extending park hours except we were extending them hours and so that ordinance indicated that we were able to get permission from the director for the over night stay and it have to be approved by the board but this time around we are indicating that we are going to have to use the ordinance for sleeping in the parks instead and the only body of government that can give that approval is our parks board stated that there were occasions where we have done it in the past for carnivals where the carnival staff would camp overnight when there used to be carnivals in parks so we have done this before he just wanted to make sure he was clear that we were not going to have the public overnight stated that this area is a big area to be out there by yourselves responded that state parks are a lot bigger he stated that they do this for every event that they host and have been doing it for years chairman asked how many people they are anticipating in the three areas we are talking about replied that there ranges from to people and often times it is determined by weather and the worst weather the smaller the crowd chairman stated that it is an opportunity for us from the parks perspective to bring some folks who not otherwise use the park to see that they can come and utilize the trail system that we have there or maybe they will find some other amenities that we have at the park that is to them and will come back added that as far as the participants it is not uncommon for people to bring their spouses and children to watch or play in the park at the same time chairman asked if there were any other questions from the board greenwood stated that she started the questions so she is ready to make the motion a motion was duly made by greenwood seconded by bowling and unanimously passed to approve agenda item chairman explained again to the board that it was thought to be covering all three of these locations by the board voting on the first site approval board secretary explained that they should vote on each board item individually and the board did so and voted on the other two locations agenda item approval of the board of parks and recreation of the consolidated city of for the department of parks and recreations authorization for do representatives to stay overnight at park during a special event on a motion was duly made by seconded by and unanimously passed to approve agenda item agenda item approval by the board of parks and recreation of the consolidated city of for the department of parks and recreations authorization for do representatives to stay overnight at eagle creek park during a special event on board of parks and recreation minutes page six a motion was duly made by seconded by greenwood and unanimously passed to approve agenda item agenda item approval by the board of parks and recreation of the consolidated city of for the adoption of the resource development division of the department of parks and recreations park master plan for director greeted park planner for parks and greeted the board and thanked them stating that this is the park master plan just a little bit of history to tell you how we got to this point pointed to the overhead screen depicting the right hand outline stating that this is the current park which in martin deeded over to the city for the purpose of becoming a park and in this board approved the pursuing of a proposal from landfill to purchase a piece of land and trade it to parks for the land where the existing park was on part of that process was the development by parks of a commitment to do a full master plan for the park the original park had a site plan but not a full master plan on they held their first public meeting and the gathered information and met with the public gathered information about what they wanted to see in the park and explained the process and how we got to that point they came back to their office to develop the plan took it back out to the public on for the second master plan public meeting the presented the plan pointed to the overhead depicting some of the pictures of events held at the existing park it is a well loved park and they hold a couple of music events every year including a fest lots of picnic events and they also host a classic car show there spoke about the next pictures on the overhead which depicts the piece of land the proposal is to move a piece of land to relocate park it actually is located at road and it is a little over acres and is almost exactly the same size as the existing park location and it is a lot flatter and will be much easier from a developmental point of view to put features on the land the next slide to the board which is a slide of the proposed plan and it incorporates all of the amenities from the previous park and also calls out for new amenities to be added the ball fields multipurpose fields the trail moving the playground equipment and this plan proposes that we actually supplement that with more playground equipment more recent pieces is a former restaurant building on the north corner of the site and there are photos of this restaurant in the plan they went out and looked at the building and it seems to be in decent enough condition that we can repair and modify it for use as a community center meeting room and some restrooms for the use of park patrons there is an existing parking lot on the site that we can take advantage of as well as adding a a half court to year old basketball court and a full adult basketball court lastly as you look at this master plan layout on the overhead on the southwest corner it looks like a little dark chip which will be a performance shelter similar to the one that they put in at park with electrical for use by the community for music events presently they have to rent a big stage and bring it in and this would be a much more effective facility for them this pretty much up his presentation of the board of parks and recreation minutes page seven master plan to the board chairman asked the board if they have any questions stated that you have car parking area here and you have these sports fields here and if he could remember there was a big issue down there with sports fields parking neighborhood parking issues and they were upset about the parking situation and these sports fields and he is assuming there will be soccer and his question is that the parking spaces you have in this design and you will have soccer and all this other stuff is that issue going to be resolved he remembers there were some issues that when they had soccer going on there and the patrons wanted to use the park there were not enough parking areas on the old site he is stating that with the new design you are showing spaces you have soccer fields band you have a lot of stuff going on down here is this parking going to accommodate that where you the director or don will be getting these calls about we have people parking all over their neighborhood and they cant get to the park is the community comfortable with these sport fields in here and soccer and parking and bands and their events and it is going to be a scheduling nightmare for somebody but he is just saying that spots with all of this activity could you tell me a little bit about the comfort zone of that stated yes and that question did actually come up at the public meeting about the conflicts with programmed soccer events pointed to the overhead screen stating that these shapes showing as the fields for the purpose of this plan they are place holders and staff would not necessarily be calling for a striped field with official play without further consultation with the community and what would work asked if these are practice fields not game fields or tournament fields answered yes practice and informal usage is what he believes what their intent was don stated that he will add a little more flavor to what stated there are additional parking spaces right along road if you look at the plan there is parking along the street and this will help both when you are having a concert series in the park or if they were hosting some game play there is a little different perspective about the original park since the neighborhood really brought this park to parks they have felt there is more personal ownership in it and maybe they were not as visionary about how the general public should have to all of the park was very clear that when this moved to the top of the property that this park is open to all members of our community obviously two fields is not enough to run a sports league but if there was an opportunity to have an event here we would be able to accommodate an event here and this would be a park for all the community members not just the little localized neighborhood and he has been pretty clear about that at this time stated ok they felt like they owned it and they would lobby for it and it was their park and he just wanted to make sure it was understood don stated that he thinks that how has out the parking here and there is also some parking along avenue as well along the parks property line he picks up another dozen or so parking spaces that we can some as use a couple other things that we should be aware of as a board is that we will be coming back to the board the property has not been transferred yet so we the city parks still owns park and this property that the master plan that is done on is still owned by landfill and smith and don met with representatives from landfill to their commitment to the board about matching it up like for like and they are on board to do that and they are doing some board of parks and recreation minutes page eight survey work on the property now and we will be bringing back the deed for the board to accept the land transfer before we start investment this was also one of the sites that grant came through the parks foundation funding landfill still will match up everything over here and put in the trail the fields the playground but the dollars will come in and add the water enhance the playground further and there are some shelter opportunities chairman asked if there were any other questions from the board asked what size is the meeting room replied that it is about the size of a the last use of the building was for a so the building is totally gutted which is to parks benefit actually because all the interior walls are exposed so when they go in to make their public restrooms they can just tie it right into the utility features and then they just can finish the interior of the building and he had and our construction guys for parks and and smith attended the on site meeting and so it is around to square feet it is not huge but it is a typical old fashioned where you had the restaurant piece behind and you had the seating area in front and previously was a burger chef and then became a and it has been empty for probably years because he remembers it was empty back when he was doing the original site plan for the current park don stated that he is anticipating that it will be at least as much space as what we have at where you can have maybe a community meeting area of maybe folks in comfortably because we need to set aside a little storage area for tables and such because it also could be rented for parties as well as community functions or run in summer lunch programs out of there one of parks summer programs stated that this is the only facility that will have the restroom is that correct yes this is correct there will be one restroom facility and part of the grant is to put in a comfort station and those dollars assist us in preparing this particular building as a public restroom asked if there was any thought for design stated that a lot of cities are putting in nice little throughout their parks now is something like this feasible don replied that he would like to think that this building would provide the necessary public restroom and they will open up in the spring they will be flush toilets and parks has a janitorial service contractor like we do all of our other comfort stations so unless there was a special event where they exceeded this capacity then they would bring in the just for that event and take them out afterwards this would be a temporary fixture a lot of times our enclosures for our seem to be targets for and graffiti tagging so if we can avoid some permanent structures for those and have the permanent restrooms that would be our preference chairman asked if there were any other questions from the board there were a motion was duly made by greenwood seconded by and unanimously passed to approve agenda item board of parks and recreation minutes page nine agenda item approval by the board of parks and recreation of the consolidated city of for the award of bid from mechanical and electrical in the amount of for the fountain renovation of park sunken gardens greeted the board and apologized for his voice being and that he has a little bit of a cold and it sounds a lot worse than it is and he is feeling great but the voice sound good this item he is presenting is the award of the bid for putting the pumps and motors into the sunken garden fountains pits they are purchasing the actual pumps off of us communities and also get a better price for doing this and also get them in a little quicker than if the contractor was doing the work and time is of the essence for this project they have already demoed out that was inside those and this is what you see on the overhead screen and all you see is just the pipes so that we have something to attach these new pumps and motors to this item before you is to actually install the stuff that they are in the process of purchasing for sunken gardens stated that he invited to attend this meeting today and he had an emergency inspection and because we all know what kinda happens with these inspections he able to make this meeting today because of the last minute inspection on their part stated that he has just one quick question how have you with the footing of the pits answered that they are trying to make sure that they use either water rated pumps motors or ones that can get wet he believe that they are pumps what they have also done is made sure that they have a better drain system installed so if water does make its way in they are repairing the water line that comes in so that it is not any longer it is going to be a copper pipe so they do not have to worry about things busting they are thinking that if a pipe busts that takes care of the fountain pumps because of the size of the line that is leaving this pit now and no more water is in these pits they should be able to get it out before there is any damage at all and by using the rated motors that they are trying to use with everything else they think that they are going to be in very good shape also asked if they moved all of the electrical out of the pit answered yes as much as would allow by the codes there are some electrical items that have to be in there by the code and they removed everything out that they could stated that the one thing that he should add to this is that is significantly different from the last time is that they had a little residential sump pump that just pumped the water up to the grass lawn and with this drain it is being tied into the sanitary sewer system and as mentioned they will be able to remove that water in a high volume capacity into the drainage system and get it totally off site stated that it is going to be a forced main sewer also stated that another key component is worth noting is that the previous motors that were in here were manufactured by different what they did this time because they had the opportunity to use us communities it is one manufacturer who has produced all of these pumps and they are all tested at the factory before they are delivered so when they arrive they arrive on a pallet and they literally get dropped in and attached to these various valves so in the future if one pump fails they can order the same pump again from us communities and it will come in on a rack drop it in and take the old one off and attach the new they did not have this opportunity in the last design that they board of parks and recreation minutes page ten with the main control panels will be up near the greenhouse building where the main circuit boards are what is being put inside the pit are little that will literally open the valves and close the valves which is no different than what you would have with an irrigation system added that as part of the code requirement there must be a mode of disconnect and they are trying to keep everything in the pit of electrical nature to a minimum stated that another point of clarification with the new design opens up the pit completely and now when a maintenance has to go down and service these pumps the area has been greatly simplified with these compacted motors as well as they have added a new a new pit for the filtration system so none of the chemicals are in the pit it is so important for the preventive maintenance side making it physically easier for the technician to get in there and change out the filters or replace anything that needs replacing in the chemical component is osmosis and it is in its own pit just for the filtration of it asked if this is approved what is the for having water spewing out of those fountains answered that they are shooting for memorial day clarified that that is the date that they are really hoping for fountain operation also stated that with everything else weather and all the other items since this is an outdoor project is shoot for that date and that is what is stated in the contract for this to take place with that being said it could rain every day that they are doing this work and at that point it is not only the rain that is happening that day but subsequently every day after the wait for drying out has to take place before they can do more side work so that is the date that they are shooting for and this is the only thing he can tell for sure is that they are shooting for that date added that again to this schedule last year they awarded the repair of the fountain basins so there is another contractor who is actually sealing the cracks in the basins and painting that separately this project also replaces all the old lights in each one of the basins to new led lighting which has a much longer life cycle and also as far as utilities a very conservative on energy as well chairman asked if there were any other questions from the board members there were not a motion was duly made by bowman seconded by greenwood and unanimously passed to approve agenda item agenda item approval by the board of parks and recreation of the consolidated city of for amendment amending the professional services agreement for design and construction documents for chuck site and building renovation to shook in the lump sum amount of stated that the chuck project is on the street right now for bidding what this item does is it gives their designers the money then to do submittal reviews and to do some periodic site inspections they take care of the majority of these themselves but they have progress meetings and this is job that is going to take pretty close to a year to complete so they are going to have a progress meeting and attending the progress meetings and all the the spec book on this project is about board of parks and recreation minutes page eleven inches thick and there is a lot of things that they have to look at and approve in order to get this project done and this is what this item is for to amend the existing contract to extend time so that they can get this project completed by of chairman asked if there were any questions from the board there were a motion was duly made by seconded by and unanimously passed to approve agenda item agenda item approval by the board of parks and recreation of the consolidated city of for justification of a professional services agreement with access valuation for work associated with appraisals of land involved in the conversion at eagle creek park in the smith came to present this item and mentioned that he believed the agenda stated that was supposed to be the one presenting this item and tells you that it is not for him whatever hes got but it is painful listening to him he can tell you that wants to thank actually put this contract together so he wants to thank him for doing that but since it was an appraisal contract that he wrote it up for he felt that it might be a little better for to present this item to the board stated that this really a small piece of what is a huge project having to do with the range out at eagle creek park and he is not prepared today to talk to you about the project as a whole but what he would like to do today is limit the discussion to attempt to the board to approve this appraisal contract that you have in front of you they are going to have to appraisals done on a acre tract at eagle creek where the range currently is located and they also need to in conjunction with this conversion that is referenced here they are going to have to have appraisals done on substitute property where at the end of the day is going to have to have substance value equal to or greater than the acres that we have at eagle creek we really know at this point we know what we have at eagle creek what has to be appraised there but what we know is how many different properties how many acres we are going to have appraised to be able to match up exceed the value of those acres at eagle creek so this is a contract of stated that he cant tell you if it is going to cost any where near that maybe less than that by a long shot we just wont know until they get into this they do know one thing that they cant take that first step without the parks board approval nick was asked to be here today and did not get a phone call from him and is sure that something must have come up because he indicated to that he was going to be here today and he will on his behalf for him not being here today and the timing is critical on this as well and they would like to go ahead and get started on this and with the boards permission they can do this don if he wanted to add any more color to this or not in terms of background he tried to keep it limited but you want to add something more don stated that he thinks the question that the board members have is why are we even doing this and that board of parks and recreation minutes page twelve probably will be the big question and the easiest way to answer that is there is a program called conservation funds that is operated by the national parks service and administered by the state of and we had used years ago federal dollars national park dollars to construct the range use these conservation funds the facilities you build have to be open to the public greater than percent of the time they prefer it to be percent of the time but at a bare minimum percent of the time well a lot of things have changed over the years with eleven and the amount of training that our department of public safety has to go through to be ready to protect us in our communities the use at the facility has been limited to about hours a week for public access so this puts us in violation of this federal program that we use these dollars for and in order to put us back in good standing with the national park service and the state we need to take this covenant off the land and place it on land somewhere in our system now the board has been very good to him over the years and and a lot of these properties that we have been bringing to the board to receive the board has allowed them to place these properties at our parks foundation and they are presently holding several of these properties that will be the properties that the appraiser looks at to replace this covenant on the eagle creek piece and once they do and if they are accepted by not only the state first but then the national park service they then will come back to the board and let the board fully accept them back as our inventory and the foundation will give them back to us as we will not loose the land out here at eagle creek park it will still be parks land he just will not have this deed restriction on the property it will be lifted up and placed on these other properties that are for outdoor recreation use asked where is the funding coming from to purchase these properties don explained that as he mentioned earlier that was where the board has been so generous over the years he has been planning this for a long time and you even helped over the years when you were director of parks don stated that he knew they had this issue evolving and so every time a developer came and gave us a property he came before the board and asked his permission and asked director permission and at the time at the parks foundations permission to place these properties over at the parks foundation so these are the properties that will cost this board nothing to receive these properties which were gifts and were just placed on hold by the parks foundation and if they match up as and approved these properties will be given back to us free of charge the departments cost is in the conversion these dollars here today and then we hired green last year who is running the other part of this project actually preparing the legal documents for the national parks so there are two contracts if you would that is helping us bring this project together stated that he knows that don and are good land people and he asked if don believes what property is being held is going to be equal don answered yes he does he really does he even believes that the one they were looking at park which was given to us down off of southeastern avenue which is part of a grant and will be a full park when it is completed in less than probably years it will have playgrounds and parking lots and shelters and water he is also looking at this new park board of parks and recreation minutes page thirteen property technically that could be given to the parks foundation by landfill and then passed back to the parks department if it was approved and just with these pieces of property alone potentially could meet this requirement if not we potentially have to others to be looked at forest manor is another one where we have around acres of all woodland that goes right up to forest manor the baseball diamonds josh we also have a couple of other properties as help us with this stated that he and don have a couple of surprises up their sleeves that they cant share with the board today and we like to save those for greenwood because she loves when they come before her with land gifts stated that we have more than enough to take care of this and we just want to be very judicious with what we put out there in terms of either if they come back to us and say that they need more we have more greenwood stated that she knows is going to bring it to them stated that he thinks of greenwood every time we have a gift of property as well stated that he knows you have a lot of public out there using the range but once you move this from public use there will be some push back on it only because one person is going to say they want to shoot and now they cant use that range how are you planning on addressing these concerns don stated that they will still have hours of public use there stated that that wont change we have a contract with a professional arms person that oversees this use and supervises and gives training classes and the department anticipates this to continue they are not being asked by public safety to leave the premises our problem is not the public use the problem is there is not enough public use it will not go from whatever it is to zero it will stay the same as it is right now is what the department is anticipating these are available times when public safety is not using the range we anticipate this actually to stay the same or even increase because there is quite a demand to practice at that range stated that this is probably more true recently don agreed with that more recently chairman asked if there were any other questions from the board there were not a motion was duly made by greenwood seconded by bowling and unanimously passed to approve agenda item agenda item approval by the board of parks and recreation of the consolidated city of for the fee proposal from infrastructure engineering inc for the design and construction drawings for bean creek bank north of the center at park in the amount of stated that this item is for design services for fixing the bank shown on the overhead and also further more upstream where we have some more problems where the bridge is stated that they are watching the tree that is on the left hand side the bank was getting a little bit closer and closer and they thought they would have some additional time but that this last winter and rather than loose the trail then subsequently the parking lot over at the center board of parks and recreation minutes page fourteen they decided that they better do something to stabilize this area was gracious enough to do some initial stabilization so that we have to worry about but it is not something that we want maintain over the next bunch of years so what they have done is talk to infrastructure and is here and is back there as well in the audience if you want to talk to him stated that to do a design and what is kinda unique about this is and can probably talk to you about it a little bit more is rather than just use a standard type of design for this they are looking at using logs to stabilize this bank and turned the floor over to stated that the method that the are actually proposing for this is called the toe wood sod mat stabilization so it is more of a natural method rather than using a structural for the toe which makes it a little more permit the state agencies tend to go for this a lot more and the idea would be that they would bench out part of the stream and create the toe stabilization by using logs of different sizes and drive them into the bank to create the toe stabilization and create a where it could silt up and slowly become part of the bank itself and above that there would be a sod mat that would have native and then eventually as the whole bank starts to it takes the stream itself back to its conditions chairman asked if there were any questions from the board asked if infrastructure engineering was a stated that they are an stated that they have done some other work with us previously they are who we used for the coffin bank stabilization as well and they have done some work for us previously don stated that he for how much he has to say today but he must have had too much coffee to drink stated that it has all been good things so go right ahead don stated that this toe of wood technique is that we are using is going to be the first example of this usage in the state of and out west it has been used extensively and they have been using it on large rivers like our white river to stabilize these embankments and because this is unique and they think it is going to be because they are working with the center for environmental sciences over at the state primarily bob who has helped them with pleasant run they think they can seek other dollars and he is hopefully he will not have to come back to the board for the construction side of it and that the soil water conservation folks at the state are very interested with this as maybe a demonstration project and also we think that the department of public works have a lot of interest in this because if this works as well as it has in and other places this could stabilize a lot of the out at eagle creek where they have some particularly on the and we would receive folks coming into town to observe this example within parks to take back with them it is much better in many ways because it us using the natural system instead of armoring it with concrete or baskets and stones because that is just a short term fix many times the energy in that stream hits off those hard surfaces and very much like a pool table or the ball bounces off the rail to the other side and causes damage on the other side this defuses all of that energy of the stream into this natural he is also working with our urban forester and we believe we can harvest some of the ash trees that have died at park and use some of those same trees in a productive way as the that goes into the embankment board of parks and recreation minutes page fifteen because you tip the trees over and you leave their root systems on and that becomes that irregular pattern on the tree that allows everything to kind of bind up like a spider web so we are going to use some of our own materials instead of just chipping it off we are going to have them set some logs and use them on this particular project it is kind of exciting he likes to think that parks is always on the cutting edge and trying to be and we appreciate the support of the board when they help us be a visionary in these areas chairman stated that it is a good sustainable application don added it is very sustainable chairman asked if there were any more questions from the board members there were none a motion was duly made by bowman seconded by and unanimously passed to approve agenda item agenda item approval by the board of parks and recreation of the consolidated city of for the acceptance of the fee proposal from infrastructure engineering inc for the design and construction drawings for the trail repair along fall creek in the amount of stated that while he was talking to infrastructure about the problems we were having at he said he has a bigger safety problem over at fall creek when the creek rises we have this problem stated that what they are going to do is get rid of the items that have created the except the water because that is going to stay anyway and rework the trail so that it is a safer area and we do not have to worry about the riling up that area and washing out the trail itself chairman asked if there were any questions from the board members there were none a motion was duly made by seconded by greenwood and unanimously passed to approve agenda item agenda item approval by the board of parks and recreation of the consolidated city of for the acceptance of the fee proposal from and associates for the evaluation and programming of automation controllers at thatcher park family center island park ice rink and municipal gardens family center in the amount of jack president of and associates greeted the board interrupted and stated that he needed to talk a little bit first stated that is also a graduate of dame and that this is as close as dame and state gets sitting right here stated that what he has here is a proposal to better utilize the existing control systems that we have right now what they plan to do is do some additional programming and do some additional work at each one of these different areas to make them more energy efficient to use what we board of parks and recreation minutes page sixteen currently have in place passed the floor over to jack to explain the specific plan that they have stated that for about three years he has been working with the office of sustainability as the energy manager on some energy improvement projects and they have worked on a number of parks facilities with control through that project as he was working on the project and worked closely with and mike he came to appreciate that a number of systems were a little bit older and it had been a while since they had been commissioned or so that they were confident that all of the points were working and all of the sequence of operations were proper the schedules were right and matched up with the hours of the facilities and all they spent about hours with an engineer in and of last year going through all of these facilities with mike on the computer and document all the different controllers and they raised a number of questions about whether things were really working the way they were supposed to or not and whether this piece of equipment was working correctly or not and from that they developed a number of proposals of number of hours to go back into certain facilities to in fact do that work to map and document all the control points to do a programming that was necessary to get the system back into harmony with the hours of operation and the temperatures needed in the facilities and then to document all of this on the that they look at all of these facilities can be accessed remotely on the computer to adjust schedules and this is a great benefit that we have now and pointed to the overhead screen pictures stated that they are not confident that what they see is in fact working properly at the sites they picked the four largest facilities and energy consuming sites to start with and they will spend about of the annual energy expenditures there with the notion that they will get all of that back before this year is over stated that their history as a company as an owners rep and working in this area they have generated savings in the to range on this kind of activity going back in and working with the systems and getting them kind of up to scratch chairman asked the board of they had any questions there were none a motion was duly made by bowman seconded by and unanimously passed to approve agenda item there being no further business before the board of parks and recreation chairman made a motion to adjourn and seconded by and unanimously passed to adjourn the meeting board of parks and recreation minutes page seventeen the next scheduled board of parks and recreation meeting is and relocated to park stop road
