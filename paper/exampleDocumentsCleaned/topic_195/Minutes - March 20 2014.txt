the meeting of the board of parks and recreation was called to order by chairman at pm room building east street chairman john josh bowling and valentine deputy corporation counsel staff absent greenwood approval of minutes none chairman greeted the board and the and he thanked everyone for being there chairman greeted the board members and guests chairman stated that he has a couple of announcements first and foremost it is that time of the year again where we at parks are looking for lifeguards for our pool season those of you who are watching on television if you know someone who be interested in becoming a lifeguard this summer please contact the parks department and we would be more than happy to put you on staff you have to know how to swim obviously and be able to pass our tests of training to become certified and we are looking forward to having a full confident summer staff to help us open up our pools for a safe summer season secondly we have been working on different kinds of promotions and there is a new one that he believes is a good idea that if you want to support parks the department store and the national parks and recreation association have ripple park as a location for what they call a new your park initiative through what this means is you can go to the location only and when you purchase items and acknowledge that you would like part of the proceeds to go towards the project at broad ripple park if you happen to find your way to at mall please remember to support parks thank you this is all chairman has as announcements and we do not have any minutes to approve at this time and we will be approving last months minutes in agenda item the resource development division is recommending that the board of parks and recreation support the sons of confederate veterans in their efforts to raise all funds necessary to restore the park confederate prisoner of war monument don greeted the board and introduced and he has been able to have the benefit to work with on this project for quite a while now to work with his ideas and what he is trying to accomplish and as we all know the sons of confederate veterans memorial down at park has been there for a number of years and has fallen into disrepair the caulking joints are and in particularly the brass plaques are needing aid and typically this is not something that the park agency have the resources to make those repairs and particularly when we have leaky roofs systems expenditures came to him with an idea he would like to take on an opportunity to take on to fund raise this and what we have here before you today seeking out the board support to start this initiative they are not asking for any of the dollars to be involved in this and he will let really speak to you of all the details they have met with the parks foundation president and the foundation is more than happy to receive the funds they are not going to raise any additional funds for this project but they are very much in support of receiving the funds and holding those funds until the time of the expenditures and if there are any additional dollars left over from the fund raising process those dollars will remain with the foundation for any future maintenance activities if the board would so allow him he would like to turn the floor over to to go over his presentation to talk about what he is hoping to do for this war monument thanked don and the board for his opportunity to present his proposal to the board pointed to the first slide on the overhead screen noting that the monument is about to feet tall and about foot wide the monument has six bronze plates on its sides on each side this monument and of course that is him standing in front of it on the slide which gives you a proportion of how big this monument is the monument was in by the united states federal government to honor the confederate that died here at camp here in during the civil war in the early as the city began to grow the green lawn presently the diamond chain company became in so they every body located in the which included the confederate soldiers which took them about years to finish the project and they moved them out to crown hill where they rest at this time in the southern club of asked the parks board to move the monument while they were doing this of these veterans to park as being the only city park in at that time of course the board approved the monument to moved to park during the due to cost and the great depression that struck the united states this monument was not moved due to the financial costs that they could not afford so it has been sitting in the park since the condition of the monument is not bad for year old monument the stones are in great condition a lot of the caulking is missing and of course the brass plates are severely weather worn with mold and in a bad state of affairs the next picture on the overhead screen shows the monument on the shady side and you can see all the black mold the picture on the right is a closeup of what the brass plaque will look like when restored with is president of monument company who has been in business since and he has been asked to help them restore this monument his goal and request is to restore the monument for the city of public for the next years he is a member of the sons of confederate veterans which is southern historical society geared towards the preservation of the history and the heritage of their confederate ancestors has received approval from the to raise these funds for this he has obtained a quote from to complete the project and he has been in contact like stated with the parks foundation and they have stepped up and agreed to hold the funds and distribute the funds for the expenditures of the repair and that with any funds left over they will hold as future funds into an escrow account for future maintenance expenses and there will be no burden on the city of or the tax payers of for maintenance of this monument and they hope it last for a very long time since the monument is in extremely good shape for a year old monument went on to tell the board of his personal story he stated that he is extremely excited for the board to give him the opportunity to make this restoration and thanked the board for allowing him to present to them his proposal he is hoping that he will received the boards approval for him to proceed with this restoration it is a win win for park and for the lastly being a member of the sons of the confederate veterans people look at you in a strange way and he understands the sensitivity behind this but his organization is in now way here to make a political statement in any way or stir up any old wounds they are here strictly for a restoration project of a beautiful monument which sits in the city park at park one last thing there are some people he would like to thank and they are of course the parks foundation the friends of park city county miller of district which encompasses park who is on board as well as city advisor to the mayor who is also on board kip who is a legislator of for the disabled veterans and ham with the department of veterans affairs and don who has helped him over the last year and a half reach this point for the approval of the restoration and he thanked the board for their time and hopes that they approve his request chairman thanked for his presentation chairman asked if the board had any comments or questions stated that this is a very sensitive issue obviously also stated that it is stated that they have also had issues with putting statues on the cultural trail and it got all blown out of proportion and he know how he will move with this because there will be some sensitivity from the public and he think that there would be such an with the statue on the cultural trail either about slavery and the slave monuments and with the confederacy you have to be very sensitive when you bring something like this forward in the public eye the statue on the cultural trail became a big issue with neighborhood meetings and they said they were not going to do it when you talk about confederacy and things like this you will be opening old wounds he grew up in south and this is a very sensitive issue and he only says that to let everyone know that it could be opening up something that needs to be very very careful in dealing with it he does support the restoration but he wants everyone to know what this could involve into a big issue and the people who were involved with putting the statue on the cultural trail the community foundation think that there would be an issue with that and it went crazy with issues when the push back comes you need to figure out how you are going to deal with it they deal with it very good with the cultural trail statue issue they spent a lot of money developing it stated that he and don have had this discussion several times and in his first meeting with don about a year ago this was one of the first things that he discussed with him stated that it is a little different because they are not putting up a new monument they are just restoring the one that is and has always been there for years with private funds he does the sensitivity for sure and would like to do this low key as possible they need newspaper articles cameras or stuff like that this is not there goal their goal is simply to take care of the restoration wants them to be prepared if there is any push back and to not be totally caught off guard if there is chairman stated that first of all there is a very good distinction between putting up a new statue verses restoring an historic monument there is always going to be that sensitivity chairman stated that he would advise to do a little bit of research and maybe you will have answers to any questions that and be prepared to answer if they come about with regard to sons of confederate soldiers because those organizations do exist as well stated that there are veterans that are buried at crown hill along with and a truck load of people from south and he is not sure what countries and for historical purposes people are in the war not necessarily because they wanted to be and as a veteran he knows that for himself and he unfortunate to go to battle but he was in the military at a time when the country was at war during the desert storm and he was very close to deployment and he knows there are a lot of people on both sides as to whether or not we should have been there he would hope that because of the service that he provided for our country he will be honored for his service regardless of or not they agree with why he was there in this respect he believes it is similar in nature people lost their lives on both sides of the battlefield stated that he prays that there will not be any repercussions from the public of this restoration process it is a historical monument and he hopes that it can be restored without any repercussions chairman asked if there were any other questions or comments from the board members ms valentine stated that she has just a question on the restoration piece of it is this put it back together for another years is it a year is there a way to this process curry stated that the monument is years old now and it just depends and it should look fine for the rest of our lives it will be completed in several steps step is to take the bronze plaques and send those to factory for sanding with crushed walnut shells to keep the bronze from restoration crushed walnut shells are less abrasive and then paint them and then belt them with a very large sander to go over the letters and the seal it it should last a very long time since it is is hanging on the wall there be general upkeep as general cleaning no maintenance on a regular basis the process will clean all the details out of the green and clay out chairman asked if there were any other comments or questions from the board there were none a motion was duly made by ms valentine seconded by bowling and unanimously passed to approve agenda item chairman stated that we have a presentation and while they get set up for the master plan which will give the board members an opportunity to hear the exciting things that have been going on this year with our master plan development and has been doing this and in the process of obtaining public comments and things of that nature so without further a do are our ready replied yes presentation master plan principal park and planner stated that before you hear from he wants to thank the board for letting them present and next month they will have the resolution before you for approval and hopefully if you have had a chance to read this massive document he knows it has been thrilling reading but he wants to thank a few key staff first the board for allowing them to be here today his boss don for pushing them to do the plan as well as they have for her assistance at several meetings and putting up with his bad jokes he would also like to thank staff and the from both and parks he believes that they have gone through every with this plan and last but not least he would definitely like to thank his right hand man who get as many kudos as he should as the man behind the curtain doing lots of work so he definitely wants to thank him for all his hard work and heavy lifting as other things are getting accomplished with that said he has challenged because they presented this plan yesterday before the development committee to finish the presentation to have us out of the meeting in time to watch later on today so he is going to turn it over to and would like to thank him and a couple of his staff and foster who does a lot of their heavy gin their office with putting together a lot of the graphics he is turning it over to but he will be around to tell any jokes or answer any questions you might have thanked and said he noticed that is running for cover thanked director deputy director and members of the parks board he appreciates the opportunity to talk to you today you received a hard copy of the master plan document and hopefully you have had a chance to thumb through it they are actually really excited about this project and what he wants to do is take a few minutes to give you an overview of what you are going to see in this master plan and give you a little bit of direction because he knows that the amount of information in here can be a little bit intimidating so we are going to step back a little and tell you a little about the process and how the recommendations from this document came to be and then we are going to show you what the master plan includes he believes you will see why they are real excited about this when we think about the a lot of times we go back to the plan which really was the first plan that really started to look at how we use some of our recreational open spaces if you look around the city today you can find pieces of that plan still in place there was a legacy that was left in the city by work but it is by no means complete this is still a vision that they are implementing today on the overhead screen is a photo of right before the winter began of the new construction happening on the fall creek just to the west of the trail there has also been some contemporary planning done the first plan that established the plan that is in place today was done in updated again in and it too left a legacy if you will on the city when we go out on a and we look at the people that are walking along the in broad ripple this really is the legacy that that plan has left this vision as well has not been fully implemented and today we are still implementing part of that system this is an image on the overhead screen from the south white river thats construction is just currently rapping up on that so he thinks it is important to understand when we start this that what they are doing is establishing the next vision if you will for where need to go in the city in the next years the next years and the next years and beyond just to give you a little bit of background our current system of trails and we have just under miles of trails in the city in the original or the plan from we still have about miles that have not been constructed another key number that we like to remind people of is the fact that we take user counts on all of our trails last year or in we had over million people use these are some significant recreational spaces their current system is broken into separate and some are rail some are long waterways but we currently have of those different systems in place and this is what the current plan system looks like on the overhead screen they have the to show you what is currently in there from the master plan now he is backing off a little bit and stated that the picture on the overhead screen now is actually the graphic that shows just what has been built from that plan you are starting to see some things emerge when you look at this map he is going to add this yellow line in here and what this is is what they term as the service area of that and it basically is a half mile fringe on each direction from a built and that is roughly a minute walk from a this starts to show us how many people and how many geographic area within county is within a minute walk of our again he thinks you can see that there is a pattern emerging and if you cant see it well lets change the graphic a little bit and take a look at the additional graph on the overhead screen which depicts the map of county and their townships and you can see our are developed in and center townships there are reasons for that with some of the early planning that went on but we do have a system today that is in those townships we also are living in a time in the city that is much different than when the or the plans were done what they are seeing around the city now is we have an bicycle culture we are seeing many many miles of new bike facilities such as the bike lanes and the emphasis on using your bicycle to get around there is an evolving health and fitness awareness as well as the new transit initiatives that are happening across the city there are initiatives out there to reconnect to our waterways and there really is a growing resurgence in neighborhood planning and development trying to figure out at the neighborhood scale we are starting to plug into the city both the uniqueness of getting people to those neighborhoods as well as how those neighborhoods can plug into the system to be connected to other things what they are doing with the full circle plan obviously trying to look at obviously some of the improvements that are needed to that existing system but they are really establishing the new vision for and this is an important thing that we have to do because completing this plan helps to ensure that the are not only plugged into these other initiatives and the regional transportation plan but also make sure that the are for the different types of federal funding we seek to try to construct different portions we have been going through our planning process for a little bit over a year now and he thinks this is probably something that is important for the parks board to understand and this is that this plan really has been driven by public engagement it has been driven by a level of public engagement that you often see in plans like this he wants to show the board some of those tools that they have used the past year and a half from the very beginning of the project they wanted to make sure that people were aware of what was going on what was happening with the plan why they were doing it what it was all about so they began the process by having a series of promotional brochures printed and distributed to libraries community centers schools any place that would take a stack they pretty much delivered those there was also a project website established and this website really is the portal if you will to this plan they have been able to put materials on this website for the public meetings so that if people were not able to attend the public meeting they have been able to direct them to the site and they are able to obtain the information and know what has been going on they have had a very active social media platform one of their tools that they have used the most has been their page that is specific to the project and what this has really done has allowed them to connect with several different people on a more intimate basis much more informal basis so that they are able to strike up conversation about anything that might come up in the planning process another unique thing that was done for this is that they opened a project office in boulevard station the historic rail depot is right where the meets th street and one day a week the project development team and folks from his office would be staffed there where people could schedule meetings and come in and talk to them the neighborhood groups could come in and talk to them or if they just wanted to stop by and see what they were working on they could sit down at the table and pull out some sketch paper and work with them they were pretty successful there in broadening the type of input we were able to get incredibly they expected to get folks to come in with scribbled notes on notebook paper and they got some of that but they also got some of this people were coming in with their neighborhood plans with ideas for what the trails could be of how trails could connect and where things could go and they think that this was really successful and they think that they are starting to see that same model being replicated in some other going on in the city there also was an online survey conducted with residents and this was just a experience because what you are going to see in some of the recommendations is driven by some of the things we received as part of this he has blown this part up and he thinks that one of the startling facts to them was that of the people who took the survey of those people have to drive to get to a and if this startling enough of the people who had to drive to a had to drive more than miles so another way that the same question was asked as seen on the bar graph on the right side of the overhead slide asked the question of if you use the why is that of the people said because there is no near their home or neighborhood the data that they received from this survey was pretty beneficial because it allowed them to start bringing those types of things into their recommendations they have also been pretty active as you have noticed rather it be the development committee meetings or public meetings on channel and they have had a real extensive series of different public events and meetings they have held official public meetings including one in each township and by his count tonight it is the th public presentation that they have given on this plan and they have been very visible and very active and they have been trying to make sure that if you have something to say about the and they heard it by now he is not sure if it is shame on us or shame on you but they have made a great effort to make sure that the folks have had an opportunity to talk to us we have shown up everywhere if you went to the mayors polo pedal you probably saw a bunch of them walking around with the ask me stickers on their shirts wanting to talk about the they held a day at the city market during the lunch hour and they set up every exhibit that has been done and talked to folks as they walked through even on national bike to work day at boulevard station they sponsored a rest stop where they invited people to stop on their commute home and come in and get some refreshments and talk about the plan so they have had a significant amount of public engagement and when you look at your master plan packet there is a that is in the back cover that contains all the notes from the different meetings and all the public meeting comments so you have some access if you want to see the types of things that they have heard and people responded pretty positively to them now he has shown you all these different things that they have done in terms of public engagement and if you were to ask him what are the four biggest things you heard the and we had to narrow that down to these are the four things that they heard connectivity options interface with neighborhoods lack of options in the southern townships he also thinks it is pretty interesting to hear some of the other things that were discussed during the life of this design process a couple of these things are pretty recent and he thinks these are exciting because these are things that the start to plug into and the types of things that the can help elevate within the city of we know that livability magazine just ranked as one of the best downtowns in terms of connectivity the readers of today has ranked as the top convention center city largely due to the connectivity of its downtown and and the cultural trail is often mentioned the new times has done a feature travel article telling people that you need to come to thats where big things are happening another big thing that has just happened the people for bikes has just selected as one of the cities for their new project which is a really big deal and this one just blows his mind he is going back to the new times in was listed as one of the places that they feel you have to see he know if you have looked into this or if you have read this article but when you go to this list is not what you would typically think one of those cities would be and it is a great recognition of some of the things that are going on so this brings us back to the star this is the editorial from and this was the morning of the grand opening of the cultural trail so that weekend we had downtown flooded with people there were events all along this trail marching bands going up and down the trails and the star posed the questions what is the next big thing that the city of will undertake we think this is the full circle master plan he went on to show a little of the document itself which was passed out the the board members for their reading pleasure and he went through the goals and he go through all of them but showed them on the overhead screen a copy of this full circle master plan is attached to these minutes as well he would be happy to address any questions the board have and he appreciates the time that they have given him to give them this update chairman thanked for the presentation and all his hard work that he has put into this process stated that he hear anything in the plan about security he would hope that this plan is shared with someone in public safety because when you open up a system this wide you you are definitely going to have security concerns and he hear him touch on this replied that they started to address this heavily and they had some meetings with some different park rangers out at the project office as well as with people on their survey said they feel safe on that was another number that was startling to them we expected to hear a lot about the public security and safety and people feel relatively safe so what they have done is that they have met with them and they have talked about what some of their needs are in order to be able to patrol this and he thinks it is part of an ongoing discussion that needs to happen just like everything else because rather it be the maintenance or security a lot of people will look at the system and wonder how do we expand to take care of all these new miles he thinks that every body is still trying to deal with some of these issues stated that this is what he saying and you are talking about opening up a system from his standpoint somebody from public safety needs to look at the plan and the cost of providing security throughout this system another thing that came about during the recent new package was developing a new emergency response they currently have mile markers and somebody can call in and say they have a problem at mile of this trail and there is always a little bit of of where exactly is that or how do i get to that point and part of the design standards include a new system that was developed that provides specific at different places along the trail stated that this is the kind of discussion that needs to be discussed for monitoring from public safety to start thinking about how to monitor the emergency calls stated that as part of the whole public meeting process public safety these discussions will still be taking place and when they get the construction documents safety is be people at the table seeing what these issues are ms valentine asked when was this started as a process has it been a year years replied that it was of last year stated that it was actually a little be fore then but their contract started in of ms valentine stated that is is very impressive and she is a huge fan of the trails and she trained for the marathon on the white river parkway and would run over the the canal towpath and she feels she might have ran on all of them you mentioned somewhere and then she see it as a priority and she is assuming this come out from the public input part of it and it is a totally selfish question restrooms is that something that emerged or just something that is just so costly when you look at the entire existing miles she also has small children and it is also important for families restrooms came up during the public process they have taken a look at the public restrooms and they have taken a look at some of the standards that kind of meet the requirements careful thought has to be taken about the design hours of operation safety and trying to strike the balance of having those types of facilities and it really is a tough question the city is trying to position those type of facilities in their local parks that are near the so that there will be more activity and more security one of the things the plan does deal with and they are still working through what we want the comfort stations standards to be but that is included in there ms valentine also stated that at some point you have to think about cost of implementing and she turned to the back page and it have a giant number so she is assuming that in process you would adopt a master plan and then you look at the priorities and then you begin to piece out the cost for that is this how this works chairman stated that he believes touched on this and the different things that are associated with each trail is that correct chairman stated that you have to look at the individual trail stated that they have a planning level cost it is difficult because especially with some of the new routes with this master plan level it wont get you into the number of properties that you have to buy and there is always unknowns but they sort of have a rule of thumb cost that they can tell you what they think the costs would be in the range of but one of the things that he thinks they have been careful with the planning process rather they are meeting with maintenance or the public security people it is the same thing with the costs and this is really the long term vision and we necessarily build and operate trail systems the same way today that we did even or years ago and he thinks part of the challenge the city has even when you look at the trails that are being implemented now they are being paid for a little bit differently and implemented a little bit differently than what they have been just a few years ago so part of that cost you know there be some areas in there of undeveloped parts of county where there be some private investments or a developer be to help build segments there be creative ways to get other types of construction done to bring the costs to the city down ms valentine stated that it is a beautiful design a motion was duly made by bowling for adjournment seconded by by and unanimously passed to adjourn the next board of parks and recreation meeting is scheduled for at pm to pm at thatcher park located at street
