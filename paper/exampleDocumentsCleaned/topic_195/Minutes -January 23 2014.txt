in the process of working with a particular group to do some work over in that area of and riverside and talking to them about doing something like this chairman stated that we did have a celebration at park and we had some folks there like governor pence was there to celebrate and they did some minor work while they were there chairman stated that they usually do that on an annual basis chairman asked if there were any other comments from the board members if not we have the minutes of and he would entertain a motion a motion was duly made by greenwood and seconded by and unanimously passed to approve the minutes of agenda item the resource development division is recommending that the board of parks and recreation of the consolidated city of accept amendment to the original contract for additional time for the update of the master plan by design group to greeted the board members telling them good afternoon and thanked the board secretary first he stated happy new year he seen them in a while it is good to be here said to that he looks good thanked he stated that he thawed out yet and the reason for this amendment to the contract is basically to give more time for and who is our consultant time to finish up a few things because of the weather and or whatever it has been called they have not been able to meet some meetings with operations to go over some recommendations for maintenance along and just a few little formalities and what you see on the overhead screen is basically the proposed for what is going to happen next they will be getting a draft to our resource development team of the master plan they have been calling it the manifesto because every time they meet with them it seems to be getting bigger and bigger they will be reviewing that and he would like to tell his wife on that they probably will not be having a valentines day celebration and as you can see on the chart that is he is to read that and get it back to them to make their revisions and then at the next board meeting they plan to basically have the draft available for you but also for the general public and in those next to days before they plan to have a public meeting and get reviews from them and then bring it to the board for a presentation and then in another days for the board to review it and then they will ask the board to approve it and then it will be final and our next draft for the next decade or for however long before the next update he has here from if there are any questions but that is basically why they are asking for this adjustment of time for the contract chairman asked the board if there were any questions stated that he has just one the new trail along fall creek parkway is that included in this plan the one that is being built now coming down central it that a part of this plan answered that it is shown on this plan and it was also originally in the previous master plan that is why these master plans are important because once funding is available they can go from scoping to construction document and those plans have been sitting on the shelf for a very long time and he said those plans were actually done in and that tells you how long those plans have on the shelf that was part of the last master plan but you will see that dash line go into a solid line because now it is in construction mode chairman asked if there were any other questions from the board there was not chairman entertained a motion then a motion was duly made by seconded by bowling and unanimously passed to approve agenda item chairman stated that we are finished with all the official business today and we are pleased to welcome the friends of park here today to talk about something that he knows they find near and dear to their hearts and he has met

on their progress they have presented to the board twice now she thinks once in of and again in of as many of you know the friends of park is an independent charitable organization committed to preserving the park they work closely with parks to build support and maintain many aspects of park including the playgrounds the rock garden trails programming summer concerts series just to name a few the friends also raised million dollars to construct and endow the nature center which opened to the public in currently they are now engaged in the public phase of a million campaign to revitalize the ruins and the exhibit hall in the nature center this also includes an endowment to maintain them in the future which resides at since the nature center has served over program participants and visitors including area school groups years of high visitation have lead to wear and tear on the exhibit hall and most of the components are reaching the end of their life expectancy their new plans are very exciting the new exhibits will improve the educational impact of the space and they will encourage people to go outside and experience nature visitors when they come into the exhibit hall they will be in the habitats of park there will be activities throughout the areas primarily geared for kids that are preschool through second grade some of the highlights include the forest area with a tree that has activities that demonstrate the and the forest floor the white river area which features a water table that they feel certain will be very popular as well as the unstructured play area which will have toys books costumes and all their things and the wetlands area which features a table where children can the sounds that the animals make in the wetlands studio has been collaborating with their project team on the design and they recently signed a contract to move forward with them if their entire fund rising goes well the new exhibits will be installed by of and endowment is the lead sponsor for this area is here if you have further questions during their questions and answer section and he can answer those for you on to the ruins the ruins today continue to behind a fence and they are completely to the public this beloved icon of park is right now dangerous unusable and sets a tone of neglect that affects the park the new design by nine bark and reed reestablishes the ruins as open safe and in inviting place for the public to go use and enjoy and truly taking a back to the centerpiece of the park the revitalized ruins also has the potential to provide a revenue stream for the park through rental facilities for special events such as weddings parties community festivals concerts and they see a lot of great things happening in park fund raising for this campaign started in the fall of and they about of their goal during that time and they went public last and john was there the night that they launched their public campaign they are very happy to report that they have only left to raise so with a little more work and a lot of luck they hope to see visible signs of construction at the ruins this summer she turned the floor over to ken now and she would be happy to answer any questions for the friends that you have at the end ken stated that as said he is ken from associates and they have the of taking incredible design for this great resource and neighborhood and help bring that to he said he would like to start with the overall sight plan just to orient everyone and refresh your memory on where this project has gone he stated that they are looking at the overall site plan which is organized as a progression of space along an promenade that begins at and moves to the east you will see they have a zone and they have the promenade that goes down the center of an ally of trees past the existing parking lot so that it is fully to people who arrive and park in this area along the promenade arriving at the ruins where the actually surrounds the ruins and has kind of a performance stage area on the west side of the ruins and then the shimmer pool picnic area on the east side looking at it in a little more detail and most of us are familiar with the orchard in bloom event that happens here each year and those of us who have had the of volunteering for receiving all the people that are arriving in this zone and ushering them into the orchard in bloom understand what the importance of this space out here and creating a zone which can actually hold buses at one time and multiple cars so they have where they expanded through the zone they go to the john and gateway with markers on either side of the and they continue on through to where both parking lots are fully accessible to the promenade they move on to the drive and you will see at certain locations along this route they will have and various site impertinences that accommodate the users needs at this new feature now going to the area around the ruins and when you arrive in this zone you will actually encounter at the very beginning by the recognition pilasters and the historic colonnade that then wraps around adjacent to the promenade so these pilasters will be right at the end of the alley and will give them an opportunities to give recognition to the primary donors to this feature they have the colonnade lawn which sits in an area adjacent to the stage and performance area and during events this is the area where you would see music being performed and people enjoying music on blankets on the lawn but at nonevent times it is obviously a wonderful area to drop a blanket and have a picnic also part of their of the features that are already there they will be the utility room and they will have their fountain equipment in there you can see that the gardens plank the ruins on the north in the center and also on the south and around the east side of the fountain on the east side of the ruins you have the water table that sits right below the and then the paved area immediately east of that water table is a shimmer fountain just a thin layer of water moving across it to add to kind of the fun and excitement for children playing at the water table immediately adjacent to that the promenade expands where we have some lounge chairs made out of obviously a place where parents are supervising their kids that are enjoying the shimmer fountain can relax and read a book as well as keep an eye on their children finally the picnic lawn is immediately to the east of this active area and actually as you think about it putting yourself just a little bit away from the ruins that is probably the most striking vantage point of the ruins when they are completed he then presented a slide picture in more detail of the water table and shimmer fountain the water table will be at a hight and have a channel along the back of it that will be the source of the water that then flows across the top of the water table and it is designed with a lip on it so that the water actually flows around follows that lip down to where it then hits a grove and then it drops down to the paved area below and then the shimmer fountain is from the water table all the way back to the edge of the edge of the promenade where there is the source of water that rises up from the channel and slides across that paved area up towards the water table ken showed pictures of examples of the shimmer fountains in very very popular in ken then went on to talk a little bit about the green fountain what we have here is a horse troth which was part of the original design and they are taking this and turning it into the fountain and then they will have a garden behind this with planting plants which makes for a landscape that attracts the birds and finally he wants to talk about in general how the design has been zoned for various uses he stated that they have the large zone that is north and south of the promenade which they are calling the community festival zone much of the tents that would be up for orchard in bloom would be in this area the promenade ally will be designed to allow the flow of people both north and south through there to get from one side to the other of the promenade next to this is the stage and concert area which sits right in the foreground of the ruins with a paved area for setting up bands and so on with the lawn area inside the circular promenade also finally the smaller programed events could be staged on the shimmer pool fountain side with the picnic lawn area he opened it up at this point for any questions from the chairman wanted to thank them again for their when he first started he met with the friends and was shown their vision and they talked about it and he wondered if they would be able to raise that amount of money within that amount of time and now to hear them state that they have only left to raise is amazing he certainly appreciates all the hard work everyone has done trying to raise the resources for this project he also understands the importance of the maintenance and how extremely beneficial having the endowment for this is really a wonderful thing greenwood stated that her grandchildren frequent park and they love it one of her received an a in her science class because she was so involved with the nature at park they always want grandma to take them there they live along way from the park but this is ideal for them and it is amazing how they still come back and they always want to visit park chairman stated that this is what we want is for people to want to return stated that it is good work and on the oasis of men could they please elaborate a little more on how this will be tied into the design replied that the will remain where they are on top of the columns and there has been some some of the limestone chunks have fallen off and they are in the process of evaluating how to conduct those repairs and how to avoid this happening in the future essentially they will remain in their current location also asked about some of the other statues around the fountain that are missing heads will their be included in this project stated that they are not utilizing them within this specific zone and they are not removing outside of this zone either again stated good job chairman asked if bowling had anything to ask bowling stated that he also wants to note that this project looks wonderful and that he have grandchildren but his children live all the way out east and they make their trips to park quite frequently mostly for the climbing amenity at the playground he hopes to return often soon stated that he would like to personally thank the friends and that this has really been a long journey and a fabulous project to work on but he really wants to extend his appreciation not only from himself but from his whole team of the ability and to work with the staff in the department and really truly listen to their concerns about the long term maintenance about the design and building this into not only the exhibit area they talked a lot about the issues and they have a real creative plan and they kind of said oops they missed a little of the issues and he brought that to the design teams attention and they quickly addressed it he cant tell you how much that is appreciated because ultimately we cant exist without partnerships like this and the investment that they make both in time and in resources but they also have to have a product that the agency can live with and being sensitive to some of the things that they have experienced in the past is so critical and he cant commend them enough for being responsive to this they have had the luxury of being very closely with both the landscape smock on the construction side and god bless when he was here he thinks it really makes for a holistic project that come together and satisfies both the internal staff who live and program these facilities and the partnership and closeness we have with the friends group thank you very much on behalf of himself and his team stated that he has one more thing he knows that they said that their is almost there and they are anticipating that the work might start this summer if all your is in place when do you think this will be completed answered that they would hope that it could be completed by sometime next summer or sooner they just have to receive those final dollars and the board feels very strongly that they will not move forward until they have all of the money they need to raise not only for the construction project but also for the endowment chairman stated that he thinks just kind of piggy back on this this is one of the very first agreements that he signed when he took over as director of the parks department and having talked with staff they were very much concerned with not allowing any thing to happen until all of the money was raised to be able to do this project including the endowment again being new on the block he know if they would be able to raise the million dollars that they had inspired to raise in such a short period of time but he thinks if they are intent on building out and completing the construction with the same that they had with the raising of the money then he has no doubt that they will get it done sooner rather than later and he want to put them on the spot to say when and he knows that the construction documents will dictate some of this he really would love to be able to see this come to and be open by next summer if that is possible and we can have a great celebration to let the people of know of all the great work and then showcase what they have accomplished he thanked them again asked chairman if he would have someone give a presentation on the because he has been getting a lot of questions from the article in the paper and what it stated but more of the details who in the department is heading this up chairman stated that is over this special project and what we will do is once we get all of the responses back and evaluate them and they get to a period of time where they have selected the vendors have been before the board if they have a contract that is going to be voted on then they will start talking about that there is limitations as to what they can talk about because if they are in negotiations then they will not be at liberty to discuss certain things so he could and he will talk to counsel about that asked if the board will be approving these chairman stated that it will depend on the result of the process so if there are contracts that have to go before the board then certainly they will bring them before the board and certain small projects whatever that the board has already vested the power is in his hands to make approval on those then this is what we will do in any event the board will be made aware of what is going to happen prior to that happening and to answer your question more specifically about doing a presentation he has to talk to counsel and see what we can and cannot do stated that he is not so much yeah just the process chairman stated that he understands that wants to know what the process is how many responses they receive stated that they do not need to know what the negotiations are taking place he has people calling him about giving this and that away and from a board member standpoint chairman stated that just for the listening public and very briefly he has had a couple of people ask him the same thing what they intend to do is be able to solicit opportunities as they have done before in the past where they can improve upon our park spaces he knows that this is very vague to a certain extent but what they are looking to do is give individuals or corporations what have you an opportunity to respond to an that was set out back in of to give us an idea of what they could possibly do to improve upon our parks add amenities to give you an example of the things that they have done in the past like go ape where this is a truly partnership so to the extent that people are saying that we are just going to sell all of our parks or privatize all our parks that was not the intent they are looking to have some really good partnerships that will facilitate amenities and that kind of thing even something like we have done here with the friends of park he would consider that a partnership where they are going to help us maintain and to a large extent redevelop or rehabilitate our assets that we have in our park system we cant do that alone stated that the only reason that he asked is the fact that and don comment and not we have gone into some very bad partnerships ace catering he hates to call them out was a partner took all the money and gave them bad facilities back the partner that we invested millions of dollars in it he stated that he can go down the list of ones that were partnerships took the resources and did not do the investments and he is just saying you know he understand and this is his concern because we spent a lot of money rebuilding facilities that were partnerships post road and he is not going to call the out because he does not want to put their names out there but he is just saying cautiously partnerships are good if they are going to benefit each other and this is all he is saying is the fact that he hopes that whoever is doing the evaluations have some benchmarks of who is going to benefit we lost a lot of ground trying to recover for some terrible partnerships chairman stated that you know as far as the public trust is concerned he thinks that the friends of park added not them and chairman said no no no stated that there is not an out there for park chairman stated that from a point of reference that since they are here he thinks it is really fitting to discuss it in these terms and that is as he has down and talked to them he thinks that they were able to really understand his position as the director of parks and recreation for the city of in saying that there are certain things that they just are not going to let happen unless certain things are met when we did the agreement with them and he thinks this is the first one in a long time according to don that was done this way that we would not let anything happen until there was substantial actually the dollars that were needed for this project were raised and they understand that unless they went out and raised number of dollars for an endowment for a maintenance aspect of it they were not going to enter into an agreement with them so he thinks they did their do as far as the parks department is concerned to make sure that our partner understands their position and moving forward any other partnerships that we have that is what we are going to do and make sure that our partners understand what it is that we expect to get out of this relationship having said that you know things can always go bad stated that one of the things and he wont hold them up you see is that the partner can always quit the partner can always come in and say had enough and walk away and we wind up digging ourselves out of the hole chairman stated that he totally understands this and he prides himself with being a pretty good stickler on process and control and with that being said it is going to be upon us to make sure that whatever it is that we do we have the best interest of the city at hand in that the individuals that are going to be proposing to do work with us have the where with on capacity to to do what it is that they say they can do if we do our job in making sure that we evaluate legitimately what it is that they are capable of doing then we are in our duties and he wont be that way he has worked with roach here and he has been on committees with when they have done large long term contracts where they really take to heart their responsibilities as public servants to make sure that they do their do diligence to do what is right for the city of and he will do that he will make sure that they have the appropriate personnel at the table to evaluate and if it make sense and it seem like it is going to work for the city of then they will not enter into those kinds of agreements we wont do things lets just put it that way chairman asked if there were any other questions from the board a motion was duly made by greenwood for adjournment seconded by by and unanimously passed to adjourn the next board of parks and recreation meeting is scheduled for at pm to
