authorize the grant of a perpetual nonexclusive easement for use by of inc in conjunction with a project to install citizen energy group project number a sanitary drop shaft at graham martin park formerly known as th street and fall creek park which is located at fall creek parkway east drive don greeted the board and stated that what is on the overhead screen is is a picture of graham martin park and on the west side of this park at avenue and street and he pointed out the most recent project where the old used to be is the area they are currently talking about this situation which was originally one of the department of public works project the deep tunnel project or dig where they are trying to separate some of the storm events with our sewer and bring them down into the deep rock limestone within our system this is generating some activity and they had a utility line had a line up on a utility pole that stretched across and because of the type of construction project this was they had to bring in some big cranes and they had to drop their lines and what they are asking the board to approve is to allow their lines to remain underground instead of bringing those lines back up on the top of the utility pole and hang them like they would traditionally would the electrical line from pole to pole this is pretty much what they are asking which is about feet wide and between to feet long as you can see the project has disturbed what was originally a walking trail around there and the trail would be put back there and we would just simply put the trail over the existing easement for recreational purposes don stated that he is not sure if he has a representative here from today and he looked the audience and he did not chairman asked if there were any questions from the board members asked if those lines are currently over the property don replied that they used to be prior to the big dig project and that is what is generating this conversation right now for the act of an easement which there was an air easement previously asked how close is this to the old blocks property don replied are you speaking of the cancer survivors park don asked to flip the slide back to the photography picture where he can use the pointer and show where this site is in with the cancer survivors park as you start to go up over the bridge it is right there at the edge of the bridge asked if we can get anything more than just the repair of the trail don suggested discussing that during the next agenda item which is very similar in nature and this item is strictly just a utility line don stated that either the line goes back into the ground which staff would like to recommend that it stays in the ground or the line comes back up on the pole and it gets put back how it existed previously if it goes back on the pole visually it becomes sort of a visual if you would greenwood that for safety reasons is it ok to go back under the ground don replied yes chairman asked if there were any other questions from the board members there were none a motion was duly made by greenwood seconded by bowling and unanimously passed to approve agenda item agenda item approval by the board of parks and recreation of the city of for the consolidated city of authorize the grant of a perpetual nonexclusive easement to citizens energy group the department of public utilities hereinafter in conjunction with a project to install a deep shaft sanitary system at graham martin park known as th street and fall creek park which is located at fall creek parkway east drive don stated that this is the exact same location as we were speaking of previously in agenda item in the same disturbed area but we are talking about this little zone in the corner now based on this project this is the project that actually disturbed the site when did their development they put in a walking path that started over in the corner over by the cancer survivor park and then went up to another zone that don pointed out on the overhead and stated that this is a citizens energy project and what they are proposing upon the completion of this project is to realign that trail back to the existing sidewalk and where it originally went one way it will tie into the top end of the route and put the trail back they also will be establishing the lights back along the trail that was there previously and regrading the site so it is easy to maintain don made mention of the red outline on the overhead show their permanent easement that is being asked for and that comes with a series of different things there is an entrance way that they have to get to to service that there is a utility building and some screen that they have to clean out some of the pipes in that and he does have three representatives from citizens energy here today that can speak to really the details and answer some of the questions that you have about what it is again this was a project that was originally started under it is kind of the consent decree that separates sewer from our utility lines and this will be occurring throughout the city of for a number of years and a lot of these will be on parks properties don asked if there were any questions for citizens energy anyone of the three members to come up and clarify chairman asked the board if they have any questions for citizens or don josh stated that they only time he has actually spent a significant time in this park is for cross country meets since this had become quite a place for cross country meets josh asked if in any way does this affect the course here and will this effect the long term use of this park don stated that this is an excellent question and the citizens contractors met with who is the coach that runs many of those events and he runs a very group as well as the high school events and they are actually shaping the land and don pointed to the turn point for the high school groups and noted that it is actually like out at the speedway where they have the bank don pointed to the land that will be shaped so as to when the runners come around that is a turn point and citizens has been very sensitive to the needs of the course and that and that will all be put back into place they never really ran on that section anyway but he showed where they turn and go all the way out to street then there is another course down below the levy that goes onto the bridge and there is a main course down where the white river state park is located and this is a main course and it is a great viewing spot because you are up on the embankment and the runners are up above and the runners are down below and this is one of the challenges when you go to a cross country meet you only get little windows of opportunity to see the runners where that course and graham martin park provides a wonderful viewing opportunity don stated that they that into this project has just a couple of questions obviously he is a park land advocate and he is always concerned about development on park property and he knows the importance of separating sanitation and storm water sewer and he supports that effort he is not against that but with all these projects coming onto park land his thing is going to be that there should be some development to the aspect of that park instead of just putting the park back where it was before being up and parks should get something back to enhance that park he know whether it would be or resurfacing basketball courts or something and we want to be supportive and we want to be a partner and understand the importance of making the city a better city but we just want park land to be up there just because it is park land he is interested in that and number he is interested in the building he knows you talked about the design and there is going to be a building and we have success with buildings and with buildings like the building there at carter park that sits there and is a stone building and it looks like a piece of junk but we cant move it we have good buildings that and we have one building where a house was built over a lift station and we have the buildings at th and arsenal that look good his concern would be that if you are going to do a building it has to be compatible to that park and we just stick a stone building there and we want some type of landscaping and we want to look at how that road and don you are a landscape architect and you understand all that we just want it to be a brick building stuck up there in the middle of the park those would be his concerns that there would be some consideration on the beautification and landscaping of that building and how that building is compatible to that park and get some type of enhancement in the park he want to be storm water because he understands the importance of it but he just wants to make sure that they get something and that when we put buildings in parks that they be compatible to the park don stated that he could answer that but he would actually like to ask a representative from citizens energy come up and he believes they would do a fine job of responding to that type of concern chairman added that as they come up he would like to add that he has met with citizens energy and talked about how they will restore the park and as mentioned how they would the park and he thinks john will give us some pretty good information about what it is that citizens is prepared to do and the conversations that we have had this far to insure that the parks system is going to benefit from having this kind of relationship chairman asked the citizens representatives to introduce themselves john director of special projects at citizens energy group and their prime focus is the deep funnel system for combined sewer overflow and as you mentioned that is part of the consent decree and over they years the work he has been involved with the past eight years or so on the project through work as consultant and then with citizens they have worked with parks and had recent workshops and they understand and they are developing the building so it fits in with the area and they are looking at redoing the fences and they make sure to coordinate with don and his group to make sure that everything is suitable as well as landscaping and they absolutely understand this and they are prepared to work with parks and leave it better than they found it and even add amenities as are appropriate stated that if that is comfortable consent chairman stated that as we move along most of the projects that they are going to start have not come on line yet parks has been in conversation with john and citizens and he has actually had several conversations with them and as they move along in their planning process we will sit down with them and talk more specifically about those parks that will be impacted and what needs to take place and as john said before that if there is an opportunity for us to add an amenity it would certainly be to do this they have already discussed this we really are not at that point yet to start making those kinds of decisions because they gotten to those other larger projects yet but they will be coming down the pipe mentioned that what would help him as a board member is that as you identify these locations is that they as a board get some type of a packet of where these projects are going to take place etc what some of the drawings will look like before they start as well that way they will not have be addressing the board one at a time and that way if there are locations in mind just think through how this information can become some type of packet that way as a board they can all have the information stated that they know things can change and they understand that asked for a on upcoming projects and what parks are going to be impacted what some of the amenities might be something like that to give them a little more don answered if director is comfortable staff just had the benefit because citizens invited his whole staff to stewardship planners construction team to a presentation which went over their future projects all the way to and they gave us a little photo packet and again it is a high level look but he thinks it is informative and if john is ok with that he would be happy to make copies and share that with the board replied just for the knowledge of knowing what is going on within the parks and they know that it could change but it gives the board a little more information director stated that john has been good about meeting with folks he and the director talked about a couple of individuals that they met with to let them know kind of what was going to happen and this really impacts the property and potentially would impact them he would only caution and you can maybe weigh in on this as far as the open door laws are concerned as far as meetings and the board is concerned if we are going to do a meeting it have to be here at the parks board meeting because of those kinds of legal but it it is a he would recommend taking a look at the deep tunnel and seeing how it operates and those kinds of things just to give you a little bit of an understanding on what it is going to look like because initially it seem kinda of scary when folks see that they are going to dig a hole on parks property but once that operation takes place because you are probably going to get people calling and saying there is going to be all this noise well there is going to be some noise and we cant say that there wont be but when you go down in there and you hear the operation going on from the top side you are not going to be able to tell other than the equipment that is there and they do a very good job of making sure that they mitigate for the dust and those kinds of things and they do a good job of traffic control and what have you so again if john is willing to do this from citizens end and he know if he has been still doing the tours you know john said stated he knows they did a deep tunnel dig at highland park and they put the park back together and the parks department got some amenities out of it and what have you don stated that it has been well maintained since then asked what is the plan to role this out how do you deal with the different neighborhoods when you do stuff like this don stated that these questions are for john john answered that they do a lot of work his public communications office does a lot of work at citizens as well as with the city and parks and any area they are going to impact they are doing a series of public meetings and most of their projects as don indicated their degree is at the end of and so most of their planning they have years to work together and this is their intent so they are in design of a lot of these and getting their preliminary things together and moving and altering things as much as we can and try to maintain a best value type project so that is an ongoing thing and this particular site is somewhat on a fast track because that is a redevelopment so bush stadium and some of the other developments is to try to get it in even though the tunnel will not actually be there for another four or five years and it was to get some of that infrastructure so we come back and tear things up don stated that as far as the architecture building they are working with citizens to try to what used on their new building so it is a modular but they are trying to be sensitive to the the type of brick color and they have to fence it in and as a landscape he not to have a fence but he understands the safety issues that are related to that and just the general public getting into this and some of this is very high voltage materials and you do not want people to mess with it don stated that they are going to try to be sensitive as much as they can with this project don stated that they are kind of confined a little bit by its proximity to the bridge and to the street but this was the nature of how they had to go underneath avenue there were limitations there he has forgotten the distance but there is a pretty significant bore under that street chairman asked if there were any other questions from the board there were none a motion was duly made by seconded by bowling and unanimously passed to approve agenda item agenda item authorization by the board of parks and recreation of the consolidated city of to authorize the director of parks to enter into a ground lease with the challenge foundation academy for the vision academy at riverside located at stadium west th street chairman greeted senior special project manager mentioned that as the board probably remember we talked about this not too long ago but as they were working through the lease agreement they came up with a couple of issues that due to the financing structure that a charter school will use it was different than what they would normally see when they work with schools that are developed in parks so it was determined that the best way to deal with this would be to go through a formalized request for proposal process they did develop a request for proposal which was advertised through the purchasing website and they did receive a proposal from challenge foundation academy for the development of the vision academy at riverside the terms of the agreement are exactly the same as what they had discussed before as far as improvements to stadium the term of the lease the shared use of the facilities and also the land replacement at this time we are requesting that we award the lease to the challenge foundation academy for the development of the vision academy at riverside and we ask that you authorize the director to enter into a lease with them chairman asked if there were any questions from the board stated that he believes he missed that board meeting he was in with the improvement to the stadium what are they planning to do ms replied that it has been up to us to determine what improvements are made and the staff has determined that the most important improvements are to seal the stadium and prevent water from infiltrating into the locker rooms and doing locker room improvements and if we have funds left then they will look at improving the main soccer field the east field stated that there is one thing that he wants to say and that is this information of improvements is great and he is glad to see the fence removal was one of the major reasons they lost the state tournament with a state tournament you cant have fans running on the field he would hope that if they ever plan to bid for that state soccer tournament again because with state tournaments you have to be able to separate the fans from the players and especially the official in case they make a bad call at the time this was a major concern they had to move the tournament because of security and the need to secure the players or the officials during a game he just wanted to throw that out and those things that you mentioned obviously are much more important than the fence chairman reiterated the same concerns were looked into he stated that they will try to maximize as much as they can as far as the improvements there with the relationship that we will have with the academy and they will go back and look into this issue with the fence in their discussions with the academy a motion was duly made by seconded by bowling and unanimously passed to approve agenda item agenda item a approval by the board of parks and recreation of the consolidated city of for the change order with electrical and mechanical for the additional work on the park sunken gardens in the amount of greeted the board and he apologized that they see name on the agenda as presenting this item he is not here and is presenting for him there is worth of change order on this job he will go to item number listed here which is the highest dollar value and this is actually to change out the control system that they currently have in the conservatory and to put a new control system in the one that is there now work they thought that since they already have a good control doing the work on the fountain part of this project that they could do this work as well the other item was the need to modify the pump packages that they purchased for this system the city of purchased all the pumps motors and including the new vault on our own and then they had mechanical install it as part of the job what they purchased seem to fit and theses charges here are to modify what we purchased in order to fit with that being said they had a rather extensive conversation with the fountain people yesterday about us not paying this ourselves he has to incorporate this into a change order because what that does is this work becomes part of the year warranty bond and they can make sure that this is all covered during that year time period they are working with the fountain people to determine how much of this almost items number numbers and number that are all related to things that the fountain people we thought should be obligated to pay and they are working through issues right now the rest of the items they changed where they tie into water that leaves the fountains they changed the board and there are additional lights that were not part of the original package that was determined would enhance the fountains so they shipped additional lights and they installed them and this is a value added so they went ahead and this is a pay item that we think we should do there are some broken lines and in order to keep the water out of the vault they added an extra sump pump into the existing vault to get the water out quicker and the other thing item number when they started these fountains up and they put the water into the fountains it was the prettiest blue color you ever saw and as soon as they turned on the first pump it went black there is a lot of debris in the existing piping from the old system rust leaves all sorts of debris and it took coming out in a five gallon bucket load and they had to fill it up and run water through and clean them up and there was at least gallons of debris that they pulled out of these things so they were trying to get all the debris out and get everything running back to a clear condition again number they are done with the job just before labor day and this is actually the maintenance that they need to do on a daily or weekly basis depending upon what they have to do in order to keep the fountains operational so this is what this is stated he has some pictures for the board to see on the overhead screen of the work as it transpired during the course of the construction stated that you can see the wiring that they pulled through and this is all control and electrical wiring that they had to pull from the conservatory down into the fountains which are miles of wiring gave the board a brief of the pictures of the pumps as they were being installed into the vaults there were several broken pipes that they had to fix he pointed out the new vault that was purchased beside his van so you could see how big this thing actually was this vault contains all the control work for the lights themselves and then set into the ground there was a photo of the wiring that they had to rework it there was a of the basins to make ready for their painting there was a photo of the led light that they have in the fountains then there was a photo of the actual control panel that sits inside the conservatory this is the type of control panels that was sitting inside the vaults that got wet and were ruined and this is the new control panel then he had photos of the beautiful pictures of the fountains in action with the colored lights etc asked if this was on top of what has already been spent answered yes and again of it is not fountain specifically related but it is for this system and in the conservatory asked if this was a part of the original scope of work answered that this was a change order that during the course of the construction yes stated that they are very expensive to operate and he knows that this is not going to be the end don asked if he could speak to this comment and did so don stated that they were able to negotiate with the friends of park and for this is taking the maintenance until the end of the year and it is going to winterize the pumps but in the friends board approved that they are going to take on the maintenance for they will be opening the pumps and close the pumps and they are going to try to work with a local that is very familiar and with these pump systems and they are trying through their and different sponsorships they are trying to raise the money for to again take over and they are trying to transition the longterm care and maintenance of the fountains to the friends group because they think this is a better home to put that activity in stated that these costs will drain the department dry he said that when you talk to the friends they should be encouraged to be setting up an endowment because these kinds of facilities like this can be a draining monster especially with the departments budget shrinking like it its stated that you will spend all your capital dollars at that fountain but they are nice and they are pretty and he knows that people like them but he thinks he would encourage the friends of park like has an endowment and you try to get the friends of eagle creek to set up an endowment and they need to not just focus on the maintenance they should be saying how do we raise money as an endowment so when you need replacements then the endowment takes care of it and not parks chairman stated that as don mentioned we have had conversations with them about the long term maintenance as well as the long term care of these pumps at the sunken gardens and part of that is going to have to be a strategy on how we are going to deal with how we do sponsors and and those kinds of things so we actually have talked with the friends of park about what their role should be with regard to developing some of these kinds of relationships you are absolutely right from the entire agency perspective we are looking at that because we are not just talking about park and the sunken gardens there we are talking about our system as a whole and the kinds of relationships and the kind of partnerships that we have to start cultivating and creating in order to maintain some of these amenities that we already have on board so i appreciate that comment and that thought because that is something that we have already had a conversation with the friends of park stated that what will happen down the road that will come with the idea of if you put million dollars into park then don why cant you get the fountains running at don stated that they have been pretty successful at they have for a number of years now maintained the round ball outside and they are almost complete they still need some last little bit of dollars to be successful and they have taken on the complete cost of raising the funds for the design and refreshing of the ruins and they are asking the city to just support them in their initiatives but they have not asked for any financial support don stated that he thinks this is the model that they would like to point to as a success story chairman asked if there were any other questions from the board there were none a motion was duly made by seconded by greenwood and unanimously passed to approve agenda item a deputy director of parks and senior manager of marketing of parks gave a presentation to the board informing them on the sale stats with regard to alcohol sales at park facilities she stated that they established best practices for our popular event venues such as broad ripple is another as well as eagle creek more than anything parks go out and promote beer as a central part of any of our events but they worked with offering this as an enhanced experience to some of our park goers and to benefit our marketing effort our movies that we tried this summer which were a huge success everything was pretty well controlled and this gave us a good template to know how to do this in the future at these type of venues is here to answer specific questions regarding the graph on the overhead screen for parks gave a brief presentation to the board depicting a budget recap provided a slide of several years actual and proposed figures to show comparison she explained how the funding meant through four different funds gave an overview of the shift of union staff to and the actual dollars being transferred there as well for those staff members we brought those staff back under and then we also moved resource development staff over to along with their capital dollars and budgeted monies for these staff we ran out of time for don to give his presentation on the so chairman and don agreed that don would give his presentation at our parks board meeting a motion was duly made by chairman for adjournment seconded by and unanimously passed to adjourn the next board of parks and recreation meeting is scheduled for at pm to
