existing in the marketplace and allow them to refinance these outstanding debts and save some money for the parks department in their debt he pointed out the slide that is on the screen shows the current debt schedule and a revised debt schedule for to the maturity in that would realize and reduce the annual debt service payments over the course of those four years five years of approximately and he this as something similar to refinancing your home mortgage they are not extending the term of the debt and it will still mature in and they are just asking for approval to refund that and take advantage of lower interest rates he is happy to address any questions from the board asked if there were any other miscellaneous fees involved replied that this is a deal that there is also board of parks and recreation series had multiple es and it is all backed by the so there is sanitary district and all of those fees are taken for the whole he guess you would say the cost of issuance fees the

for drum corp international inc participants and their to lodge overnight at riverside park park and park through during the annual drum corp international competition at oil stadium greeted the board and stated that it is her pleasure to introduce cox with drum corp international and and she have been working together the last five years in conjunction with the parks staff and they come into town on th and th and basically what they do is they use our facilities to sleep overnight and if you have not ever had the opportunity to attend there are thousands of kids and their parents and come to and stadium for the drum corp international competition they have a wonderful website if you have a chance to go out there you can actually see some live presentations but they are here before you today to ask for permission for the kids they the bus drivers and everyone to spend the nights at park park riverside park and some additional ones to be added if at all possible and board of parks and recreation park she stated that she will go ahead and let talk about drum corp international does and what the partnership between parks and his organization means cox stated that drum corp international moved its headquarters from to seven years ago and they started their drum corp international championships at oil stadium and this will be their fifth year in the stadium the first year they were here in they were supposed to be the first event in oil but unfortunately their construction schedule ran a little bit behind and they had to move it to to the campus this will be the sixth year at of a ten year contract which they probably will expand as well oil provides a great opportunity to save our event and our in case of inclement weather and such two years ago was a perfect example of this when we had the bad that came across and they were inside drum corp in international has typically been an outside event but they have moved their championships every couple of years this is a new venture for them seeing one city provides them a lot of opportunity to work with people such as yourselves and retain the continuity it is a nonprofit organization they promote over events across the united states every year these groups will start in a couple of weeks from to the west coast to the east coast and doing major events on weekends and sleep in sleeping bags air mattresses we have students and to adults that travel with them and some of them even more that are instructors and professional music educators that are traveling with these kids this year there will be corps participating in world championships from the united states and across the us and from and this year we actually have a group from that is coming into town so it is truly an international event as he said they range in size from members down to about members so we have from the smallest to the largest the kids range in age pretty much from to years of age they have what they call world class corps and open class corps the world class corps are the ones that will be on tour for the first months of the year and the open class corps are the younger smaller groups that travel only on weekends until they get ready for the weekend championships here the are with all corps competing on oil stadium on the th they have what is called semifinals with the highest finalists scores taking place and th the top corps scores in competition it is all competition and is judged by a panel of judges across the country as well so it is a very event for the spectators and for the kids no one knows for sure who is going to win until it is all over at the end provides housing locations for all these groups typically what they look for is schools parks camps places that have sleeping locations and breakout rooms for the staff the drivers cooks and if they have food trucks for food for the kids and practice fields they are using the schools in the area parks in the area and they are probably within an hour and half from right now and they also use the fields for the practice these practices provides opportunities for the people in the neighborhoods to come out and watch interact and he has been to sites where the people in the neighborhood come out and bring cookies and cakes for the kids it is really a social event for them and they can enjoy it they have actually provided tickets to park campers and park members if they board of parks and recreation page six would like to come to the events on or these are complimentary tickets and they can come in for the and the semi finals and watch the event each corp provides a certificate of insurance that names the city of as an additional insured and then they make contributions based on this to the parks department chairman asked approximately how many students approximately will be at each facility cox answered that it could range anywhere from to chairman asked also what is the ratio of student and cox replied it was to greenwood asked which way cox replied students to every adult greenwood asked if the students that are years of age are they going to be somewhere clustered together because you said you had ages to so cox stated that pretty much what they do is they go into the with the kids with the girls on one half of the gym and the guys are on the other half of the gym and that is how they split it down the middle in some places they are fortunate enough to have a curtain in the middle or wall some do some and they are pretty much accustom to doing it like this they will be starting on tour here real soon and the th of is their first show and they will be on the road until they leave here on the and th of greenwood asked if the will be with these children at all times cox answered that it depends on what groups they are but yes they have a certain amount of staff they use the word sometimes we use the word staff volunteers support staff and they will be yes asked if any of the groups will be staying longer than one night cox answered yes they will staying night night and night and departing they control when they arrive to after on the th and they control when they leave either in the morning or the afternoon depending on what they are doing on and they will be here for multiple nights reaffirmed that the parks facilities will have ample as far as rest rooms and shower facilities cox answered that rest rooms are not a issue for them basically the showers do become a bit of an issue we have to deal with for example that park only has showers they can work with it it is a little less fortunate and they would like to have at least six per gender as long as the corps knows what they have to work with they can adjust their schedules to doing that it just takes them longer to shower and what they will do is probably for the evening before they go to the competition they will have half the corps eat their meals and then the other half of the corps will shower and then they will switch it around they work very well with the schedule on this they run into this problem a lot it is not ideal but it is workable greenwood asked if the facilities that parks has to clean becomes the responsibility of the corps staff or the parks facilities cox answered that basically what they do is that they look after it like this they have the that if they keep the clean if not cleaner than what we find it the other thing that they do ask for is cleaning utensils dry mops wet mops cleaners access to a dumpster he thinks he mentioned that they are going to have food that they are going to serve to the people and they have food kitchens and they create some refuge so they do need the access to the dumpsters and they have worked through this in the past this will be the fifth year and the sixth year that they have actually done this and it has worked very well riverside and have been staples for the youth centers throughout the years asked if there were city staff i guess this is a question for you chairman a city staff person assigned or on site or on call on the site during the time that they board of parks and recreation page seven are at these centers chairman stated that he will defer that question to stated that they do have staff on site and typically what they do is that this is the week that our pools close the previous weekend and their day camps end so they typically will keep our seasonal staff on for additional time that way they get an extra weeks worth of salary before they go back to school and we do have staff on site and notify security systems and the park rangers that we do people staying overnight in the buildings overnight so they know not to worry about alarms or anything of that nature and then the park managers will usually rotate she knows that like at park she knows that the park manager and the assistant manager they have had the same corps stay there for the last five years so they pretty much even know the kids and it is like old home week for a lot of them they will stay overnight with the staff also we bill them for all the staff hours they are using and this is a condition in the the rental fees we look at it as a win win proposition for parks they are giving us some revenue that ordinarily we would not have and with some of the facilities it is additional revenue for us and we are providing them with low income lower than what it would be for a hotel housing plus it gets them out into the parks again they have the same group staying park from and the same group staying at riverside park from new it exposes them to a little bit of and it exposes parks to a little bit of other states and everything we almost had the opportunity to host the group from but they are finding housing at the international center so that works out very well for them we have been always excited to host the drum corps here and she remembers the first year that they came her reaction was we are doing what she knows that it has become a yearly event and they put it on their calendars and plan for it accordingly stated that he have a problem with the overnight it is the mixing of and year old kids and the he would advise that there be some type of separation as to how the division of these kids is handled in these centers added division of male female and added division by age group too stated that we want some parent coming back and stating that their child got touched at one of our centers by the upper age group stated that he is not trying to tell him how to run their program but he knows that if you have and year olds together sometimes presents problems cox stated that these groups are staying in the parks particularly and he mentioned that there are two different classifications of corps the world class and the open class corps the world class corps are going to be more of the year olds and are the groups that will be participating all summer long and the groups that are just typically doing this on weekends and stuff are more of the to year olds and are the open class corps stated so there will not be any to year old participants at the centers cox answered no only some of the staff members of this will be there chairman said thanks for clarifying cox stated that the to year olds are more of an adult group typically they are larger in group size as well most of those in the world class corps have members reiterated that there will be and under age groups at the centers cox replied yes cox that he make that more clear when he was talking about the division of the classifications greenwood stated that mentioned that this has been going on for the past few years and asked how board of parks and recreation page eight long we have been doing it greenwood stated that this is her first time hearing about it answered her by saying it will be our th year stated ok so it come before the board before correct answered no it has not come before the board asked why is it coming now answered that in previous years they were directed to draft a memo to the director because the board at some point had given its approval empowerment to the director to approve overnight stays in our parks it has been decided that we will follow the ordinance as it is written and bring their requests before the parks board chairman added that this was essentially because of the fact that we have people staying in the parks overnight he felt like it was more appropriate for us to say we need to seek our counsel and say what does the ordinance say and has done a good job in making sure that we troubleshoot and make sure that we are following what the ordinance says we are supposed to do with regard to folks staying in the parks overnight again it has been a working relationship and they had any incidents over the years so he feels confident that we will be able to continue this partnership cox added that from his standpoint it has worked fantastically the kids like it and rather than a school which is a jungle to them they are able to get out underneath the trees and it is a real benefit for them as well chairman asked if there were any other questions from the board there were none greenwood stated that she would have to sustain because of the students and her relationship with the schools a motion was duly made by seconded by and unanimously passed to approve both agenda item agenda item approval by the board of parks and recreation for the consolidated city of director of the department of parks and recreation authority to begin the necessary procedures according to the public parks and recreation naming policy revised to formally name the property located at avenue reverend a chairman greeted deputy director and she greeted the board stating that she is here today to ask for the boards authorization to proceed with agenda item which is a naming of a park this park as we can tell was never officially named park but has come to be known as park by the neighborhood and the community around it and has become so well known as park that that name has even found its way onto the open space plan and maps so for that purpose we felt that it was appropriate to come at this as we were renaming a park that had been named properly what we are asking is for the boards approval to follow our stated renaming procedures for a park and we would like to propose the reverend a park a few months ago who is the director of minority and business development for the city of shared some community input that was gathered by neighbors it was also gathered from a couple of our council members councilor oliver and and in the packet you have in front of you you have some letters of of support from those individuals board of parks and recreation page nine the idea came about to name this park after reverend who is an native an of attics high school and the first president of black expo in he became the first official president of that organization since that time and before his death in of he became and remained one of the most influential black leaders in the city of what they asking at this is for the board to authorize staff to request a published notice sometime during the next days it would go in the star and we would leave a comment period open for days and during that time anyone who wanted to say anything any regard positive or just a neutral comment on this could send those types of comments to director with that if we get anything back or if we get anything back from that period we would like to come back to this board with what we have gathered during that days on or the date of our next board meeting if that happens to change and we would seek adoption of the naming recommendation stated that he has just a couple of questions he thinks it is a good idea what is the size of the park and what is the condition of it and what is the master plan of the park look he knows where it is located but we want to make sure that when we rename a park it is representative of the and what have you so his thing would be and he will go look at it again that it needs to be a class a well kept and well looked park and he just put that out there and he know if this is something from the planing staff from or whomever he just wants to know what the condition of the park is how does the park look chairman answered that in the past few months they have actually have done a couple of community outreaches for that park to start the process for master planning and dealing with what it is and what that park would look like for future there are a couple of things that he wants to highlight one is that in talking to about particular naming of this park of course those of us who are not from but have subsequently moved here quickly found out about who the reverend was not only with the black expo but as an male he was very instrumental in pushing forward this whole idea of getting tested for prostrate cancer so he did a lot of good work in the community with regard to that and we think that is appropriate to name a park in his honor chairman thinks on the one hand is absolutely correct that we want to make this park a jewel and it could already look at it from that we probably have parks that are already named in honor of someone else or because of the geographical location or what have you that really makes it a little more difficult to do that in staying within the guidelines of our policy he thinks it gives us an opportunity as we develop this park if you will the flavor of the park in with who or reverend was stated that the only reason that he raised this issue is that the department made a couple mistakes before when they named st and after gains they had to stop it because it was an to invite the family out and we did the same thing for for a long time over there across from united parcel he is saying that it is a good idea but we get down the road with this and have to stop because it is not presentable enough to put his name on it because was the first to serve in the mayors office under mayor taking care of minority concerns he had a great deep history of what he has done for this community and he world recommend that we put his name on something that is representative of the department greenwood added that she board of parks and recreation page ten wants to tell us something you know him as being the political person and she knew him as being a great person for education and he gave so much to the students of and he would reach down to support them and help them to find ways to go college the man was very giving and very well respected she would like to visit this park too and she thinks it is an excellent idea that we want to do something to honor him because we lost a very good friend stated that he assumes and maybe could speak to this but black expo for a number of years was housed at st peter which would be close to where this park is and he know if this was the historical connect that we might have been going for or was this part of the thinking process chairman asked to come up and introduce himself to the listening audience he did that was the connection they wanted to make sure that there was something connected to him that those who had been in the community knew that that connection was there he knows that the reverend has a great legacy and even these great events that we have the summer celebration and the classic and when you look at some of our top events here in the city that is in the top bringing revenue to the city and those two events are what he brought here and as you said whether it was education prostrate cancer the fact that he was a voice in the community overall and that was the kind of focus that they had and this being the year of circle city classic and they are trying to do some big things this year we thought this would be something good for the community that we recognize reverend greenwood stated that she commends him for that because that is long over due and she thinks it is a wonderful idea that we do spruce it up even thought she been there she is telling you the man was wonderful he reached back he walked his talk and he gave so much to our children stated that question still has not been answered could you the condition of this park size look chairman answered that he have the exact acreage chairman looked to the audience for and if they have the acreage stated she was sorry but she have that and added that it is small it is a beginning and this is why we liked the idea of starting this naming process now when don and his group had held some vision into its planning meetings with that part of the community they were well attended and there was an obvious level of interest in doing this and so there is some momentum that is starting to happen there and she will say it is small it is used and it is loved stated that the reason he has said this is that he is almost positive with all the things that reverend has done if there was a master plan or a concept there would not be an issue of raising funds for that park and there are a lot of people in the community who would jump on board with coming up with resources and this is why he said that we want to do it right and he thinks funds could be raised to make this park representative of what reverend stood for in the community added that this was one of the reason when he talked to john and talked to councilors they thought that this would be a part that the community could get behind in the care and upkeep of the parks long term vision is that the community is more engaged and involved and this is the perfect park for that and to even help bring that neighborhood up to where they want to be stated that he all that the department and board is doing chairman thanked board of parks and recreation page eleven so what do you need from us chairman greenwood stated that she wants to make that motion chairman stated that there is nothing really to vote on at this point deputy director stated that they need authorization to publish the notice if that is ok greenwood stated so moved stated that he likes the idea particularly what has stated but he has held back because is his cousin so but given the and the fact that he worked in the mayors office for a number of years he would probably prefer someone who has had a little more in the city but he respects the community sentiment and maybe there is a potential here to make something that is a little under the radar to be enhanced and dynamic stated that he certainly recognized and felt about too that not a being a person from originally he does know reverend was and what he meant for the city and he thought about that and wanted to be sensitive to the fact that the way we normally would work this type of process is if we have a park that has a name then the park staff asked what we name it well it will be and street park or something like that until we come up with something better so here we have and two who have recommended that we name this park after reverend he has to assume and he knows they did do their do diligence at looking at what is the significance of this particular area so it not be what we consider a or great park today he thinks it also gives us the opportunity to make it into the image of what we are seeking to do in naming it after reverend so if we can do that and if we are as a park staff and as a community in doing that he thinks we will be successful greenwood stated that she wants to go on record that he was a wonderful man also stated he was chairman stated he was and it is duly noted a motion was duly made by greenwood seconded by and unanimously passed to approve both agenda item a motion was duly made by chairman for adjournment seconded by and unanimously passed to adjourn the next board of parks and recreation meeting is scheduled for at pm to pm in room of the building east street
