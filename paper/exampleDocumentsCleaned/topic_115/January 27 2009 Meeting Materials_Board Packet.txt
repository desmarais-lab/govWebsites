datasets also ensure that all data are automated to the greatest extent practical the model in preliminary discussions with controller this wont be changed for the budget but hopefully for the budget year we have eased the administrative burden of billing to where we can sending out individual bills essentially the new process will be that we send a spreadsheet to for the city one to the auditors office for the county agencies they will pay for their respective directly journal entries since its set at the beginning of the year is the same amount all months there is no need to send individual bills get individual approvals etc this will be a big efficiency gain monitoring and capacity planning the strategic objective is to implement aggressive network monitoring and capacity planning

offerings from various vendors including existing business partners the for all new custom development projects we are currently utilizing the initial round of enhancements put forth in our assessment on a majority of new development projects some new projects are simple enough that the documentation suggested in the assessment takes more time than the actual project we are working on developing a simplified set of documentation for these smaller projects the application of the will be coordinated with the a service we have met several times with our state counterparts and piggybacked upon several state contracts that were already in place we are in a much better position to diligently search known as contracts come up for renewal or new contracts are being considered strategic planning

with regarding reporting services and analytical services both components of server our eventual bi strategy will encompass use of all the reporting and performance management tools we own in the manners they are best suited to in our the lights on the goal is to reduce costs of services provided while maintaining the appropriate service levels for each service as an operation this is a
