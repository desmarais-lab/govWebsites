prepared by information services agency consulting group report title needs analysis version final report overview about this report this report contains an analysis of the strategic and operational effectiveness of the city of and here after referred to as the current financial and resource planning systems and processes the purpose of this report is to provide the leadership with a clear and substantiated business analysis and discussion document that highlights the following the current state strengths and weaknesses of the systems tools and processes used by the to function as an system today the current manual and automated processes used as a means of identifying how and which aspects of the current systems tools and processes could be better served or replaced by implementing an system a cursory review of solutions available in the market today a preliminary net present value analysis for implementing a new system consulting group led the business process review workshops with the participation of the in the lead departments auditors office and hr they documented the business process from those workshops developed the survey provided the justification criteria and spreadsheet for the analysis and identified the support costs of the current developed the findings in this report researched the market supplied the supporting proof of the findings and wrote the

appendix the net present value matrix attached in appendix the needs analysis planning document available in ms word format information services agency prepared by information services agency consulting group report title needs analysis version final executive summary the has been working with an antiquated financial system that was introduced in the with the exception of which runs a legacy personnel system on an unsupported platform the is working without a human resource system since then technology and processes have substantially evolved revealing significant shortcomings in the ability of the to manage its finances and human resources with the system because of this information services agency was asked to put together a business case to assess the current status needs and feasibility of implementing a new system over the past few years elected officials and the council have agreed to allow the financial oversight of nearly all local government to be administrated by the overall goal of this unification is to create one standardized way of reporting budgeting processing transactions and overseeing finances however the consolidation is not complete and there are still functions outside the purview of major functions managed by other agencies include timekeeping payroll wage control and revenue collection and both have applications that manage these processes there are several computer systems and databases that manage the enterprises financial transactions budgets payroll and assets and which reside on the mainframe allow for some enterprise interaction however the lack of integration ease of use and functionality have resulted in the development of over shadow systems the cost of supporting these systems both in manpower and processing power is substantial this report details supporting evidence for the consideration of the an system to consolidate and standardize business processes this new system would provide the following benefits a new integrated suite of software that is both modernized and cost effective a reduction of hundreds of shadow systems across the enterprise such as excel spreadsheets and access databases a single consolidated source for financial and human resource information to be stored reported and shared across the enterprise approximately eight percent of the employees directly or indirectly manage or support these systems in some cases the financial support utilizes up to of their time see section for more detailed scope of along with appendix for a breakdown by agency of interviewing and business process workshops were conducted to review the current business processes of each agency department and division involved the amount of manual duplicate and triplicate work done by administrative staff and the cost to the for continuing to support the current status offers evidence of a need for an system the section below highlights the major findings information services agency prepared by information services agency consulting group report title needs analysis version final findings paperwork and shadow systems there are over shadow systems across the enterprise causing multiple repeated data entries unsupported technology shadow systems are providing mission critical functions and are unsupported as a result of the technology is becoming obsolete see section and and appendix data quality because of the tremendous about of manual inputs calculations and reconciliation quality assurance takes time and introduces error data currency there is no central repository of information therefore seeing data is not available this limits the visibility of progress on requests reducing ability adding time and introducing errors labor intensive functions numerous work around procedures create repetitive manual functions such as maintaining paperwork inputting processing organizing verifying numbers and performing busy work that wastes time and introduces errors along with the interviews cursory market research was completed to provide a cost expenditure model for the implementation of an system it was determined that on two successfully implemented models reviewed that the municipalities were very satisfied with their decision to implement an system we performed analysis using two main cost structures the moderate cost for implementation would run around million with an additional in annual maintenance support fees while the lower cost structure would fall between million for implementation and ongoing costs in the range these estimates assume both financial and human resource modules would be implemented the analysis of this study supports the financial feasibility of implementing a new system as the results recognize a positive investment as early as year three with the assumption that all implementation costs are accounted for in year one the varied productivity rates of personnel who work with the systems are dependent on the breadth and success of the implementation for that reason we analyzed three personnel productivity rates the rates affect the but in general the higher the productivity rate the greater the benefit to the by implementing a new system the total costs saved by year five are over million with the total benefit ranging from million to million based on the high productivity low cost cost structure used the full report documents the findings defining gaps of the current financial and human resource systems and the need to fill those gaps and unify business process and information for financial and human resource oversight and management a great opportunity exists to improve the financial system of local government making it a better business fit with department and agency needs providing for more strategic information in a more affordable support structure for the enterprise many cities and counties the size of the have gone through the process of modernizing their systems validating that a proven solution is available what is paramount for the success of an system in the is having the political will to get it done cooperation by all stakeholders and the funding to implement and maintain it information services agency prepared by information services agency consulting group report title needs analysis version final current situation objectives benefits the city of and county is an association of many local government departments and agencies was the beginning of consolidating like functions to reduce duplication of services within government specifically the financial oversight for city departments is the responsibility of the financial oversight for county agencies until recently was the responsibility of the auditors office during the past few years elected officials and the council agreed to allow the newly formed to provide the financial oversight for nearly all local government the goal is to provide uniform reporting for budget standardized transaction processing and financial oversight the reality is that the consolidation of functions under is not complete many county agencies have unique financial processes that will take some time to assimilate there are several functions that are related but beyond the purview of timekeeping and payroll wage control revenue collection implementing an system would improve coordination across functional departments and increase efficiencies of doing business but only if there is a total commitment to improve upon existing processes technology is often used to automate processes but it does no good to automate a bad process because in the end those bad process still exist only faster instead the enterprise must embrace the idea of improving processes by defining clear objectives and creating a vision for the immediate benefits of a new system fully automated financial processes including cash management accounts receivable and payables integration of personnel payroll and budget to include wage control accurate budget forecasts for strategic planning and reporting centralized management of contracts including streamline of purchasing process and public bids single source of fixed assets access to and historical data improving decision making reduced it support financial and human resources systems at the is the longtime mainframe financial transactions processing system for the it has provided years of reliable accounting however has limitations and many departments and agencies created shadow systems to overcome the services that could not be provided in many cases they were simple spreadsheets although financial spreadsheets will always be useful in performing what if scenarios there is to much reliance in todays environment on the information services agency prepared by information services agency consulting group report title needs analysis version final hundreds of spreadsheets used to track everything from calculating payroll capital improvement projects to wage controls to revenue projections financial and human resource tools because of the disparate systems it is not easy for decision makers within the to get information in a timely manner information requests flow from the mayors office or council to the agency head or if the information is not available in a whole flurry of activity begins as staff work to cobble together information an example of this phenomena is the tracking of compliance staff new to this process perceive the information is readily available and that the request is simple after understanding the reality of the systems available to them they begin to create new financial and hr systems to meet the information demands is willing and skilled at providing information but the design and limitations of the current systems and lack of simple tools do not allow staff to gain access manipulate and present financial information on demand to meet information requests do projections and essentially manage financial and human resources financial and human resources systems are applications on the mainframe strategically the mainframe is scheduled to be eliminated because of the higher cost it takes to support the dwindling number of applications the software licensing support hardware maintenance and the need to keep skills for the major applications left on the platform is becoming proportionally larger as the other key applications on the mainframe and property have migration plans developed the financial and payroll applications will be the lone reason to support the second platform if no suitable replacement for the core financial systems is identified the mainframe will remain financial and human resources personnel when evaluating the need for an solution it is important to understand how many employees and hours are spent within the enterprise managing such functions as payroll labor benefits accounts payable accounts receivable asset management and revenue management collecting the total employee headcount provides management the opportunity to review the numbers to determine if employees are making the best use of their time because of access to relative and timely information or if there is wasted labor in the enterprise a survey was sent to all agencies to ascertain how many employees are primarily engaged in the use the financial and human resource system in addition the number of managers who depend on the information derived from these systems was collected assuming that there would be small benefit in productivity for those type of employees each chief financial officer identified the number of people in their department and the percentage of time spent managing these specific functions the matrix identifies departments and agencies employees with direct management over financial operations employees responsible for financial operations employees who depend upon the financial information to manage their day to day it is interesting to note there are nearly two staff members responsible for financial activities for every department validating the survey results required an understanding as to how the financial functions were performed information services agency prepared by information services agency consulting group report title needs analysis version final analysis findings overview understanding existing processes there are several hundred people employed at the responsible for financial and human resource information this section addresses the business processes of how these employees perform their jobs due to inflexibilities of the current financial and human resources systems understanding the existing business processes provides the opportunity to identify improvements and employees were happy to be given the opportunity to describe the existing issues that exist within the current process there is a significant amount of employee knowledge in the enterprise and the following departments participated in workshops or interviews conducted by consulting and the business relationship managers office of finance and management county clerk county treasurer department of public works metro police department information services agency each department was asked to identify strengths and weakness of their current systems describe the process of accomplishing their duties and estimate how much time is spent on those activities twenty business processes were documented into detailed diagrams these diagrams illustrate how the departments perform their jobs today and identify what manual and labor intensive tasks be eliminated with the implementation of a new system this section is arranged by individual findings with supporting information from a sample of departments to provide greater insight into how these burdensome administrative tasks result in inefficiencies five reoccurring findings emerged paper documents and shadow systems are considered the primary source of information access databases provide mission critical functions this technology is becoming rapidly obsolete data currency issues result in lack of timeliness manual calculations reconciliation and quality assurance take time and introduce error functions are labor intensive and usually on paper reduce ability take time and introduce errors information services agency prepared by information services agency consulting group report title needs analysis version final current budget process analysis in this section the business process for addressing the annual budget is described along with its diagram for reference although a total of business processes were documented the annual budget was selected as a critical process to describe since the event represents the beginning of the financial reporting process where every agency is a participant and common points of pain are shared across the enterprise it is also the least ambiguous of all the business description of the budget process the process begins with each excel spreadsheets access databases to track expenditures internally these shadow systems were created by agencies because historical information is difficult to obtain from the financial system working from the information contained within their shadow systems the agencies update a component of the program has strict security within and access is only allowed to users during budget season about days agencies such as have technology budgets that must match supported agency budgets therefore it is imperative understand what technology initiatives an agency wishes to implement to properly submit their own budgetary numbers to the program in order to obtain this budget information from an agency created an online web survey which is distributed to agency a few months prior to unlocked release of after all agencies have submitted their initial budget figures to it is closed a program called focus extracts the budget information where it is then downloaded into access databases for analysis and manipulation by creates budget reports from these access databases granting rights to agencies to access the data in theory if changes need to be made the agency will make updates directly to these access databases where it is then updated in however it is easier for an agency to take the access database and export the information into excel the department of metropolitan developments grant division finds the process to be cumbersome because they would prefer to run their own extract directly from and receive information that is most relevant to their grant budget reporting instead they are forced to back out the encumbrances and import the revised data from access directly into excel requiring an additional level of consolidation at the division level next and meet to discuss the proposed budget reports for their agency if no changes are needed the agency will write a narrative on how they would like to spend their budget for the following year and send it to if the grants budget is approved by their excel spreadsheet is uploaded back into once all of the budget information and narratives are collected from each agency will publish the proposed budget on the web site print and advertise their rates through the star examples of all five reoccurring findings occur within the annual budget process with the creation of shadow systems no historical trending lack of data currency manual functions resulting in multiple data entries and vital financial information contained with an access database information services agency prepared by information services agency consulting group report title needs analysis version final the budget diagram is documented below along with recommendations of how an system will automate tasks eliminate redundancies and provide business intelligence allowing for better decision making see appendix a to view the remaining diagrams information services agency prepared by information services agency consulting group report title needs analysis version final information services agency prepared by information services agency consulting group report title needs analysis version final finding paperwork shadow systems one of the most alarming findings made during the interview process was the discovery of financial and human resource shadow systems in the enterprise today consisting primarily of excel spreadsheets and access databases there is such a critical need for accurate and detailed views of the current financial status and employees feel the available information is not available to them or is too difficult to extract out of the system or question the integrity of the data therefore the majority of agencies have created their own shadow systems to help them manage the information necessary to run their department in addition to the shadow systems agencies heavily rely on paperwork to keep track of transactions because it is easily accessed and seen as the most reliable source of information the following conclusions can be made from the discovery of paperwork and shadow systems detailed financial information such as revenue assets accounts payable purchases and grants for the is truly maintained within individual and not paperwork and shadow systems cause duplicate and triplicate data entry resulting in an increase of human error time and labor lack of integration creates data silos across departments making information difficult to share many of the spreadsheets and databases are saved locally on an employees desktop and are not by servers critical information would be nonrecoverable should the desktop fail locally saved databases often conflict with network standards and requirements because they have not been converted to the latest standard version here are specific agency examples of this finding see appendix for additional examples county purchases under each department uses to create purchase orders but the tracking and maintenance of the purchase order process is managed within their own internal excel spreadsheet or access database departments feel is not scalable enough to provide the level of detail needed for their purchasing processes and some were never properly trained on how to track the information within therefore they work around by creating a shadow system to track the information invoices are data entered into as there is no direct interface from the use of does not allow for online approvals therefore is largely used as a depository of information as the is done entirely on paper auditor and county departments payroll the auditors payroll department uses a mainframe application called formerly known as to process all county payroll each county agency is responsible for maintaining and tracking their employees hours pay rates benefit leave and providing the auditor with a voucher summary report of what needs to be paid all of the vouchers are printed or hand written by each county department and physically delivered to the auditors office where it is manually entered into it takes two to two and a half days for two auditor employees to input data from all of the county department vouchers into processing includes reviewing making changes where necessary such as new hires and address changes and inputting data into the access database information services agency prepared by information services agency consulting group report title needs analysis version final the auditors office notifies the treasurers office regarding taxes to be paid by sending a paper form printed from creating what is known as treasurers authorization human resources records the benefits section uses a third party application known as benefits connect after an employee completes their benefits submission online a paper file is printed and placed in their employee record many departments and agencies keep a paper record of the employee record including demographic information for future reference in the event the employee needs the information at a later date finding unsupported technology inefficiencies of the current systems have caused employees to create numerous work around procedures making it possible for employees to perform their jobs which in turn have birthed thousands of access databases in the enterprise with shadow systems existing in the financial community alone although there were advantages in allowing employees to create their own access shadow systems in the past such as business processes could be enhanced immediately with the expertise of an agency developer the disadvantages now outweigh the advantages in todays environment here are some of the disadvantages access databases provide mission critical functions are unsupported because the technology is becoming obsolete with advances in programming development the databases were built by an designer who held the technical expertise and knowledge of the workings of the database technical documentation about how the database functions is nonexistent when the designer leaves employment so do the intimate details about the database modeling triggers and security settings leaving the agency helpless to support their own systems access databases are not meant to hold more than records and therefore are not scalable to an growth when a database begins to reach its record limit it will begin to exhibit signs of failure such as corrupted records and nonrecoverable entries access databases are only meant to be used by a handful of users at a time yet the has stretched access to its limits by providing rights to these databases to entire departments and multiple agencies the majority of databases are saved locally on a users desktop creating multiple versions of the database and making it susceptible to threats because it is not backed up is asked to assist with redesigns and bug fixes but cannot accommodate the majority of requests due to a lack of employed access developers and the sheer volume of databases in the enterprise makes the task impossible a movement has been made to work with agencies to convert databases over to the new standard net platform giving the responsibility of maintenance and enhancements but the process of identifying the most critical databases and gathering business requirements takes time in addition is a costly endeavor that results in no gains in functionality information services agency prepared by information services agency consulting group report title needs analysis version final below are specific agency examples of this finding see appendix for additional examples auditor financial reporting the auditor uses many access databases solely for reporting purposes and shares the information with other county departments the auditor does not have the capacity to train the departments on how to use the databases when someone asks for assistance all of the databases were created by a contract employee who no longer works for the auditor and finding a developer in todays environment who knows of the exact type of access coding used to create the database can be difficult office of finance and management revenue and cash management the revenue manager of has built several access databases to accommodate the growing business processes of the agency the databases are built according to the individuals specifications and it would be difficult for to offer support if it was requested because no technical documentation about the databases exists finding data currency issues another significant finding during the business process interviews was the lack of data currency when data is not relevant because it is inaccurate or the enterprise runs the risk of making misinformed business decisions based off of wrong information many processes require manual approvals needing a wet signature which slows down the decision making process making the data stale a lack of automated also increases the risk of poor decision making because people are forced to manually route documents the paperwork is often left floating with no one person directly responsible for taking any action or resolution as a result employees waste time hunting down information to determine what went wrong during the approval process and what action needs to occur in order to move forward the following are examples of data currency issues which result in a lack of timeliness and poor decision making abilities county purchasing public bid process almost all of the processes performed are done individually by department without collaboration on the bid development and are done in programs not relating to or it is impossible to know where the request for proposal is in the process because there is not one single system to track its status and not one single person responsible for monitoring the process instead there are multiple versions of and their respective vendor responses in electronic and printed format some are printed on paper and sitting on desks and others are stored in outlook email or on shared drives for example purchases over require a department to submit a allowing multiple vendors the opportunity to bid on equipment or services purchasing specification writers work with the department to create an using word the process can take up to three months to complete and there are many version control issues throughout the process because it is impossible to know who has the latest version of the when the is finally ready to hit the streets email notifications are sent to prospective buyers and advertised when the receives a bid at a public opening it is tracked and tabulated within excel after the bid is reviewed by a purchasing buyer it is scanned into pdf information services agency prepared by information services agency consulting group report title needs analysis version final format and emailed to the agency for review where it is printed out on paper and marked with comments county purchasing purchases under all requests for purchases over are done on paper with multiple signatures requisitions and invoices are walked to the auditors office and back opening the process up to error and not allowing for visibility of progress of request finding manual calculations reconciliation quality assurance the enterprise is a breeding ground for potential errors when humans are responsible for performing manual finance calculations over spreadsheets to ensure balances match and double checking each others work as evidence of quality from coding and data input errors to misplaced decimals when a person makes a mistake generally there is a supervisor present to verify the information making the reconciliation process lengthy and redundant another downfall to performing manual calculations over and over is how errors affect the ability to make accurate decisions poor decisions are made every day because one department has made a mistake which in turns affects the entire decision making process causing a snowball effect that agency then makes poor decisions affecting another ability to make precise and informed decision the process continues until the entire enterprise feels the affects of one person forgetting to carry over the one during the interview process it was found that a large amount of the payroll business processes are performed by hand although payroll department prides itself on the fact it has not missed a pay period in years the checks and balances they have in place to catch mistakes increase the payroll processing time frame by a week as well as the cost of producing an accurate payroll below are examples of manual calculations and quality control procedures and use when processing payroll additional examples can be found in appendix office of finance and management county payroll non public safety the county superior courts and treasurers office use a program called online time information system which allows employees to enter their own payroll hours into an electronic application supervisors review and double check the hours first before creating an voucher report this report is then walked to the auditors office where the employee hours are data entered back into the administrative work and chances of a data entry are somewhat reduced since initially the employee data enters their hours into the system but because no interface exists between and there is still duplicate data entry which would be eliminated with an integrated not just interfaced system office of finance and management city payroll non public safety there are over benefit changes processed by every two weeks when there is a new employee or a change to an existing employees payroll deductions benefits paperwork must be completed the departments hr manager then data enters the information into their internal excel spreadsheet or access database next the paperwork is delivered to who calculates by hand the new amounts and enters the rate changes deductions or new employee information information services agency prepared by information services agency consulting group report title needs analysis version final into the risk of human error is high because of the manual calculations and triplicate data entry procedures paper time cards are completed by over nonpublic safety employees every two weeks the time cards are collected by the departments hr manager who data enters the total hours worked overtime sick leave and any benefit hours received into their payroll excel spreadsheet or access database the departments hr managers hand deliver the time cards to the payroll supervisor from there two payroll coordinators manually data enter all time cards back into resulting in triplicate data entry public safety hr and payroll while and both have their own systems over time they become less functional given the changes in union contracts and age in the case of of the platform it runs on and both produce the pay for each employee and then send it to or the auditors office to produce a paycheck while the system automates some function there are still things left to be desired for example after changes in certain requirements some deductions and special pays are being calculated manually the process is substantially manual as the systems are depositories for information but the process to produce elements of pay is done outside of the system for to determine pay paper are alphabetized by hand and then each evaluated individually in a manual process to determine if the employee is eligible for shift differential if eligible shift difference is calculated with a calculator pencil and paper a second pass of the is done to determine other types of additional pay such as canine care again this is calculated on paper after all types of special pay are added these numbers are then manually entered into a separate access database the process is fraught with data entry errors and requires several validation passes by hand are sorted and calculated in four different passes special and extra pay is data entered into the the hardware system the actual payroll amount is calculated by hand and each amount for each employee is handwritten on to the summary voucher report and hand delivered to the auditors office where it is manually typed into the system finding labor intensive functions there are many limitations of the current financial and human resource systems which have forced employees to work around the problem if the systems cannot provide the information and it budgets and resources are limited then employees have to find a way to get it done using their own means to accomplish the task as a result most employees are performing repetitive manual functions such as maintaining paperwork inputting processing organizing verifying numbers and performing busy work that wastes time introduces errors and bogs down the decision making process tracking historical information and reliable trends are other examples of manual processes because the information simply does not exist within the system resulting in head knowledge over system knowledge it not seem serious if one person wastes minutes per day trying to track down information but what does it cost if there are people trying to track down the same information throughout the year assuming a rate of hour and hours or work per year this issue has cost the within a year information services agency prepared by information services agency consulting group report title needs analysis version final the interviews have forced agencies to take a hard look at their business processes at a minimum it is suggested agencies begin thinking about business processes in order to shift time and resources from performing manual functions over to innovating problem solving increasing efficiencies and improving customer service to each other and the constituents of the many of the inconsistent processes are due to not having a system to support a streamlined business process so improvements be limited some improvements could also be possible with policy change which not require systems to support it examples of burdensome manual functions are described in detail below financial reporting there are several reports is required to produce each year but the largest and most time consuming report is called the comprehensive annual financial report and is required by the state of the report is very labor intensive and usually requires six months of preparation because the information cannot be easily extracted the process begins with an extract from received in printed format and then data entered into a master excel spreadsheet with approximately worksheet tabs the introduction to the report is also created using a second excel spreadsheet with approximately worksheet tabs the budget is managed on a cash basis accounting system within but for reporting purposes must convert the numbers from cash basis to modified accrual and then into full accrual the conversions require an extreme level of attention to detail and knowledge of accounting ledgers human resources employment non public safety currently hr has two systems for gathering employment applications express and an access database express is a hosted third party online application used to submit accept review and processes electronic applications per month at an average rate of three minutes per application employment is using both express and a previously created access database to process all of the applications until the entire enterprise is configured to express approximately paper employment applications are accepted via fax mail and walk in per month and processed using the access database at ten minutes per application there are approximately applications stored in four large filing cabinets within their office and another to records that must be retained from two years prior stored in various locations within the building department of metropolitan developments grants nearly of the work is done using an access database and excel spreadsheet the information can never be viewed in because of the delays in data entry from into these shadow systems duplicate and triplicate data entry increases the chance of errors and since the information is always reentered back into employees must wait a full day after has been updated to obtain and validate their numbers lastly there are seven employees who need to work in the database at the same time and access does not support concurrent usage with that amount of people people are forced to schedule their work within the database resulting in wasted time and resources county treasurer investments there is no mechanism in place to perform various comparisons on investments when a proposal to invest is received all of the analysis is done using excel spreadsheets leaving the analysis approach up to the individual analyst in addition if the data was ever lost and found unrecoverable there would be no way to get historical analysis across several years information services agency prepared by information services agency consulting group report title needs analysis version final market research overview the objective of this research was to identify software vendors supplying solutions for cities approximately the same population as a cursory review suggests there are at least five vendors with applications suitable for this enterprise these software modules include but are not limited to government accounting procurement cash management tax revenue management contract management fixed asset management payroll personnel and cashiering initial contact was made with a number of municipalities to discuss basic cost and experience with implementing an conversations were documented with vendor project managers senior government staffers and vendor marketing and sales executives however given the time allocated to this task a complete picture of costs was not always possible discussions from the governmental units solicited revealed these thoughts many cities acknowledged it was a painful process systems and agreed to be contacted for advice and tips if needed for most it was a difficult but fruitful experience lasting from to years the users and technology staff had different experiences in some cases users loved the features but the tech staff had difficulty making it work in other cases the users clamored for more but the technical staff had a good installation there was significant consulting required to identify new policies and changes in business process the cost and coordination for such a project requires the complete cooperation of the executive legislative and judicial agencies anything less means multiple financial systems in the enterprise market research findings these findings were obtained by identifying key software vendors in the market and contacting customers with populations similar to the the incumbent vendor is tier which provides support at the moment tier is the parent has a strategic partnership with owns the dynamics formerly great plains suite of products tier has a version of dynamics called tier financial management system specially packaged for government the is a premier customer hence potentially leading to services and resources that can be leveraged any move from the mainframe is going to be a major upgrade tier estimates a implementation cost of million

coordination of funding and business processes between human resources and city departments was never achieved oracle is a major vendor in the arena oracle supplies both database software and a suite of applications software our research focused on the applications software important notes has oracle database administrators expertise and although the number of database applications is decreasing there is still a strong portfolio oracle is an industry standard with a number of accounts that fit the bill cities contacted were city and st fl oracle solutions be available on a database which is the standard the constituent relationship management software used by the mayors action center was purchased by oracle and is now part of its offerings is an software provider with a wide variety of public sector offerings and has a number of customers that are major cities is the parent of odyssey the court management software selected by the state of the following four customers were contacted buffalo buffalo is a long time customer they love the features and offerings but had trouble in the early stages with customization requests it is a closed system and such requests were considered from release to release fort in the employees contacted in this environment were extremely happy with the system and were satisfied with the implementation effort the project took about months from start to finish franklin county oh they have been customers of for nearly ten years and remain very satisfied with the product county is a similarly sized county as very good implemented the product in and rates their satisfaction as other these other vendors show great promise and should be included in further investigation sap is frequently seen on websites providing white papers the city of phoenix was contacted phoenix has a full offering of many modules sap and oracle the largest and similar market share has acquired work management system and is the parent of the current payroll system however was not shown to have a wide variety of software the north central council of governments cities of grand prairie and use and are very happy with it information services agency prepared by information services agency consulting group report title needs analysis version final net present value analysis overview the net present value analysis in this study is to equip with real options to gauge and react to risk over time is calculated based on the expected and the expected costs of an investment where these expected benefits and expenses are discounted by a rate that reflects inflation and opportunity costs the spreadsheets found in appendix consist of benefits costs avoided and personnel productivity and costs that would be eliminated by the implementation of a new system these costs include maintenance and support of legacy systems storage costs of shadow systems support of shadow systems including access and excel and mainframe retirement the personal productivity is calculated by taking counts received from for direct and indirect users of the systems and multiplying that with the average salary and productivity rate initial and ongoing project costs were determined through market research of implemented systems the discount rate used was provided by the bond bank as the cost of funds estimated at and the inflation rate was estimated at three percent the analysis reviewed two costs structures moderate and low and varied productivity from low mid and high within the two structures a high cost structure was never obtained because of difficulty in getting clients to further break down the numbers into hardware software and implementation the costs structures were based on successfully implemented systems within cities comparable to productivity was determined primarily by defining high productivity as all direct and indirect beneficiaries operating at full utilization with all modules purchased therefore receiving the full benefit moderate and low productivity was estimated by defining different levels of implementation and adaptability of the system variables that could impact the productivity figures are the number of modules purchased training user of the system support implementation time available budget and process changes findings an analysis of each cost structure provides an for the moderate cost structure million million and million along with the for the low cost structure million million and million the first section shows the information for moderate costs with high mid low productivity while the second section shows the information for the low costs with high mid and low productivity the results translate to the following conclusions regardless of productivity or the cost model the is positive by year two with the assumption that all implementation costs are accounted for in year one supporting the idea this project would benefit the and save money the low cost model will provide the greatest savings because of lower cost outlays in general the higher the productivity rate the greater the benefit to city county information services agency prepared by information services agency consulting group report title needs analysis version final varied productivity rates will help project the actual when scaling and implementing the total costs saved annually by year five are over million with the total benefit ranging from million to million based on productivity for example looking at the spreadsheet below within the moderate cost structure and mid productivity total costs avoided are fairly consistent starting at million from year two and going up to million in year five there are management and positions that are direct beneficiaries of the system and management positions that are indirect the productivity for the personnel assumed a direct beneficiary enhancement rate whereas the indirect beneficiaries assumed only a enhancement rate based on the assumptions of hourly rates and numbers of hours worked productivity increases from million to million by year five equaling a total of in personnel productivity add in the costs avoided and by year five the total benefit to the is close to million information services agency prepared by information services agency consulting group report title needs analysis version final the initial costs in the spreadsheet total which is the estimate for implementing the new system based on market research after the initial costs yearly ongoing costs for maintenance are around million annually this is half the cost of supporting the existing system the supporting calculated realizes the positive investment in year three at million at year five the accumulated is million information services agency prepared by

information services agency consulting group report title needs analysis version final information services agency prepared by information services agency consulting group report title needs analysis version final information services agency prepared by information services agency consulting group report title needs analysis version final appendix additional findings there were so many findings discovered during the business process interviews an additional appendix section was created explore and learn more about how paperwork and shadow systems manual calculations manual functions and obsolete technology make working within the existing human resource and financial systems inefficient finding paperwork shadow systems office of finance and management accounts payables there are over checks printed by each month to pay reoccurring bills and vendor expenses most of the checks are sent by the us postal service and some are hand delivered within the building thousands of dollars could be saved each year in postage if the money could be sent through an online banking system office of finance and management auditor city payroll non public safety manages city payroll and the auditors office manages county payroll in a mainframe program called however most departments maintain their own payroll spreadsheet or database because the department does not have permissions to thus creating separate shadow payroll systems auditor accounting reports are only available in printed form if the auditor needs transaction detail it is printed by and picked up on floor nine cash transaction reports are also received in printed format from the treasurers office the information is manually data entered into the auditors fund book access database and then manually data entered into human resources benefits and family medical leave act as part of the process the department manually enters data into two access databases correspondence is created and sent through various notifications such as email and mail the entire process varies from a minimum of one hour up to six hours per day information services agency county pass and is calculated manually for each customer with the amount entered into an access database that is used to create invoices each invoice is attached to a paper spreadsheet as backup for the charge and sent to the auditor and paper checks are issued to by and deposited at a cashiering station in the treasurers office the deposit process consists of several validations of actual deposit against paper receipts to ensure the correct amount was deposited because of typographical and data entry errors human resources records there are approximately employee records filed for sworn officers sworn officers and seasonable employees in addition there are six years of terminated employee records retained without knowledge of how many records are contained in those files on average the employee records start with pages of documentation which includes everything from their application and resume to benefits information and tax information the longer a person remains employed the larger the files become and some records are pages information services agency prepared by information services agency consulting group report title needs analysis version final finding unsupported technology office of finance and management fixed assets the city uses a mainframe programmed called extracting information from requires systems wide a separate mainframe report program the majority of all mainframe data extractions are obtained from a program called focus and therefore technical expertise and knowledge about how to properly extract data from system wide is limited finding manual calculations reconciliation office of finance and management management ninety percent of all revenue collected is from departments who collect money through their own cash collection shadow system and make their own deposits they are responsible for providing with their deposit receipts and an excel report of the daily transactions all of the reports contain coding to distinguish between the type of transaction type the money was collected for such as a permit license and application fee this coding from the excel reports is entered by the revenue department into an access database called quietus none of the reporting information collected through these various means is uploaded into until can balance all the information in quietus the lack of one system for reporting cash collections from departments creates duplicate data entry and numerous errors because the department must first verify the correctness of their own data before reporting it to for entry into quietus the transaction information is exported from quietus to nightly and is the last duty performed by the revenue manager before the upload command can be launched the revenue assistant must check and balance between deposit tickets and account data when all of the information is reviewed and the information properly coded in quietus the revenue manager runs the export job if there are issues with revenue managers coding within quietus the transactions will not export into and an error message is sent to the revenue manager much time is spent trying to understand and correct the errors within quietus the parks department uses accrual based accounting because of their need to refund accounts however uses cash based accounting when the revenue information is received by the transactions must be converted before being entered into quietus parks also have their own cash collection system called class and is currently building an interface to import deposit information directly from class into information services agency county pass and the pass and processes are done outside and it requires an access database and the analysis of an invoice from approximately pages in length requiring a match between each item and a service request inputting the data into an access database to create the invoices requires a three page document and approximately manual steps causing three days of work each month manual invoices are created for auditor reconciliations it takes two employees three and a half days to reconcile the fund book because of the amount of time needed to review and cross check against the cashbook and access databases county purchasing purchases under when purchase orders are created checks to see if the money is available in the departments budget before the funds are encumbered for every item purchased a commodity information services agency prepared by information services agency consulting group report title needs analysis version final code and must be assigned to the type of item and they must match frequently county departments are notified by the auditors office they have assigned the wrong commodity code to a however no information is given to the department about how to find the correct commodity code to match the process is very frustrating to the department and they can spend hours searching through the to locate the right commodity code editing a purchase order is very difficult within and when a department needs to make changes it is less time consuming and easier to delete the purchase order and start over rather than creating a requisition when the purchase order is finally approved purchasing creates a receiving document when the item arrives accounts to make sure the receiving document purchase order and vendors invoice all match all three documents must completely match or the invoice will not be paid sometimes a vendor will send a partial shipment with partial invoice which does not match the original purchase order much time is spent by the department trying to rework the purchase order to match the receiving document and invoice in order to pay the vendor finding labor intensive functions office of finance and management fixed assets there are two systems used to track fixed assets depending on whether the agency is part of the city or the county it is impossible to get one complete view of all the assets the owns since the data is stored separately thus causing extra administrative work to report on the the county made the decision to use a web based program hosted by a third party vendor there are limitations as to the amount of data that can be extracted because the information is being pulled across the web as a result the system cannot provide a complete listing of all the fixed assets with one extract and requires multiple extracts office of finance and management grant reporting only accepts transactions done in cash basis accounting all transactions and reporting must be done in cash basis accounting for grants which means nearly of all of the work is done using access and excel spreadsheets office of finance and management accounts payable two percent of all of the checks issued are replacement checks typed via an affidavit and replaced manually auditor reconciliations corrections to the journal entries are emailed by the departments auditor accounts payable checks on demand consist of manually writing the check or using a typewriter county payroll cannot provide specific reports needed by the department such as projected benefit leave county recorder accounts payable all checks are processed and hand delivered to the treasurers office human resources equal opportunity information services agency prepared by information services agency consulting group report title needs analysis version final every year equal opportunity receives and processes approximately new applications for certification for vendors each of these applications are separated and placed in their own file the starting size of these files is determined by whether or not an application was approved if the application was denied the file starts out with pages if the application is approved the file will start out with around pages and continues to grow as long as the certification is renewed while reviewing these files there were several vendor files containing at least pages every time a firm submits an application and forgets to add any required documentation creates and mails a letter asking for the missing information has every paper application that has been submitted to the since currently all of the files from to are stored in a storage facility the remainder of applications are stored on the th floor in filing cabinets and bankers boxes human resources benefits and family medical leave act four hundred applications with approximately compensations claims were manually entered into an access database and login in these files are stored in filing cabinets for two years until they are moved to bankers boxes and shipped off site public safety human resources and payroll both and have chosen to use payroll systems completely separate from and the after and calculate the pay for their employees the payroll information is data entered by hand and given to the auditor and to enter back into public safety is unable to track applicants within the system for public safety testing and must use an excel spreadsheet essentially all human resource files are on paper resulting in loss error and inability to easily determine employee history the entire process for tracking civilian employee applicants is done on paper information services agency prepared by information services agency consulting group report title needs analysis version final appendix matrix the following chart consists of benefits costs avoided and personal productivity and costs that would be eliminated by the implementation of the new system the personal productivity is calculated by taking full time employee counts received from office and finance and management for direct and indirect users of the systems and multiplying that with the average salary and productivity rate information services agency prepared by information services agency consulting group report title needs analysis version final appendix net present value charts the following spreadsheets represent the completed net present value calculations developed during the course of this analysis each spreadsheet identifies one of three different productivity levels within two different cost structures high productivity moderate cost this spreadsheet estimates the benefits based on the high productivity with the consistent costs avoided and evaluates the costs determined by the moderate cost structure to calculate the net present value information services agency prepared by information services agency consulting group report title needs analysis version final mid productivity moderate cost this spreadsheet
