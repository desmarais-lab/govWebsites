addendum vendor questions and answers this addendum modifies in the following manner the following are the questions generated by the vendor community and answers provided by the information service agency vendors shall note that these written statements will be binding on these written statements represent official position based on what is known at the time of publication and supersede any previous oral or written statements made at any time by staff is the date the date of the first release of the new system to the general public or an internal site to be used by city employees only and expanded with new features until all features are present a is the proposed date of release to the general public a first release to the general public is the intent to replace all features of the current site over the month starting on a and the pilot site will run concurrently for a period of time will contain a mix of old and new system during the transition a no and the pilot site will run concurrently for a period of time what are the services to be released on a this is still to be determined when will these services be available for testing a the services should be available for testing weeks prior to launch how many developers are currently working on the new web site a the number of developers will scale with the number of data integrations for example for the first services two integrations will take place are you looking for a services response software and services response or best solution response a we are looking for a response that best meets the criteria established in the document however we do not anticipate purchasing software directly through this is your current vendor involved in this process a unclear what vendor is being referenced page section in the table that describes the six key functions that the vendor selection for requirements gathering was completed as part of a combined with project function are the requirements available now to help scope out the a not at this time page section it is mentioned in the table that describes the six key functions that the for testing and training needs to be compiled in is this expected to be performed in parallel and by a single vendor or two independent vendors a two separate were published one for testing one for training they will be evaluated separately there is no expectation regarding one vendor winning both or one vendor for each as this is a phased project testing and training activities are likely to occur in parallel at different points throughout the project page section if the pilot site is to be live by does this include the window for the functionalities that are going live on a yes page section if the pilot site is to be live by and the current site will be retired in months is it months from the go live date of the pilot site if not can you provide the anchor point from which this months is being calculated and milestones in particular what are the planned dates subsequent to the pilot a this is still being confirmed anticipating rolling launch of functionality after work passes testing months is an estimate of the entire project page section if the project is following an agile methodology based on the overarching project management flow with a feedback loop to the development team is it an expectation that testing will be performed after every iteration of the product is made available by the development team a no page section it is stated that the project would follow an agile methodology can you please provide more details on the following a what kind of testing would happen within the design and development before the product is made available to the testing team unit integration and load testing will be performed before the product is made available to the testing team will the documentation and test results of the testing performed by design and development team be made available to the vendors no what kind of test automation and code coverage is the design and development team targeting to develop this information is not available will the testing vendor be responsible to independently develop and perform functional nonfunctional and regression testing to be included in part of what is referred in this document as user acceptance testing scope the testing vendor be responsible to independently develop and perform functional nonfunctional and regression testing page section given that subsequent cycles of the pilot site will build upon the number of live services offered is there a requirement to perform regression testing on the old website as well during this period in other words will the selected vendor be responsible to test only the new website a the selected vendor will be responsible to test new website only page section given the project is following an agile approach is there a specific agile methodology that is being followed example scrum a scrum page section the states that the vendor will manage the defect remediation feedback loop to development team can you explain the defect triage processes that are currently to have in place a defects will be managed via daily scrum meeting page section regression testing is not included in the list of minimum testing mentioned will regression testing be done after every iteration by the vendor or would this be carried out by the design and development team a this will be carried out by the design and development team page section it is stated that the testing regiment should be flexible to accommodate an agile approach is the expectation that testing would happen after every iteration which or not result in a go live or would it be done only for the specific iterations which would result in a go live a will be done for specific iterations that result in a page section what technical approach is being used to migrate the estimated pages of content is there any data migration or onetime process involved in this project if yes is the chosen vendor responsible to perform this data migration testing a this is not a migration the pages of content are not being moved the entire experience is being redesigned and will result in a drastically different footprint however there be a need to migrate document repositories or other content the testing of the processes related to data or content into the various web services or content management systems is the responsibility of the selected testing vendor page section please characterize how much of the website is to be new content vs migrated content a all new page section please quantify or estimate how many web services are being newly developed for this project broken out by complexity or some similar rubric please provide a few examples we could relate to and use as estimation units information is not available at this time page section describe the approach for content management throughout the development is there a source of truth for the exact content on a given page is the intention to tightly manage content lock it down at some point in the or will it be completely fluid throughout content will be tightly managed for the first months and then become more fluid page section can you elaborate more on the internal user group referred here to be engaged in the process their availability and preferred cycle for windows a we cannot elaborate further at this time page section will the chosen vendor be responsible for creation and management of test data to perform as part of the user acceptance testing scope indicated in the document a the testing vendor will be responsible for facilitating the creation and management of test data to perform page section the vendor should include a proposed schedule of completion for each milestone resulting deliverables with a targeted of for site launch is there a tentative start data that we use as an anchor point based on section there is only a vendor selection and negotiation but not a proposed begin a at this time there is not a tentative start date that has been declared section of the emphasizes on but section of the lists down different phases of testing please clarify if the scope is limited to only or if it includes earlier phases of testing like system and integration testing a in addition to section emphasizing section accounts for those items found in section at what stage is the design and development of the project in a requirements gathering stage what is the estimated effort for design and development a information not available at this time please provide the requirement documents associated for the overall project a not available at this time is it possible to share the details on the estimation parameters such as number of use cases or function points or however the overall project has been estimated with all other necessary details like screens complexities etc content and functionality will be released on a rolling basis is there a project plan in place for the overall project if so please share a not available at this time when is the testing service expected to start a not available at this time if able please provide details on what will constitute the pilot release of website on a a service for each of our core constituencies residents media and business if able please provide details on the agile methodology being adopted for the program if using scrum how many scrum teams will be formed what would be duration of each sprint what would be the typical composition of scrum teams a not available at this time please provide the technology architecture of the new a elm elixir phoenix what are the testing tools for various forms of testing functional automation performance etc that will be used on the program or the vendor is expected to recommend the tool sets a it is the selected testing vendors responsibility to both recommend and attain or possess any necessary or beneficial tool sets is there any adoption plan for the program if yes please provide details a there is not a adoption plan in place at this time what is the appetite for transformation to a quality engineering model that includes tools intelligent automation etc as opposed to pure testing a no preference is offshore a possibility a use of offshore resources is not a disqualifying factor as long as it does not conflict with standard local and state contracting requirements design and development efforts will follow an agile approach a who is doing the development and associates and their subcontractor who is the testing team for this this question is unclear when the application will be ready for testing the website will be rolled out in phases as services are made available following the initial pilot on the selected testing vendor will be responsible for conducting testing prior to release and in preparation for user acceptance what approach testing will follow how many cycles of testing will there be this is determined by the testing vendor cycles are to be determined is in development testing in scope development testing will be performed by the development vendor when said a pilot site is to be live by does that mean the first of the sprint deliverable will be by a yes does this include in development testing who will be the testing team a it depends on the service being tested and the type of test being conducted section says this testing will include at minimum the testing of the following a viability and adherence please provide more details on this not available at this time integrations please provide more details on this not available at this time load how many virtual users are to be considered do we have the tools to do testing not available at this time we expect the selected testing vendor to provide any necessary tools for testing performance compliance compliance testing against what please provide more details web standard and any applicable federal state or local regulations accessibility what is the level of accessibility testing to be done compliant functional do we have the requirements available how many are to be considered are test cases available or should be developed is automation in scope tools to be used or should it be proposed not available at this time usability or user experience i cross browser and browser version compatibility mobile devices windows and android phones and tablets anticipated deliverables as in section conduct website and web service testing a vendor testing of website test logs providing evidence of completed testing efforts what kind of evidence is expected ex like screen shots of each step observed industry standards vendor testing of web services test logs providing evidence of completed testing efforts what kind of evidence is expected ex like screen shots of each step executed observed industry standards test closeout report in which stage this report is expected after each sprint testing artifacts and iterations what are the artifacts expected any byproducts or results of testing anticipated deliverables as in section conduct a vendor led as per section this is to be done by internal users are these internal users from the project who are doing the testing or are they from the client side in which environment this is expected to be done who will provide the test cases both internal and external will occur test cases will be derived from requirements and created by selecting testing vendor when the application will be available for and what is the schedule to be determined feedback documentation discrepancy resolution via vendor managed feedback process please provide more details not available at this time please clarify if you are expecting a complete cost proposal or rates for the different roles a both we will want to see a clear estimate of total cost of the project but also the rate and time assumptions behind that total estimate are there customer journey mappings and defined for customer experience available at this time are there requirements and technical specs around design that will help design test scenarios a not available at this time does the newly designed website expected to interface or integrate with external systems or outside of the a it is highly probable that the newly designed website will be expected to interface or integrate with external systems or outside of the is there currently any business involvement in any existing testing activities a testing activities have not started yet when they start they will be involvement from end users not clear what is meant by business are there nonfunctional requirements around load performance compliance and accessibility to be made available a not available at this time
