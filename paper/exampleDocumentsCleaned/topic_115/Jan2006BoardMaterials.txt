individually and that also contains the verbatim answers to all questions we will also be presenting the calculated relative importance values for all the service attributes measured in the survey and will compare your survey results to our benchmark database of other it surveys so you can see how your performance compares with that of other it organizations that we have surveyed in the meantime this report will give you the basic overall results of the survey the sample size completed interviews and demographic composition are nearly identical to your survey so where we can compare results to that survey we are confident that the comparisons will be valid you will see in the report that terms of the actual numbers and mean or average rating for each results for example the mean we show the answer distributions for each question in the percentages for each answer we also calculate a rating question and this is the way we usually view the rating for overall satisfaction in this survey is in our view the overall survey results are very encouraging your ratings are consistent and high throughout the overall satisfaction rating compares very favorably to the one in the survey the ratings in this survey were more weighted toward the highest rating than at that time which indicates that your customers appear to be more satisfied now than they were with their it experience please
