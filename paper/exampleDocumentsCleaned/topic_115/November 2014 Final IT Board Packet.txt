status implementation phase accounts expansion this final component of the system ha completed and fully tested we are currently awaiting customer approval to implement into production tablet pilot as begin preparations to distribute the tablets to our participating it was discovered that the winning vendor from our competitive bid shipped the tablets without all of our requirements the tablets were returned and the next winning vendor from the bid process was awarded the business we are expecting the delivery of the tablets this week once received we will begin deployment outlook upgrade this project has slipped in schedule for primary reasons the first is the delay in the procurement process in getting necessary equipment for the upgrade all equipment has now been received so the project is again moving forward the other reason is the amount of cleanup work that had to be done in our existing email environment prior to upgrading to added projects electronic subpoena this project will provide an electronic method for law enforcement officers to obtain their subpoena information the current process is to extract subpoena information print onto postcards and mail to a law enforcement officer the new application is a more convenient and efficient way for law enforcement officers to track their subpoenas retirement of mainframe applications and data this project will retire the use of the mainframe along with all applications and data currently residing on it all applications previously used on the mainframe have now been replaced by new applications using current technologies the relevant data being used by these new replacement applications has also been moved to the respective database platforms all applications and data will be backed up for historical purposes bandwidth is upgrading the bandwidth infrastructure in the city county building in the recent months several applications were implemented which has caused saturation of the bandwidth within the building was aware that we would have to increase the bandwidth in the coming months due to these applications and several more being implemented within the next months however the projections for bandwidth usage for those applications already implemented were under estimated causing us to increase the bandwidth sooner than was anticipated the upgrade will provide a better user experience for all users utilizing the network within the building and will provide with the ability to meet demand the growing demand additional updates syncing to mobile devices we have been experiencing periodic issues with the ability for mobile devices predominately to sync with email and calendars the underlining issue is that we are currently on exchange exchange was not built or designed to support connections with mobile devices our infrastructure built to handle the number of mobile devices that we have operating in our environment with the lack of policy for mobile devices and a mobile device management platform the number of personal and organizational devices in our environment has increased exponentially in the past year or two in order to resolve this issue we will have to either upgrade our current on premise exchange software and infrastructure or move our email to a cloud based solution we negotiated our last contract to give us the ability to move to which is a cloud based solution we had several internal parts of this project that had to be completed before we could begin our email migration to our migrations to are set to begin in early we have provided our standards with regard to syncing email and calendars in our environment a few times over the course of the last year unfortunately many of our users do not follow these standards which increase the amount of issues in our environment for example a typical users mobile device should have approximately transactions per day however we have many users that have anywhere between and transactions a day these mobile devices are using a significant amount of resources in our environment which disrupts the service for others while we continue to spend time to help users try to resolve their individual syncing issues this problem itself will not be resolved until we move to for the month of met all of their established met of their established and missed missed were as follows service level
