training for office and moss project server administrator ms added has two open positions that when and if the hiring freeze is lifted help manage projects ms stated that the budget is around million but once additional appropriations are included the figure is closer to million asked if the difference between the and million is mostly due to grant funding replied grant funds one time expenditures or capital expenditures new application development and additional projects the department took on that required appropriations as approved by council stated the budget is very tight this year and there is a cut from the current years operating budget the items on the list that were cut such as the is a must do otherwise agreements with the prime contractor are violated there is risk associated with failure to do the data center upgrade the it board reviewed that risk and agreed that under current circumstances the enterprise cannot risk a failure there is also risk in failing to have someone as a project server administrator as the takes place the requires juggling time and the network in the appropriate order continued with discussion of pushing production justice enhancements and the delay hood concluded the presentation meadows asked if the in character is for the variance meadows stated that is not much to do the variances agencies have requested ms stated that the office of finance and management has requested that variances be approved by them ms added that figure does not include anything would want or need a request not in the budget would require consideration of other appropriations ms enders asked if other sources of funding have been identified to cover items currently not funded stated there are sources such as however some funds are paid directly like and have specific uses initiatives such as could be funded through grants the property system is funded out of special funds the appropriations for project management are a little different ms stated the project management of the property system project is going well ms enders stated that she appreciates the circumstances but as a board they need to state the importance of concerns identify risks and address the best way available given the agreed that is the responsibility of the board and there are no easy decisions internet acceptable use policy deputy director and presented the internet acceptable use policy stated that the policy has been reviewed and accepted by the it team is the chair of the policies group which focuses on the human side of technology serves as chair of the standards committee which focuses on technology and hardware highlighted the second paragraph as the governing statement of this policy ms clarified that in instances when an employee is terminated and the threat exists a department head or supervisor would need to contact ms enders asked if an emergency delete request process exists replied that there is and ms stated that the administration of human resources is part of the committee and is comfortable with the policy judge asked if the policy includes delegation of email explained delegation authority be set up as part of the email package and there will be exceptions especially in law enforcement in reference to the portion of the policy regarding an employee face disciplinary action by has no authority other than to notify the appropriate agency in reference to the introduction of viruses into the environment commented that if there were imminent denial of service would have the ability to shut that down without asking the agency asked should service be denied what about future service stated that would stop the attack and then discuss the issue with the agency cannot discipline another employee but can prevent the employee from damaging the environment ms white stated that the it board could get in hot water very fast telling department heads and elected officials how to handle their employee matters stated that there should be implied an element of cooperation would expect that any agency or department head given proof or evidence of an employee wanting to harm the system would want to take action against that employee added that the policy should include the opportunity for mistakes or the need for training commented that a poor performer probably knows the writing on wall and should the user delete data is there the ability to restore stated that unless the hard drive is physically altered physically removed and crushed data be restored asked what port scanning is stated that within the network there are different ports that are opened up for different services people that are trying to break into your system will scan your servers and what ports will accept a connection reveals security breaches and generates traffic asked if office lotteries through internet are illegal or campaign mobilizations are unauthorized use asked if there were any surveillance of activities accessed employees stated blue coat tracks those types of activities stated that communicating the ability would be good preventative means to let employees know the enterprise do that asked if the notice will be posted and if so monitoring of usage should be included stated that when a user logs in a secondary screen will appear to accept the policy ms added that is working with hr regarding written authorization meadows stated the it team and standards committees have done a fantastic job but are not done and the sheriff department will be blocking an additional categories of sites meadows offered support of the policy but asked the committee to look at blocking additional categories meadows stated that the board needs to control access in a reasonable and ethical way stated they accept that task ms clarified that directors and agency heads from different departments block additional categories the policy does not have to be controlled at the enterprise level judge asked what shows when an employee tries to access one of those sites and suggested a big red bar judge stated that the courts have blocked additional sites including all games ms white made a motion to approve the internet acceptable use policy the motion was seconded by and carried unanimously technology update narrated the briefing is a process by which multiple physical servers are consolidated into a single more powerful server which results in a higher utilization consumes less power generates less heat and overall less costs historically a new application is rolled out a new server which leads to a proliferation of servers this project looks to reduce this number presently there are several large projects which would require new hardware if the enterprise does not now narrated the benefits including fewer physical machines lower hardware costs lower power consumption less heat generated ease of administration scalability and the environmental grow with improved disaster recover and reduced recovery time stated that the business case was based on several assumptions asked for further plan for redundancy for disaster recovery site stated that the long term plan would be for two data centers with capabilities between them asked in regards to the fail over in the mirror sites wont the enterprise have to go to complete to get there responded that is not only technology that allows for replication of data stated the cost savings is largely in hardware as best can be determined the human resource element was not built in the business case and asked if that is due assuming there will not be a need for more personnel stated that based on the current contract there is no cost increase or decrease from network perspective designed to handle asked if there was capacity for test environment replied there was but the business case is based on the production environment only ms added the electricity would be cost avoidance stated that space would be an issue also asked in relation to the servers what the ratio to core applications activities stated he would find out ms amber pm and narrated the presentation staffing changes resulted in a new development approach some tasks have been delayed but at this point no impact to overall project or go live date asked if there are particular users that there are not getting cooperation from judge stated that there are some differing ways in which people think things should be done on going discussions are taking place on how to resolve those issues judge stated she does not agree with the linear difference of opinion and expressed concern requested attention be put on the problem and identified where the project is getting stalled judge stated seeing the update clarifies the concerns and have the setback comes from having different ways of doing things which were not understood before last week and seeing this today explained in setting up user profiles each agency identifies new staff coming in and requests the new profile look like an existing profile the process has continued which has resulted in copying profiles there is a need to reestablish knowledge and get scripts fully defined stated that is a significant step by clerk courts and prosecutor which will require much time ms continued that before go live the security profiles need to be in place or an increase in the support hours will continue judge commented on the portion of the presentation noting that is the basis of the philosophical differences that need to be worked out the way that the agencies scripting process is viewed is the way that the most panels will be missed and results in the most interaction with security profiles judge asked for an analysis of as it currently exists including what panels are utilized judge suggested a different way to do that ms stated she had spoke with and wants to go through the case types as suggested and pound through the case types the challenge is related to court court civil court and the different functionalities associated with each of those courts that will need to be tested ms stated that would like to find and write down those processes in the future which will help with training and help with scripting judge stated that using without well defined scripts is very very linear and court updating is not linear over the months or year a case progresses the different ways of scripting pass from experience the suggested will not access that the group needs to sit down and have a discussion about that and that has not been done commented that he needed clarification and stated that initially the discussion included what panels are touched whatever the case mix might be now many months later the recommendation has been made to have the users sit in a room whatever way they see fit show the team how they use these kinds of elements inside production commented he did not recall committing the case type had to be a matter of concern since the last presentation progress has not been made with the courts which are huge users and stated concern with the current conversation regarding differences in philosophy judge stated she did not fully understand why production had stopped and now she understands and will try to resolve the differences judge stated the group has been unsuccessful in replicating what the courts do and there is a need to have discussion with the project manager and the judges to decide the best way to get through this staff will not participate with out business processes place needs very clear documentation when all has been tested signed off on and agreed upon which is the benefits of scripts asked if one of the issues were the number of judges involved judge stated that the number of judges is not an issue explained that in looking at the court process the process is basic court process scripting wide always another case starts the process then the court schedules a hearing is it a bench trial or jury trial judge listening to two plaintiff attorneys or two despondent attorneys listening to case not really using justice at end of case at that point enter a code on justice say what the verdict was process wise that is the court process it is a very simplified process the should include bringing in staff from every different court based on each case type and have the tester act as clerk act as a prosecutor act as an officer act as law enforcement officer run case type through testers would touch many panels but the process is simple stated that testers are ready to test however a print solution and scheduler are missing ms stated that is a investment that has to make and would want to make sure the solution is the right one verify progress is being made and certify the test provides documentation to be at a comfort level before making that investment stated that he needs from a report that identifies each panel and each user id that has accessed that panel suggested getting the user groups together and formulating a plan prior to the next it board meeting added that security is an function ms clarified that is responsible for the day to day operation and to load the application is a function ms continued with issues and concerns including two production bug fixes pm and pm presented the property system update curt of was present reported that in spite of the property tax bill challenges progress has continued to be made the majority of time has been spent on gap analysis meetings the contained requirements that the vendor has to meet the requirements have been divided into functional areas the gap analysis meetings are scheduled for project team area coordinators and subject matter experts to review the requirements in each of those functional groupings and to make sure that understands each requirement already meets many of the requirements of the new property system will take the notes from the gap analysis meetings back to their developers to analyze the results will be developed into functional specifications which upon approval by the and will be used as the basis to add county functionality to reported that and representing entities have participated in the meetings held thus far noted that attendance has averaged of those scheduled to meet and commended those who have attended on their commitment and participation stated that in the revised project plan implementation of the auditor and treasurer modules has been moved up from of to mid of the question was asked if the reconciliation bills would be produced on the new system stated they would not although other state mandates will be included in the new system at no additional cost commented that staff is stretched with the property reassessment and other types of initiative requiring flexibility in hard times the character of staff shows during challenging times and complimented staff with the progress and added that moving the treasurer and auditor up on the schedule is great news stated that the different agencies involved do not always agree with each other but given the importance of this project differences have been put aside added the and will be very busy the next months the it board adjourned at the next information technology board meeting is scheduled for at in room project has been completed this is the last time it will appear on this report the project is experiencing significant delays potential cost overruns or critical failure hard deadlines be exceed in excess of original budget immediate corrective action is the project is experiencing minor delays or minor cost overruns or the project has encountered problems which put it at risk of either going or missing deadlines hard deadlines can still be achieved but original goal dates be missed cost end up over original budget project is on time and on budget with no delays or budget issues anticipated project including estimates define

print assessment the assessment was completed and the office of finance and management has signed off on completion of the project xerox will be providing an enterprise business case for review which falls outside the scope of this project appeals exemptions the merging of three access applications into a single appeals exemptions application was completed and deployed to production on this application is used by the county assessors office to track monitor and report on property assessment appeals and exemptions the application provides significantly improved reporting security stability and recoverability capabilities application and authentication of the applications requiring a user to using their network and password were updated to utilize the windows active directory lightweight directory access protocol ad authentication instead of the this allows users to have less logins and passwords to remember in order to access their coroner information management system the rewrite and conversion of the access version of the coroners database was completed and deployed to production on th it stores a large amount of data and images related to every case being handled by the coroners office the application provides a powerful search engine and reporting component it also significantly improves the security stability and recoverability of the data court services scheduler the court services scheduler was deployed to production on th it is used by the courts staff members that are responsible for reserving and scheduling the various court rooms within the building the application allows a room to be requested based on the amenities required the application interacts directly with an outlook calendar to update the status of rooms as they are requested confirmed denied and public defender move completed the move of over employees from the building to the gold building over a two week period of time victims of crime act child interviewer and victim advocate applications the child interviewer and victim advocate applications were deployed to production on th these two applications are used by the prosecutors office to track maintain and report on interviews conducted and any subsequent services provided to victims of crime the application generates the biannual report in the format that is required to remain eligible for the grant program through the criminal justice institute the initiation phase has concluded and the requirements gathering portion of analysis is complete initial discussions regarding coordination between the system project and upgrade are underway as is the data cleansing necessary prior to the conversion to camera projects this project is now divided into two separate projects neighborhood cameras vendor responses were due to purchasing on th and the evaluation team is reviewing the proposals and will have final scoring completed by st samples of all scheduled and ad hoc reports produced through the legacy property system the goal is to analyze what current reports are needed combine reports where possible and add new reports based on new functionality available in there is great concern that the reassessment is a major risk to the property project and data integrity data integrity if the computer assisted mass appraisal files are converted in they will not be of use to the assessors because of reassessment when reassessment is complete scheduled for the results would be laid on top of the files due to the fact that the reassessment will need to be completed in the old property system which will occur at the end of it does not make sense to deploy the new system to the assessors before that is complete there is concern that the assessors will not have time to do proper testing continues to work with the project team to plan and evaluate what the impact of these items will be to the overall project liberty zone phase of the project closed out the week of th after resolving three cameras being brought online phase cameras total have been received and plans are being made for the installation of the four mall cameras at and square mall to close out the project is preparing a cost proposal to fill the support gap that has been identified as an issue from the contractual vendor support and the end user for phases and enterprise resource planning the office of finance and management and are beginning a project to develop a business case for replacement of the financial and human resource systems the software industry has developed a suite of integrated systems that encompass finance hr and related systems into an offering called enterprise resource planning and will begin meeting with various departments at the end of to gather high level requirements the project is approximately complete this period the project team will be focused strictly on the user acceptance testing scripting process as all other tasks have been put on hold the decision has been made to investigate if other options or solutions to a case management system now exist to ensure that we are still on the right course for county a review of potential solutions is underway municipal wireless has successfully negotiated a scope of work and pricing for consulting services to conduct a feasibility study to deploy a wireless system the study will give the a better understanding of the projects capabilities viability capacity to implement the solution as well as the overall sustainability of such an initiative budget process presented the proposed budget before the administration and finance committee of the council on the evening of th since that time we have worked with the office of finance and management on various budgetary issues as well as attended both finance committee meetings the finance committee approved the budget on th the budget as a part of the entire budget went before the full council on th and was passed there were no changes to the budget property system replacement all gap analysis meetings have been conducted and will create functional specs which upon approval by the project stakeholders will be used as the basis to add the county functionality to the project team has reviewed and updated the revised project plan statements of understanding were approved by the executive sponsors for hour updating of the reporting database and enterprise wide access to the the team will inventory and gather from what was reported at the last it board archive project the use of email continues to grow and presents challenges in maintaining performance of the system the archive system being implemented will automatically manage users and migrate old messages from the active message store to an archive while maintaining the appearance of those messages within the users this will help maintain system performance while appearing to the user as a virtually unlimited as discussed in previous months the volume of calls into the has stabilized the has handled calls year to date with a projected total calls for completed for the month of in addition to the related to the refresh one was missed for the month of and it was availability this is the first month that has missed this since the outage that caused to miss the occurred after hours and had no impact on the customer formally known as continues to work on a marketing and communication plan to roll out remote connectivity to the user community this solution will be rolled out to the enterprise by the end of standards policies the standards policies committees continue to meet and work on various topics for the enterprise the standards group is focusing on updating the standard hardware of our desktop and laptop platforms as well as looking at a standard for a device the policies group is reviewing the web categories within blue coat as discussed at the last it board meeting the county sheriffs department has piloted blocking a number of categories and the effects are being studied prior to deploying to the enterprise the policies group has determined that the next policy that will be addressed is the email acceptable use achieved all for the month of and completed a number of application related projects as indicated at the beginning of this report there are three additional applications that are in user acceptance testing including the following document generation framework utilizing words mail merge functionality to forms from a database supervisory special reporting system to track and monitor specific events in the field tax sale bidder registration treasurer allows prospective bidders to register via the internet instead of having to do so at the sale storage assessment the need for storage within our environment continues to grow at a rapid pace this is being accelerated through the requirements of the many large projects currently planned or underway is in the process of assessing what storage is presently in use how it is allocated to various functions and forecasting what our needs will be over the next year this assessment will develop a storage strategy that meets our current needs and lays the foundation for future growth financial report this report describes the financial position of in three areas vs budget comparison revenue statement and vs contract comparison expenditures as of total million or this includes payments to and the budget includes million in prior year purchase orders the expense for character includes million carried over from revenue has collected million dollars or of our projected revenue for which includes payments received for the th quarter billings the projected revenue does not include million to be billed for the remaining balance of the camera project and the fusion financial report includes credit amendment credit in includes credit credit includes board resolution to approve an agreement between the information services agency and inc whereas the information services agency has determined that the unique and disparate wireless initiatives being pursued by individual city of county departments would materially benefit from overall coordination and whereas the information services agency requires the services of an experienced vendor to provide wireless initiative feasibility design coordination and related services and whereas the information services agency has researched service providers in this field and has determined that the proposal outlined by inc is well suited to provide the services outlined by the information services agency and whereas inc is an experienced and renowned purveyor of these services and the information services agency desires to obtain these services from now therefore be it resolved the information technology board approves a professional services agreement between the information services agency and inc for an amount not to exceed for the services enders secretary modular messaging information services agency is seeking approval from the information technology board to enter into agreement with and enabling technology contractors on behalf of the city of for updating the current system purchased in early the modular messaging is a internet protocol messaging solution that offers the robustness and features that the city of county expects from our traditional system while providing advanced features and functionality along with a platform that can be expanded in the future since this system will replace our existing system currently supported by it is important to note that modular messaging will offer a functional replacement for most if not all of the features and applications currently in use there is a need for this upgrade to happen prior to inclement weather in order to avoid incidents due to outages that have been experienced over the past couple of years issues with the existing system are happening more frequently due to the age of the current equipment and the telephone operations department receives numerous complaints regarding the failing of the existing system one major issue is that the existing system fails to alert employees when they have messages waiting for them in their due to a malfunctioning message waiting indicator while this functionality can be quickly restored it results in a delayed notification to the employee in addition modular messaging services will include culturally necessary features such as multilingual system prompting requesting the board move to approve the agreement between the information services agency and for the install of the state of the art modular messaging system and therefore bringing efficiencies ultimately creating savings and productivity for the city of board resolution to approve an agreement between the information services agency and for a modular messaging system whereas the information service agency desires to obtain for the city of an optimal messaging product and whereas is currently supporting the archaic system purchased in the early and whereas can provide a state of the art modular messaging system that will interface with our new email system and whereas agrees to provide and install the modular messaging system for a total cost of two hundred and seventy eight thousand three hundred and twenty two dollars and cents now therefore be it resolved that the information technology board authorizes information services agency to enter into an agreement with for the modular messaging system in an amount not to exceed and authorizes the chief information officer of to execute said agreement technology update archive executive summary electronic mail continues to be a critical application for the use of the system continues to increase with user demands for larger mailbox sizes to send and receive large documents as well as save more messages for a longer period of time with the increase in email use the message stores database containing the messages and attachments continue to grow which increases backup times and slows performance of the overall an archive solution automatically migrates old messages from the active message store to a database archive this eliminates the need for the to manage their either by manually archiving messages to a local archive or deleting them presently we have purchased from as the software solution and are determining the hardware needs server and storage necessary to implement the solution a pilot has been successfully implemented the project plan calls for implementation by the end of the year including communication and selected training the purchase of was funded through the migration project funds remain in the project to purchase the additional storage necessary for the archive archiving provides several benefits to the eliminate the need for users to archive rather than requiring users to maintain their own the archive solution will automatically migrate old email messages and attachments to the archive where they can be later retrieved improve performance of the exchange environment by implementing an archive the message stores within exchange will remain at approximately the same size rather than growing as use increases and degrading performance enhanced search capabilities advanced search capabilities allow users or administrators to search their and archive quickly and easily to find messages based on many different criteria reduced storage needs has several features including single instancing which reduce the overall need for storage technology update storage executive summary storage is a critical component within any application and use of storage at the continues to grow the increased demand has several affects including continuously adding storage resulting in a more complex environment increasing backup times and degrading the speed at which an application can access data is critical to the overall performance of the application especially as we look to much of our production server environment as we look to purchase more storage we want to first inventory all of the storage that we have how it is allocated and its potential to be expanded this is being done in partnership with and dell through a storage assessment in addition to the technical aspects we want to take a look at what is being stored and whether there need to be policies established as to how and what is stored eliminate mp files based on the results of the assessment and future needs related to current projects a storage strategy will be developed which will determine what type of storage and how it will be deployed for any future needs while there is no specific funded for this endeavor the idea is to insure that as we purchase additional storage it follows an overall storage strategy this insures that funds are used optimally storage is a vital component of our overall computing environment and it is important that we continue to monitor its availability and performance by developing and following an overall storage strategy we can insure that we leverage our existing hardware and maximize the benefit for any additional purchases password reset tool presentation what will allow the user to reset their password without calling the will allow the user to unlock their account without calling the will provide single to multiple will allow the user to change passwords on multiple systems why for the month period ending calls to the were for password resets on average it takes the minutes to reset a users password that represents hours of lost productivity for our users staff would have more time to help other customers will improve network security when implementation will follow the expiration of the users
