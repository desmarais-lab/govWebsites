meeting minutes and the motion was seconded by ms carried with assenting votes from ms beth white judge and good morning madam chair good morning to all of the board members and for the record i am the chief information officer and i thank all of you for the opportunity to update you on the report neither closed out nor added any projects in the last month i expect that to change for next month as we kick off efforts to update our month plan and our enterprise technology plan a couple of projects have been moved to yellow or continue to be yellow this month email marketing services procurement negotiations continue on this project and we hope to be able to wrap things up and have all the agreements signed in time for the current contract expiration of th in the event that we are unable to do so we have made arrangements to go month to month under the current agreement disaster recovery plan upgrade phase with the focus on and other priorities this project is delayed the progress made so far has focused on a new storage solution which has been presented at a high level to me in the last couple of weeks this new solution will not only set up the enterprise to better handle our storage needs but will also help with our tape backup and disaster recovery needs we continue discussions with the state to leverage their secondary data center in as well ongoing projects that i want to mention this month include traffic signal network system upgrade is working with engineering to upgrade the traffic signal network and signal management system due to budgetary restrictions identified in the last month we are working to redefine the plan and the project to match the funds that will be available it services sourcing project the sourcing project progress remains steady the team in and will be primarily focused on data validation as well as and sample contract development both are sizable tasks that require the considerable more time when compared to other project tasks as mentioned last month as sections are drafted will submit to and legal for early review and comment with the goal of making the overall review and approval process more palatable and efficient budget last white and i presented the budget to the finance committee we shared with the committee a number of the successes that we achieved over the last year and then focused on what the numbers looks like for next year just a couple of highlight since i have shared this data already with the board total proposed budget for next year is a little over million dollars which includes both operating and the project this represents the lowest proposed budget for since did not have the project and is a reduction from this year with winding down the overall reduction was expected the more telling number is that the proposed budget includes a reduction from the operating budget so adding that to the reductions from this year has reduced its operating budget by almost in two years we talked about the to the agencies and the pain that this has caused the departments for the first time will fully charge back its budget and that meant a million increase to the department and agencies in a time where money is very tight the reason for the increase is that in the past the fund balance has been used to subsidize the agency budgets and that fund can no longer sustain doing that we talked about the cost model that has been created and the emphasis our team is putting on getting a new model in place that will help customers better understand and manage their it costs the good news out of all of this is that now that is fully charging back its budget the customers should no longer see the large jumps in cost without having specific projects associated with it the other good news is as continues to find savings and manage down our costs as we have over the last couple of years this should have a direct impact on the to our customers i would love to be able to go back to our customers next year and say that through the hard work of our customers and the team we have been able to reduce our costs and i can pass the savings back on to you both and met all their for
