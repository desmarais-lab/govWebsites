morning and welcome thank you chairman good morning board members good morning for the record i am glen baker the chief information officer initiatives were completed this month downtown wireless technical evaluation completed in mid a evaluation was led by and had two major objectives define wireless network options and help and the public safety select the future wireless technology for the prepared a plan for a downtown pilot including a full bill of materials and fixed deployment pricing we selected a public safety solution and public safety are analyzing the proposal and working to define potential funding options special thank you team team public safety entities sheriff fire homeland security and and our project steering committee major mark wood and fee modification enhancements completed in early a enhancements to support fee increases and other ordinance changes thank you to team and property system project completed yesterday a executive committee unanimously voted to close the project and transition to support and maintenance mode will give us the details a little later initiative was added this month network vulnerability assessment a hired three outside firms to perform network vulnerability tests near future while we cant provide specifics its an important part of our overall security strategy projects are yellow at this time public safety future state analysis delayed to a too many public safety initiatives for available resources including wireless and office implementation delayed to a remote laptops will take longer several hundred check into the network small number of laptops need to be refreshed brief update on a couple of other initiatives public safety a goal is to equip public safety vehicles with that allow them to access critical information anywhere in the tunnel to our network has been successfully implemented for testing and are working through some implementation issues performance testing is underway public safety integrated regional info system iris a goal is to implement technologies that will promote regional and national sharing of safety information taken off of hold this month and moving full speed ahead most likely see an or in the near future both and met all in i thank and congratulate both and for many months of meeting or exceeding our service levels inform everyone that we will be reviewing our budget at next months it board meeting total expenses was budgeted for was used which equals used overall revenue was budgeted for was received which accounted for collected approximately million in prior year purchase orders carried over into of that amount we have spent approximately million in this calendar year the main service areas show a total of spent for compared to for last year at this time this made for a variance due to a different payment schedule this year on the contract deputy presented the action items for resolution slides available for viewing in it

solution enterprise vault and updating email policies and procedures efficiencies will be gained through the reduction systems required to deliver the service utilizing archives to reduce the amount of high storage and reducing the amount of time and effort required to fulfill public record requests the scope of this phase includes the administration pension and payroll chameleon upgrade the chameleon line of business application will be brought to the current patch release this will open up a number of enhancements which will provide value to the agency will have access to better reports and application functions additional useful data fields will be added or expanded a number of application bugs will be corrected processes to ensure we are ready to launch the implementation of the core phase in late the scope of this phase includes the implementation of general ledger procurement and assessor facilities consolidation due to a public referendum assessment responsibilities were transferred from nine local township assessors to the county assessor the plan was to consolidate the nine local assessor offices into four satellite offices north south east and west with a main office located at the enhancements have been broken out into three phases phase includes the solution and retirement of phase includes the digital plan review software and phase includes online access for the public of documents guardian home moves sheriff and the have relocated staff currently residing at university avenue former guardians home as of th the department of public safety received approval through the city council on th to enter a year lease agreement as of th approximately officers and administration staff began occupancy of square feet of space at avenue election board warehouse move the election board is planning to move its warehouse from gale street to the commons shopping center located at east street this move is schedule to occur after the election and will require a new data circuit wiring and phones for approximately ten employees the county sheriffs department warrants unit currently located at university avenue have relocated to the former information technology it section of the main jail located at street as of it is undetermined whether this will be the final location of the unit email optimization the objective of this project is to improve the efficiency of the email services by upgrading to latest version of exchange implementing redesign phase this phase will involve the creation of a test environment to develop the new website structure and to implement the new design and architecture into the content management system in addition reviews will be performed with individual agencies to gather essential feedback prior to drafting of individual site designs public safety super bowl future state analysis the aspires toward achieving public safety systems to support the needs of both massive events like the upcoming super bowl and operations achieving this vision requires elaboration of both needs and further documenting the longterm vision across public safety entities to ensure maximum of any interim solutions the major deliverables for this project will include conceptual diagrams of both current state and future state documented data flows and gap analysis information for the super bowl iris public safety data records management moss enterprise the purpose of this project is to leverage our investment in moss technology we will accomplish that leverage in two ways first we have engaged apparatus to manage our moss services second we will work with apparatus to deploy to the enterprise in phases with enterprise and portals processes impacting single and the association of static addressing for the without using a client additionally the current implementation focusing primarily on enabling field reporting will rely on a backend internet connection thereby disabling circuit uptime service levels while currently out of scope foreseeable future enhancements including the addition of redundant and commercial circuits are anticipated to enable other benefits that mitigate current operational risks stemming from vehicle radio modems network vulnerability assessment the objective of this initiative is to engage a neutral vendor to conduct a security assessment to identify any potential vulnerabilities in the external internal and wireless network infrastructures and provide recommendations on how to them office includes a new look and feel most notably a new menu structure emphasis will be placed on providing training resources to users throughout the phase this initiative will expand upon the initial successes of the portal by adding additional capabilities and request types making usability enhancements and adjusting some technical aspects of the portal some of these changes include more robust user help language support and mapping enhancements transmitters in addition to being one of the requirements for accreditation through the correctional association significant savings could be realized by tracking deputy movement and eliminating manual entry of clock rounds information into traffic court move the traffic court is a high visibility public facing operation moving from the training academy at post to a new location at ave a is required to accommodate the staff moving to that area it is estimated to take days for construction the new court must be operational before staff can move from the old location it is anticipated that will be snow fighter
