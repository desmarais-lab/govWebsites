encumbrances in a sentence below the year to date expense chart the year to date revenue collected through of was slightly under of what we expect to collect million through the calendar year this calculates to percent of the budget for so far this amount is lower than what we had collected at this time last year however the reasoning behind that is largely timing the normal monthly bills were not received until th there is nothing alarming about that figure hood pointed out the miscellaneous revenue figure of million budgeted for the year vs budget for the year represents how that money is categorized in and how the budget is set up with including grant dollars those transfers are from other funds that come in to that are classified as revenue such as grants and fiscal ordinances hood than reviewed the service contract comparison area of the financial report per judge request hood separated service areas and into their own individual columns so that the chart reflects the three separate service areas for more clarity the service contract comparison through of is a little over spent in the three major service areas the variances are positive at this point service areas and
