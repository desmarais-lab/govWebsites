where can drive efficiencies cost reductions and best ways to communicate detailed cost information to all the agencies and departments he continued by saying is working with to determine if our results will be driving the for three other initiatives are nearly complete the database migration and server migration have proven to be to be an admiral foe due to the amount of data on those servers most of the work is done and hope to get them closed out in judge young asked what can be done to get the users to do what is needed to get the migrations completed baker stated that proper planning upfront will help so the users the only reason for the delay and i need to thank some members from and for working through the holiday weekend on these projects added that due to users normal

information technology board called for a vote and judge young made a motion to approve resolution the motion was seconded by and passed business intelligence project manager and rick mgr systems integration deployment strategies presented the business intelligence presentation stated that business intelligence is the process of deriving information from data and bi applications provide historical current and predictive views of business operations one of the tools used in development was performance point which provides functionality for performance management that includes scorecards dashboards reporting planning budgeting and forecasting the project sponsor is the mayors office of enterprise development and the primary objective of the project was to reduce the burden of producing reports the pilot departments were and and the contractor was tech to create the applications discussion with tech began in and was implemented the bi tool will meet the reporting needs create standardized reports for division and departments and allow analysis requests from the press or stated that as the sponsor on this project explained how this would benefit the enterprise by allowing users to cleanse dirty data which will result in better performance management judge young asked for clarification on how the tool locates errors in data replied that the tool will allow them to find were things are out of range of the standard he continued by saying that they are working on putting together their strategic direction we have the pilot completed and will have a demonstration to show how it is used we will be evaluating how to use this across the enterprise establish goals determine next system candidates for bi applications secure funding and determine public distribution strategies asked if we own this tool and what are the future funding needs replied that we do own the tool and the funding needs are for the resources necessary to do analysis for the online analytical processing which is a form of data warehousing currently does not have anyone with that skill set and will need to have this done for us until we do asked if we were able to do the pilot programs under the dollars we set forth replied yes we were on budget but about a month late due some technical problems ms asked if there were plans to integrate with and are you looking to surface that data in or separately replied that preference point is tightly integrated with deputy controller gave a short demonstration of the city accounting system ms white asked if there is a plan to train agencies to use this tool stated that the data that we are analyzing right now is on the city side and we have not yet done the analysis to pull over the county side data as we do roll it out to agencies it will be part of the plan to select people and systems the agencies use and training will be supplied asked if the additional cost comes from outside support stated that understanding what that system tracks how the information is stored what is useful and how the department wants it analyzed then bringing that in and building the cubes that makes the quick analyses possible baker stated that in their budgeting they have identified change orders and have put money for business intelligence the amount of money we are putting in be building cubes for the next four or five agencies departments or systems ms asked if would be looking at the other projects in the portfolio that might be impacted baker responded they are going to put together what our next twelve to eighteen month plan of record is for that includes how all the technologies and projects come together because they impact what we are doing with the implementation of the property system and with moving forward we will change out a lot of our systems and a lot of our data sources over the next twelve to eighteen months i think its very important from an integration standpoint that we understand how we are going to move forward what tools we are going to use and that we have that vision overall office of code enforcement rick powers director office of code enforcement presented the public safety starts here presentation to give the it board a sense of the commitment needed from in the future powers stated that he is creating a new department which will support when you look historically at the city of county and our services in some core areas to look at things like where do you obtain a license or permit how to i obtain an inspection service the response from a government agency is it depends we are looking throughout city government to consolidate those functions by consolidating some of these issues we will have a significant impact on the quality of life currently underway are efforts to have and to stay on the same system move to electronic files with computers in courtrooms and have computers in the inspectors cars with systems proposal will create the department of code enforcement effective a board of code enforcement will be created powers stated he had no idea when said he wanted to move licensing out of what that really meant there was a huge impact upon technology when we starting plugging enforcement mechanisms into it and it consumed resources we are hoping to do things more efficiently more cost effectively so the expenditures we are making today will lead to more savings tomorrow baker added that powers is a very important and aggressive customer of the group which is a good thing and we are just beginning to understand the extent that technology is needed to drive a lot of the capabilities discussed today organization update baker promised to give a quick update on the organization chart he stated he has created a flat organization that should provide very good visibility from top to bottom we changed the reporting relationship for major projects to report to the highest level of the organization which will give those projects the attention they needed from my level we addressed the concern that the span of control for the seemed to be very wide by adding the deputy position which is filling that position will have the responsibility of the day to day operation of but will report to me from strategic standpoint baker gave an overview of the reporting structure amber manager projects open service

the tool file services consolidation the objective of this initiative is to provide a more cost effective file storage service by consolidating the number of servers used to provide those services the project includes migrating file storage from windows based systems to mass storage in addition to retiring windows servers after migration is services request for qualifications the team has long augmented its internal staff with outside resources to allow additional flexibility and to provide a wider range of expertise the contract for these services was last competed in late and as such a request for qualifications will be released to ensure that the is receiving the best value for its money business intelligence now that has successfully implemented various tools used for business intelligence and completed a pilot for the mayors office we can begin to assess and develop an enterprise strategy for and use of these tools with a strategy in place can develop service offerings to meet the business intelligence needs throughout the enterprise hosting services analysis the initial goals are to reduce the aggregate costs increase the efficiency and to reduce the recovery time for hosting services a secondary objective is to reduce the environmental impact of hosting services and increase collaboration with other public entities the three primary areas of focus are the mainframe hosting platform the externally hosted infrastructure and the current disaster recovery locations implementation of to upgrade the superior courts human resource and payroll systems implementation of a grants module will also be included in phase two of the project database migration the objective of this initiative is to provide more cost effective database services by consolidating the number of servers used to provide db services existing oracle and server databases will be migrated portfolio management this initiative includes implementing processes and tools that will enable to maintain a constant inventory of active and queued initiatives ensure that priorities are governed by the functional groups and it team and priorities are aggressively communicated to customer agencies and departments document management has been identified as the enterprise document management solution we are ready to implement the new version of document management as part of the project we have also begun development of a strategy that will enable jail wireless in anticipation of future time and cost savings initiatives such as automated clock rounds automated event

services migrations superior court state voucher interface the scope of this project is to enhance the state voucher system to capture the required data and transfer it to so that a check can be generated without manual intervention regional center design guidelines in order to undertake development in the regional center potential developers must submit a design plan to planning for regional center approval the current guidelines for issuing regional center approvals and the review process are somewhat fluid and subject to administrative interpretation this resulted in a planning initiative to establish and document formal regional center design guidelines the new guidelines were formally approved by the metropolitan development commission on the implementation of the new guidelines has prompted the development community to request a solution that automatically generates the applicable regional center design guidelines for each proposed project planning believes that such a solution will be vital to facilitating future development in the regional center moss enterprise this project involves migrating the existing content management sites to the moss environment converting existing sites to moss migrating the moss pilot sites and rolling out to the remaining departments municipal wireless feasibility study the current scope of this project is to determine the feasibility of utilizing certain applications and business processes over a municipal wireless network it is expected that a pilot will be the end result of the current scope nuisance property tracking system attacking vacant and abandoned housing and related public safety issues is one of mayor priorities and collaboratively developed a list of the top problematic properties and an action plan to address each one currently information regarding these problem properties and the actions being taken to address them are stored in a excel spreadsheet on a network drive this method of storing and sharing data is proving inadequate for the needs of the team this project will result in a method of gathering and tracking information and activities related to the properties the system should allow access by all team members including outside counsel this project was initiated to develop a reporting system to track and monitor the reporting on the occurrence of specific incidents related to officers the application must include automatic routing through the for review and approval proposed a new data model application flow and supporting user interface to and everyone is confident that this will provide all of the desired functionality in an intuitive and efficient application the objective of this initiative is to migrate off of the legacy circuits to a robust
