requirements for the core project all requirements for this project have been documented and the implementation has been completed all requirements have been turned over to for development of dexter yellow status physical host migration to it was our original plan to go live with the system in our environment on however we have experienced a few challenges in receiving the data in a proper manner from our current hosting vendor therefore we are approximately days behind schedule i am pleased to announce that the entire system including all components is up and running in our data center the team completed their preliminary testing and have now included our customer to complete user acceptance testing which i understand is also moving forward smoothly we will begin the final migration of all production data starting at pm on th the entire system will be down from that point until th at am when we go live from our data center we will be hosting a in the public assembly room on at pm regarding this move new projects dexter development this project is the development of the dexter integration engine components required to facilitate the data exchanges identified as critical for the core go live which will be the components will be designed and developed per the requirements gathered and documented in the above completed project mobile device management pilot is working to execute a mobile device management platform pilot using the application this application will provide with a to manage wireless devices with greater security and enhanced efficiency as well as providing a better user experience additional comments definition explanation on th we experienced technical issues that affected much of the enterprise while this incident was not an outage of service it did result in some users not being able to access to internet while others experienced more significant issues using their computers the issues primarily affected those users remaining on windows or applications still running on a windows servers to explain the incident we receive a nightly update from for and protection the update that we received during the evening of th introduced these issues into our environment it was not just the that experienced these issues but many based organizations our technical engineers worked closely with to resolve the issue as quickly as was possible on that day as a reminder to all should this incident had been an outage we have redundancies and business continuity plans in place to resolve with our new site operational we will be further increasing our redundancies as well as providing greater business continuity offerings we understand that mission critical business operations such as public safety systems need to continue

dexter development conversion to odyssey tablet pilot enterprise private email upgrade mobile device management pilot redesign implemented into this module includes an interface for cash management this project will define the service catalog and design the new model for applications within the enterprise the new model will utilize consumption data and provide more pricing for customers in physical host migration to the physical server equipment for the system will be moving from its current location in ma back to the floor data center in the building benefits of this migration will be alleviating system performance issues and a cost reduction associated with the system system the project has three major components network devices at intersections and in the data center fiber optic cable under city streets and traffic signal monitoring software the network will be supported by and the estimated project completion date has been revised to false alarm tracking reporting develop a new application to replace the legacy application developed in vb to track monitor and report on false alarm runs add the functionality necessary to allow to track their false alarm runs as well accurate tracking and reporting of these runs could result in significant revenue for the respective departments this project will be deployed in multiple iterations using the agile methodology
