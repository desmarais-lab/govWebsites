implementation resource utilization moss and enterprise implementation phase mainframe hosting with state processes to ensure we are ready to launch the implementation of the core phase in late the scope of this phase includes the implementation of general ledger procurement and the scope of this phase includes the administration pension and payroll resource utilization study the superior court seeks to undertake a thorough documentation of the system source code use cases operational aspects and reports generated the purpose of this comprehensive study is twofold drive increased efficiency via the rightsizing of mainframe resource utilization and output creation and to provide information gaps on transitioning data to the state supreme courts statewide system the enhancements have been broken out into three phases phase includes the solution and retirement of phase includes online access for the public of documents and phase includes the digital plan review software mainframe hosting with state of this project originally conceived in early will leverage existing budgetary resources to transition current mainframe hosting activities to a model with the state of hosting transition will result in significant shared benefits across governments while specifically furthering strategic goals of simplifying service provision via the consolidation of agreements delivering increased cost savings and accelerating transition from the increasingly expensive to mainframe platform moss enterprise the purpose of this project is to leverage our investment in moss technology we will accomplish public safety integrated regional info system iris that leverage in two ways first we have engaged apparatus to manage our moss services second we will work with apparatus to deploy to the enterprise in phases with enterprise and portals processes impacting single and the association of static addressing the project is focused primarily on enabling field reporting and is not meant to provide sufficient redundancy to completely mitigate current operational risks stemming from vehicle radio modems future enhancements will include the implementation of a new wide area network configuration to enable of internet connectivity an additional longterm benefit of this project is to better position to swiftly adopt emerging connectivity solutions and similar miles tones is refresh desktops refresh desktops refresh laptops due to recent process changes in the ordering of equipment there is a possibility that the and refreshes not complete on time once we receive delivery notification from dell we will be able to report on any future that be a result from the process change phase ii application testing complete changes to data are in process with final testing to follow phase i phase ii phase i and ii implementations have been impacted by the upgrade resources required for both have been working diligently on the upgrade project as that project has faced critical issues in addition phase i introduces changes to the environments that could negatively impact the upgrade project if phase i were pushed into production prior to the upgrade completed user training business licensing user testing started upgrade implementation business licensing user testing completed business licensing implementation for the upgrade has encountered many critical issues
