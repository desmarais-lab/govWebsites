sword tom turner randy young guests group communications beth and consulting group laura and bill business technology the chairman called the it board meeting to order at am the chairman asked for approval of the it board minutes a motion was made seconded and passed unanimously status introduced the discussion stating that the purpose was to give a high level review of the project review the business case and discuss funding options briefly discussed the history of the project to date and reviewed the first several slides of the presentation he stated that one of the items learned during the review of the statewide case management system project was that the earliest that county would have the opportunity to implement the system would be three to five years for civil only once that was understood it was important to review other interim solutions since changes to the system had been put on hold since he further stated that one of the most exciting possibilities for the project to him was the opportunity for both the civil and criminal sides i and ii of the system to communicate came forward to discuss the next slides regarding some of the technical aspects of the project he began by stating that several people had asked why the solution to move to net had not been pursued prior to this point the answer is that the tools to port the application to the net environment have just become available reviewed the ultimate projects goals to reuse business critical legacy functionality retain critical data and provide information to other applications more readily in response to a question from at the last it board meeting also reviewed a slide that discussed more details about the net technology itself he pointed out that putting into the net environment does not automatically mean that the application will be on the web additionally the reporting services that will be used for the project will allow county to leverage the statewide reporting services moving to net creates the option of making system a module within the statewide this is actively being explored by finally the project would have an improved ability to integrate with existing and future systems which will exist in the net environment presented the it personnel resources needed for the project as well as the proposed schedule for the project he clarified in response to a board question that the personnel for this project are different than the personnel needed for the tax bill modifications and for property system then presented the concept that this project has two major components the first component is creating and the second a longterm enterprise need for a completely separate test and development network environment this separate environment can then be used for other new application development one example would be a new property system described several slides which graphically represented the current and proposed environments and the benefits of the separate test and development concept he reviewed the process for putting the business case together including the collaboration with associates and the agency stakeholders slides detailed the development cost included in the current contract with no additional cost based on the current scope of work and an assumption on the amount of work the current system might need hardware and software license costs for the component and infrastructure costs for the enterprise wide test and development environment and disaster recovery and addressed several questions from the board regarding schedule the contract cost comparisons between moving to a net environment for versus continuing on the mainframe platform and interfaces between and other systems the jail information management system for clarification currently accounts for of the mainframe activity the reduction will allow other users to do more or allow for a smaller mainframe which could also result in cost savings stated that one of the things considered was to make sure we are not paying for latent capacity and that has been involved in the consideration of the impact on the mainframe he pointed out the slide that shows that the costs for continuing on the mainframe system continue to go up while the costs to change to are predicted to level out after the initial investment the cost to continue on the current system is predicted to be roughly five times the ongoing cost for and discussed financing options researched for the project including looking at no interest loans from hardware vendors board members recommended soliciting local banks and the bond bank for additional financing options asked if is looking at transferring other applications to a net environment and considering this as the standard stated that is moving in this direction for example it is anticipated that the property system project would be on net might fall back on mainframe systems but not on client server since it is more expensive to support client server than net commented that he would support that direction asked if once in production this would impose restructuring obligations on existing applications that are functioning today with stated the interfaces have been reviewed and the target systems should not need to change as long as they coexist with the mainframe he commented that even with package software there is a need for a test development and production environment asked if there are other net projects within city county government that are in test and development or production nelson offered that several net projects are either in production or test and development and major meadows added that the courts and have net applications either in production or being developed major meadows said he believed that what they were waiting on was the test and development environment to be established confirmed the hardware is current and has planned for future configuration requested the security of the net be addressed discussed products and the potential of hackers he stated the security on this particular project would be at every level it will be as secure as any other application it will be possible to test security prior to production asked if there would be a greater demand on bandwidth stated that it would create more demand on the bandwidth because it will facilitate more solutions has planned for increasing the bandwidth asked about experience with net projects he wants to make sure that the right people tools schedule and costs are in place given the experience and delays with the project and the two million dollar investment that entail respectfully submitted the issues were more with scope than tools the definition of the project he believes that the scope of is very defined stated that the hardware and software costs have been carefully researched he expressed confidence in ability ms commented that she and staff from the courts have been very involved in this process and that she is confident that the homework has been done she stated the parties involved have adequately researched the product her confidence is expressed by offering funds from the clerks perpetuation fund to move the project forward she acknowledged that risk exists but stated that there is also risk in not moving forward the benefit this project brings to the courts and the clerk outweighs the risk ms also expressed appreciation and confidence in abilities judge miller spoke on behalf of the courts he stated that this is the right project being brought before the it board at the right time and at the right price with the right people judge miller continued that the courts are very much in favor of the project and that it needs to move quickly also expressed support for moving forward stated that board approval was needed for establishing the test and development environment and for procuring the software and hardware necessary a motion was made by and seconded by ms enders to authorize the approval to proceed with establishing the test and development environment including establishing any necessary contracts and procuring the software and hardware discussion ensued regarding the exact steps including giving authority to procure the equipment and network connectivity continued that this project be reviewed after each and every phase it can be stopped at any phase ms enders commented that this project is an opportunity for and to move the environment to be leading edge not bleeding edge out of the dark ages with some risk and that she is pleased with the phased schedule and the manner in which is moving forward clarified that the amounts being discussed from the previous slide are for the test and development hardware and for the test and development network environment the total expenditure over three years would be approximately million but the expenditure for the test and development environment is as above ms confirmed that she has approximately from the perpetuation fund which can be put towards the expenditures ms pointed out that enhanced access funding might also be available it was determined that as long as financing is obtained the character three budget will be sufficient as long as it is charged back to the appropriate agencies as discussed above commented that it is unusual in this sort of project to see how clearly it covers its costs in this case in three years the motion was passed unanimously search update meadows shared the progress of the subcommittee the applicants for the position have been narrowed down to deliverables status ms presented the status on deliverables and recommended a performance improvement plan they are behind on a couple of service levels although this is somewhat balanced by the understanding that two initiatives not in the current agreement were added thought these two added initiatives were important in building and maintaining a working relationship stated the service level report indicates that levels for this month exceed prior months a new tool has been implemented and there is an expected learning curve added the transition is ongoing estimated months the vendor and continue to work through problems and initiatives commented the contract allows for fines in the event service levels are missed the deliverables were included in the contract for a reason he continued he was not interested in enforcing those penalties however he wants to make sure we are getting the services we are paying for he recommended the level of detail on the monthly report be increased resolution to approve wiring standards a motion was made to approve the adoption of a standard and uniform approach to the planning and installation of wiring for voice and data the motion was seconded and passed unanimously resolution to approve disbursal of enhanced access funds a motion was made to approve resolution the disbursal of enhanced access funds the motion was seconded and passed unanimously executive expenses board approval of travel for and deputies board approval of executive reimbursements stated that the changes he is proposing in travel approval and reimbursement are similar to what was required at the bond bank he stated they will allow for better control and protection for the employees judge miller asked if had money budgeted for travel and if so how much ms stated travel budget is substantial however it was approved by council ms the was asked the amount of the travel budget and replied that she believes it to be approximately noted that much of this budget is used for training of technical staff the members asked if there were a particular reason to require approval for travel to come through the board chairman at this time noted that it did not seem to make sense for the board to approve a plane ticket for the if the had the authority to approve contracts up to without board approval ms noted that currently expenditures are processed through the county auditors office and are subject to review a motion was made and seconded the motion failed for lack of majority the chairman adjourned the it board meeting at the next scheduled it board meeting is at am in room resolution to approve disbursal of enhanced access funds whereas a calculation error related to property taxes requires programming changes in the property system and whereas the corrective action will require the commitment of programming hours to complete at a cost not to exceed and whereas discussion by the enhanced access review committee determined the best means of offsetting these costs was a disbursement of funds from the enhanced access fund and this recommendation was unanimously approved now therefore be it resolved the information technology board authorizes the county treasurer to disburse an amount not to exceed from the enhanced access fund to cover costs associated with the issuance of corrected property tax bills tabulation form term contract for temporary service personnel department information service agency department contact chuck budgetary estimate bid opening

budgeted does not include pass through charges for both years it does however include the cost for maintenance and support in the contractual dollars allocated for application development included maintenance support along new development this breakdown was for maintenance and support and for new development for prior to the split was more for maintenance and support and for new development based on the chart above there is a contract savings of for year to date and based on this trend we are projecting a contract savings of approximately by the end of calendar year county dollars budgeted hours the chart above shows the hours and dollars budgeted for the city and county for application maintenance and support we currently should be at for both the city and county budget at the end of we need to monitor and prioritize our projects and enhancements so that funding is still available for support through out this year based on current spending trends the county will exceed its budget for application maintenance support by outsourcing update in evaluating performance there are two types of items to measure milestones these are onetime improvements that make our environment more productive single capability of the milestones were either late or of such quality that they could not be accepted as part of an improvement plan has provided feedback to and has asked for a day plan to fix ten milestones in addition has been trying to meet the milestones with operations staff although there was a commitment to bring in corporate expertise one of the reasons was selected has asked to provide resources to work on milestone deliverables to improve the quality and allow staff to focus operations service levels these are ongoing performance measurements such as availability of mainframe and servers there are service level requirements in the contract currently only of the are being reported of these meet the contractual requirements for the first four months of this year volumes such as calls to the help desk were lower than in past years since retained much of the staff this should have resulted in stable performance there are three differences between last year and this year has a new management team they have brought in new tools to manage measure and improve performance and there have been milestone projects due during this period the new tools are designed for specific purposes one for ticketing one for asset management one for response time management and these are not fully operational hypothesis is that will continue to have difficulties meeting service level requirements until the tools are fully operational staff is spending time getting them online and experiencing a learning curve which contributes to the problem has requested a root cause analysis of the tool problems as well as a plan and for fixing the problems in addition has also requested that assign more resources both to milestone development and operations staff so that service levels can be met in the meantime is retaining the right to charge credits in the future but banking the current credits for the time being until the time when reporting is functional will not have the necessary tools to completely manage performance it is crucial that the tool issues be resolved as soon as possible which is why has asked for an analysis of the problem and a quick resolution operations through the month of continued to expand the help desk tool set and the lex asset management tool the feature was added to allows end users to submit and monitor status of their help desk tickets from their desktops it is also the method to gather end user satisfaction with it services the facility will be extended to all users of information technology technical expertise was primarily to provide implementation assistance for and to provide technical training in addition to the added features and education is undertaking a ticket quality review to ensure the product is being used efficiently and tickets are being routed properly in conjunction with has continued to improve the accuracy of the asset data the effort has shifted from identifying how many assets are on the network to the identification of the department to which the asset is assigned identification of the software operating on each desktop asset and its associated licensing information is also being pursued this team has many more weeks of data cleaning to improve the accuracy before the benefits of the lex asset management system will be utilized hp is a product to sample the health of all devices and send reports for technical staff review this product has been installed on the network and is monitoring network and server events on a proactive basis the technical staff is installing agents on the critical applications to perform response time monitoring the full benefits of this product will be realized in the when the response time service level requirements are enabled help desk statistics for the month of are as follows total calls for the month total calls answered total calls abandoned abandoned calls seconds abandoned calls seconds average speed to answer seconds performance answered is performance abandoned over sec is the help desk focus during was on quality standards updating documentation and training staff members the help desk team answered more calls than in vs with fewer abandoned calls than in vs performance also increased vs and vs additional training for users was also accomplished successfully continues to improve the response to severity and problems but is still falling below the service level an analysis has been made and improvement should be forthcoming service area application services had another very good month in terms of ticket processing and service level requirements they hit of the problem ticket response and resolution requirements for the third consecutive month in addition they met the proposal turnaround requirement
