customer survey leadership comments city of satisfaction survey write in comments optional question area i have been very happy with the level of support from when i have a need they have proven to be true business partners keep the users informed as much as possible about what be on the horizon i believe that should develop an introduction to program that brings agency representatives such as myself up to speed on services i have been involved for several years and for the most part technically savvy but there are procedures and initiatives that surface periodically that have been here all along that i know existed not sure if the disconnect is an assumption that everyone should know the in and outs of services or that the information is not making it to the agency representatives and users we need more vision and less keep the lights on stuff going on that just meets contractual obligations at some point we will be so far behind that it will be a major migration with a lot of pain has always been very helpful to me when i it issues they have always been extremely courteous and very professional as a lay person with all of the evolving technologies it is difficult to identify all of possibilities out there that might apply to your operation when technologies are brought up by me is extremely helpful to assess the technology but that is reactive as a partner knowing my organization identifying cost effective or possibly more efficient options and presenting them to us would be very beneficial customer survey services comments city of satisfaction survey write in comments optional question area education on the nuts and bolts of what can provide to the everyday user of the systems every time i have placed a call or request i have had immediate professional and exceptional work performed i have only had one situation where i have had to call back times every other call has been truly exceptional thank you for all you do could be more involved in helping agencies move in the right direction with technology advising of issues and sharing technical expertise understanding the need and how equipment is going to be used should be more involved in the purchasing process so the right type of equipment is bought to accomplish the functions and work with other equipment so often problems come up after the purchase has been made causing problems that could have been avoided in most cases many of the people in work hard to meet our needs the heavy bureaucracy costs too much money and is not tuned in to the majority of users needs services are to expensive and take to long to provide customer survey customer service comments city of satisfaction survey write in comments optional question area i have noticed an increase in on support requests over the course of and am pleased with the increased attention to problems and their solutions the difficulty now is knowing when to contact specific project personnel versus help much much improved over the last years customer survey overall comments city of satisfaction survey write in comments optional question area even though i think needs improvement i still do not want it outsourced further contractors tend to be worse there just needs to be improvements made leadership needs to be addressed first then improvements in services and customer service should naturally follow i asked others on my floor if they completed this survey and if not if they were going to complete it several said no therefore to supplement this i believe some focus groups desperately need to be conducted thankful of having it provide service and every time i call they listen first and provide or will do the work with me watching and are always courteous and will stay on the phone with you until you are up running and ready to proceed that i like there is no option of escalation of issues other than knowing who to contact which can be quite difficult at times not only for me but also for the analysts i contact individuals directly which i know is wrong however my confidence that it will be routed properly through is extremely low there need to be a service mapping guide published
