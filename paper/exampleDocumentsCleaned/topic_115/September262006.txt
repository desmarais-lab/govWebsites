constraints as far as the budget is concerned but judge young would prefer as a board and enterprise projects stay within the net platform whenever possible and not let an opportunity getting away from the enterprise if the public defender budget is constrained the board needs to look at funding the request and repay ourselves out of subsequent funds judge young continued that he is not against

most palatable as far as technology integration into future systems ms public defender office explained that the systems ability to pick up stuff from beginning with the time of arrest however it is not critical it is more critical that there be no integration from the public defenders system should information be leaked the individual involved would be before the disciplinary commission ms

has a product that meets the need the agency looked at the product went through the screens looked at the data being selected and with a few exceptions the core of what is needed is there discussed the importance of import and export possibilities and suggested in a timely manner at reasonable cost provide for integration of that would help with work and clients maintenance inventories data recovery when data is locked memory and so on not questioning need for security and or rights of the clients within system commented that he did not believe adequate information was at hand today about the technical aspects of data exchange or crisis of additionally the board would not be doing work in the usual way if not given a presentation from someone that has walked through all the information ms responded that the criminal justice community has been crisis mode the last couple of months much effort has been given in several years to get pay increases for public defenders increase staffing and it is incumbent upon the it board to take part in the very quick steps ms continued that an executive order recently was given to open night court agencies are acting in an unusual way because progress needs to be made the public defenders office is much a critical part of that as much as any agency here and it is unbelievable the agency can move as many cases as they do

items the met with the project manager to discuss a focused approach to working with the customer to gain a better understanding of the goals of the mac as an agency so the technology can support that mission a list of preliminary questions was created as well as initial tasks matching those tasks up with an end result the customer will understand managing customer expectations will be extremely important for all parties the perception of progress by one group vs another needs to be unified the mac it team will meet to discuss the preliminary list of customer questions and initial tasks to gather additional feedback this list should be finalized and sent to the customer in preparation of a report enterprise deployment the automated mapping engine will allow users to create a high cartographic quality map without the need for desktop software to be installed the application has been designed with a nontechnical user in mind and will simplify the process of creating maps this application will be available to users on the only users will be able to select from a set of predefined datasets to be mapped on top of a base set of map layers the user will be able to further refine the data to be displayed by specifying an attribute filter to be applied a geographic region such as a township council district or neighborhood organization boundary and a date range the user will be able to specify the size and orientation for the map the application will then create a pdf format file of the map in question and ship it to the user phase i is available for use at the following address the is being developed and deployed in phases functionality included in phase i is described above phase ii will add the following the ability to save map definitions for repeated use the ability to subscribe to receive a map based upon a saved definition on a regular basis via email this map would of course contain current data such as all citizen calls to the mac within the past month reporting capabilities so that a tabular report could be included in your map subscription complete resolution of identified issues and continue testing continue working with users to identify strengths and shortcomings of the application and to continue expanding its utilization modified map templates and available layers based upon user feedback resolved all phase i issues and deployed fixes to production installed phase ii into the test environment and began testing plan to demo at councils administration and finance committee on th mayors office developer report this project will involve the creation of a new public internet application entitled is envisioned to become a single source of information related to a citizens surroundings preliminary plans are to consider the following types of items for inclusion elected officials trash collection day zoning flood zone and land use information crime statistics school choices including charters libraries police fire facilities post offices neighborhood associations etc in addition to listing each of these items for a given address and providing more detailed information about each subject later phases of also include the ability to provide citizens with directions from their address to the location of interest the team will be creating this application using a portal approach that will allow us to utilize a common framework to which we can easily add additional functionality piece by piece without redeploying the entire this application is closely tied another report item migration and development as all of the actual processes employed by are performed by these software integration initial projections are to have the first phase of this project available late this begin documenting data requirements and the corresponding maintenance responsibilities begin design requirements documents for each of the new that will be created to perform the work of this portal additionally begin defining enhancements to the existing that will also be utilized documented data requirements continued creation of design documents none complete design documents begin initial development enterprise the software integration chaired by rick powers was created at the request of the mayors office to assess the feasibility of using automation as an enterprise application report migration and development begin planning next visit which includes meeting with health hospital to facilitate their request for a quote as well as an additional demo meeting with to discuss business requirements demo to cover licensing and cashiering meeting with of to begin the process to finalize the sow worked with and made a decision to postpone visit to better prepare will now be making two visits one to meet with one to meet with separately the meeting will occur first likely mid a date for the visit has not been set worked with health hospital and as a middleman to put the two organizations in touch to discuss a possible migration of health hospital to automation the purchase of automation has not officially made it into the budget this purchase is required to meet the goals set forth by the mayors office the scope of this project could potentially touch a large portion of the enterprise a phased approach will be key to successful implementation health hospital has recently decided to do additional research into the automation product as a possible replacement to their product their late interest and participation could impact the implementation schedule within begin planning visit which includes demo to cover licensing and cashiering meeting with of to begin the process to finalize the sow enterprise developer the team utilizes several to provide specific functionality to various applications within the enterprise the most prominent example of this is the applications are able to send an address string to the service and receive a validated and possibly corrected string back this ensures that the calling application stores a good address within its own database and alleviates the longterm problems associated with bad addresses the primary goals of this project are migrate existing to the platform and enhance them to work together more effectively create several new services that will be used by both the portal and future enterprise initiatives existing to be migrated report new to be created project initiation established project scope created the initial software requirements specification none complete review of document begin detailed specifications

assembled to improve processes success rate increases with each push migration schedule updated to account for delays in pilot lessons learned leave time between push and migration leave time between migration and major application upgrades monitor migration with resources provide clear migration instructions to engage a champion from each work with champion to ensure validation of users machines and the relationship between the two need this in advance of migration for proper planning keep all scheduling information in one place keep and desktop personnel informed on all issues and their resolutions stagger of migrations to prevent bottlenecks risks concerns issue automated scripts not resource not on site risk this requires considerable manual intervention to complete and verify migrations the level of manual intervention required is not sustainable mitigation has been asked to provide appropriate resources to finish automating the processes issue mailbox size issues risk if email size limit policy is not enforced for each migrated mailbox it will cause failure for the migration of that user mitigation is working with customers to enforce the email size limit policy issue misidentification of machines and users for a particular agency risk this could result in machines being migrated when their users are not or mitigation working with our customers need to ensure that all desktops and laptops that are to be migrated are identified and accounted for in the project plan and associated with the correct and user issue additional machines that need to be migrated exist that have not yet been identified risk this could result in machines not being migrated when needed by their users mitigation working with our customers need to ensure that all desktops and laptops that are to be migrated are identified and accounted for in the project plan issue data center health risk this could lead to down time in the data center if it is not fixed mitigation working with to improve various aspects of the data center temperature electrical etc issue need to complete application testing with risk need to test applications prior to the migration to validate that they work with mitigation test the applications that have not already been tested in a lab environment prior to the migration net update development is an iterative process extracted code every time there is a
