the report as follows good morning board members the team closed out one project in the month of refresh we finished the remaining machines to complete the refresh in the past month i want to thank the team for all of their work on this project i want to take a moment and remind everyone of the plan for this year regarding refresh due to budget challenges this year we have suspended the refresh for one year this was not an easy decision but one that makes sound business sense for let me be clear also that while we have made the decision not to refresh this year we are not ending the refresh program it is my intent to continue next year with the replacement of the machines that were scheduled to be replaced this year i also want to be clear that as we experience failures new business needs etc we will acquire equipment as necessary we have heard from numerous customers that were disappointed by the news of the program suspension and i wanted to make sure they hear that this program is still important to and the enterprise going forward there are two projects that remained yellow from last month and we have moved a third project to yellow status building network refresh this project is back on track and we expect it to finish up at the end of we had a successful pilot of the third floor of the building and have begun the scheduling of floors to ensure project success customer satisfaction program as discussed last month we extended the survey period which is now closed and i want to thank this board for their assistance in encouraging their teams to complete the survey results we will be meeting later this week to discuss the results and look at ways we can improve our services to the customers we plan to share the results with this board in if possible implementation phase even though we are not doing a formal update i felt it is important that we discuss a possible delay in the phase as we continue to stabilize and get used to the new we continue to face challenges with the system itself and the comfort level of the enterprise departments there were two meetings over the last couple of weeks with both the steering and executive committees for this project and there have been a number of concerns raised with an implementation of this magnitude there are always challenges and with the aggressive schedule we have tried to maintain we have pushed our project team and the customer base potentially to its limits our customers have expressed concerns with starting phase while still working through the issues with phase we have heard their concerns and are working to identify all of the known problems and to categorize them into three different categories so that we understand what the real issues are the categories are system this is an actual issue and something is broke our partners at will work with us to prioritize and ensure these are quickly resolved training with a system of this magnitude and all of the processes and procedures that change with it we need to identify what issues are training related and determine how we address these challenges on an enterprise and individual level change issues these are categorized by items that we decide that we like or it really do what we thought it would etc the need for new reports new views etc once we know definitively what we are dealing with we will prioritize and put a plan together to address the issues we will also be looking at the phase schedule and pieces to determine if there are options to postpone items that are not critical into next year or beyond i think it is also important to note that in the original schedule for st we had months between go live and the kickoff for phase with the delay until st this gap shrunk from months to in hindsight this was probably more aggressive than the team could handle so we will need to evaluate how to deal with this going forward the full project team will be working hard over the next couple of weeks to find the best options in dealing with the challenges we face now and going forward as we make progress we will be updating this board and i would expect that we will have hood on the agenda next month to discuss in detail our findings ongoing projects include two that i want to mention data center refresh we are working with our partners in building authority and to identify a plan to address of the issues of our plus year old data center to ensure that we are prepared to handle the needs of enterprise for years to come over the next few months we will be looking at what
