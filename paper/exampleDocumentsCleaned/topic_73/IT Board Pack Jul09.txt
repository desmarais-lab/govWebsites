strategy review presentation started the presentation by discussing the background currently the service providers are and and a legacy frame relay for remote locations that is coming to the end of life and will need to be moved off on to a new technology soon voice service is currently delivered over approximately half of the frame relay sites so we use voice over broadband and high speed connections are in use at other remote locations like the parks and fire stations ring technology is used to provide highly reliable backbone to our hosting sites which is post rd city county building and henry street stated the strategic objectives going forward are to replace frame relay technology find a technology that provides scalability and support network intensive applications improve manageability by consolidating on fewer technologies formalizing service level requirements significantly lower overall costs and improving the ability to track and report costs asked about the objective to significantly lower overall costs and asked for more explanation stated we are currently spending about a year on these services and we are looking at a cost reduction of about baker added that they are looking at a month savings ms asked if we have looked at wan acceleration said they had looked but it a priority and agreed to see if it made sense to do it at the same time ms white asked how many locations did we have connected to the network and stated approximately frame relay and another on the high speed with with and with ms white also asked if adding new fire stations will affect pricing baker said they are currently looking at locking in pricing for additional sites in the contract negotiations stated that they will continue to use for high bandwidth sites which are mg to gig per second and plan to implement for lower bandwidth sites which are mg to mg he continued by saying they will replace the ring with circuits which will allow them to achieve service level agreements targeting high said the next steps will be to complete site surveys by present the proposal at the next it board meeting on execute the contract and begin the migration by early with implementation to be completed by the end of the year ms white asked what the contract process has been baker stated that an went out last year and receive proposals that would lead to the kind of change they were looking for so they worked with the current vendor to drive new solutions and new technologies and upgraded their service which will lead to a longer contract of to year range project manager and curt presented the property system replacement presentation stated that the number one priority was to get the reconciliation tax bills out which started th went in to production last week and is accessing which allowed us to have enhanced access to allow public to access property information response time issues were resolved by putting into production a replication data base stated that of requirements have been completed and or tickets have been resolved asked why only requirements have been completed when we are this far along in the project said that was coming up stated the challenges of this project were the reconciliation tax bill initiative and it was much more complex than initially thought interface required more effort than planned as did the response time remediation response time remediation was also causing a delay so the schedule and many of the project milestones became outdated thanked mike darling curt and for putting forth so much effort asked if this answered question and suggested he rephrase the question he just thought it odd that you could be using a system and it has only met of the requirements said some of the pieces are in place and being used but been signed off on suggested that a listing of what the requirements are and which office is still waiting on them baker stated that its that is signed off on and i think what you would find out is what we have done putting the core of the system up that while there be requirements that been signed off on but it mean there was no progress those requirements it take another hrs hrs or another hrs to actually complete and checkoff that requirement and sign off on it said that of the requirements left there are maybe of them have a resolution for it but had the time to test or we tested and it needs more tweaking stated that the next steps are to define remaining requirements in to two categories and develop a detailed plan he said the plan will target completion of all required functionality in and completion of remaining contractual requirements in st and then we will need to have the contract amended to accommodate the new and approach stated that one of the biggest components of getting this signed off on is if the user is happy he continued by stating that the user still needs time to test use it while continuing to process the regular business of the county we do need to revise our supervisory special demo nelson and mark wood presented the supervisory special demo presentation mark began the presentation by stating that when baker came on as the he came to him and asked if there was anything he could do for him and i told him i needed help on getting supervisory special focused so we can finish this project he and did that and it is now completed nelson introduced the team members and thanked them for being the best nelson gave a brief history that begins in by saying there have been multiple versions of supervisory special released for testing but because of staffing changes and navigation and flexibility problems with the program it was decided in of to totally redesign the user interface the current version was released in of and a pilot team was trained and the pilot began in of nelson stated that the objectives were to improve the reporting process by making it easy to use with an intuitive user interface reduce the time required from creation to approval and finalization of the report and eliminate duplication in data entry increase accuracy and readability of reports nelson said they also wanted to provide a single repository of all reports that would support search capabilities to would also provide quick data summary queries nelson explained a flow chart of the application and approval flow nelson then signed in the program and did a demonstration of actual data entry which showed the resulting final report ready for submission for approval thanked everyone involved ms ruby stated it might be nice to do a cost benefit how much time and cost it used to take versus the cost of the application for a payoff said he wanted to thank everyone involved especially victor ray for helping the offices of the
