amended vote rules and public policy committee the rules and public policy committee of the council met on chairman called the meeting to order at pm with the following members present gray angel and bob and sanders arrived shortly thereafter was absent general counsel and chief financial officer represented council staff and were also in chairman asked committee members to introduce themselves and indicate which portion of the county they represent review recommendations for civil taxing units provided three handouts and stated that the actual action taken by the council will be on exhibits a and attached to these minutes which are the budget and levy review forms the third handout is a spreadsheet to help look at the data on one document he thanked office of finance and management for preparing the review forms he explained each form with proposed budgets and approved levies by the department of local government finance he said that the third column includes the recommended review amount he reviewed the information for the city of beech grove and stated that in looking at the levy to recommend they looked at the levy proposed by beech grove and the local option income tax piece and if it was below the maximum levy in they added back half the amount below that levy as a levy growth is permitted in and the maximum levy is then recommended in the third column he said that they did this for each of the local units if they reduced a proposed levy that levy reduction was prorated in those funds and they did not change the debt service funds because those are outside of the freeze he noted that there is no recommendation for the town of because they did not submit a budget and missed the deadline with the state requirements therefore they will have the same budget next year he added that this is a review but the council is required by state law to make these recommendations to the he said that a resolution will be introduced evening as proposal no for the council to act on these recommendations chairman asked why the council does this said that the county councils are required by state statute to do a review if they do not do this the could rule that county then does not have a budget for next year he said that it was intended he believes to be an exercise in bringing the proposed levies and budgets for all entities in the county to the forefront however there are some other units of government not included such as schools asked if there might be some incentive for a government unit not to submit a budget if there are declining assessed valuations in order to stay at the numbers responded in the negative and said that if a unit does not submit a budget they would revert back to their tax rate and levy and if the assessed value goes down their levy goes down and they lose the benefit of the growth they would then need an additional appropriation in to change their asked if the variation in among funds is due to different boundary lines in each township said that it is more due to some townships still having their own fire departments versus those which have merged with the fire department he said that in the areas outside of the fire funds have a smaller av asked specifically about township said that in this case did not extend into all of township and therefore is just a portion of the av clerks note sanders and arrived at pm chairman asked if the total fire for township would be said that looking also at the firefighting fund which is almost at the sum of those would be about chairman asked if township would be about pike township at and township at responded in the affirmative but said that is what township is proposing but the review cuts it to chairman said that is significantly higher than the other townships responded in the affirmative gray asked why township is so much higher said that this happened some time ago township used to be a volunteer fire department and they have done some appeals for levy increases to fund the fire department and it has happened over time chairman asked what fire rate is said that it is around chairman stated that as a matter of full disclosure he will be abstaining from voting on this recommendation to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest because he represents the town of in his private practice moved seconded by to accept the review recommendation as presented by the motion carried by a vote of with abstaining said that proposal no will be on the agenda evening under special resolutions to be voted on approving these recommendations he said that the proposal has not yet been introduced before the full council and therefore can be voted on the same night it is introduced chairman asked what would happen if they do not approve the proposal said that they risk the possibility of reverting to this years budget for sanders asked if the council does not have until the adoption of the budget to act on this recommendation said that they do not he said that according to statute they have days after the civil taxing units budgets are submitted to make a recommendation he said that they are running very close to that time limit by approving it at council meeting he said that the alternative is that if they do not do it they run the risk of not having the budget approved sanders said that it seems a high risk for something that is non binding chairman said that he has suggested to members of the legislature that if there are such consequences it needs to be binding gray said that this action then is simply an exercise in futility chairman said that the unit of government is made aware of the recommendation and they could take a look at that and voluntarily change their numbers he said that they can always hope for this type of result pat vice president of the county alliance of neighborhood associations said that the recommended version seems to have a different av said that he used the av numbers certified by the county auditor ms asked if this is then the final number said that it should be ms noted that the av for township seems to be the highest fraction off of the recommended av and this play into the final tax rate for the county proposal no appoints to the common construction wage committee for township chairman stated that he received a call from expressing his regret that he had a prior engagement and could not attend this evenings meeting moved seconded by to postpone proposal no until the motion proposal no approves and authorizes the execution of a concession agreement to grant a concessionaire the right to operate maintain and improve the metered parking system of the city of and amends the code to provide for among other things new metered parking zones hours of operation and rates for the metered parking system in accordance with the provisions set forth in such concession agreement chairman stated that as indicated on the publicized meeting notice and agenda he does not anticipate taking a final vote on the proposal this evening he said that it was left on the agenda because he received a call from sanders indicating that a gentleman was coming from out of town to provide public testimony on the matter sanders asked if she had not called if the proposal would not then have been on the agenda chairman said that he would still have left it on the agenda for discussion among council members or additional information from staff former resident of who now resides in stated that he has written about this issue on his and in letters to the editor he said that he does not feel it is an appropriate transaction for three reasons parking meters are a poor candidate for a longterm lease the contract is not favorable to the city and the financial arrangements are not as optimal as they could be he said that he is not opposed to privatization as he believes the toll road and the recent water transaction are good deals for citizens however he said that parking meters are different and are not traditionally a revenue raising mechanism or a city service parking meters are an urban planning tool that cities use to optimize precious curbside use to help the retail health of a community he said that a city needs to be able to respond dynamically to market conditions and a longterm deal limits the response to business conditions he said that there is not much else the city could do with a toll road or water pipes but parking spots are more of a general purpose real estate and a component of the most important public space these parking spaces could potentially be used for non parking uses in the future such as landscaping or a sidewalk or something not even envisioned yet said that because the vendor wants certainties they write those into the contract with significant penalties for change which limits the flexibility he said that if the committee thinks about the state of the city in they could never have known what city challenges would be facing today he said in was still a segregated city it is difficult to predict the future and such a longterm deal is not a good approach he said he does feel involving the vendor in management would be good and he does give the administration credit for learning some lessons from the similar deal done recently in such as not taking all the money up front and waiting to raise rates until after the meters are upgraded he said that the deal is however still heavily based on the template he said that the deal is known to be very in favor of the vendor and bad for the public he said that the contract cannot be terminated for years unless the vendor defaults and the city cannot simply cancel the contract because they decide the deal is not in the best interest of citizens he added that fees from temporarily bagging the meters could potentially exceed collections he said that there is also an obligation for implementing permit parking programs which should be under the authority of the council he said that the contract still needs a significant amount of work and more financial due diligence needs to be done on the deal he said that structured their deal on bids but the way the process was handled in the winning bid was not the most financially aggressive bidder he said that while the request for qualifications can produce some creative ideas it is not a traditional bid process and not necessarily the best financial approach he said that this is not like a toll road style lease but is more of a loan where million plus some capital investment is being fronted to the city in return for downstream revenue which is essentially like paying interest however the city has a much higher credit rating than the vendor and has the capacity to issue tax exempt bonds the city is a low risk borrower who does not pay taxes unlike the vendor he said that they are essentially giving up an asset with up to billion in revenues for million he said that the council needs to look harder at this transaction and realize that this deal is not a good candidate from a policy perspective the plan for modernization and their decision to finally raise rates which is overdue are good ideas but they need to find a better more flexible mechanism to accomplish these goals asked who he is representing from said that he is not representing any organization but is simply a former resident who now lives in he said that he saw the consequences from a similar deal in and felt compelled to speak out he said that he maintains a and usually just relays his thoughts and suggestions through that medium but felt compelled to come and speak in person stated that he reads and appreciates many of the issues he raises he asked to share some of his background and how he came to be someone who would analyze issues such as this for those who be watching but are not familiar with his said that he works for a management consulting business that does have some competition with the chosen vendor but not directly he said that this sort of management is his expertise and while he is not a certified planner he is very versed and interested in urban planning he said that many cities cannot afford top consulting firms and he wanted to bring some analysis to the civic domain where it had not previously been present so he began writing his in as a hobby his is not done as professional media and even though he does do some speaking consulting and independent analysis he is not compensated for it he said that he tries not to take partisan stances or compromise his independence and he hopes people will judge his work on its contents and not because he represents anyone in particular clarified that is therefore not associated with a competitor or the vendor but is independently employed stated that this is correct said that stated that parking meters are not a revenue stream yet state law requires that revenue from parking meters be spent on infrastructure improvements he said that he represents broad ripple and urban planning is a hot topic in that area with envisioning sessions and many community meetings he said that he read the contract with this in mind and did not see the limitations referred to he asked what provisions in the contract limit the ability to plan communities differently years down the road said that meters do raise some revenues because they are charging for the use of the street but they are not like a tax or garbage collection fee and are not seen as a profit center to cover the cost of a particular service he said that the price is set to optimize the use of the resource and meters were installed downtown and in broad ripple to provide parking turnover for businesses where parking is at a premium he said that infrastructure is a very appropriate use for these limited revenues added that the contract is limiting in two respects if the vendor builds a garage they must implement a permit parking program but it is not specific with regard to parameters he said that broad ripple is presently thought of as a hip destination and it is difficult to envision anything happening to it but many neighborhoods that have thrived in the past are now suffering in one instance with regard to fountain square the meters were actually removed in order to stimulate business with this contract the city could not do that without paying a substantial penalty to the vendor said that he feels be misinterpreting the contract he said that he reads it to say that if they build a garage the vendor must have the capacity to provide a permit parking program and that program or not be initiated and operated he said that broad ripple supports a permit program for public safety reasons he said that he also believes that what it means today to remove meters versus what it would mean under the contract does not seem to be any different he said that if the city removes meters today they would that revenue and as he reads the contract it would be the same type of formula the city would the revenue which would be essentially doubled with the contract but he does not really see any fundamental difference said that the city would be giving up their own money because of the revenue split the vendor would be forfeiting a share of money but the city would only be forfeiting money on the revenue side and not on the cost side so if meters were removed on the street it would reduce the cost to the vendor but no cost to the city said that it would not however be a situation where the city would be writing a check to the vendor it would simply be the city receiving less revenue the city would not be paying an affirmative penalty but would simply just be recovering less said that it is a very complicated contract and as he reads it if the city takes out meters they would forfeit of their revenue but yet if a meter is removed has to be paid into the pot in expected revenues which would be split between the city and the vendor said that the council has the authority to institute or place new meters and the amount of revenue the city receives is based on whether or not the vendor feels it is an appropriate place for a meter said that there is no provision for relocating a meter if they remove five but add three there is no offsetting of revenues he said that there is some provision that if the city adds more than a certain percentage which he thinks is then the vendor has the option to analyze the addition and determine whether or not it is economically viable if the vendor determines it is not viable the city would be responsible for installing the meters and the vendor would be entitled to a reduced revenue share he said that it seems an administrative fee was intended but it is not clear why the vendor would those revenues and they would only exercise it if the meters were determined to be unprofitable said that the city would still have the ability to add meters and eliminate meters for a net zero revenue change he said that he believes the contract gives them flexibility but maybe a provision could be added to give them the first opportunity to move the meter said that he believes the council would need that specific authority and the revenue value for meters is different depending on the location he said that it seems a very complicated formula and he believes it would be a useful exercise to pro different scenarios to make the formula more explicit asked if he has thought of a better method for the city to modernize the meters and provide better management other than the normal bond issuance and paying for it over several years he said that he can only think of three times in the last few years where the city has taken notes out for large projects such as with the hotel tax increment financing hospital and for the metropolitan emergency communications agency he said that the city is clearly not trying to do that type of bonding often said that he does not have a concrete plan but there are certainly alternative ways to structure this process financially he said that there could be surplus bonds in the downtown and they should look into those who invest in privatization contracts he said that they could also explore syndicating out to pension funds which are typically big obligations with low returns he said he does not understand all the legalities but he believes modernization is a desirable thing but should do it differently than and because it is not as urgent a need at this time had an enormous budget deficit to fill and was faced with a funded municipal pension that had to become funded by the end of the year to avoid the state taking it over at great peril to the taxpayer he said modernization is desirable but there are no terrible consequences if it does not happen this year he encouraged the city policy makers not to enter into an unfavorable deal for something when there is not a sword hanging over their heads stated that it shows a huge demonstration of civic responsibility for to drive down from just to give testimony and he thanked for his willingness to do so commended the mayor and said that the plan he put together is a good one and the rates which have not been raised since are overdue but this is simply not a good transaction he thanked the committee for indulging him sanders thanked for the in depth understanding he shared in what he has written on his and in the emails shared with her in the last few weeks she said that many people in this community still feel like is representing their interests even though he lives in she said that in her communications with constituents they are five to one against the transaction but not against modernization she said that the deal is like a payday loan as it is structured now and even because they do not know what they will be paying over time because of proprietary information she said that she appreciates and others efforts to insure a good quality of life in this country regardless of where they live asked if feels that the process does not provide a more qualitative assessment than just a dollar figure and maximizing money provided up front said that using an for stage one of the process is good in order to seek creative ideas which is different than what did and provides more flexibility to pick a vendor that the city might like for criteria asked if disagrees with as financial advisors he said that there were bidders with lots of ideas creating stiff competition and this seems to serve the taxpayers better than another method said that there are some benefits to the process especially for looking at different criteria than just chairman thanked for his comments and asked deputy mayor if he would like to respond to comments responded in the affirmative and said that he has a brief presentation he would like to provide to address some of the more complex questions they have received since the last meeting said that as a matter of full disclosure he has been reading for four years almost daily and has had several discussions with through he recommended that people visit the site as there are some very conversations about this and other urban issues he added that he appreciates crediting the mayor for seeking a solution to the problem but his concerns about structure and policy are where they differ he said that he welcomes a discussion he said that he agrees that parking meters are an important urban tool that needs to remain flexible to adapt to changing times he added that the main goal of parking meters is to create on street turnover for businesses the parking rates have not been raised in years and if they wanted to truly maximize urban planning they would make it free in perpetuity but they cannot have it both ways with the increased revenue from this transaction they can accomplish more infrastructure improvements with less reliance on property taxes he said that they strongly disagree that there are extreme penalties in the contract for removing meters and the cost reflected in removing a meter is simply an acknowledgement of giving up revenue and paying back a little something for infrastructure investment he said that they would view it as a reimbursement and not a penalty he said that this transaction is very different from deal as they are not taking of the dollars up front has already spent all of their investment dollars leaving nothing for future generations conversely the mayor wanted more dollars available for future generations and therefore proposed this option stated that with regard to a broad ripple parking garage the deal is intended to be responsive to the residents and the neighborhoods would come to the council for approval who would still have to approve any such permit programs he said that while parking spaces are different from a toll road many of these spaces are taken up by visitors from outside of county and this gives the opportunity for outsiders to invest in the infrastructure yet still maintaining turnover in spaces he said that he respects and his views but disagrees with his interpretation of the contract in some aspects and citizens can see the responses to some of his concerns on he said that they still do not claim to have all the answers but believe it is a good proposal that is on the table chairman asked with regard to removing a meter if there is consideration for reimbursement to the vendor but no consideration given to adding a meter to the revenue stream said that there really is no change as the city also loses revenue today if a meter is removed he said that he disagrees with the analysis that they would still lose if they shut down two meters but add five counsel from ice miller law firm on this transaction stated that if the city removed two meters then there would be a reduction in revenue share yet if they increased meters over the they would increase the percentage of revenue and it would not qualify as a penalty he said that the vendor is also providing the city with revenue up front and a capital investment and they would need to recoup that investment through a reduction in revenue share going forward if meters are eliminated said that the city should recover the cost of shutting down those two meters in a short time depending on the utilization of added meters he said that the plan contemplates additional meters and an economic development project with meters so he believes they will eventually net more revenue based on the growth of the system sanders said that as she reads the formulas in schedule they can say there are no penalties and they can call them reimbursements or whatever they want but the present value of revenue will be lost while it not be taking money out of a pot and handing it to the concessionaire it reduces what the city gets going forward and is still a penalty said that if the concessionaire is expecting million in revenue to offset the capital investment and upfront payment then the city taking away that revenue source entitles them to some compensation sanders said that they seem to be entitled to billion according to reports said that there is no way to truly know what the revenues will be and nothing is a given sanders said that they do not know because the vendor claims their information is proprietary introduced executive director of the municipal bond bank and began a brief presentation attached as exhibit to address questions raised over the last several weeks he explained the challenges to the city modernizing the parking system on its own and explained the bond complications if the city issues its own bonds for parking and infrastructure as relayed in exhibit referred to the slide comparison between this transaction and the city issuing its own bonds and said that this does not even include the new jobs that will be bringing to the city with this deal gray said that those new jobs are not included in the contract and so if it is not in writing they cannot really include that as a valid reasoning for the deal asked if there is not some middle ground where the city can go ahead and issue the bonds and not give up their equity share but still have a contractor involved in the management of the parking system said that this is a possibility and there are other scenarios which could have been pursued but there is more financial risk to the city in most of these scenarios chairman asked if bonding this system would affect the capacity for bonding other projects in the future said that if there is a general obligation pledge on it then it would potentially affect that bonding capacity but if they are only pledging parking revenues for repayment there would be no restriction asked if the increases in rates are not reflected in the model for the city bonding scenario said that this scenario assumes the council approving rate increases periodically asked how the bond rating would be lower because there is no current stream said that bond rating agencies look at historical data not future potential for revenue asked about the general obligation bonds said that the revenues of the downtown district do not require the city to levy a tax to pay back the bonds as in general obligation bonds said that some money in the has been spent for other entities like libraries and public transportation and he asked if they could not explore changes in the state law to allow property tax to be diverted into the for such projects chairman said that this discussion is not relevant to this proposal asked which financial scenario is superior stated that from the perspective of generating revenue and from a risk standpoint this transaction is optimal over the city issuing the bonds and managing the system themselves chairman asked to finish his presentation and then the committee can ask more questions as some of the information in the presentation answer questions introduced bond bank and continued with the presentation as attached in exhibit he explained who will have oversight and control of important meter decisions and if the city will retain the ability to transform downtown he shared how this proposal might impact conventions parades and special events he further explained the difference between using an operating contract versus this concession agreement finally explained how this proposal is different from those in and and what this means for the city he said that more detailed information can be found on the website at chairman referred to the question about taking one meter out and putting another in and how that would affect revenues said that it could very easily be considered a wash said that a wash assumes the concessionaire sees the demand for the new meter as it is a different matter if they do not in that instance the city would actually fund the meter and realize a larger percentage of the revenues from that gray asked at what point this levels off and the vendor anticipates recovering the million investment said that the profit question is based on so many unknowns and they would need some time to fully figure it out he said that and their competitors have relayed that there is a to rate of return on these transactions and the annual returns would be about million at they would then have to subtract out the initial upfront payment and initial and subsequent capital investments in upgrades gray said that with a million capital investment in new meters and a million upfront payment at some point the vendor would expect to recover that and make a profit said that they would receive their share of revenues which would indeed make the transaction attractive to them in recouping their investment and experiencing profits above that said that they are also required to make other upgrades over the life of the contract potentially every five years which would require additional investment said that one of the main benefits would be that the city would be out of the business of parking meters and would have no capital or operating expenses and no debt service associated with such he said that this is a good thing for the city said that with a year contract and a council being elected every four years they are essentially tying the hands of the next councils he said that they are also tying the hands of future mayors and administrations in terms of setting priorities for their community he said that he appreciates the thought process of trying to anticipate future problems but the reality is that the administration does not know what the future holds and there is risk associated with the unknown he said that in the early the city did not have half of the technology they have now and would never have envisioned electronic meters he said that a million upfront cash payment is not worth the risk said that this is part of the policy debate about whether it is truly worth it he said that he will continue to try and convince that there is some flexibility built into this contract with some cushion in he said that the city has not done anything with the meters for years and has had less money to pay for infrastructure because of it this transaction will substantially increase revenues which will in turn benefit any future administration he said that even closing some meters the city will still experience more revenues with this deal than they do currently chairman called for a brief recess at pm he reconvened the rules and public policy committee at pm sanders asked what article in the contract gives the assurance about the numbers the city will receive she asked if all transactions are based on information from and therefore how the city can be assured that the numbers are accurate she said that the revenue generated is all predicated on data provided by the vendor and in order for the city to get its fair share what assures them that the data provided is accurate said that the city has a substantial ability to audit the contract on a regular basis and the formula is based on gross revenue on a tier percentage said that article has the reporting and auditing requirements sanders asked who is responsible for auditing said that the city is responsible and that process is laid out in articles and added that the reports generated would be public record and citizens could also access that information regarding meters and ticketing revenues said that the city is also getting those reports and can audit on a regular basis sanders asked how the city can audit properly with claiming their information is proprietary chairman said that he is not sure there is any way can predict the true revenue at this point and so their estimates that make the deal feasible for them could be considered proprietary and not for public consumption sanders said that she understands that but asked if is aware of the audit with she said that there have been numbers presented by in which were not accurate and this causes her great concern said that dealt with that issue and that is one of the reasons the provision exists in the contract to allow the city to audit he said that they would do this audit at a minimum on a yearly basis sanders asked if the city has talked with representatives from with regard to this issue said that he has and those individuals actually gave them a favorable recommendation for sanders asked who spoke with said that he can get sanders those names as he does not know them off the top of his head sanders said that the situation does not seem like would receive a good reference said that relayed that the case had a positive outcome and the contract worked in that case and the problem was found he asked from perspective what went wrong in that situation and if the company simply messed up or if there is a problem with their general credibility said that he did not invite representatives from this evening as he understood that they would just be making a brief presentation to answer questions he said that he can get a response for in writing asked from perspective if there is a comfort level with and that this situation is not a systemic flaw said that there are substantial provisions written into the contract with safeguards put into place long before a winning bidder was selected with the asked if is more confident then in the contract provisions and not necessarily said that he is also confident in and has seen their experiences in other cities and is confident in their ability to do the work asked if has been involved in the whole procurement process and is satisfied with the process and feels they have chosen a quality operator who can meet the service levels and high standards of this administration responded in the affirmative and said that the parking operation has been underfunded and is outdated and does not generate enough revenue to make infrastructure he said that there are other bidders that he is convinced could have done the same quality job and they took longer than they wanted in the process but felt that taking their time was necessary to get the best deal for the city asked with regard to the debate about proprietary information is it not true that the contract has provisions for access to proprietary information for auditing purposes that would not be available to the public he said that releasing a private proprietary information could cause them financial hardship or loss of business to competitors and the city does not want a vendor that goes broke and can no longer provide the service to the city said that this is correct and the city will have access to reports on demand and access to proprietary information as is necessary for auditing purposes to determine that the data provided in reports is accurate asked if is then confident that there are protections built into this agreement so that the taxpayer will not be defrauded responded in the affirmative asked if he is also confident in the quality of the vendor chosen responded in the affirmative he added that the confidence is enhanced by the choice of partners has chosen to operate this system with global and time who both have local ties and significant investment in this said that in his contact with constituents the biggest question is with regard to the year term he said that they have also heard from business owners downtown that they want quicker parking turnover he said that he received an email from a constituent with regard to the time limits for meters in the different districts he asked who would massage those time limits for example he has a constituent who spends a lot of time at the state library in the genealogy center doing research and he said that it would be hard to use those public services without special parking considerations said that there are some policy decisions by the city that trigger a re negotiation of the contract and ultimately the council is still in control of these issues he said that there be some cost for reimbursement if the loss of revenue is substantial but he is confident the increased revenues will be significant enough to offset any such cost concurred and stated that the council controls increase or reduction in rates and with an electronic meter an individual would not have to continue running out to the meter to feed it more change if they have used a debit or credit card said that they would like to hear from other constituents with their concerns as well said that the city is not then actually giving up control of these assets for years and there is always the potential for renegotiation said that a contract is a contract and to the extent that either party wants to do something different there is always the opportunity to amend and renegotiate any contract to add provisions which would require council approval sanders provided a letter from constituent who could not be here this evening but testified in a former hearing attached as exhibit she said that one of the concerns brought up by was with regard to the administrations blanket statement that businesses downtown are supportive of this transaction she said that many of the business owners who do support the deal already have spaces in garages and do not vie for parking meter spaces she said that there is also the situation with construction on avenue and she asked if the city could request that upgraded meters not be installed in construction zones until that construction is finished stated that they can talk with about delaying the installation of those meters but they can also shut down meters for construction jobs for up to days with no charge sanders said that most construction projects last more than days said that as they do presently they would charge the contractor for lost revenue because of shutting down meters for construction projects sanders said that the city will be charged by the concessionaire said that the city would pass that charge along to the contractor sanders said that in the interest of full disclosure and the interconnectivity of individuals working on this deal and possible influence on involved parties she has heard numerous rumors that was once employed by or their predecessor and she is concerned about this she said that it simply be rumors based on connection with but the presumptions have been very prevalent said that he has never been employed by or their predecessor he said many years ago he did work for a company that competed with and also worked with a gentleman by the name of skip approximately years ago who has ties to the vendor he said that in reality he probably has more friendships and connections with the competing bidders who lost out on the deal than with he said that because of his many connections he himself from the scoring of the bids and was only involved in the writing of the sanders asked if based on the fact that they are currently involved in a lawsuit with the vendor the state has given a positive recommendation for said that the state has recommended and has subsequently retained to implement a hybrid modernization structure even though they are in litigation with at this time sanders asked about and the mayors offices connection with who is a partner at and law firm who represents and has quite a bit of influence on the th floor stated that does advise the city some on behalf of the general assembly and the administration retains him to advocate for legislation that the city supports however has never lobbied him on behalf of a and client as that would be highly inappropriate in his role with the city he said that was not involved in the procurement of this deal in any way sanders said that she guesses she will have to take at his word regarding this matter chairman asked if sanders has evidence that word is inaccurate sanders said that she has no evidence but there has been enough speculation to suggest inaccuracies asked if has enough familiarity with who clients are to know that there has been no undue influence said that he is not familiar with all of clients but is aware of relationships that are involved in this deal asked if is still friends with the losing bidders said that he believes so as one even dropped by his home this past weekend citizen provided a copy of a recent letter from in the star attached as exhibit she stated that she moved downtown to and street into an apartment above the restaurant she said that there is not adequate parking for the apartments and five condominiums located at north street she said that she is disabled and relies on home health agencies and other people to provide the care she needs to effectively get to work for a local advocacy organization she said that it is incredibly difficult to find parking around their building when the colts play or when there is a parade she said that she has to pay parking permits for her home health care providers and no other agency would take her case because of the parking situation she said that a lot of the people in her building are students with bicycles but parking for the other residents is extremely scarce and at pm all parking spots are locked up for the night she said that her main concern is the cost and while it not seem like a lot to some people when she has to provide parking for herself and sometimes two aids at a time it can get costly she said that there is no accessibility to affordable parking or transportation for people of low incomes she added that while the administration says businesses favor this deal there are many small businessmen like the owner of and their who have signed a petition and are not in favor of the deal she referred to the article she passed out written by a law professor at university and pointed out the paragraph regarding one of the problems with privatization she referred to the and political and asked how much of this the consumer can bear she said that if the relationships noted in this paragraph regarding the mayors personal advisor and the president of the council are true then it is a smack in the face to citizens thanked ms for attending tonights hearing and waiting patiently to make her comments he said that there are some interesting things in the paragraph to which ms alluded and as some of them refer to him as the president of the council then he would like to publicly comment on these allegations he said that he is indeed an associate with and law firm and has been for approximately four years he stated that he had absolutely no input into the drafting of the nor did anyone at and that he knows of he said that he did not find out who the bidders even were until they were posted on the website and was not involved in the selection of the vendor in any way he said that he was contacted by one company during the process but it was not with regard to legal advice or representation and they were represented by a firm other than and he was contacted in his capacity as a he said that this proposal involves action by which is a part of their job duties to vote on such issues representing their constituency to the best of their ability he said that being a is a job and most of the have jobs which he sees as helpful because they then have to live under the rules they create he said that this creates an interesting dynamic with voting on subject matter that could affect their own quality of life said that he is happy to address such articles as this that refer to speculation and the appearance of impropriety because due to this councils work rules now exist that did not exist three years ago which define when a should recuse himself from a vote due to impropriety he said that if he abstains it is in effect a no vote representing the broad ripple area nothing in his years on the council has probably been more important to his district other than possibly the water deal therefore he would be remiss if he did not cast a vote on this issue he said that he has had no input in this deal and did not even find out who won the bid until minutes before the mayor held a press conference to announce it he said that and has no interest in this contract although they do represent in a number of their pursuits he said that the firm has over lawyers and is by far the largest twice the size of the next largest law firm in the state of he said that it is against lawyers ethics rules to profit share with a client or to take on a contingency he said that he does not share in the firms profits and is paid a fixed salary the council rules are very clear that he is required to abstain if he personally benefits from a transaction in the amount of or more he said that in this case the amount is immaterial as he does not benefit at all he said that he wants to be very clear about the appearance of impropriety and about his relationship to this deal going forward as he does not intend to abstain from voting on an issue that is very important to his constituents even though he has not yet decided how he will vote he said that while it appear contradictory he would like to thank ms for bringing this to everyones attention as he frequently has to answer these types of questions and is glad to do so he said that other work for different departments in the city or county or for the department of public safety as a police officer or firefighter yet they also are charged in their role as to vote on the budgets for those entities he said that he can understand the initial public reaction and knows it is a difficult thing to understand at times but cannot disregard their public duty based on speculation or appearances he said that it is important to engage in conversation about these speculations but it would be a disservice to the constituents he represents if he were to sit out on a vote this important when there is clearly no conflict king downtown resident and neighbor of ms stated that listening to the testimony and reading the contract makes her feel like a commodity or a revenue generator paying meters and tickets she said that there are no students living in their building but students who are the working poor or people on fixed incomes she said that they cannot find parking for those who live in their building off street and maximizing turnover at metered spaces does not help those who live downtown she said that they have approached many area garages and lots and it has been either to rent spaces or the facility does not have spaces for them to rent she said that they are hoping for some parking options or a parking permit program but in the meantime they rely heavily on metered parking said that he also lives downtown and is aware of the lack of available parking as a lot of people in the service industry also rely on parking ms king said that extending the hours to pm before free parking kicks in means residents have another six hours of parking they have to pay for residency including hours for parking just makes it worse said that the administration needs to make sure there is adequate medium and parking available for residents and workers while increasing the turnover would make it easier to find a space they do need to find medium and longterm parking options ms king said that they have talked about business owners approaching the administration with concerns but asked how residents have been included in these said that many downtown residents have attended their public forums in the last couple of months and they will have to look into more residential parking options he added that they will go back and look at the zones and residential building locations to make sure they have not created any unintended consequences chairman asked what the parking makeup is around ms kings building ms king said that it is all metered spaces added that there is a garage behind the building ms king said that they are not allowed to rent there nor in the surface lot nearby vice president of management services downtown incorporated stated that they support the proposal and parking is a passionate issue he said that there are some individual issues with residential buildings and part of what does is work with partnerships to solve problems he said that he will look into the issue at this particular building right now regardless of what happens with this proposal he said that there will always be similar issues like this that arise and they are there to help resolve such issues he said that they are working closely with the mayors office during this transition and still support the proposal asked how went about support said that is has been an ongoing dialogue asked if they conducted a survey said that they did not do a survey on this specific issue but have had many conversations with many different businesses downtown resident who works in the old area said that he appreciates the efforts of the administration to improve infrastructure and it is definitely time to consider increasing parking meter rates but he still has two major concern the first is that years is an incredibly long time and he has seen a lot of changes over the years and a lot of deals that did not make it he said that the the other issues is with regard to whether they call it a penalty cost or offset removing meters will incur costs and as the changes they need to have more flexibility he said that not having that flexibility will adversely impact downtown development and he does not believe this is the best deal the city could do said that the increase of revenues generated by the meters is not a disincentive for doing projects downtown he added that the upfront payment has to be used for infrastructure and in looking at bonding the upgrades themselves this presents more of a financial risk to the city chairman said that the parking meter rates have not been raised since and he asked what would be in todays dollars said that it would probably be six times that amount moved seconded by sanders to postpone proposal no until the motion carried by a vote of with gray and sanders casting the negative votes proposal no establishes an investigative committee to investigate the city of public safety leaders response to matters related to the incident on and in the weeks chairman said that he has serious concerns about hearing this proposal due to the ongoing investigation by the federal bureau of investigations he said that this proposal addresses leadership but because they do not know what the investigation consists of he does not feel comfortable pursuing any investigation by this council that might interfere with that investigation said that this proposal is timely necessary and a matter of common sense and should not be viewed as controversial there has been a clear loss of public trust due to this incident and some unfortunate things have happened since the accident regarding leadership response and he believes there is a clear need for clarity he said that the council has clear oversight responsibility as the legislative branch and there is a public expectation for the council to insure that this is remedied he said that this proposal would form a bipartisan body to help restore the public confidence he said that this is not a question of criminal acts and pointing to the ongoing investigation is not necessarily an excuse for not acting in the case of a recent significant event such as the oil spill where a number of people were killed within two months congress held hearings on the matter chairman stated that the council is not the congress said that congress did that because questions deserved answers chairman said that congress have simply investigated the matter as a form of grandstanding said that he has not heard any of his constituents complain that his taking a stance on this issue was grandstanding chairman said that he is not implying is grandstanding but that possibly congress was said that this proposal should have been dealt with on the floor at the last council meeting and he does not understand the controversy or reluctance to act he said that the criminal investigation should be finished by the end of this month and there is no reason not to look at the department of public response in this incident he said that it is very important in strengthening public safety to restore the publics confidence in the police force chairman said that he is not necessarily opposed to the proposal but feels the timing is inappropriate concurred and said that on a technical note the word live should be life in the fourth whereas statement he said that he has serious issues with entertaining this proposal at this time he said that if at the end of the investigation there are still questions unanswered this would be completely appropriate at that time he said that earlier in his career he served as a deputy prosecutor and argued such investigations in front of a jury he said that due to his experience in this area he is confident that the only result of this committee on that process would be negative this proposal gives the committee the ability to subpoena documents and individuals and the issues that would arise from a policy standpoint could be disastrous he said that he is cautious about public policy makers like the council intervening in such investigations if after the judicial ruling there are still questions unanswered he could understand the need for this proposal but until the criminal process is completed he could not support this he said that he believes it would damage the prosecutors ability to effectively prosecute this case he added that he believes has true motives and is not grandstanding and has the public interest at heart but as a former professional in this field he cannot support it moved seconded by to table proposal no the motion carried by a vote of with gray and sanders casting the negative votes sanders said that she concurs with and regrets that they could not move forward with this proposal she sad that they could have passed the proposal and put a committee together that was prepared to act after the investigation was completed she said that she believes by the time they approved this proposal and formed the committee the investigation would have been behind them she said that she is sorry to see the matter tabled said that he appreciates comments regarding his motives but delaying action on this delays accountability and he is disappointed in the action of the committee proposal no amends chapters and of the code regarding the and video services agency to make it consistent with state law office of corporation counsel stated that this proposal is simply a technical cleanup of the local ordinance to make it more practical and consistent with state law she said that it does not impact the franchise fee calculations in any way and the and video services agency remains under the regulation of the utility regulatory commission she said that the board has approved the proposal and there is an amendment before the committee to more appropriately reflect what they are trying to do with this proposal moved
