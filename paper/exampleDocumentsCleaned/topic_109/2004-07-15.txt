everything we can to make the transition to the new vendor as transparent as possible mayors action center throws switch on the mayors action center took the new application live on this means that the mac customer service representatives began using the application on this date to enter work orders this is without any of the integrations in place in order to do this tier established a temporary solution to duplicate one direction of the current interface into they copied the current code now established from expert advisor to that once entered into open the work orders in for those calls that need to go to the updates that occur within will not go back to until completes the new interface the statuses of these work orders are being captured within a staging table and the work orders will be updated after interface the and interfaces were both delivered at the end of for user acceptance testing user acceptance testing was successful and the date for the integration is while the date for the integration is major application services updates the following items are current or completed application upgrade and database upgrade to oracle i the production application was upgraded to advantage version and database was migrated to oracle on this upgrade affected hundreds of users at the and at health and hospital and went very smoothly the project took just over fourteen months to complete due to the complexities involved the work effort included upgrading the database to oracle i upgrading the application and testing with the fifteen technologies integrated with these include master address permit research online permitting special event permitting research inspections automated reporting interface web license and over crystal forms and reports the project team included the controllers office the city prosecutors office and due to an outstanding project team with lots of patience perseverance and cooperation the overall project was a fantastic success master address interface implementation van developed an interface that ensures that addresses used in application follow master address standards all addresses used in will now be valid address the interface also coordinates master address centerline data with street name validation table this provides the ability to add addresses not currently in the master address table this interface went live on many thanks go the project participants from parks the mac and the project took a little over two years to complete it was dependent on the progress and implementation new master address project and required the cleaning of over addresses with the system even though the work effort seemed enormous the team forged ahead and is now enjoying an outstanding success development significant progress was shown on this major development project all new components have now been delivered to the client for acceptance testing the form components will be delivered in and the reporting in the reporting component was demonstrated for the customer in late and received favorable comments and reviews miller created an oracle procedure to load the current employee data from into the new employee database table approximately records were extracted from and were loaded into the new database applications service request summary the application services group continued to focus heavily on maintenance and support requests during the month of a total of application services requests were closed during the month while new requests were opened a table showing the breakdown of these tickets follows heat category total development total maintenance problem calls total problem calls total service major technical the following projects were addressed during the month and their current status is presented improved infrastructure and processes in a combined effort between the communications and systems groups a project to improve handling of address and mainframe assignment and reclamation has passed user acceptance testing and is currently being implemented into the staging and then production phases a web application was created to assist the communication group to more efficiently manage the plus addresses used by the enterprise because of this technicians are able to access the database from the field providing quicker turnaround in the resolution of problems mainframe support efforts the systems group replaced an old technology terminal control unit at the training academy with a more art tabletop control unit capable of supporting the few remaining type terminal devices at the academy the old control unit was at the end of its product life cycle and replacing it provides a more reliable hardware solution with a smaller footprint that enables space to be used for future expansion the production control team modified batch jobs and schedules to facilitate the execution of jobs necessary for the cycle a close for the county treasurer the cycle a close process closes the books for properties processed in the spring tax cycle and sets necessary flags and creates the appropriate data sets in preparation of the fall tax cycle in cooperation with associates inc the production control group placed into production a new batch job for the public defender agency the new job reports on criminal charges filed for each quarter of the calendar year replacing several jobs that ran on an irregular schedule the effort provides reporting on a more efficient automatic and systematic basis support efforts the team implemented a process to create a disaster recovery tape to aid the staff in the event of an emergency on a weekly basis in addition to the normal backup efforts a special disaster recovery tape will be created and stored in the event of testing or actual emergency this tape can be used to expedite the recovery of the backup server which would then allow for the recovery of other servers in the event of an emergency the disaster recovery tape allows for a much faster recovery of the security improvement efforts the security staff upgraded the production firewall to a new version of checkpoint firewall also upgraded the firewall hardware operating system on the internet protocol security operating system ipso which is an security hardened operating system that supports the checkpoint firewall application ipso compliments the checkpoint software by improving processor utilization that actually speeds the processing of normal packets of information up to times and virtual private network packets up to times the upgrade provides improved security for the enterprise network for gateways provides protection from email virus threats and malicious payloads in the security team implemented an upgrade from version to that includes additional administration virus and protection enhancements the newer version offers more accurate detection rates on new and known messages than that of traditional keyword filtering techniques the upgrade also provides greater flexibility and coverage for blocking email based on the source a mass mailer worm automatically generates useless emails to distribute its payload to other unsuspecting recipients instead of eliminating just the infected attachment the entire message can now be eliminated the group assisted in the effort by developing a script that augments the functionality of the gateway by notifying users of suspicious emails blocked by the gateway server improvement efforts the server group deployed a new application for electronic field study through the application launcher the server group created a group for to manage which grants the necessary user rights and has the application associated to it the new application displays enhanced aerial photos for departments to use with their projects after months of testing from the vendor and telephone operations the server group implemented a new edify server into production the new server replaces equipment and provides improved fault tolerance remote administration and alert notification translating to greater reliability and service for the customer in the server group completed the upgrade of the remote lights out firmware and drivers on all windows and servers that supports this project was undertaken to ensure that all production servers have a functional hp remote lights out card with the latest firmware driver network settings and correct address this capability ensures that the server team has access availability to all of these servers the upgrade also ensured that all information was added to the server database and insight manager with any new or missing information the server which provides all employees web access to their data files was upgraded by the server team in this upgrade utilizes our existing hardware technology and replaces an server the newer technology provides faster processing more memory and additional disk space to access your data securely on the new server go to the server group removed the cluster server due to it experiencing memory and disk controller errors causing it to be unreliable for any online cluster services installed a new cluster server that will handle the service resources of two servers this reduces the number of servers needed to support the storage area network cluster environment the new server technology and additional processor enhancements allows to reduce the server cluster environment from five to four servers while enhancing performance reliability and reduce support costs to the server which supported the community courts at south st for the past three years was not being utilized for file and print services to reduce the support costs to the the server team transferred those services to a server within the building and the server which is is now retired from service to further reduce server administration costs to the and improve performance a reduction of one server was made accomplished this by migrating two containing hundreds of email accounts to an existing quad processor server this new technology is capable of handling faster database processing and email storage growth network communications projects head end has continued to move connections from the two head ends over to the new ring and has nearly completed this project the

the communications group will be surveying and updating firmware on a scheduled basis across the network during and the communications group has new wan links new remote sites currently underway at several sites the drug treatment court is considering a move to a new location and we are awaiting their decision of which site they will choose they be able to use existing fiber communications infrastructure if they choose to move into the st building the public defenders offices at the juvenile center are to be moved pending council approval to a new site and at that site has already been conducted both of these sites will require new data and voice wiring along with new network equipment planning and installation fire prevention is moving from their existing location to the government center at fall creek blvd network communications will have install a new frame relay circuit and is coordinating with vendors for data and voice cabling installation and required network hardware has also requested installation of a point to point wireless link that will run from this site to the building a distance of nearly three miles network communications has determined there is an excellent sight line from the roof of the remote location back to the we have specified and provided quotes for required network equipment antennas and data cabling to complete this project we have not received approval to move forward on either of these projects as yet wireless access point project will continue for some time as we work through to completion we envision this to be a longterm project server group move all print queues from server to this will provide faster processor and more memory this will consolidate all city county building print queues onto one server and will complete the upgrade of all servers to version group in the it board approved the purchase of more disk storage in the form of an storage array which will extend the capacity of the current storage area networks this project will involve staff from and the groups to merge the current environments into one we expect delivery sometime in early the implementation and migration effort will begin immediately and expected not be completed until this fall it has been determined that the has outgrown the majordomo mailing list manager and has been directed by to investigate other list managers which is now
