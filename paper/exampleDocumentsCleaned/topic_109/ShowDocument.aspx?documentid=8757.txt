harper ditch harper ditch maintenance activities and schedules for each department will maintain all best management practices that have been installed this includes routine sweeping of parking lots proper management of trash disposal roadside shoulder and ditch stabilization proper planning and care of roadside vegetation or vegetative and monitor and remediation of outfall scouring conditions each department will put in place controls for reducing or eliminating the discharge of pollutants from operational areas including roads parking lots and maintenance and storage yards this shall include covering or otherwise reducing the potential for polluted storm water runoff from deicing salt or sand storage piles each department shall have in place standard operating procedures for spill prevention and cleanup during fueling operations proper facilities will be provided for containment of any accidental loss of concentrated solutions acids salts oils or other polluting materials best management practices shall be in place for vehicular maintenance areas for each department where vehicles equipment and other maintenance activities take place the city of will prohibit vehicle and equipment washing with the exception of small equipment such as mower decks chainsaws etc and concrete or asphalt hydro demolition waste waters into storm water runoff except under the allowance of any appropriate wastewater permit further the minimization of pesticide and fertilizer use will be promoted by the city of and its employees pesticides shall be used applied handled stored mixed loaded transported and disposed of according to the chemists guidance requirements each department that has fueling facilities shall ensure that all fueling areas have an appropriate spill kit that is labeled any fueling facility that has secondary containment shall ensure that all secondary containment is functional and any drain plugs are installed or tank is doubled walled these facilities shall be routinely inspected and any damaged tanks hoses or containment shall be as necessary all tanks shall have pollution prevention messages with spill contact information and shall have automatic shut off installed as required each fueling facility area shall be locked at the end of each work day the city of will promote the proper disposal of animal waste it will be recommended where applicable that canine parks be sited at least one hundred fifty feet away from a surface water body all dumpsters will be maintained inspected and kept covered after use dumpsters will be located away from storm drain inlets the city of will adhere to the reporting guidelines and reportable spill quantities listed with the united states environmental protection agency fertilizer application management fertilizers will never be applied within five feet of pavement feet of a storm drain inlet or feet of a stream or water body a low or no fertilizer approach to maintain turf when feasible will be utilized fertilizer will not be applied when rain is expected soil tests will be performed to determine actual fertilization needs and application rate fertilizer spreaders will be calibrated to avoid excessive application application management integrated pest management the use of mechanical methods of vegetation removal rather than herbicides will be used when possible consideration will be given to using a low or no pesticide approach to maintaining landscaped areas all departments will avoid applying herbicides and pesticides if rain is expected equipment will be calibrated in order to avoid over application the city of will ensure staff is certified by the office of state chemist for pesticide application storage of materials all hazardous materials will be properly marked and stored on site this shall include but not be limited to oil fuel antifreeze lubricants chemicals and other possible pollutants that be on site where possible these materials will be within an enclosed building where they are not at risk to contaminate the storm water if spilled and can be properly contained should a spill occur material safety data sheets for the fuels oils hydraulic fluids and antifreeze used in the vehicles and equipment can be found in the binder located within the maintenance buildings and areas adjacent to the storage areas where these materials are located catch basin drain maintenance a daily log of the amount of sediment collected and removed will be maintained waste will be analyzed to determine the nature of disposal any liquids collected during should be decanted and disposed of separately depending on its hazard class cleaning will be planned to coincide with municipal street sweeping all suspicious catch basins will be reported to the ms coordinator for inspection and enforcement inappropriate discharges and illegal dumping storm drain marking the city of will ensure that any newly constructed or replaced storm drain covers have storm water pollution prevention messages such as dump no waste drains to waterway waste disposal of materials all departments that are involved in waste removal of any materials removed from the separate storm sewer systems and operational areas must dispose of the materials in a landfill that is equipped with handling the type of material being disposed of this disposal shall be in compliance with all applicable solid waste disposal regulations this shall include but not be limited to trash and debris dredge spoil accumulated sediments and debris training of personnel to handle hazardous waste all departments that deal with hazardous waste are properly trained with periodic refresher sessions on topics such as proper disposal of hazardous wastes vegetative waste handling fertilizer and pesticide application and the function of implemented building perimeter when feasible a vegetative buffer around the building perimeter will be established and maintained routinely collect and properly dispose of any trash debris or empty containers building interior all departments with maintenance activities inside of a building will ensure all floors are routinely swept and kept free from oils hydraulic fluids fuels etc spill kits will be made available where hazardous fluids are placed and will be located in a centralized location and employees will be properly educated on the use of the spill kits all absorbents are cleaned and disposed of after spills drip trays will be placed in all buildings with vehicles and used when needed vehicle washing guidelines all departments will utilize a commercial washing facility when feasible purchase and utilize nontoxic biodegradable phosphate free detergents designate and label specific areas for washing operations which drains to a sanitary system floor drains should have oil and water separators vehicles will not be washed outside no hazardous materials will be stored in the designated wash area unless adequate containment is provided maintenance guidelines all departments will maintain accurate inventory of fluids properly and promptly dispose of used fluids in appropriate labeled containers recycle all used fluids when feasible store bulk fluid waste in an appropriate area inside dry sweep work area routinely have an appropriate spill kit accessible and utilize approved cleanup procedures store damaged batteries in a covered secondary container designate and label specific area for maintenance operations which drain to the sanitary system floor drains should have oil and water separators place drip trays under small drips from for temporary containment and do not perform maintenance involving fluid handling outside the building all bulk fluid contains shall be maintained in spill pallets and routinely inspected for leaks and fluid accumulation residual flood accumulations shall be cleaned in secondary containment all containers shall be clearly labeled to accurately identify the contents garbage cans regular trash only and used oil containers waste oil other practices storm water pollution prevention plan implement the within this plan revise as needed to improve protection of storm water
