distributed door hangers to homes and hand signed invitations to businesses the chamber of commerce assisted in promoting the event and there was a story in the truth social media was used with some of the largest networks in the city business cards with the survey link were distributed to area convenience stores and available to customers page recommendations recommendations from the public process were sorted by priority assigned by each group then by eligibility for funding of the public priorities sidewalk improvements were rated highest other activities all had roughly the same priority level priorities accessible sidewalks and completing the sidewalk network traffic studies for an at and railroad tracks bus shelters longer trolley hours parking infrastructure study community centers with technology improvements vacant lots the next section details the public comments on each activity provides background information on the issues and details a list of activities to undertake eligible activities when a area is created all or part of the new tax revenue from that geographic area is captured for a fixed period of time to pay for incentives and infrastructure costs such as building or widening roads expanding sewer and water systems or other infrastructure the new business development will need a economic development agreement includes a capital projects plan that spells out how tax increment revenues will be used within the allocation area so everyone involved understands where the money will be spent projects spelled out in the plan are the only ones that can be financed by revenue as established for the consolidated district for infrastructure projects the redevelopment fund the costs of real estate acquisition engineering costs architectural fees surveying costs title fees design costs legal costs accounting costs financing costs project development and management costs costs of permits licenses approvals or other similar costs in addition to the cost of construction the following list is a comprehensive overview of potential projects that be undertaken using funding it is meant to supplement not supersede the established goals and objectives of the individual consolidated into the consolidated south area these actions could include but are not limited to the following planning activities the development of plans for lusher avenue avenue prairie street and south main street are priorities page the planning activities include but are not limited to corridor study access management strategy beautification plan utility needs study storm water management traffic improvement plan pedestrian facility needs study compliance and implementation study zoning overlay recommendations develop standards and overlay recommendations amenities focused efforts throughout the consolidated area are recommended with specific attention paid to major thoroughfares and gateways along lusher avenue avenue prairie street and south main street improvements could include without limitation walkways sidewalks multimodal paths etc lighting landscaping crosswalks building improvements to tree lawns parks community gardens improvements gateway improvements gateways are the front door to our community and give visitors their first impression of the community when possible revenue should be leveraged with federal funds so as to maximize impact in areas where roadway improvements will encourage private investment major thoroughfares connector streets and primary intersections should be priorities specifically lusher avenue avenue prairie street and south main street page transportation improvements transportation corridors are a vital part of making a complete community railroads rivers and existing roadways restrict traffic flow in a number of areas around the city special attention will be given to major thoroughfares connector streets railroad projects including the prairie street overpass project and gateways to the community utility technology infrastructure and right improvements where appropriate money will be spent to construct repair extend and upgrade utilities technology infrastructure and to better serve the area these actions could include but are not limited to the following traffic devices street lights etc water fire hydrants drainage sewer and storm water infrastructure technology infrastructure curbs intersections roadways alleys bridges etc gas electric and other utilities including burying of utilities property acquisition demolition rehabilitation the properties on the property acquisition list be considered for acquisition these properties would be considered as to the extent that adaptive reuse of the existing structure will likely not be sustainable hence acquisition and demolition through a partnership will likely be required costs for acquisition will vary depending upon the structure and possibility of partnerships in addition to direct acquisition of for sale properties on the acquisition list the city will continue to work with county to acquire tax delinquent properties this process is critical to addressing the vacant and abandon property issues that can cause blight in the area and works against efforts to develop this area development incentives partnerships will likely be necessary in some of the most challenged properties this extend to assistance in assemblage or acquisition public infrastructure reimbursement agreements tax incentives or low interest loans or grants adoption of the implementation strategy the area over laps with the consolidated south area this plan set forth a series of activities and strategies to improve the area the activities and strategies set forth in the plan will be utilized in the consolidated south area as and when appropriate to make local public improvements as defined in this plan page transportation transportation includes roads and intersections including railroad crossings public bike and pedestrian infrastructure signs traffic signals and lighting related to the public and transportation network the transportation recommendations were guided by public input existing plans and planned projects and activities normally undertaken with revenues or by local units of government issues were the most common issues raised during key person interviews focus groups and the world sessions issues identified were sidewalk conditions sidewalks are needed where there are gaps fix existing sidewalks improve sidewalks new sidewalks sidewalks in good repair narrow sidewalks sidewalks sidewalk plan for concord mall sidewalk updates for block of east sidewalks on main more oversize sidewalks compliance smooth concrete access for wheelchairs sidewalks that are compliant main street sidewalk improvements improve sidewalks landscaping curbs streets and lighting as needed better spaces for bike riders sterling bike path to match the maple heart trail make

evenly background information since nearly in public facilities and improvement funds have been invested in the neighborhood revitalization strategy area through the sidewalk program or through public facilities such as parks and gardens the city of community development department partners with the street department to utilize funds to pay for a job training program in which low and seasonal employees install sidewalks in the this program not only provides funds to replace aging infrastructure in the core neighborhoods it also provides skills and a gainful employment to income qualified city residents the impact of the program is seen in the neighborhood through the installation of over feet of sidewalks but also through the skills and economic impact of hiring local residents the program is a job training program so participants only enroll twice and then they can put their skills to work in other areas of the city or with private enterprise the trail connects to the maple heart trail miles in via the maple city the maple heart trail begins at the city limit and ends at the sterling bike lane then picks up and connects to other parts of the city using the bike lane miles from the end of the sterling bike lane to the tracks then north on to one block south of franklin the lusher bike path is miles in length from east the interurban trolley has three lines that serve the consolidated district red green and orange the red line connect concord mall to lusher avenue the orange line east is a loop that includes parts of and prairie street and has a connection to the green line the green line west is a route that connects the area south of the river to downtown and north of the river the red line has weekday hours of am until pm with hours from am until pm the green and orange lines have daily hours from am until pm through none of the lines run on or holidays the fare is one way and includes transfers there are signalized intersections in the city of the sign asset database has over traffic signs there is a number available on the city webpage to call when there are problems with traffic signals lights have been recently installed in sterling park as

activities were identified in the plan as eligible activities as population and economy has shifted some of the legacy development in the city is either functionally obsolete or has become significantly dilapidated demolition of structures is one way to make land with urban services and areas connected to the core urban area available for development in some cases buildings are of a historic or locally significant nature and can be rehabilitated for reuse recommendations were based on public input and existing activities as well as those that can be supported with public investment demo or rehab blighted properties consider demolition of woodland crossing in areas to bring back room for other new buildings populating woodland crossing or tear down demolish buildings

serving the district to identify technology needs identify community center technology needs that are appropriate for investment of resources particularly those with an economic development focus gateways gateways were identified in the plan as appropriate uses for funds in the area gateways can take a number of forms but are traditionally physical improvements which include signs landscaping or that identify the edges of unique places the consolidated includes a number of places so multiple gateways be needed for the unique areas that are part of the district as well as gateway enhancements for the city as a whole entryways us coming from the south and gateway improvements to make it look better improve the south gateway a if field is developed the south entrance could be purchased to create a dual purpose entryway that celebrates and informs people of the park and the presence of the neighborhood getting around is a challenge create beautiful and moderately sized place building gateways for various neighborhoods that have distinction and some unifying theme to increase pride and ownership in the at main prairie at th at the boulevard us exit onto us main welcoming announcement paint overpass wall on railroad tracks on with something welcoming replace the old service organization signs with something newer figure gateway locations stars background information gateway projects are more complex than the general public often realizes there are a number of issues related to property ownership and easements for signs or other installations the cost of design and installation lighting and ongoing maintenance due to the visibility of these projects it is critical that they be well conceived implemented and maintained over time is a concept related to gateway it is intended to welcome people to unique areas and direct them to the destinations that are part of what makes the area unique the a comment that getting around is a challenge suggests a need for or a comprehensive system for the area or the city as a whole other plans park development is in the south central quality of life plan and has been underway as a grass roots effort for several years the primary goal is to turn the field into soccer fields for neighborhood league play the park has not been adopted by the parks recreation department as a city park the had donated the land to the city for development of the park but development needed to occur within five years the current status is not available the comprehensive plan identifies a need for gateway enhancements to distinguish from along the main street corridor develop a major gateway plan for the main street gateway into the south side of that includes lighting landscape features and design guidelines for new development plan for the ongoing maintenance of lighting landscape and features develop criteria and a process for secondary neighborhood gateways to be developed by neighborhood or business organizations funded with revenues include ongoing maintenance in any for the gateway projects expand to include key destinations in the area and bring people in from the south gateway to downtown and other local destinations beautification improvements such as landscaping lighting benches trash receptacles and banners and beautification activities are eligible activities generally these investments would be in construction purchase of or similar activities other activities be more appropriately sponsored by neighborhood associations creating a sense of place downtown has much more tasteful lighting and crossings neighbors and neighborhoods try to follow suit with larger improvements that are being done main street area that has been redone from the overpass would look nice all down main general appearance and beautification improvements are opportunities have bulletin boards that get information out to people in the communities in a good place that looks nice more than one kiosks active billboards anything to raise awareness of whats happening and where its happening will benefit everyone lack of definition between streets curbs and sidewalks a open bright cheery landscaped areas landscaping lacks general beautification home improvement competitions clean and peaceful more activities focused on neighborhood clean up smaller nicer neighborhood parks remove old trees plant new background information there have been significant roadway and improvements along main street in the downtown area recently message boards and kiosks have generally fallen out of use in communities for several reasons the to keep the information current the maintenance needs and the shift to digital information sharing certain population groups be less likely to use the internet or a smart phone for their information and need information to be disseminated in a more traditional manner the neighborhood associations need to take on this role as appropriate to reach all populations other plans the comprehensive plan identifies a desire for a environment for the city enhancements to landscaping along the corridors are one of the ways this character could be established the long range transportation plan does not currently identify any funding priority projects for main street beyond the work that will be completed in improvements made to the along main from to the south city limit are not likely to be in conjunction with a major roadway project in the near future recommended support and encourage neighborhood cleanup activities program tree planting
