planning process organizational policy over the past eight years the city has expanded the parks system by parks and miles of trails during the same time period the parks department has significantly reduced staff making it difficult to operate and maintain park facilities natural resources and programs the operating budget for parks consists of approximately of consolidated county funds generated from property tax revenues and of revenues generated from fees and charges for recreational programs and services this accounts for the total park operating budget in addition to this the parks and recreation department receives approximately million each year to take care of all capital expenditure needs such as new building construction or renovation roof repairs updating units and paving hard surfaces including tennis courts and basketball courts these combined operating and capital budgets have not kept pace with the economy and cannot sufficiently support the current parks system or the expanding needs and challenges of our community the last decade has seen an infusion of over million in improvements to park infrastructure including new playground equipment additional land and open space building renovations expansions and installation of new facilities as well as the growth of technological advancements these improvements were desperately needed and served to rescue park resources from archaic and degraded conditions the improvements and growth of the department of the past ten years have included new state of the art aquatic centers complete replacements of city pools with aquatic centers annual new family center constructed family center renovations expansions new nature center complete renovation and upgrading of the conservatory and sunken garden facility playgrounds replaced with new playgrounds designed for the st century birth of total system including six different trails and corridors extending over miles of trials that will continue to grow and eventually interconnect throughout the city the department is in a constant struggle to maintain its current assets and retain the value of its resources this is one of the primary concerns identified in the public planning process for the pathways to the future parks comprehensive park recreation and plan a recent inventory of park assets and projected scheduling of routine maintenance and projected asset replacement indicated a need for roughly million annually to properly maintain the current assets of the department this does not allow for additional park expansion facility improvements increased utilization or addressing any new services or challenges another phenomenon that has been witnessed is that facility improvements and renovations result in increased of utilization from the community restated a more visually pleasing space that can accommodate a diversity of activities generates increased traffic through the parks in the arena of program and facility utilization the department has seen a continual growth of interest and demand from the public this increase in utilization can be attributed to the parks and recreation departments development and implementation of quality programs and services that fulfill relevant recreation and open space needs for all members of the community in particular we have seen increased involvement with local schools seniors and citizens with disabilities and special interest groups bark parks skateboard parks and environmental education parks new organization the parks and recreation department year
