rive ant fort rivers plant softens and filters water to serve people in fort and a areas water pumped of the plant and in fort water system plant capacity origin plant com capacity capacity lab addition electrical addition service pump station on fort first water works was in and the watter supply came from deep wells the orig cost of thee works was over during the period and thee pipes clean water were as the co the late saw water during th he summer season and there was general the need for new water by thee early the limitations an supply became more and apparent a study that the existing wells had reached and that wells would not enough to justify th he cost the study looked for other of a water it that there were no lakes in thee area with enough of a area be able to meet the needs of a growing ind comm the looked using the river at or below as a water supply the would furnished a and supply but the of the watter was the received much of the drainage sewage from the itself the st and st rivers were as a raw watter source the st was determined to be as a water it had a steady flow and better quality than the st in the origin three water plant was at the where the river and th he st river come together to rm the river original plant provided and softening facilities to tr water per treat gallons of the original plant included a million on finished water and a pump station that would send water out to homes and businesses the was financed a on bond issue the plant was on a acre tract of land east spy run a avenue the is and saw the passing of the mound ding an trappers and the pioneer flags of great and thee early states flew forts within a of todays plant the site at the of thee rivers was chosen as the for filtration plant in for the land was already ow by the city its location made it easy too send water to all of the city from the plant also of its setting the site be and made the desire to the plant bu a mark carried the and the building was designed in a style the firm off of arbor and of a central tower with wings extend ding from sides the exterior of th he building was covered with many of the feature of even in the of water water scenes or wildlife significant water utility were completed co with the plant in the st river dam and pump ping station was built the st river from what is now johnny park previously utilities park the dam an where is stored to supply in an of the plant its by adding facilities complete treatment for another on gallons of water per day in ground was broken yet another the expansion of the and soften added her st river mg of to the plan bringing total ability to prod duce finished water to the ville dam on the st at was also com as of the project to more the in were financed through an million issue both the and expansions added co plants to thee water complex the three in plan can be so that portions of thee total plant be taken for or as needed the to the com over th he years carefully to be keeping the origin and character in an addition to the plant was built to house new testing analytical laboratories the new laboratory addition pro more space and for required federal lab technicians test raw and finished for more than some are done co are done daily monthly testing is done at intervals within the so that treatment can bee as needed to meet raw watter in the plant and tests water from us parts of the city to make that it health safety standards in and utilities million in a major at the the of electrical capable off powering entire in the of an electrical throughout the plant cleared the way for the phase off new electrical gen built in in the new service north pump was to water from thee plant out to all parts of city it four each of million gallons of per day the project the original high pump room built in i and in the effective of water the of the and pump allows for two mo ore pumps to installed of which will be in year as part off the the east pump is being and will soon the new system that under con and will be in the flowing into the three on plant is using a physical and ch the step in thee treatment the of ferric lime and carbon to the raw water the are physically mixed the water with large paddles in this the ferric causes of sticky clump in the called soil and materials in the water to the flocculation the lime to soften the water the soaks up and help to remove taste and odor the water moves into tanks where the continue to grow and pick up the the of eventually so heavy that they to the of the tan the is then off from the top goes through the and processes again then a of chlorine and a fluoride the chlorine kills bacteria and germs added fluoride remain in th he water to aid in thee prevention of tooth decay the water flows fl into where it moves by gravity through layers of filtering material because of a difference in charges between the water and th he filter the filter media and micro that are a resistant to on the also trap an hold many of the remaining that the water to be cloudy the basins the south of the cloudiness or turbidity of the water is a general indicator of water quality it is measured in turbidity units or the goal of the plant is always to produce water with less than of turbidity federal regulations require that water be treated so that turbidity does not exceed an ultraviolet light disinfection process to be implemented in will increase protection against an intestinal parasite called although has never been found in fort drinking water new federal regulations require that all water systems that receive their water from a river lake or stream implement added precautions traditional chlorine disinfection does not kill but filtration physically removes it from the water treating water using ultraviolet light deactivates and will allow city utilities to meet the high standards set by the us environmental protection agency and department of environmental management following the treatment process water is stored in an underground reservoir at the plant until it is pumped into the pipes that carry it to customers in fort and vicinity
