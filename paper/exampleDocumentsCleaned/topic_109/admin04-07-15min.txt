meeting to order at pm with the following members present hunter jack and lewis arrived shortly thereafter general counsel chief financial officer brown and fiscal analyst represented council staff county justice center fiscal feasibility analysis brown council chief financial officer chair stated that she has asked brown the councils chief financial officer to share the council staff report from an independent analysis of the proposed criminal justice facility brown stated that he would first like general counsel to comment regarding documents posted on the website and requirements regarding information available to the public said that there have been a few issues with this process with regard to withholding key information about this deal from the public the administration first refused to release the proposals and they are continuing to withhold key information from the taxpayers who essentially will be paying the bill he said that this is a serious problem for a deal of this magnitude the chosen proposal will pay heartland justice partners almost billion between and he said that he believes the redactions in the proposal released to the public are wrong from both a legal standpoint as well as for sake he said that redactions are allowed in public documents to protect trade secrets or confidential financial information but when there is information it should be separated out although the public access counselor for the state issued a letter agreeing that what was released was consistent with the public records act feels it was not adequate out of pages only pages were made available to the public and he seriously doubts all of those excluded pages were confidential information or trade secrets he said that a lenders due diligence handout at a recent meeting referenced a report by a consulting group that report is pages long and is included in the redacted information but was not included in what is available to the public although it was referenced in a public meeting he said that there were other findings and standard poor letters that were referenced in handouts at public meetings but the public cannot really speak to any of these as the documents themselves were actually withheld from the public even the information that is provided with redactions is redacted to the point that it is pretty much useless to the public when it comes to cost information at some levels it is confidential but in broad categories he does not see how it can be confidential for the sake of argument if they concede that and the city is correct and they can withhold every word they did the public still does not have the information they need to understand the deal and provide public input at public hearings taking place right now said that this process has been too secretive and too rushed he said that and the city should rethink their position on what is truly confidential but he has not seen any indication that they are willing to do that if the nature of a partnership deal is so secretive then he suggests maybe the council consider other procurement levels that do not require that level of secrecy brown for the council office provided a presentation attached as exhibit a and introduced baize chief executive officer and founder of development corporation baize foundation and and associates who will offer some insight and additional information regarding the analysis of this deal he added that general manager of the county building authority and the president of the board of trustees don are also in attendance to answer questions but have to leave early brown said that he was given one task to look at every possible procurement method for this project he said that they did not look at operation or maintenance of such a facility but they did hear some arguments that the building authority did not have the capability to facilitate a project of this size that is why he invited and to attend and answer questions said that building authority has been criticized by the administration by saying that they are not capable of handling a project of this size she asked for a response to this statement said that building authority has a pretty good track record with regard to operating and maintaining facilities they have overseen the operation and management of the building for years and their total portfolio is larger than this proposed project as they oversee different properties he said that he would have to say they certainly do have the capability to operate and maintain a facility of the size that is being proposed asked if their ability to maintain would be affected by budget constraints and if the ability to maintain would be contingent on their budget being increased every year in order to do so she said that the current proposal includes preventative maintenance such as replacing the heating ventilation and air conditioning system every years and roof replacements said that this would be a component of the budget and expenses would be on top of operating expenses hunter asked if building authority has preventative maintenance dollars set aside said that they do not have that luxury to set aside dollars for preventative maintenance right now they do capital projects as needed out of savings they have put away and reserves some project costs are placed into a series of budgets but they do not routinely include capital expenditures in their operating budget hunter asked if the best practice would be to budget for preventative maintenance said that in light of best practices they would certainly want a reserve hunter asked what percentage of the budget should be set aside for a project of this size said that they do not know enough about that facility to say hunter asked if they do not set aside dollars for the buildings they already operate and maintain said that their budget is all about preventative maintenance not capital projects hunter stated that the elevator on the sheriffs side of the has been down for weeks and he asked if it has been fixed said that they had two companies come in to look at repairs one quoted five weeks of downtime the other less costly alternative promised two weeks so they chose the latter he said that they did run into some other problems during those repairs that they had to work out so it did take a little more time than two weeks hunter said that therein lies the problem he asked if building authority is not setting aside money each year to deal with these types of issues how they propose to get ahead on these projects said that they are getting by and managing to meet the needs with energy costs exploding that is no simple task hunter asked if they have had an outside analysis on repairs needed on the properties they currently manage said that they do have a plan of capital repairs however these projects are not funded they do however know what projects need to be tackled if the funding becomes available said that they did do an energy refit and an infrastructure deal and bond were approved but the operating budgets do not include funding for capital projects chair said that it is not building fault that funding is not available the bar is set low because of the budget mayor set before them and she blames this on misplaced priorities of this administration she said that the administration is contemplating a soccer stadium at west market street yet they are not even taking care of the police force and public safety she said that the city needs to stop spending money on things that are not a dire necessity said that in the course of his work he has been in and out of this building for about years while he thinks building authority does a good job there are many capital projects that are needed the overhead door to the garage was out of commission for several weeks which is a good example of not having funding available to replace things on a regular basis this is an old building and the garage door was so no replacements parts were available and therefore it took longer and was more costly because no replacements had routinely taken place he said that there are issues like this throughout the enterprise including the jail which is also facing some repair issues for a building that old he said that he realizes they are not funded to make these repairs and that is part of this councils responsibility to figure out ways to fund these issues however building authority is having problems maintaining their current structures within the budget that is available and he cannot reconcile that with the kind of numbers they are talking about in this new proposed said that he has been on the council for three years and he appreciates all building authority does with the funds they have available he said that they are simply not getting the money they need and this is a continuing pattern the regional operations center lease cost a month even when it was inhabitable and building authority could have built and maintained it for less than that the administration is saying building authority is not capable but they are not funding them in order to maintain properly said that the jail is years old and the city will get this new facility back after it is years old so they will be facing the same problem this developer will be making profits off of the payments each year and if they were not paying them for profits they would have the money for building authority to manage it along with extra for capital projects she said that they would have more money if they did the project themselves but instead are simply helping to finance this profit margin hunter asked where the budget has been in comparison with their assets said that the overall budget of building authority has increased as they have taken on more buildings but in the past years the rate of increase in the has been less than a year in operating costs said that the difference is that with this deal the new facility will be properly maintained with regular repairs so that it will not be in a deteriorated state when it is handed over to the city in years the builder cannot walk away from this deal and there are very strict maintenance standards with financial penalties if the company falls below certain requirements therefore this is not the same analogy of a crumbling year old building like the jail chair thanked and for coming and answering the committees questions brown began his presentation see exhibit a and said that he was directed by council leadership to provide an and transition funding analysis on this project he was given permission to bring in some experts to help with the analysis he said that he sought advice from the specialists from because of their expertise with projects and from associates as an independent financial advisor to governmental units he said that in looking into this projects they followed the following requests were all options vetted interested only in guarantees make sure there is at least coverage savings and revenues should be directly related to project meet with agencies independently of mayors consultants if it is not backed up with documentation do not count it trust us is not an option brown stated that the project that was originally introduced was much bigger and the offices of the prosecutor and public defender are no longer a part of the project he said that in meeting with the agencies independently they found that some of the numbers given by the administration these agencies had never seen he said that the numbers have changed several times since they were first presented and savings that were originally reported in the sheriffs office of million are now being estimated at million it has been difficult to confirm any numbers because they keep changing chair asked who is changing the numbers brown said that the numbers are coming from the administrations financial advisory consultants and the stakeholders brown said that they do believe there will be some savings for the sheriff in personnel but are not sure to what extent he said that the city could save money on arrestee health care costs today by contracting with community corrections of at jail ii instead of sending everyone to hospital the issue is in getting the police agencies to send them to the jail according to a general order already issued in the metropolitan police department already sends every arrestee to the jail however officers are not able to assess the extent of injury and are still sending too many to the hospital they cannot however create an emergency room at the jail so they will always have to send some arrestees to due to gunshots dog bites excessive stab wounds etc therefore they cannot eliminate of the charges for arrestee health care to he added that costs for those services that require emergency medical treatment such as gunshot wounds and stab wounds continue to increase there be some savings in health care costs but nothing like what the administration is estimating he said that there was a recovery bill introduced this year at the state that was included in analysis with savings estimates however this bill has nothing to do with this project and is just now getting action in the house of representatives so they cannot yet count on that advantage he said that there is also some hope regarding holds for the federal service and they do have some communication that they want some beds but no documentation yet brown stated that due to population growth and state law changes it is determined that county could need up to an additional jail beds community corrections does not have the budget for these additional beds and this would obligate the council to fund another beds with no state funding yet confirmed for this expense the analysis of the courts is fairly close yet they are demanding the city build them a new building but do not seem willing to pay for it he stated that in most recent numbers the parking revenue stream increased even though was agreed upon it is not their decision to arbitrarily increase this cost but coincidentally this number went up when the sheriffs personnel savings number went down brown referred to some other recent projects involving land sales in comparison and said that there is no confidence they will get much out of the current jail site as the demolition will cost millions of dollars he said that there is almost a million difference in the savings and revenue projections by and those he has provided to the committee in the presentation and the cumulative shortfall in estimated fees is million if interest rates go up this will be an even greater number brown added that anything related to information technology outside of the complex will be an additional payment brown concluded that the council does not make decisions in a vacuum he said that there are many other unfunded needs for the city to consider guardian ad staffing only half way there th pay fleet fleet deputy salary parity increase in crime prevention grants cost of living adjustment cola for employees brown said that diverting revenue to this project will make things worse in providing funding for other needs a recent greater progress committee study shows that leaving the prosecutor and public defender out of this project does not make sense but it would be difficult to pull off a request for proposals to add them in the next two months if private law firms were included construction costs would be even greater but this would add another million annual cost to have the prosecutor and public defender located in their own building in this complex brown said that his conclusion is that the next mayor and council would have to raise new revenue in order to fund this obligation to if they move forward with this said that she understood there were signed letters from the courts community corrections and some of these other entities verifying the revenue they were willing to give up to make this project happen brown said that he has seen only one signature from community corrections he said that he saw a letter from the sheriff outlining some concerns and other needs but the forms were not signed he said that the communication he has seen from the clerk shows that she does not endorse or support the project even though she would experience a gain in her budget asked how she would experience a gain brown said that staff would be added to maintain files and would be added to her budget and supposedly deducted from savings elsewhere but his analysis is that this would come from fund balance asked what community corrections agreed to brown said that they were comfortable with recommended budget cuts and savings in order to be included in this project he said that he has not seen anything from the courts that would indicate they would guarantee cuts in their budget if projected revenues are not produced said that the th pay is being funded by each agency and some of them are using their reserves to cover that brown said that this is correct assuming there is no additional appropriation from the office of finance and management to cover this pay said that this would vary by the size and amount of personnel per agency she asked if this is listed as potential revenue brown responded in the chair said that she is not sure how there would be savings to fund the additional budget needed for the clerk as they already maintain files for all of these entities and it seems like a false budget brown said that he believes they would have to fund the increase through use of fund balance in the grand scheme of things is not a lot of money and he has confidence they can find this funding however the clerk was never involved in these discussions until the new clerk came into office in these meetings have not been supposedly there have been stakeholder meetings but a lot of the smaller agencies were not involved in these discussions and mostly only the sheriff was represented chair said that this is like the regular budget process where more money is needed here and there when they already do not have a sufficient budget to fund what they are required to provide said that she has through several hours of meetings and a comparison chart was provided showing some costs agencies would incur on top of the annual payments to she asked if that list is available brown said that the list included security in the parking lot provided by the sheriff but he has not seen any plans to hire private security it was also assumed community corrections would handle landscaping but he has not seen where they have the budget or equipment to facilitate that there are probably more examples but these are just two such items said that as she recalls there were many more things on that list she asked if they end up adding beds and only fill up of them would this mean less federal reimbursement brown said that federal authorities have only asked for more beds but the numbers keep changing right now they are providing and they are asking for more he could count these additions if he could get that per diem agreement in writing said that she is not as optimistic given the crime rate that these beds will be available as she sees the city filling those beds added that she requested medical savings information and has not yet received it she said that the city administrations analysis does not seem possible with medical cost savings and she has a problem believing their numbers when they change every meeting and she cannot get a copy of the analysis she has requested hunter said that brown keeps referring to my analysis as though it is his own opinion therefore he is not sure how independent this analysis is hunter said that he predicted there would be a shortfall with the arrestee processing center and the merger yet one of the advisors on this report who was the city controller at the time of the and merger predicted those projects would be fine that was not the case and it was a complete and utter miss he said that the deal was the same kind of structure as the but did not seem to be as much of an issue brown said that when he refers to my numbers he confirmed every number he received working with the administration when he could not get documentation he asked questions and some of these numbers were subsequently changed he said that the analysis is independent because he does not have a stake in this project he said that he receives a paycheck from the council and if he is wrong in the analysis he provides he could potentially lose his job he does not however have any stake in the final decision on this project he added that the gentlemen from are here to provide insight on deals and is part of an independent firm hired to give an objective analysis they are here to back up his findings he said that he is not recommending the city not do this deal but if they do decide to do it he wants them to be realistic and be committed to funding it hunter said that he has concerns the same as he did with the and merger the numbers did not flow correctly in those projects either and brown worked for the council at that time also he asked what analysis was not done in those projects that is being done here brown said that they used the same methodology on this project he said that he was not on council staff when this process began but since coming on board he has reviewed every number and asked for proof of those numbers which is the same that was done with the merger and he said that with this project however whoever led the effort settled on a number they wanted and worked backward to justify it said that the police and sheriff merger was done twice two units under the sheriff were merged and then reversed he said that he was the interim controller and bond bank director during the merger process the new department of public safety director at that time turner said there would be no savings and more money would be needed because of the merge with the sheriff and then the reversal additional costs were created with changes in cars uniforms administration and transfers so that there was no chance for savings he said that this project will face the same dilemma because the current council and administration will make the decision for a new council that will be seated next year with a new sheriff and mayor in for elected officials to enforce what is being planned now by others is next to impossible and becomes very complicated he said it was the same with the fire station mergers with subsequent leadership not closing stations that were expected to close he said that he will take the blame for there being no savings in the merger but it is always complicated when the people who put the plan together are no longer there to enforce it hunter said that brown alluded that staffing was only at for yet the council approved funded positions brown said that is the net number and they are adding but taking into account an attrition of hunter said that during budget presentations last year the sheriff indicated he was not seeking parity for those deputies who were not paid the same and yet now brown is saying the sheriff is seeking parity which could cost millions brown said that he is referring to an internal parity not parity with officers lewis asked the total cost of the project the way the administration presented it brown said that it is approximately billion lewis asked if they are far off in the calculated difference brown said that a couple of individual lines are not far off but this is not the entire report lewis asked if there is an estimate for another for a building for the prosecutor and public defender brown said that he does not have a number and this concerns him lewis asked if it is safe to say that the entire project with this addition would be more than million brown responded in the affirmative asked about the parking revenue number and asked how far that issue was pursued he added that he thought that community corrections was asked to engage in the landscaping for the facility and he understood they wanted to do that he said he was also told there were signatures from the courts the sheriff and community corrections he asked at what level these signed letters were pursued brown said that million was agreed upon for the paid parking lot but then last week it was raised without further discussion another million this just happened to coincide to the reduction of million in savings from sheriff personnel asked if brown requested the reason for the change brown said that he just received the new numbers yesterday but any increase would assume the council would raise the rates of parking said that this raises the same question of this being an independent review and he would have made an inquiry if numbers changed arbitrarily brown said that he will make inquiries but the burden of proof is not on this body when numbers are being changed at the last minute chair said that it concerns her that they are making decisions to raise parking rates on people who are going to court when many of these folks are on limited incomes have incarcerated family members or were subpoenaed as witnesses she asked if they would be reimbursed brown said that jurors and witnesses would be able to park for free chair said that this is a matter of and she has an issue with raising rates which could deny some accessibility brown said that this is an old trick when revenue is lost to bump up the cost somewhere else to cover that loss chair said that she is a certified public accountant and an attorney and she is very concerned that the contract is based on a mega bonus if the deal gets closed she asked how objective those numbers can be when a bonus is on the line and the fact that those numbers keep moving causes her even more concern she said that a contingency fee takes away objectivity said that she understood there was to be a medical facility within the complex and since a vast majority of arrestees with injury do not require a surgical facility this would seem to result in substantial savings brown said that is referring to inmate care and the sheriff is doing a good job of getting those costs down with less inmates having to be sent to the real issue is with regard to arrestee care and the sheriff has no control over those costs said that she would assume they would be brought to the medical facility in the jail instead of the hospital brown said that according to general orders they are already supposed to send minor injuries to the jail but gunshot wounds and other serious issues require transport to the hospital he said that is saying they are not sending cases to the hospital but the costs do not reflect any change asked if they can receive reimbursement on bills for any offenders who are covered by brown said that with the new bill before the house that could be the case but that bill is not related to this project and there is no guarantee it will pass said that she understood the outlying counties cannot handle the influx of inmates and would be sending some to county brown said that he has heard that but there has been no documentation from any of those counties he said that his instructions in his analysis were not to assume anything that was not a certainty once the city signs on the dotted line with they are liable for paying that bill whether any of these other revenue sources come to fruition or not said that she would not disagree with that but county would be the natural assumption for any overflow brown said that he cannot argue with that but he cannot put assumptions into the analysis based on a feeling said that she feels like a lot of assumptions have been made in this analysis and it feels adversarial she said that she might feel more comfortable if someone from the mayors office were here to address some of the discrepancies and questions being raised by brown brown said that they have been talking about it for months now and they simply cannot see eye to eye he said that his job is to protect the council and the taxpayers said that she feels it would have been more conclusive if someone from the mayors office had been invited to come answer lewis said that she does not want this body to force anyone to take a gift they do not want she said that she was told there were letters signed by these stakeholders she understands that the clerk does not support the project but if the courts and community corrections have signed agreements she feels the committee needs to know that their compliance seems to also be based on a lot of assumptions and they need to have access to those signed letters if they exist she asked if she needs to make a call if the administration is not providing those letters to brown brown said that he can get the committee a copy of the clerk and sheriffs correspondence but what he has seen did not indicate either were in complete agreement with making these reductions for savings said that already expressed that he is uncomfortable with the information that was provided but the real issue is that they cannot get the information they need to make this decision and the project needs to be put on hold until they do said that she has some numbers that she can share with regarding the medical costs she asked why the sheriff and clerk are not comfortable with the reductions she said that she asked what would happen if revenues do not cover the payments to and the answer was that other city services would have to be cut to make those payments or the city would have to find new sources of revenue or raise taxes brown said that if the contract with is signed it will be considered debt by the rating agencies and could impact the credit rating in order not to affect their credit rating the city would have to cut services for additional savings or raise revenue to make the payments hunter asked if the sheriffs budget included in the presentation was actual expenditures or what was budgeted brown said that it was actual expenditures as less was budgeted he said that he can provide hunter with a spend versus budget report if he would like said that it was his understanding that the administration worked with the states public access counsel and went over the documents in detail the states counsel agreed with those items that were deemed confidential and while the councils attorney disagree with that finding that opinion is not rendered arbitrarily and there is a detailed statute that sets out those parameters that the states attorney has to follow he said that there are severe civil and criminal penalties if the public access counsel has made a determination that information is confidential and then it is released to the public he said that he understands the argument that the process should be as transparent as possible for the public but at this stage it is important to follow the law he said that he is not an attorney but as a career law enforcement officer he has read the law and understands it and does not want to go against legal counsel and risk a civil lawsuit chair said that the bigger issue is that the administration argued that certain things are confidential but yet they are making references to or disclosing parts of that information in public meetings said that he does not see what shared as a type of disclosure said that and staff have access to more information than the public but he believes a mistake has been made on this dissemination of material he said that they have redacted almost pages without separating material from which means that the public has effectively been cut out of the said that she was anticipating letters from these entities saying that it was okay to cut their budgets in order to help finance this project she said that these are public safety agencies who have come before the public safety and criminal justice committee requesting more dollars and complaining of cuts the council raised the public safety tax to give them more dollars but they still do not know if it is enough she said that she would like to see those letters brown said that some agencies are claiming they will bring in new revenue said that this is another bigger problem but her understanding is that they agreed to cuts in their budget lewis agreed and said that she would like to see the letters as specific as possible because she does not want them coming to the council during the budget process saying the council did this to them baize shared his qualifications and expertise on deals with the committee and gave a brief presentation attached as exhibit he said that he is not advocating any process but is simply shedding light on the process of deals he explained value for money studies to determine objectivity versus subjectivity and used some examples from an audit and the long beach courthouse project he said that any public private partnership solicitation should have three things in common transparency objectivity and competition he said that in his opinion all three of these are missing from this deal clerks note left at pm asked if when this project is finished could sell it baize said that the city could add language to the project agreement to avoid that but the contract could be transferred he said it would depend on whether it was and most would rather leverage the project and seek international funds hunter said in light of full transparency company has also bid on projects for the city he asked brown if there was no one else in central that would be truly independent on this matter he said that has made some good points but he does not believe he is totally impartial said that he always has an interest in projects but he is only here to advise on the process hunter said that he also has questions about impartiality due to his former appointed positions under a democrat mayor he said he also has some issues with confidence in but wonders if there is no one else anywhere with no connection to provide an impartial analysis brown said that he was asked to take a look at the deal independent of the mayors representatives he said that has been invaluable to him because of his knowledge of the city budget baize was brought in to give his expertise on he said that there are no other experts in that he knows of other than but they are already employed by the mayors office he said that young are also but they also have current deals with the city the council leadership gave him a very small budget to hire additional help with this analysis and it was hard to find someone with no connection whatsoever hunter asked if it is standard in deals to prove credit worthiness for any type of transfer of a contract so that could not just pass the project off to anyone baize said that is just a holding company and their only asset is this project agreement it is just a shell company for show said that there is a provision in the agreement that would not assign any interest except as security of a loan they would have to wait two years after occupancy and would need the consent lewis said that she takes issue with the assertion that this is not an independent analysis the council staff is hired to advise members of the council serve and do not have the resources the mayors office does in a case where there is divided government it is important that each branch have adequate resources and information to make informed decisions she said that it has been hard to find someone totally impartial as the mayor has every democrat lobbyist with experience already involved in this deal she asked committee members not to push back on council staff for doing their job and if it seems like they are leaning one way or another they have tried to provide the most objective analysis they can with the resources they have available chair said that in previous administrations if the council majority was different than the mayors office they were given extra resources she said that mayor does not recognize that the council is a separate branch of government and that he should provide them with better resources asked if brown was open to any difference in findings from other independent folks brown said that he was not charged with evaluating the bid but was simply charged with looking at the process and the numbers he said that when he first saw baizes he did not want to consult him because of his advocation for projects however baize has helped him to understand more about projects which has aided in his analysis said that he encourages an open process and asked if baize has been involved in any part of this process as it has been going on for some time baize said that he was asked to give a workshop on early on and did submit some requests for information however he determined early on that minds had already been made up and he did not believe in the process and bowed out he said that he can count on one hand the groups that bid on these types of projects if it is truly an open process he said that he presented a workshop on the methodologies they could pursue but was not advocating any one model asked if baize does this in other places around the country baize said that he does but the long beach project is the only one that has ever gone forward he said that he provided them with the same analysis he said that he did submit also in county asked if it makes any difference that they have a solid proposal of a certain dollar amount baize said that just because they have a solid proposal on the table it does not mean that it is a good proposal he said that he has not been privy to all the documents especially those that are deemed confidential he said that with any project of this nature there will be additional unavoidable cost escalations due to the bond market and interest rates asked if this assessment is not part of what is engaged to provide baize said that there is a strong advocacy by for going the route and he has seen some solicitations for these types of projects where consultants were threatening to other bidders asked if baize has any direct information that this has happened with this deal baize said that he cannot comment on that lewis asked if is questioning baizes impartiality because he offered a bid baize clarified that he never bid on this project and simply gave a workshop on the process he said that he did discuss some options about five years ago with then deputy mayor chair asked if baizes expertise is more on the general nature of a project baize responded in the affirmative baize stated that foundation has been in this business since when a project is put together a project manager usually sits down with the client and determines what the needs are and then prepares an he said that they do not typically design an in such a way that only allows certain people to respond to it he said that this deal only had three bids but it was not really bid competitively and he is not sure they have the best bid or if they even really have a location where the project can be built said that they do have a location baize said that it will cost million to clean up the site that is targeted said that they are already aware of this baize said that this means they will likely have to come up with another million before they even sign a contract clerks note hunter left at pm a principal for associates said that is an independent firm and they do not make political contributions and try to always keep clients best interests first he said that he was not asked to analyze the entire deal but simply to provide a value for money assessment and critique it he provided a handout to committee members attached as exhibit and said that they used three different models to assess the value for money he said that their assessment shows a flawed he said that he feels it was biased and they overestimated the risk involved he said that this city has done a great job managing its big projects such as with oil stadium bankers life etc and to say they cannot do it again is disingenuous said that is a prime example of the kind of project the taxpayers want taxpayers want the opportunity to give valid input with plenty of information because they are in the end footing the bill he said that leaders will change before this project even begins and it is not something that can happen overnight said that she wondered why they were using such a beautiful property overlooking the water for such a project but then was told it was contaminated she asked if the cleanup of the property is included in the budget or if it is an added cost brown said that there is some cost included for cleanup will do some site work and determine liability issues with respect to what is known and what is unknown said that the soil contamination is already a known factor and the property owner is working on that the city would remain responsible for any claims or liabilities arising out of unknowns they have already entered into an agreement with the department of environmental management idem to provide vapor barriers which the city will pay for would be responsible for any new or exacerbated contamination that occurs during development the current property owner racer trust is responsible for any known contamination at this time the city would be liable for vapor mitigation and unknown contamination claims asked if there is money included for that said that the city has a pollution liability insurance policy that should cover any unknowns asked if general motors gm is then taking responsibility for the known contamination cleanup said that he does not know exactly how racer trust is financed but it was created as part of bankruptcy proceedings to dispose of the abandoned real estate said that she thought back during mayor administration there was some environmental cleanup initiated on this site before they went back on the insurance bond said that this is why racer is now asked why this full remediation would not fall back on racer before the city takes on the property said that it is his understanding that the property will not be completely cleaned before the city takes ownership according to the schedule said that it seems this would still be responsibility said
