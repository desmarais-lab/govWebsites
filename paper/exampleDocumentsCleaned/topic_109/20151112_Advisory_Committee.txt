to current consent decree achieve overflows in the typical year and provide for solids removal and disinfection of all overflows achieve compliance with water quality standard proposed changes to the

count shall not exceed one hundred per one hundred milliliters as a geometric mean based on not less than five samples equally spaced over a thirty day period nor exceed two hundred per one hundred milliliters in any one sample in a thirty day period under rule a is responsible for not causing the pollution of a downstream water under rule of the the st river must be protected for total body contact recreation from to microorganisms all waters of the state protected for total body contact recreation shall not contain more than per ml as a day geometric mean compliance shall be based on the geometric mean of all individual samples taken during five or more sampling events representatively spread over a day period each sampling event shall consist of three or more samples taken at representative locations within a defined sampling area at no time shall the waters of the state protected for total body contact recreation contain more than a maximum of per ml compliance shall be based on the geometric mean of three or more samples taken during the same sampling event at representative locations within a defined sampling area volume mg annual precipitation inches annual precipitation in annual overflow volume mg water quality modeling efforts of the st river began in the early when south bend initiated their first combined sewer overflow study a joint effort between south bend was adopted in the early in response to regulatory requirements phase i developed water quality model on st rivers phase ii developed a watershed model for the tributaries to evaluate the impact of those sources most recent model update was in to evaluate revisions to the for all three cities last calibration period was from to model updates needed new reduced overflow volumes incorporate and control programs into upstream conditions include assumption about source reductions calibrate model to new data provide a consistent endpoint to evaluate the water quality impact of the alternatives being developed optimize water quality benefits of integrated planning south bend total volume million gallons total volume million gallons total volume million gallons the purpose of model calibration is to adjust certain model parameters to match the data to the best extent possible calibration period of selected to cover two full recreation seasons and based on data available covers a variety of environmental conditions based on data available for inputs reports weather data utilized both statistical graphical methods to verify the model calibration the model will be used to make predictions of future conditions when data is not available using typical year inputs for environmental conditions river mile kl state line kl bridge kl street bridge kl start of east race kl

indicates that it is capable of reproducing the timing and magnitude of most of the observed data the water quality model is a suitable tool for assessing impacts of various control strategies being

capability and integrated planning impacts formulation of regulatory strategy prepared for south bend has an water quality monitoring program on the st river there are four current sampling locations in the city st bridge boundary with ave bridge ave bridge road bridge downstream of city samples are taken weekly and analyzed for concentration samples from compared with samples from to review impact of projects implemented median concentrations are lower in than in fewer discharge events collected in sampling data lowers the median concentrations highest concentrations are similar between both time periods when discharge the maximum concentrations is similar to past years the range of normally encountered concentrations is lower in than in there are improvements upstream and in the watershed that have lowered the incoming concentrations there is an increase in concentrations as the river travels through the city both during dry weather and wet weather source st tributaries
