active asset management by managing contracts and entitlements aligning service resources with it infrastructure library standards and realizing asset over the next few weeks will be installed and configured to start scanning and discovering assets once the discovery is reviewed and validated it will be merged with the data stored in lex is a much more robust and efficient asset management

sometimes offensive email commonly called it is estimated that well over of the approximately seventy thousand email messages received daily through our email gateway are that translates to a daily average of over fifty thousand email messages is detrimental to the efficient operation of in many ways its most costly impact is lost productivity users waste time separating messages from business related messages valid email messages get lost amongst the messages additionally this influx of unsolicited email messages posses security challenges that require the need for an solution is a vector for potentially costly attacks email is one of the favorite hacker propagation techniques utilized to mount todays blended threats this increases the risk of downtime and cleanup costs research states that deploying an technology will help reduce expected losses and protect employee productivity to protect our organization from virus attacks and to protect you from receiving hundreds of messages an email filter will be deployed to processes and filter all incoming email this application is projected to be rolled starting how does email filtering work the solution will process all incoming email

additional clarification clarification has been provided an investigator has been assigned to investigate the possible impact of making the change and of not making the change the investigator has recommended a specific resolution one of the following actions has been taken the selected solution has been authorized for implementation no decision has been made the change request will be addressed again later the change request has been combined with another change request or submitted as a program change rejected the change request has been rejected because it is not relevant or because the expected impact of making the change is greater than the impact of not making the change the individual with approval authorization has signed off on resolution of the change request at this point the change request is considered closed issues management procedures project issues are items that arise during a project that prevent a portion of the project from proceeding until they are resolved publishing all rights reserved of work city of county in anyone involved in the project identify an issue and bring it to the client and project manager it will be the responsibility of the project manager in consultation with the project sponsor to secure approval rejection or deferral of the issue and to determine the appropriate resolution the project sponsors have final resolution responsibility for the issue will keep record of both open and closed issues in the project issue log database these will be discussed weekly at the regular status meeting issue is identified issue is triaged issue is escalated issue is assigned issue is reviewed an issue is defined as something that impede project progress success issue is prioritized based on likelihood of occurrence and impact issue is escalated to the individual responsible for facilitating resolution of the issue issue is assigned to those individuals who are best equipped to provide a resolution target resolution date is the persons to whom the issue was assigned is responsible for managing and reporting the issue to resolution risk management mitigation procedures project risks are items that have a high probability of preventing the project from being delivered on time in budget according to specifications the project manager will identify and track risk items weekly so that progress can be communicated to the project governance team the project will follow the risk management process detailed below identification quantification response control track communication determine which risks are a threat to the project and document each risk evaluate rank and prioritize risks based on their impact probability and transform risk information into a risk management plan that defines how each risk will be dealt with control the risk execute the risk mitigation actions identified then monitor and adjust risk response as needed keep all project stakeholders aware of the risks
