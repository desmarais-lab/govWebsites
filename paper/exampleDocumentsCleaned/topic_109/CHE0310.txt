economic impact of laws based on case studies a review of new state performed by the departments of finance health mental hygiene small business services and economic development and an article referring to a tobacco industry study of new air act clerks note these documents are attached as exhibits a and she stated that this evenings hearing will focus on the hospitality perspective hospitality perspective restaurant hospitality association john president stated that he represents the hospitality industry on many issues and he is here tonight to oppose a smoking ban in restaurants he said that restaurant owners want to keep the welcome mat out for everyone and they also want to keep the welcome mat out in for convention business the associations opposition to this ordinance is a philosophical one as many of their restaurants have already gone he said that the association represents a broad spectrum of hospitality establishments including hotels fine dining casual dining and neighborhood restaurants said that he is not a smoker but people who smoke have a right to assemble with other people who smoke just as he has a right to assemble with people who do not smoke the proposal to ban smoking in privately owned and operated businesses is an unwarranted and unnecessary infringement on the civil liberties of individual citizens and the property rights of business owners he stated that individuals have given up far too many personal freedoms and rights to the government already and have accepted limitations in the name of security religious values or political correctness this proposal takes away the right of business owners to make a business decision and the right of individuals to choose what businesses they patronize throughout the history of this country freedom has been expanded and choices enlarged for citizens but unfortunately today there are efforts to use the police powers of the government to impose the preferences of some on everyone government health environment committee should do just the opposite and seek to jealously protect the rights of all citizens to make their own choices whenever possible government is within its rights to ban smoking on public property but the line should be drawn at private property he said this is one of the strictest proposals he has seen across the country in county half of the associations members are and only allow smoking throughout their business a growing number of restaurants limit smoking to only their bar area or a separate room these environments are being provided in a city that has no smoking restrictions the hospitality industry is providing consumers with choices and responding to the wishes of its customers referred to a website that shows which restaurants offer smoking and which do not a solution will not work for everyone passage of a smoking ban would result in economic hardship for those county businesses with a customer base that includes a large percentage of smokers there is no need to endanger any business endanger the job of any employee or discourage conventions and visitors to the community should let the current state law and the marketplace continue to provide choices to everyone urged those who feel passionately about the need for a ban to simply patronize the growing number of restaurants that choose to be he stated that in the proposed smoking ban was defeated for the third year in a row one of the factors for making that decision was a study done by the restaurant association about the economic impact he provided a copy of this report and testimony for committee members clerks note a copy of this report is on file in the council office with the original set of minutes chair thanked for his testimony she stated that after all presenters have spoken she will allow questions and comments as they relate specifically to the information presented this evening she said that there will be many more opportunities for nonspecific public input at four public forums the first one to be held on slippery noodle owner stated that he is opposed to proposal no not because it deals with smoking but because it deals with another government regulation of private property the slippery noodle inn employs approximately people and does close to million a year in food sales they allow minors in the atrium area which is a nonsmoking area during their lunch and dinner hours this is in response to conventions that come to town and shows proposal no demands a fundamental change in the nature of his business this would change the entire attitude and atmosphere of his establishment people want to socialize in a relaxed fun atmosphere and drinking and smoking tend to go together sixty percent of their customers have told them they would come to the noodle less often if smoking was not allowed the business owners would have to enforce the ban pay the fines and risk losing their licenses thus putting them out of business said that this proposal would prohibit him from smoking in his own office in his own building during health environment committee hours when the noodle is closed the noodles business deals with many things that are considered unhealthy such as alcohol red meat late hours and fried foods which of these things will be the next public health item from which citizens need to be protected he provided a copy of an article attached as exhibit by a researcher and writer who says better than he can why he opposes this proposal quoted from the article and stated that the real problem is that the government is trying to legislate what private business owners and private citizens do on private property he said that his employees and clients know that a visit to his establishment includes exposure to some smoke he said that he has no problem putting up or wording on job applications warning of the exposure to smoke but he has a problem with the government telling him what he can do on private property with a legal and subsidized product owner stated that he is the president and chief executive officer of the company that owns and operates is a martini and cigar bar located just off monument circle at north meridian street he said that the proposed ordinance would literally put his establishment out of business therefore the owners customers suppliers and employees take this proposed ordinance very seriously he said that their plea is straightforward please do not use the power of government to wipe out a growing business and source of employment and enjoyment for so many of your constituents and fellow citizens the of clearly identifies the establishment as a martini and cigar bar and only adults over the age of are permitted to enter the premises including employees which they call associates everyone who therefore enters knows that alcohol will be served and cigars will be smoked the food served at is best described as appetizers and people do not come to this establishment for dinner their customers come to to relax with a beverage have conversation listen to good jazz music and if they care to smoke a cigar or cigarette if anyone walked into their establishment and was surprised to find someone smoking it would be reminiscent of a scene in where the police chief is shocked to find gambling going on in casino if martinis and cigars are not to a persons liking they can and should walk on by he said that opened in in the old king restaurant building and established a thriving business as an upscale nightclub for downtown they took a big risk in doing so but their business became so popular that they moved across the street to the guarantee building and doubled their square footage even increasing space they still have a line outside on and and business continues to grow invested over of their own money not borrowing a dime to completely renovate the downstairs of their current building including every technique to improve air circulation and air quality he said that spent for the best air circulation system on the market this system is serviced monthly and the air is changed seven times an hour they have done everything they can do to reduce the amount of smoke in their establishment but there health environment committee are still times when those who cannot stand smoke be uncomfortable he said that the sale of cigars represents of total annual revenue and they are the largest seller of cigars in the state of they sold of tobacco products in he said that if smoking were prohibited in their establishment they could not make up those sales in alcohol and food he said that appeals to a very narrow range of customers who enjoy the total experience of relaxation conversation an adult beverage good jazz and perhaps a cigarette or cigar banning smoking in their establishment would be like removing balls and pins from a bowling alley and expecting them to make up lost revenue by selling more beer and adding more pinball machines the company is a business is locally owned and succeeds or fails on the success or failure of if this proposal were to be enacted they would have to consider shutting down on meridian street and moving across the th street line into county to recreate the market there said that testimony at the first hearing indicated that this ordinance was trying to protect employees and not necessarily customers he said that their associates are the cream of the crop of the hospitality industry they are extremely talented individuals who could get a job at any hotel or restaurant in the city there is very low turnover at but when there is an opening there are dozens and dozens of applicants waiting for that position their servers can make up to and bartenders can make up to offers a full benefits package including medical dental disability and life insurance the best help this committee could be to employees is to not put them out of business he said that this proposal does exempt certain businesses and there is ample precedent across the country to exempt businesses such as theirs he asked that the council consider the consequences to if proposal no is enacted in its current form buffalo wild wings mike mike owner of buffalo wild wings downtown and owner of four dicks barbecue franchises two of which are in county stated that two of his restaurants choose to be nonsmoking and the other three have smoking in their bar areas he is an avid nonsmoker is allergic to cigarette smoke and has three small children that he does not allow around cigarette smoke however he can take his family to buffalo wild wings without subjecting them to cigarette smoke because there is a nonsmoking section with separately ventilated air he said that this is a matter of freedom and he has friends who are fighting for freedom in who have emailed him that they cannot wait to come home and have a beer a cigarette and some wings in his establishment to tell them that they cannot do so is incomprehensible to him he said that he is tired of government telling business owners what they can and cannot do thus taking away their freedoms health environment committee outback steakhouse john john representative for outback steakhouse who has been in the restaurant business for years stated that all of his restaurants originally had no separate nonsmoking sections however their customers demanded a nonsmoking section and they complied he said that in both fort and the smoking bans greatly affected their restaurants and they have not recovered anyone who owns a business in county especially those that border the county line will be put at an unfair disadvantage smokers will go over the county line and tax dollars will be lost percent of their current are smokers he oversees restaurants and the majority of their smoking sections are only in the bar areas he said that the council should let the customers decide what restaurants should offer general hotels vice chairman of general hotels stated that they own and operate six hotels in and operate the restaurant he said they do have some nonsmoking areas in their restaurants and some bar areas that allow smoking throughout with some that have nonsmoking areas he said that when the formula race was here last year they put up a cigar and martini bar on a hotel floor at the airport and sold in cigars in two days their hotel at the airport actually has all public areas designated as nonsmoking and like most hotels has of their rooms allotted for smokers he said that totally eliminating the right to smoke is unconstitutional he said that he currently serves on the chamber of commerce smoking task force and he has provided a copy of their recommendations to the committee attached as exhibit he said that while he is not a smoker he is an and thus lives in a free society and those who want to smoke should be allowed to do so he said that their employees do not seem to mind the smoke because they are being allowed to make a good living he said that it is more of a freedom issue and he hopes there are some compromises that can be made with this wise wise owner of locations in and west said that he serves on the hospitality association and supports the association in opposing this ban however all three of his restaurants are one mandated by the city of he said that he is a nonsmoker but does not profess to be a smart man a doctor or a legislator he is however a proud and what he loves about this country is the capitalist society of competition he said that in his business there is one thing that dictates how he does business and that is money he said that people will vote with their dollars and their patronization if they do not want to eat at a restaurant then they will go to one where smoking is allowed if he finds that he loses customers because of his decisions he can then make changes to accommodate the market he said that he does not need health environment committee the government telling him how to run his business he asked if this proposal goes forward then what will be the next element government will try and regulate will they then tell him what kind of oil in which he should fry his food halls grill don bud hall bud hall owner of the grill on street and several restaurants in fort said that at one time he owned restaurants in fort but the smoking ban enacted there in has caused him to close three restaurants with two more in danger of closing he said that the fort ordinance did allow for smoking areas that were sealed off in a restaurant the restaurants that will be hurt the most by this type of regulation will be the small independently owned restaurants he said that all of the restaurants he had to close were neighborhood restaurants and he could not afford to divide these restaurants into separate rooms because of the layout of the buildings he said that he employed to people at each of these restaurants with sales of approximately million a year for each establishment all of these restaurants had been in operation for over years but sales were down eight to twelve percent and it was too difficult to make up that difference he said that the restaurant business is fragile and little things make an establishment sink or swim such as cleanliness service chuckholes in the parking lot and providing smoking areas restaurants that are open hours a day experience an influx of smoking customers after bars close early in the morning mornings after church hours these same restaurants receive mostly nonsmoking customers he said that five of his restaurants had bars and it was easy to seal off the bar areas he has friends who have invested their life savings into their business and a regulation like this can kill them he said that is a great town and this ordinance will hurt the independent restaurants that give this city its flavor and personality place for steaks said that was present earlier but had to leave because his restaurant received a large party of people and he needed to attend to that situation chair said that the have some questions to ask of those who have testified so far she stated that since the concept of the military fighting for freedom was brought up she would like to say that she is a mother of a united states marine who is currently serving in she said that while she encourages the passion that is shown to protect the rights of military personnel her son did not get the opportunity to vote because he was insuring that the right to vote was protected if anyone therefore wants to fight for the rights of those who fight to keep this country free she would encourage them to fight for rights to vote health environment committee said that he would like someone to address the public health issue of employees he said that in his district there is a unemployment rate and most of the people who work in bars and restaurants in his neighborhood do not have the option to say they will not work in a place where smoking is allowed hall said that most employees come in knowing the environment in which they are going to be working he said that with regards to employees who are sensitive to smoke he accommodates their wishes and lets them work in the nonsmoking areas he said that during debates surrounding the fort ordinance a study was done with nonsmokers who worked in smoking sections and there were no negative toxins found in their bloodstream said that he has three servers who are nonsmokers and he asked them where they preferred to work these individuals preferred to work in the smoking section because they believed they could make more money with these said that the majority of associates smoke and they are concerned that if this ordinance is passed they will have no place downtown to smoke he said that they offer health insurance and have done everything they can architecturally and to move air through their establishment he said that their employees do not have a lot of sickness make a good living and are happy working in this environment oliver said that saying that the government is intruding on private rights is not really accurate as the government is made up of ordinary citizens like everyone who has spoken this evening and this is an issue of health and safety he said that they are trying to find a middle ground to protect of the public that does not smoke there are many laws people do not like that help protect the health and safety of citizens such as speed limits in school zones and no dumping allowed in the river he said that the goal of this proposal is not to run any company out of business or create new businesses however they need to find a balance he said that movies like glamorize smoking and it seems like the way to many people but is still a health hazard it should be a personal choice however and not harm those that choose not to smoke said that he agrees that a compromise is needed and a good balance needs to be found he said that proposal no is too strict and will put many independent owners out of business agreed and said that they are not against every regulation to guard health and safety but feel people should have the choice to enter an establishment that allows smoking he said that restaurants are not against all regulations and government acts he said that they welcomed the new food health environment committee codes that helped them to provide safe food to customers he said that they support regulations that are fair and provide choices for people said that this proposal offers some good debate and as a trial lawyer he loves asking questions and promoting good debate he said that used words like unwarranted and unnecessary intrusion and that the proposal being offered was to protect preferences of some people he said that repeatedly emphasized that there was no need for this type of government intrusion he asked if can tell the committee that there is no health risk from second hand smoke at all said that in his judgment this is not a debate about health while he is sure smoking is bad for ones health and is why he quit smoking there is still some debate about the effects of secondhand smoke but it probably is not good for ones health however he believes it does not matter to this debate as there are plenty of places people can go without secondhand smoke without having to regulate privately owned businesses said that said he could not refute the fact that secondhand smoke is harmful to health therefore it is debatable that there is a need for the council to take action because of that health hazard he added that it was testified there would be a harm to the hospitality industry if this proposal is passed but it would probably not be a harm that was noticeable said that it will not put the hospitality industry out of business but there will be an economic impact on individual properties that currently allow smoking and on segments of the industry said that he hopes people do vote with their wallets and that those of county residents who do not smoke will not patronize those establishments that are putting these carcinogens and health hazards in the air he asked if by saying that his outback steakhouse has not recovered from the smoking ban that the store has actually closed said that they have not yet given up the fight and it is a matter of nickels and dimes he said that although of residents not smoke they also want the that do smoke to visit their restaurants said that said of their customers smoke and others make the choice whether or not to come into their restaurant he asked if those who come into a restaurant that allows smoking are fully informed about how dangerous secondhand smoke is and that it kills and hospitalizes almost county residents each year he asked if they are informed that county spends million to treat the diseases caused by secondhand smoke said that this is not a question his customers are asking and he has never had that conversation with any customer he said that customers can go to a nonsmoking establishment any day of the week as there are plenty of them available but they choose to come to his restaurant where there is a smoking section he said he does not know if they are educated on the issue of secondhand smoke health environment committee said that testified that soldiers serving in are looking forward to coming back and having a drink and cigarette at his establishment he asked if the laws already do not dictate how much one of these soldiers can drink he said if they get behind a wheel after drinking too much at an establishment they would be committing a crime he said that it seems the government has a right to impose a cutoff on legal substances when they become too dangerous to someone else said that he does not see the connection he said that he does not smoke but went to with some of his employees recently although it was too smoky for him it is a great place and they should stay in business because they are serving a certain said that the committee has invited these individuals to the meeting this evening to share their views and opinions on this proposal and it is important for committee members not to lecture but simply gather the information and use it to make informed decisions said that he fully respects everyones viewpoint and this is an important debate in which everyone should be allowed to participate he said that it is a difficult decision as they are charged with protecting a governmental system focused on individual rights he said that his law practice is based on individual rights however there is a place for government to step in such as with the food quality regulations he said that his questions are designed to get more information to help the community make the right decision and he does not pretend that his views should be the views that carry the day stated that many have said this proposal goes too far yet the majority respect some of the things the committee is trying to do with this ordinance he said that asked the committee to find a way to include an exemption for an organization like his to provide service for that segment of the population that wants to have a nice cigar and martini in a social setting he said that the question is how the legislative body can define that exemption so that it is fair to all how does the committee balance that exception against the public health issue and without showing favoritism to one establishment over another said that he would be more than happy to offer formal proposals for exemption language he said that this is so important to the continuation of his business that he could not offer such language off the top of his head this evening plowman said that he is not a voting member of this committee but this issue is important to him and he feels it is a shame that the council is trying to infringe on individual rights of businesses and taxpayers in county he said that with the mayor threatening to lay off policemen and firefighters courts and judges dealing with an overcrowded jail and an increase in crime in the health environment committee townships that the council would have more important things to do with their time than put businesses out of business and take tax dollars away from county he said that compromise was mentioned and he believes that every aspect should be explored because once the government gets inside they never give up he said that the council needs to be careful what they do with this issue as it will put some people out of business and cause hardships on providing for their families if this is the most important issue the council has to address then vote on it this evening and get on with what is really important said that someone needs to prove to him that secondhand smoke actually causes death he said that he does not know of any death certificate or coroners report that lists secondhand smoke as the cause of death chair said that the next meeting will feature presentations from a medical perspective and there will be ample opportunity to ask that question of those presenters said that he is a and although he has a policy inside his establishment smoking is allowed outside on his deck he said that government could decide that red meat and sugar is bad because they lead to heart attacks and try to ban those as well he added that his district as well as chair and districts are just six minutes from the county line property owners in this area got hit with huge tax increases and this would be just another concern that would cause businesses and commerce to leave county especially in his district he said that even though of the population not smoke they still go to these establishments he said that outback steakhouse is a national chain their profits can fluctuate and they can shift dollars to other places with shortfalls he said that he contacted a friend who does a lot of work with the alcoholic beverage commission and approximately of all alcoholic beverage retailers and hotels are in county if those would have to go that is a big percentage of the counties and the losses could be astronomical he said that many of these establishments have to pay tobacco licenses so they already pay fees he said that this ordinance goes after an industry that invests tons of money into the economy by changing the rules on them in the middle of the game he said that while some of the national chains lose some business the small privately owned businesses will be the hardest hit if this ordinance is passed he said that these owners pay sales tax and food and beverage tax and if people decide to go home for an extra drink in order to smoke there will be a loss of tax revenue he said that these people work to hours a week and invest so much time and effort into their businesses and the community he said that he does not support this ordinance said that with regards to a compromise he believes the only compromise is to do nothing and let the marketplace determine changes that need to be made health environment committee stated that plowman said that the council had other things to focus on that were more important as an employee of the sheriffs department plowman is concerned with public safety and agrees that public safety is the councils first priority he said that in there were homicides in county according to peer review statistics almost people die every year in county due to secondhand diseases he said that this is therefore still an important asked what kind of ideas he has to craft a compromise to help protect citizens health yet act fairly with all businesses said that he is a nonsmoker but is also a businessman and enjoys doing business in a free society he said that he cares about employees and he asks them to smoke outside he said that this ordinance is simply too strict and it will put establishments like out of business and it is not fair to them or to those who wish to smoke in a social atmosphere he said that is a country and other cities have adopted this ban but are not doing as well as reported he said that nonsmoking areas have increased in restaurants because the market has demanded it and that is the way it should be and this should be a issue said that he is willing to find a compromise that works but he is very concerned about the health of the community he said that some of halls businesses suffered because they did not have the wherewithal to make the structural changes required by the new ordinance in fort he said that this proposal does not allow for those kind of structural differences and this law would affect both small and large businesses the same way hall said that there will still be a loss of business a large national chain will survive but a small business cannot absorb losses like a large chain he said that when small businesses go out of business then customers will flow to the national chains eventually he said that without banning smoking in restaurants and bars across the nation or banning smoking altogether this type of ordinance will simply beat up the small businesses he said that the ordinance does not allow a sealed room but he was just explaining the problems they faced when going in fort he said that there are many costly dynamics to the restaurant business that no one but a business owner would completely understand and this is a very complicated issue hall asked if any input was sought from when this ordinance was drafted stated that these forums were designed to include public input from both the industry and individual citizens hall said that small business owners cannot be ignored and he would love to meet with the committee to work out some compromises because he fully understands this business he said that when the government begins to mess with a very complicated issue without all the facts it will kill some of these small business health environment committee owners said that this is the value of the governmental process as it is a great way for the council to learn and make an informed thanked all for their comments and said that the debate is not served however when extremes and inflammatory language is used such as it will kill them although the loss of a business is very debilitating such statements diminish the lives of people who actually lose their lives to secondhand smoke and cannot live to fight another day and are not given another chance hall said that most individuals that die of secondhand diseases are exposed at greater levels and more prolonged terms than what they would get for an occasional meal in a restaurant most of these incidents are caused in the home where a family member smokes on a regular said that the way the council usually does business is to put an issue on the table and hold hearings before reaching a final decision he said that there will be six hearings on this ordinance and committee members will stay as long as needed to listen and give this issue the attention it deserves stated that the chamber of commerce has provided a position statement on this proposal and one of the items refers to a smoking ban in establishments which permit customers under the age of to enter the establishment he said that the problem he has with that is that an entity like the slippery noodle inn which is a big part of the convention service for and has a family room during the day would no longer be able to offer that service he said there are lots of other places in broad ripple that are the same he said that in establishments where only those over the age of are allowed people already know the dangers before they enter warnings are written on the cigarettes and on alcoholic beverages and it is a choice however this ordinance is way over the top and goes too far said that in the council considered a smoking ban ordinance that was much less restrictive than this proposal three of the sponsors of the proposal before the committee this evening are new to the council since that time and are not familiar with the history on this issue the council took a very slow path during those discussions and included members of the hospitality industry in a group comprised of much more than just council members this ordinance still failed he said that he believes representatives of the hospitality industry should have been involved much earlier and he hopes members of this committee will give credence to what they have to say chair said that the purpose of these hearings is to get substantial input from all areas affected by this ordinance she said that the community is in a health environment committee much different place than it was a couple of years ago and there has been extensive research into this proposal and many public hearings will be held before any final recommendation is made to the council she said that this is a very important issue and everyone will be heard said that due to the hours these meetings are conducted many of his employees cannot attend because they are working he provided a petition signed by his employees with their opinions regarding this proposal he added that children are more exposed to secondhand smoke outside of the restaurant environment and most of this exposure takes place in their own homes from parents who smoke chair thanked those business owners who have spoken and invited them to stay for further questions at the end of the rest of the presentations she said that there will be public forums held on and and so possibly these dates can allow some employees to attend when they are not working county licensed beverage association mark mark attorney for the county chapter of the licensed beverage association stated that many of their members are bar and tavern owners he said that he is not here to discuss smokers rights or dispute the health data they are asking that the committee oppose the ordinance for one reason the fact that it will hurt their businesses a smoking ban would cause a decline in customers for many bar owners while it not happen the day after a ban took effect the loss of profits would eventually become apparent a few unprofitable months would force many small business owners out of business the national chains be able to withstand an adjustment period but not the small independently owned family businesses he said that these owners know their customers and every decision they make is geared to make their customers happy and make their businesses successful some of their members have become nonsmoking establishments because that is what their customers want others are scared that their customers will not come back if the smoking ban is passed if this ordinance becomes law these owners will be forced to become enforcement police as well as being fined for what might take place within feet of their establishment he said that some smokers take their business away from establishments near the county line to other restaurants or bars outside the county where smoking is allowed this ordinance puts restaurant owners in the middle of a fight between government and the tobacco industry showed stacks of petitions from restaurant owners who oppose the smoking ban he said that these businesses are valuable to providing employment for citizens and contributing to the tax base food and beverage taxes have helped to fund numerous building projects around the county trying to clean the air of on the backs of these small independent business owners is about as fair as trying to balance the state budget on the backs of state employees independently owned health environment committee establishments already face tough competition from national chains and this further hinders their ability to compete living room lounge owner of the living room lounge stated that the establishment has been located at since with four different owners she said that she has been a smoker since the age of and is aware of what smoking can do to herself and those around her she said that she has made that choice and no one has forced her to smoke she said that she cannot compete with the or slippery noodle type establishments the living room lounge is a small business that survives on a basis she said that the of the lounge is extremely eclectic with people that live paycheck to paycheck eight out of ten of them are smokers with almost every table occupied by two or three smokers during the lunch hour she said that many customers come there to unwind and have a drink or cigarette before going home late night in the bar there are many customers who work in the hospitality industry downtown and come to her establishment to have a drink and cigarette before going home if this law passes she would have to probably cut half of her staff of employees her customers have told her that they would come less often or not at all if smoking was banned she said that she would have to cut entertainment as well and does not have a corporate headquarters she can fall back on to sustain her everyone is aware of the health hazards of smoke but this is about business and people and business owners should be allowed to make their own decisions hogans pub hogan hogan owner of hogans pub said that his establishment has been in operation since the early with different owners he said that he and his wife have owned the bar for years and have completely remodeled it he said that of their patrons are elderly smokers he said trying to tell one of his female euchre playing customers to put down her cigarette would be next to impossible he said that the pub has three employees one of which does not smoke yet works at another bar and chooses to work in those environments their fans and filters are serviced every month and it is a very respectable neighborhood place which neighbors enjoy frequenting he said that they own the building the land and pay the taxes and should therefore have the right to say what goes on inside the business he said that at years old he was not allowed to drink or buy cigarettes but his country could send him to the republic of to be shot twice he has fought for himself and the rights of others to live in a free country and this ordinance would take those freedoms away he said that if they have to go there is no doubt in his mind he will have to close within a very short time if closes in the beech grove area almost people will lose their jobs which will also affect his establishment and this is just another factor that will impact his livelihood health environment committee chair said that she understands the concerns about loss of business but the focus of this ordinance is really on the health of employees and their right to have a clean air environment she said that the living room lounge has some of the best burgers and homemade chips in town as well as excellent staff but she has to admit she usually has to purchase carryout because she cannot handle the smoke she asked if business owners have considered that they might gain some new customers by going ms said that the sales she has between pm and am triples any purchases made before that time she said that when she passed around petitions to her customers out of customers only two did not sign the petition she said that karaoke on a night is her best business and most of that smokes chair said that there might be many others who would enjoy karaoke or other social activities who might come out if they did not have to contend with the smoke she said that she is one person who would actually come in and sit down and eat if the lounge were ms said that she cannot rely on the possibility of new customers which not happen said that he worked in the field of alcoholic beverages around the state for almost years he said that the ordinance already exempts private clubs and for many small taverns around the state these businesses are like a private club he said that knights of legion and moose lodges have children in the bar areas and exposed to smoke and this is allowed because they are a social club he said that these taverns are a social club for many and it is a personal decision whether a person sits down in an establishment or orders carryout he said that these taverns are the working mans friend and it is the regular customers who really pay the bills said that although the argument has been made that more people will come if the establishment is there is no guarantee or evidence to support the premise that the same number of nonsmokers would come in and purchase the same amount of food and beverage to help these establishments stay solvent he said that it is not possible to get a bank loan based on this premise stated that if he owned a small tavern he would also be scared of this ordinance and so he understands the fear he said that in new state there are many upscale establishments in manhattan but just as many small neighborhood taverns in like those represented here this evening he said that studies have been done on the effect on all types of businesses the new department of finance for the state of new shows that tax receipts for bars and restaurants are up since the act this is not a study done by a health organization or tobacco company but by the department of finance he said that there are some studies that show evidence that there is a bounce back though it might be hard to believe or understand at this stage he would like owners to keep an open mind and consider what is going on in other communities amusement and music operators association bill president health environment committee and a executive director executive director of the national dart association stated that the national dart association is headquartered here in and they represent amusement vendors she said that of their equipment is located in bars and taverns from to new from to from to they have heard from their members the effects of smoking bans on their businesses consistently there has been a to drop in revenues when smoking bans are enacted three years after the ban in for those amusement operators still in business they are still at a decrease from revenue experienced before the ban these operators are typically small businesses whose main customers are local neighborhood bars and taverns if these close the operators have to take their equipment and store it in warehouses if there is nowhere else to place it ms said that in their ordinance allows smoking in establishments where less than of revenue is due to food sales so many of these bars close their kitchens to remain a smoking establishment the result is that people then drink more and eat nothing to absorb the alcohol she said that these businesses also suffer due to county lines and neighboring counties taking away customers because they allow smoking ms said that she is also the executive director of the amusement and music operators association an organization for amusement businesses she said that the public outcry in forced a referendum vote to rescind the full ban because of the revenue loss bill president of and owner of four restaurants and a company called amusements stated that he has been in business since he said that each member of the committee should have received some background material prior to this meeting he said that most of the studies referenced on secondhand smoke could be questioned and there is equal data opposing the validity of these studies as there is data giving credence to them however since he is not a medical doctor he can concede that secondhand smoke is dangerous however he cannot concede that revenues are not affected by smoking bans in this business he said that he does not know if only of the population of county smokes but he does know that on a or night almost of his customers are smokers suggesting that he will replace those customers with nonsmoking customers or keep all of those smokers is simply not accurate nonsmokers are not visiting his establishments and this is not a real issue he stated that in the citizens overrode the decision of the council and this is good government in his opinion when the citizens actually get to make the decisions they have statistical data that shows that smoking bans decrease revenue for amusements by which is directly related to bar and tavern revenue a bar is different from a restaurant due to televised sports games health environment committee darts pool tables and other amusements offered that are not offered in restaurants this would retain customers for a longer period of time than in a restaurant for a meal many will go home to socialize and these bars and restaurants will suffer said that he sent information to each in whose district his establishments are located including and invited these to meet with him and discuss this bans impact on his business and customers he got replies from two of the four of which was not one who responded he said that right after mayor was elected the first time he decided to take away the personal rights provided to violent video distributors he said that the coin operators industry fought that legislation and won a settlement if businesses do not fight these things on a personal level the government will continue to take away more and more freedoms said that he did receive invitation for a meeting but it is hard for him to accommodate every single person who wants to meet with him on an issue that is why they schedule these types of public forums to hear all sides of the issue he said that others in attendance tonight have also called him for meetings such as and it is just not possible to meet all requests as quickly as he would like oliver said that there is a profit associated with cigarettes and those sales affect the economy smoking is legal government sanctioned subsidized and also unfortunately addictive he said that it his hard to find a middle ground so that rights of businesses and smokers are not violated but nonsmokers health is protected said that many restaurants will not be affected adversely and will actually benefit because they would like to be but are scared to lose business however this is not true for all establishments while the industry as a whole will probably remain flat since some prefer and many restaurants will flourish there will be numerous individual restaurants that will be devastated and will have to close their doors this is the danger with solutions because not all businesses are alike and these businesses need to have the freedom to respond to the market and serve their it is not reasonable to think some of these establishments can make up of their business with new nonsmoking customers the large chain restaurants will survive and the small independents will be put out of said that a lot of people call him and ask to meet with him personally on an issue but he thinks it is very important to hold these public hearings which are broadcast live on television and help to get views out to the public he said that it is better to have open public meetings on an issue rather than several small private meetings which are not open to the public health environment committee chair called for public testimony on any of the materials offered this evening bill brother of stated that it seems the biggest concern is about government intervention and where the line should be drawn he said that people died two years ago in a night club fire because of violation of safety ordinances in island people died in another night club fire because of using pyrotechnics without a permit or sprinkler system he added that the th terrorist attack led to better security at airports and the brawl at the pacers and pistons basketball game led to better security measures for players he said that this is the same type of challenge with secondhand smoke exposure the community and council need to work together to come up with a good balance for protection he said that emphasized that there was no need for the ordinance but as a customer at many of these restaurants he is bothered by the smoke and spends less time there than he would if they were all of those who testified said that they are not medical experts so if it is left up to them as to how smoking sections are separated from nonsmoking they will not be able to make these decisions as could experts who know the true effects said that this is not a medical decision the decision is not made by a restaurant owner but by the customer if the customers want a restaurant to go they will go but the decision should be driven by customer choices said that this places the burden on patrons to be medical experts if the city got rid of government intervention on fire codes and water quality would the patrons then have to be experts on these issues in order for restaurant owners to make decisions said that customers support fire and building codes and he has never opposed these types of actions by the government he said that there is no doubt that individuals participate in personal activities that are not safe but the things that go on behind the scenes that affect customer safety are appropriate for government intervention as to the or atmosphere of a restaurant this should be left up to the business owners clerks note oliver left at pm alley citizen and member of smoke free asked what restaurants and bars have done to survey the of nonsmokers like her who want to come to these establishments but do not want to put their health at risk in order to do so said that this is a valid question he has a large nonsmoking section in his restaurant and did not discriminate when he circulated the petitions he has even toyed with the idea of going nonsmoking one day a week to see what it would do to his business but already knows what it would do citizen asked where the survey can be found that references deaths in county annually said that the last hearing presented some of this data but the county health departments track this type of health environment committee information said that the information can be found on the county health departments web site jerry carter citizen said that he is a nonsmoker but likes to eat he asked why this council has the right to choose where he eats and socializes chair said that the difference between making choices about food and smoking is that food choices only affect the individual making the choice but smoking affects those sitting in vicinity to the smoker and secondhand smoke has a direct and immediate affect on someone health even though they have chosen not to smoke carter said that while he does not disagree he should still be allowed to make the decision as to where he goes and whether or not he minds that a smoker is sitting next to him he said that he can choose who is the mayor governor or president but should also have basic choices about where he socializes and with whom said that this is a very difficult decision but they must also take into account the viewpoint of nonsmokers and their rights to a healthy environment also they need to make sure that they are not giving one type of business more freedom or advantage over another he said that those who do not smoke are sometimes then left without choices because they cannot go to a comedy club or listen to good jazz music because of the health hazard said that it is ironic that this ordinance is looking at saving people yet a woman can kill a child in because abortions are legal chair said that abortion is not germane to this ordinance and this subject said that both deal with personal rights and abortion does not protect the rights of an unborn child chair said that the council does not have jurisdiction over that issue for county and therefore it is not germane jenny bartender for loon lake lodge in said that many of her customers smoke but she still enjoys working there since she quit smoking six years ago her health has improved but since beginning work in a bar four years ago her health has not declined any therefore she does not believe working hours a week in an environment where smoking is permitted has had any adverse effect on her health she asked if there any solid reports on health effects of secondhand smoke on employees chair said that the past meeting relayed a lot of this information and ms can get that information on the council website or from the council office or she could contact smoke free for further information owner of two bars in said that he is a nonsmoker but it is obvious some of the committee members are so opposed to smoking that they cannot make an objective decision and they should be replaced by people with more open minds chair said that committee members have and health environment committee listened to three and a half hours of testimony and appreciate all comments and will take them into consideration max of one of the largest dart bars in asked how much consideration will be given to these signed petitions he has had of his patrons tell him they will not visit his establishment as often if they go nonsmoking chair said that committee members will consider all information they are given and will hold several more hearings including four public forums to get all the input they can before making a decision hall halls restaurant group said that there are so many reasons why a customer comes back to a restaurant part of the nostalgia about a place like the living room lounge is the atmosphere even though people be indulging in things that are not good for their health for this council to decide what they indulge in is questionable hall added that said he wanted all the input he could get and admitted to receiving messages from both and yet when got up to speak left the room added that this meeting will be replayed to times on channel and all will watch those meetings and receive written minutes of the meeting if a has to leave the room they will still make sure they are informed on the subject he said that all of these members except for himself who is retired have other jobs and many demands on their time but they take their position very seriously and will review the input over and over again citizen said that this council should not pass a law that says smokers do not have rights to smoke in their own vehicles she said smokers pay the excise taxes yet they are being told they do not have their own rights she said that she picked up smoking after a traumatic time in her life and it helps her to relieve stress she said that it should be her choice where she smokes because she is a considerate smoker and cares about her neighbors health stated that this ordinance does not prevent individuals from smoking in their own vehicles it only prohibits individuals from smoking in a vehicle provided by an employer where there are occupants other than the driver ms said that in her employer is going to ban smoking and will close the designated area for smoking and employees will not even be allowed to go into their own vehicle on the property and smoke said that this is not something this ordinance is doing but is a decision of ms private employer ms said that it will get to the point where they cannot even stand on a public sidewalk and smoke said that under this current ordinance there is no provision for a special smoking room in any establishment and smoking is only allowed feet from an establishment hospitals are making their own decisions to ban smoking and community north hospital has even put a mile radius smoking ban health environment committee which includes places that are not even property owned by them he said that he agrees that this ordinance is way too when a person cannot smoke in their own vehicle if they own a catering business and an employee might ride with them to an event he added that this ordinance does not even allow smoking on a public golf course while a private golf course is exempt citizen asked with regard to the with disabilities act how the rights of those with asthma are being protected when they are prohibited from working in these establishments as contrasted with the rights of employers and smokers said that there was no testimony offered on this issue tonight but it is a very important issue and employers should be concerned about that there is a federal law that requires employers to provide reasonable accommodation to people with disabilities who are otherwise able to work he said that this is another piece of the puzzle that should be considered stated that for those employees in the medical industry there are certain types of latex that are also harmful to those who have asthma so in considering disabilities there are many areas that could be opened up for lawsuits citizen said that the comment was made that smokers would leave a bar if they could not smoke she said that people cannot smoke on airplanes but smokers survive for five to ten hours on a plane without smoking yet they do not think they can sit in a bar for two hours without smoking proposal no amends the code by establishing nonsmoking areas chair said that proposal no was postponed at the last meeting and it was communicated that the committee would try to decide on a firm date for action before this meeting she said that she would recommend action on the proposal be set for the th meeting moved seconded by to postpone proposal no until the motion carried by a vote of with casting the negative vote said that he would prefer to just vote the proposal up or down this evening chair stated that the next meeting is scheduled for and will feature presentations from a medical perspective there being no further business and upon motion duly made the meeting was adjourned at pm
