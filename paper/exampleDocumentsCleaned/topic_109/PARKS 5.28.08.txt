character a variety of terrain scenic views cultural amenities and extensive natural service area all of county and several adjacent communities location areas of significant natural characteristics that are easily accessible to surrounding communities facilities regional parks have recreation centers nature centers aquatic facilities golf courses play grounds athletic trails shelters and open spaces in addition they also have unique features such as nature preserves conservatory horse trails or a soap box derby hill programs regional parks include resources that allow for a variety of recreation programming including both passive and active recreation opportunities core program services for regional parks include sports and fitness art and culture self enrichment environmental education therapeutic and inclusion and senior programs community parks size a park be classified as a community park at a minimum size of to acres in addition a park be classified as a community park solely on the amenities and programs offered to a particular neighborhood service area a community park should serve two or more neighborhoods although its service area should be to miles in radius the quality of the natural resources bas should play a significant role in its site selection location the sites natural character should play a very significant role in park site selections emphasis is placed on sits that preserve unique landscapes within the community provide recreation opportunities not otherwise available facilities community parks offer at least one major indoor recreational facility such as a family center ice rink or nature center many also include a pool or aquatic center programs community parks offer open space and developed recreation areas to accommodate both passive and active recreational programs community parks are capable of providing services to several neighborhoods and often offer programs in all of the core program areas of sports and fitness art and culture aquatics environmental education self enrichment therapeutic and inclusion programs and senior services neighborhood parks size neighborhood parks are generally a minimum of acres is the accepted size to provide space for a variety of recreation activities demographic profiles and population density within the parks service are determinants of a neighborhood park size service area a neighborhood park is limited by geographical or social limits maximum minutes walking distance the park primarily serves the local neighborhoods within a radius of to miles of the park without physical or social boundaries character able to support intensive use ideally level and open with some shady areas location criteria a neighborhood park should be centrally located with its service area which encompasses a to mile distance uninterrupted by arterial road and other physical barriers it should be located away from railroads main streets and other hazardous barriers ease of access and walking distance from surrounding neighborhoods central location and linkage to are critical factors in locating a neighborhood park most use is users from local neighborhood recreation activity since each neighborhood in a community is unique neighborhood input is used to determine the development program for the park a balance between active and passive park use should be sought active recreational facilities are intended to be used in an informal and unstructured manner and not intended to be used for programmed activities that result in overuse noise parking issues and congestion program offerings a menu of potential active recreation facilities include play structures court games informal or open space tennis courts volleyball courts shuffle board courts horseshoe area ice skating and spray area facilities for passive activities include internal trails area and general open space as a general rule active recreational facilities should consume roughly of the parks acreage the remaining should be used for passive activities neighborhoods parks contain no indoor facilities or programming staff the park have two to three developed areas for sports activities picnicking fitness trails and playgrounds mini parks size mini parks are between square feet and one acre in size however a park less than acres would technically be considered a anything larger would be considered a neighborhood park service area several city blocks or less than mile in a residential setting character the character be either one of intensive use or aesthetic enjoyment low maintenance of these facilities is essential residents are encouraged to assist in policing and day to day maintenance of this type of park the primary function of such a park is to provide passive recreation space to those areas of the county where population densities limit the available open space location criteria the justification for a min park lies in servicing a specific recreational need or taking advantage of a unique opportunity customer input through the public meeting process should be the primary determinant of the development and character of this type of park ideally mini parks should have adjacency to other park system components notably and trail systems program offerings mini parks are not designed to accommodate more than very limited recreational use they typically provide a single recreation use for one user group such as a play ground for preschool benches for walkers landscape and trails or to display artwork from the local neighborhood special use parks description special use areas are those spaces and facilities that fall within a typical park classification a major difference between a special use area and other parks is that they usually serve a single purpose whereas atypical parks are designated to offer multiple recreation opportunities special use generally falls into three categories program offerings special use facilities are designed and developed tor a specific identified recreational activity and draw users from throughout the county to access this particular facility examples of special use facilities include the and skate park the rowing course at eagle creek and soap box derby hill golf courses provide specialized and land intensive facilities to an estimated county golfers county is one of the few communities that has an abundance of golf courses the residents have access to golf courses in county public courses totaling acres size par hole with average length varies between yards requires a minimum of acres a holes standard course has an average length of yards with a minim of acres an hole standard has an average length of yards and is a minimum of acres the preferred size is to acres service area a hole standard course will accommodate per day and serve a population of an hole will accommodate between people per day and serve a population of location golf courses be located in a regional community or neighborhood park ideally driving time should be hour to reach a course facilities club house snack bars banquet rooms shelters irrigation golf cart rentals cart paths parking and driving rang natural resource areas natural resource areas are lands set aside for preservation of significant natural resources remnant landscapes open space and visual aesthetics buffering these lands consist of individual sites exhibiting natural resources lands that are unsuitable for development but offer natural resource potential examples include parcels with steep slopes and natural vegetation and ravines surface water management area ponding areas and utility easements protected lands such as and shorelines along waterways lakes and ponds the intent of the natural resource parks is to enhance the livability and character of a community by preserving as many of its natural amenities as possible sports complexes the sports complex classification consolidates heavily programmed athletic fields and associated facilities at larger and fewer sites strategically located throughout the community this allows for economies of scale and higher quality facilities improved control of facility use improved management and scheduling greater control of negative impact to nationhood and community such as noise traffic congestion parking domination of facilities by those outside the monuments and memorials the size of the area depends on the appropriate scale of the land acreage to communicate the memorial experience character service area and location all vary according to the subject matter of the memorial examples include the king memorial park memorial at fall creek trail and the kin memorial on pleasant run parkway director of parks and recreation to meeting held gaps action what monthly goal for gaps provide the monthly information for gaps in past years and to create a trend line for gaps monthly goal provide a breakdown by category grants etc revenue action
