region primary goals of building regional leadership via economic i will be my board a more comprehensive report fact sheet when and why was created rising regional foundation was created in to carry out the commitment by city of rising and county to share the windfall of the grand casino development with other residents of southeastern the foundation makes grants areas of education historic preservation scientific recreational economic development or other public purposes with special emphasis on covering the local share of any state or federal grant programs for municipalities counties and schools within its region which presently encompasses county county and city of aurora the foundation began program in late after the grand casino opened for business in of that year the grand makes monthly contributions to the foundation based on a percentage of its adjusted gross revenue how does expend its income from the grand casino of annual gross income is placed in a permanent reserve fund to build up an endowment balance for future grant making purposes as of the balance was almost million currently the board of directors is allowing this fund to grow with monthly contributions and a reinvestment of its income it is expected that the fund will someday provide income for future grant making by especially if the revenue from grand is reduced or ends no more than of annual gross revenues be expended for the administration of the foundation the annual gross revenues is to be remaining balance of expended for direct grant making purposes in its grant making region consisting of county county and the city of aurora making why does grant region include county the idea of sharing outside the boundaries of county was adopted by the rising council the county commissioners and the county council in to address the perceived reluctance of the gaming commission to grant rising a certificate of suitability for a riverboat casino license because the area of economic development i county was not sufficiently large enough to justify a license the intent of the riverboat casino legislation was to promote tourism and economic development to gain the license the revenue sharing plan was developed and the commitment to create a regional foundation was adopted many believe this concept of sharing the economic benefit of the riverboat casino outside county was crucial in the final analysis and led to rising successfully receiving the nod from the for the certificate of suitability grant why does making region include the city of aurora city of aurora was included in grant making region in its original articles of incorporation that also included county and other unincorporated towns in county when the city of and county became dock sites for their own riverboat casinos reduced its making region in exclusively to county county and the city of aurora continued to include the city of aurora in its grant making region following the example set by rising city council and county council who also continued to include the city of aurora in their respective revenue sharing programs why do county rising units of government educational institutions and nonprofit organizations receive less grants funds than those in county county has a population of approximately residents with one municipality and one school system county by contrast has a population of approximately residents with seven municipalities and four school systems plus a half dozen parochial schools county has some miles of county highways to maintain county has miles the sheer difference in size of the two counties in population and other characteristics causes a greater number of needs to be addressed in county and thus a greater number of grant applications received by from county organizations the population of rising county is approximately of the current making region whereas rising county from year through mid received approximately of the total money granted even without the inclusion of undetermined benefits from grants made on a regional basis the year was the first year the current reflecting how do other sources of generally funding impact making region grant decisions the board of directors gives secondary consideration to the applicant alternatives although leveraging of funds is highly encouraged there are a number of potential grantees in its making region that have obvious other revenue sources for example the city of has the foundation has the fund has the foundation rising receives direct riverboat gaming revenues from the state county receives riverboat revenues from the state and from and aurora receives riverboat revenue sharing from the city of and county while these other potential resources are certainly not ignored they are considered within the resource context of evaluation process which is intended to determine application on its individual merits the board however recognizes that there are applicants from time to time that have no alternative resources to look to and makes decisions accordingly what is grant application process regional foundation utilizes formal grant application form supplemented by requested attachments this form and application guidelines are available office in rising or at the southeastern at either the commission office in has generously offered to provide staff assistance to any organization in the preparation of a grant application to the foundation the foundation awards grants quarterly basis in accordance with published schedule emergency grant applications be considered by the foundation between these quarterly grant making meetings based upon compelling merits and time constraints related to the grant requests as determined board of directors and staff by the foundation who decides which grants approved and how and all decisions to what extent are to regarding acceptance funding of grants are made by a seven member board of directors appointed by political entities within grant making region three appointees are from county three from county and one from the city of aurora staff and board members conduct interviews gather information and make recommendations but the final decisions are made exclusively by the and then application the results of this work only after extensive review well documented of each grant are all grant requests scrutinized by the board completed applications with required supportive information are scrutinized by the board instances and as appropriate applicants are interviewed prior to to avoid any misunderstanding regarding the applicant request and to provide a fair and balanced opportunity for all applicants pertinent information is documented and presented as part of the discussion at the quarterly grant making meetings in most why my grant request declined by whereas i later noted that approved by the foundation has similar rating evaluation system that considers project importance need for funds ability to possibility that you did not consider all the your application have been rejected at a quarterly many particularly worthwhile grant requests competing leverage funds from other sources etc factors supporting your application or making meeting when there were with yours this scenario also pertains disproportionate what is grant awards that the surface appear to be making history from late through mid has received a total of almost million in income from the grand casino of that amount the foundation has set aside into its permanent reserve fund for future making which now has a market value of nearly million the foundation has awarded some direct grants totaling almost million or of its total income to governmental educational and nonprofit organizations in its grant making region this amount of grants was made in response to approximately million in total grant requests the foundation calculates that this million in other government region or in grants has assisted in leveraging some foundation personal contributions to these projects in the equivalent of approximately in total project of funding for every over its year history the foundation has expended an average of of its total annual ten income vs allowed to implement its comprehensive grants program and for administrative and related costs what will future grants program look like is continuously in the process of reviewing its grants program in ways for the foundation to more effectively serve the residents of its looking at new and creative making region especially in light of a number of initial needs that seem to have essentially been met and of other evolving priorities as part of this process will also challenge and work with potential grant applicants to assist them to plan how they too can better serve their respective constituents by preparing thoughtful creative and comprehensive grant applications to which the foundation can rising

sandy silts are to be used at the riverfront and that the foreman type to use he also does not think it should thought the soils were not the con dozer foreman could consulting be the field personnel to determine which soils responsibility of the contractor that if the material could be flushed he wants to use it at the there was probably one day where the soils could have been used and the

services were potholed every house on the street at least two additional laterals were hit that acknowledges responsibility for and did not include in the change order request did not know they had hit some of the double laterals until three or lour days later most of the hours included in the request were for exploratory digging however and overtime were not included in the request asked for

from the truck plus the sewer flow it rock in it however the crew sanitary suggested and the city could possibly share the cleaning bill from thought most debris in the sewer came from the laterals know they hit because they repaired the pipes they knew they hit quickly would be willing to take off the cost of the first day of cleaning from the change order request because brought the wrong truck the city will take this under consideration included the first items listed linear footage repair and justification of hours spent in the request for additional because the contract has unit
