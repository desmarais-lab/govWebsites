the proposed budget for the consolidated city of county is a balanced budget that continues to address critical needs while accurately accounting for revenues and expenditures for the upcoming fiscal year maintaining positive fund balances protecting the fiscal stability fund and holding the line on spending were key focus points when developing the budget notwithstanding revenue enhancements that became effective in growth in major revenue sources such as property taxes and income taxes is expected to be nominal in and fiscal restraint must continue to be exercised in the face of stagnant revenues the introduced budget is a maintenance budget that provides for minimal increases in spending specifically an additional new officers as laid out by mayor public safety plan contractual pay increases guardian ad services storm water infrastructure adjustments for information technology etc the introduced budget calls for a one year moratorium on the local homestead credit that would generate an additional million dollars in revenue the additional revenue is not budgeted however and it remains in fund balance at the start of the budget faced an operating deficit of million within the city and tax supported funds this increased to million due to an million shortfall in property tax collections at the end of the city and county are also faced with an additional pay cycle for nonuniform police and firefighters employees in estimated to cost an additional million based on these projections the office of finance and management used million of the additional public safety income tax revenue received to address a portion of the projected structural deficit in addition adopted a management reserve of million on all funds to set aside resources in the event overall revenues fluctuated during the year and to help address the additional pay cycle is pleased to report that all city and county agencies departments separately elected officials and separate branches of government participated in the management reserve exercise of the total management reserve roughly million was set aside in the city and tax supported funds through income taxes have remained stable and are on target for the remainder of the year due to the number of refunds appeals and homestead deductions that were previously removed and are now being reapplied property taxes are million less than what was forecasted at the time the budget was adopted projects that a portion of the management reserve will be released along with some additional appropriations based on discussions with city and county agencies departments separately elected officials and separate branches of government however with some management reserve held back projects the city and tax supported funds will end with approximately million in while difficult decisions have and will be made to close the operating deficit and maintain positive fund balances the budget continues investment in public safety infrastructure and neighborhood development police and fire funding will be increased in to account for contractual pay increases negotiated with the police and fire unions both police and fire departments will continue to find efficiencies within their operations to maintain the level of services currently provided the budget continues to support the mayors plan to provide additional officers on the street through improved allocation of resources and a recruit class in the budget includes funding for police and fire operations related to contractual pay increases from will receive million in additional funding in to account for the addition of officers in and to support new recruits in will receive additional funding of million to support contractual pay increases from will continue to examine its operations and opportunities for consolidation in order to create savings in the future additional funding for criminal justice services such as the public defender the county superior courts the prosecutor and other agencies was provided in but overall growth from to will remain flat an increase of million from the county general fund is included for the state mandated guardian ad program with million to support contractual increases for emergency dispatch operations the city and county are aware of the changes by the general assembly with regards to house enrolled

the crime prevention grant at million providing opportunities for groups that wish to engage the community in ways to reduce crime and improve their neighborhoods infrastructure improvements and upgrades continue to be a primary focus of the administration and are reflected in the budget support for the rebuild program will continue with an investment of million in from proceeds related to the sale of water and waste water facilities to the citizens energy group the million figure represents the final amount of funds available from the fund investment in roads and streets and other capital improvements will continue in with funding of million from the transportation general fund the budget will continue to utilize the parking meter fund in to make infrastructure and capital improvements in the amount of million in and around parking meter areas in the city county council approved a storm water rate increase that became effective in which is estimated to generate an additional million annually the increase in revenue will provide for infrastructure investment of million in finally the city will increase its investment in park facilities by million in ensuring parks are well maintained and capital improvements are made throughout the year bringing total investment local and federal support in the city and infrastructure to million in neighborhoods are one of the main reasons why and county continues to be a city people want to live work and be part of now and in the future beyond funding police fire and infrastructure services this budget continues to fund the important work provided by the department of metropolitan development the department of code enforcement and the department of parks and recreation the administration through the budget

to ensure employees working in the enterprise resource planning tool have the appropriate knowledge and skills that will create operational efficiencies within agencies that provide functions expenditures are only one side of the equation when developing a balanced budget thus revenue plays an equally if not more important role to balancing the budget and funding public safety in the city and county received million in income tax revenue distributions which support public safety criminal justice public safety communications and other city and county agencies and departments income tax revenue is forecasted to be million in an increase of approximately million when normalized for the one year moratorium on the local homestead credit organic growth is a nominal or approximately million while this increase is helpful it does not fully support the additional costs associated with contractual increases personnel state mandated programs and the overall cost of doing business for property tax revenue is forecasted to be million which represents a million decrease from the budgeted amount of million this decrease places additional pressure on tax supported funds for property tax revenue is expected to remain flat at million decreased property tax revenue in coupled with no growth in requires the city and county to be even more judicious in its spending for the remainder of and as noted earlier this budget proposes a one year moratorium on the local homestead credit this would generate an additional million in revenue in the amount generated is not budgeted and is being used to support fund balance the administrations goal is to keep the tax supported fund balance at or above of the annual expenditures from tax supported funds which is million in based on the proposed budget the fund balance for tax supported funds will end at approximately million this figure does not include the million that is held in the fiscal stability fund nor other dedicated federal or state funds the office of finance and management projects that if normal underspending occurs in and property tax collections are in and the million projected balance will increase the budget continues to support vital services that make the consolidated city of county a great place to live and maintains the administrations commitment to fiscal stability and long term financial planning this balanced budget has been accomplished through tough decisions regarding spending finding innovate ways to provide services creating efficiencies where possible and identifying revenues
