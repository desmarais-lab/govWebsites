debt service local police and fire pensions fiscal circumstances the budget for the consolidated city of county poses an interesting challenge how to navigate a sharp and sustained downturn in revenues without derailing the city from the path of progress upon which it is set this proposed budget arrives at the confluence of three daunting fiscal challenges facing our city and municipalities across the state and the nation our revenues will reflect the depths of the great recession of state laws defining both the distribution of local income taxes and calculation of local property taxes result in a two year lag between economic events and municipal government revenue impacts consequently projected income tax revenues for the consolidated city are down million from their peak in a drop of more than this sharp income tax decline which hit heavily in depleted the operating reserves the city had thoughtfully built up in and this contributes further to our fiscal challenges the upward trajectory of fixed costs such as contractual raises health insurance coverage municipal pension benefits and fuel completes a triad of fiscal factors converging in together these three factors along with some essential nonrecurring additional costs define a million fiscal challenge for the city of in yet despite similar circumstances undermining the desires and goals of municipalities across the country there remains much reason for optimism here key financial features this proposed budget offers a through a difficult fiscal time without putting at risk the key foundational principles upon which the continued success is based it leaves the city poised to excel regionally and nationally in the environment that will inevitably come this budgets four key features are it does not increase the tax burden on a recovering local economy is does not increase the general debt burden which would mitigate the opportunities for future investments it does make generational investments in repairing the critical physical infrastructure and it does maintain high level commitments to protecting the publics safety beyond these core features the budget will allow the city to continue its aggressive and successful efforts in new business development and attraction to elevate its international stature and to innovate in education to make a city of choice for young families to navigate this path successfully we must thoughtfully use the limited resources provided by the taxpayers to keep the city on track the budget plan is built on these key financial features seeking a reimbursement of not more than million from the downtown tax increment financing district for past city infrastructure improvements expenses benefiting the downtown seeking a reimbursement of up to million from the capital improvements board for extraordinary public safety costs related to the super bowl and requiring all nonpublic safety and criminal justice departments and agencies to spend grudgingly and find cost saving process improvements to yield in base budget savings in addition to seeking reimbursement from the downtown this budget also releases approximately million of tax increment assessed value av to the general tax base for this action will benefit all taxing units across the county this financial plan will also enable the city to continue its investments in core information systems to modernize internal operations and financial controls this is an investment necessary to both support productivity gains essential to navigating lean times and prepare the city to continue to excel over the long term notably the million in cash proceeds provided by the transfer of the water and wastewater utilities to citizens energy group puts the city in the enviable position of being able to invest in its physical infrastructure while many other municipalities across the nation continue to struggle the proceeds from the transfer will fund improvements to roads bridges sidewalks and the demolition and deconstruction of abandoned properties through mayor program mayor is protecting funds from being used for general government programs thus no funds are being used in operating budget additionally million is set aside for a new fiscal stability fund to maintain the credit rating this million will not be spent for any purpose until they are no longer necessary to maintain our rating then those funds will be returned to the fund for investment in infrastructure projects to date more than million has been invested to improve roads bridges and sidewalks in every part of our city by another million will be invested for these purposes and the demolition and deconstruction of hundreds of abandoned properties in and beyond mayor program will invest more than million dollars over the next few years specific budget elements with this budget the ability to deliver high quality snow and ice removal services this winter and required street and walkway repairs next spring remains intact work will also continue in earnest on flood control improvements across the city in curbside recycling is being added to the standard trash removal services in selected neighborhoods with a goal of expanding it because the department of public works is not funded with income taxes their budget need not be adjusted in response to the downturn in that revenue stream that said the city will continue to strive for savings and service level improvements within the same is true for the department of code enforcement it will continue to operate at the level their dedicated revenues support charges fees only to those who use its service freeing all taxpayers of the burden of funding this department so its funding level depends more on the effectiveness of its operations than on the general tax revenue climate of local government for the general county agencies and city departments this budget demands active and effective management the core public safety and criminal justices agencies which account for about of the general fund budget are each funded at or near of their appropriation level this can be accomplished only because of an affirmative decision to focus additional resources received from the downtown and the on the core public safety and criminal justice responsibilities the agencies and departments in this group are the metropolitan police department the fire department department of homeland security animal care control the county sheriff department the superior circuit courts the county prosecutor office the public defender agency forensic services and community corrections additional key features of the proposed funding for public safety and criminal justice are contractual salary increases for police officers firefighters park rangers and public safety officers will be honored and the million crime prevention grant program will be continued for the other general government functions funding is about of appropriation levels the proposed budgets for these other departments and agencies fully reflect the impact of the downturn in tax revenues the city departments in this group are the mayors office the council office the public safety directors office the parks department channel and the other administrative functions of city government the county agencies in the group are the auditors office the assessors office the clerks office and election registration the coroners office the recorders office the surveyors office the treasurers office and cooperative extension additional key features of the proposed funding for these other general government functions are continued capital investment in park grounds and facilities to further enhance these key public assets and the million grant to the arts council will be continued finally the matter of funding for the county public library has also been a growing concern over the past few years during the recently concluded session of the general assembly municipal finance laws governing county were changed to allow a portion of the county option income tax to be allocated to the the fact that revenues are currently in decline makes the idea of adding new uses for these scarce funds less appealing fiscally in however with an eye on the long haul adding the library to the is the right policy this budget sets an allocation of for at of the county total or in if adopted this will position the to share in the future economic growth of the city in ways that their property tax levy does not provide the budget process even in tight times the typical budgeting process in government is focused on the allocation of incremental resources seeking highest and best use for the additional funds available given the fiscal circumstances outlined above the budget development process for followed an atypical path though for the past three years it could be said that the budget process has been in an atypical cycle appropriation reductions have been demanded each cycle to address a projected deficit inherited in and then in response to the new property tax caps that reduced property tax revenues sharply beginning in with tax revenues continuing a downward trajectory in the budget instructions issued in directed all agencies and departments to assess the impacts of executing their missions in with less funding than provided in this was done in preparation for tax revenue estimates that were not to be finalized until early thus agency and department budget submissions did not represent an unfettered estimate of their operational funding requests rather they were a tool to require early assessments of continued operational changes that might be necessary in with less funding after a decision to seek reimbursement from the downtown was settled on only then were final funding levels able to be set for each agency and department the process of setting agency and department budgets was much more than an exercise in reducing appropriations proportionally to match available funds not only was the decision made to set differential funding levels for public safety and criminal justice operations but a serious effort was made to account for the unique effects of fixed operating cost increases on individual agency and department budgets finally nonrecurring unusual costs for were factored in where appropriate as a result many budgets not appear to fit neatly into either the funding or the funding category at first glance changes to the allocation of internal for information technology and legal services play a large role in these adjustments to accommodate all of this base budgets were calculated for each agency and department reductions in response to declining revenues were made to the base budgets then some funding was restored to each budget to reflect individual changes in fixed costs and internal thus shifts in internal cost allocations corrections of past budget errors and nonrecurring items were all accounted for appropriately looking ahead despite challenging financial times the budget for the city and county once again sets forth a responsible plan by which agencies can continue serving all citizens of county making a safe livable city now and for decades to come with a sharp rebound in local income tax revenues anticipated in positioning the city for continued
