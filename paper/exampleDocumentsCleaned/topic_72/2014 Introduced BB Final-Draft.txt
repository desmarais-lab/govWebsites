consolidated city of county is a balanced budget that signifies the goals and priorities of the administration while accurately accounting for revenues and expenditures for the upcoming fiscal year maintaining positive fund balances protecting the fiscal stability fund and holding the line on spending were key focus points when developing the budget even while major revenue sources like income taxes are expected to increase for those funds must be used to support current essential services and fund balances versus increases in spending the budget cannot be supported by increased income tax distributions alone reductions in operating and capital budgets to hold the line on spending along with changes in property tax policies will keep tax supported fund balances stable for the long term and provide for a financially strong city this budget includes changes to the police special service district boundaries which will reduce the tax rate by percent in and provide an equitable distribution of the property tax to a majority of county property owners in addition to support public safety and the metropolitan police department operations the elimination of the local homestead credit will shift nearly million of current income tax revenue away from an antiquated form of property tax relief directly to public safety without increasing income taxes in the summer of the budget faced an operating shortfall and negative fund balances heading into fiscal year based on these projections the mayors office and the council agreed to identify approximately million of spending reductions or revenue enhancements throughout the year as of the publication of the budget roughly million has been identified as budget reductions budget reserves or enhanced revenue the mayor continues to urge city and county agencies to identify savings or revenue options that will assist in reaching the million goal even as city and county agencies continue to reduce spending or enhance revenue the administration forecasted the budget would be difficult even with actions taken in while difficult decisions have and will be made to close the operating deficit and maintain positive fund balances the budget continues investment in public safety infrastructure and neighborhood development police and fire funding will be maintained in but both will continue to find efficiencies within their operations to maintain the level of services currently provided the budget supports the mayors plan to provide additional officers to the street through improved allocation of resources and a recruit class in the budget contemplates a reduction for the fire department by million based on operational savings related to fire station consolidation which will save on staffing and overtime needs while the budget does not include funding for police and fire contractual raises starting the administration is working diligently with police and fire unions to identify opportunities to balance pay adjustments while maintaining a balanced budget for both police and fire staff that are assigned vehicles starting in there will be a vehicle surcharge fee which will generate approximately million to support police and fire operations funding for criminal justice services such as the public defender the courts and the prosecutor will remain relatively flat by focusing on operational and functional changes that will potentially create savings or revenues that can be reinvested within those agencies the administration continues to support spending reductions within the county sheriffs office by making reductions to the sheriffs budget for fund balances will remain positive and expenditures will match revenues finally the budget will fund the crime prevention grant at million providing opportunities for groups that wish to engage the community in ways to reduce crime and improve their neighborhoods infrastructure improvements and upgrades continue to be a primary focus of the administration and are reflected in the budget support for the rebuild program will continue with an investment of nearly million in from proceeds related to the sale of water and waste water facilities to the citizens energy group in addition the state of has increased funding allocated to local units for roads streets curbs sidewalks bridges etc repairs and upgrades by million for finally improvements and upgrades related to storm water infrastructure will see increased funding in bringing total investment cash and bonded in the city and infrastructure to million in included in the budget is the management of capital investment in parks by the department of public works will oversee and manage capital planning projects and maintenance of all parks starting in neighborhoods are one of the main reasons why and county continues to be a city people want to live work and be part of now and in the future beyond funding police fire and infrastructure services this budget continues to fund the important work provided by the department of metropolitan development the department of code enforcement and the department of parks and recreation the administration through the budget continues to highlight the need for neighborhood planning and development to ensure we are building a long term vision for the city and its residents is examining operational and functional changes that will refocus the efforts and prioritize the goals of the administration the a operation continues to make a positive impact on the city through its regulatory efforts enforcement of licensing and building ordinances and ensuring a safe and productive living environment our parks continue to play a vital role in and around neighborhoods throughout the city and county over the last few years has identified efficiency opportunities that have created savings or resulted in enhanced revenue that have directly supported parks will continue to identify savings and revenue opportunities within its operations and program for the budget finally the arts grant will continue to be funded at million as part of the budget beyond specific agency changes the budget includes changes such as holding costs related to health insurance flat from examining options during related to retirement benefits for employees evaluating current contracts that could be renegotiated and continuing the good work of the strategic hiring committee for the information services agency will make capital investments of nearly million to improve information technology infrastructure and operations in addition will invest in training programs and materials to ensure employees working in the enterprise resource planning tool have the appropriate knowledge and skills that will create operational efficiencies within agencies that provide functions expenditures are only one side of the equation when developing a balanced budget thus revenue plays an equally if not more important role to balancing the budget and funding public safety as noted earlier this budget includes the expansion of the current police special service district from the old city limits to most of county excluding speedway beech grove and while all residents of county contribute to public safety through income taxes not all residents contribute through property taxes based on the current boundaries by expanding the to all of county excluding speedway beech grove and residents will equally support police operations throughout county also with the merger of police services completed several years ago the current boundaries are outdated and do not match the current service area patrolled by the metropolitan police department the change in boundaries will reduce the property tax rate from to approximately a reduction through the reduction in the property tax rate for the the impact of the circuit breaker to the city and county will be reduced by approximately million in not only would the city and county benefit from this action but other local units like public schools and the public library would benefit as well in order to support the and create a positive fund balance for operations this budget calls for the elimination of the local homestead credit in the elimination of the will shift current income tax revenue to the to support current staffing and services vital to public safety in and county the current is funded through income tax revenue paid by county residents but not all residents benefit from the eliminating the will align property tax policies with the state and other surrounding counties no longer create a property tax subsidy that benefits some not all residents and use current income tax revenue rather than increase income tax rates to support of the nearly property owners that would be impacted by the elimination of the percent would realize no impact to their property tax bills and the remaining property tax payers would be impacted by less than per month on average the impact of this action will provide funding directly to that if not made available would require dramatic changes in the police department finally as and county slowly emerge from one of the worst financial crises in the last years we are seeing an increase in the overall income tax revenue generated by county residents despite a slight increase in personal income of county residents in recent years distributions of income tax to the county by the state have been held flat due for three years due to the states over distribution of income tax in in the city and county received million in income tax revenue distributions which support public safety criminal justice and public safety communications for the state is expected to increase the income tax revenue distribution by million while this increase is helpful it certainly does not discharge the city and county from holding the line on spending and improving our financial position the administration is committed to keeping the tax supported fund balance at or above of the annual expenditures from tax supported funds which is million based on the proposed budget the fund balance for tax supported funds will end at approximately million this figure does not include the million that is held in the fiscal stability fund nor other dedicated federal or state funds the office of finance and management projects that if spending remains flat into and additional income tax revenue were distributed by the state fund balances could increase to million by the budget focuses on the goals of the administration continues to support vital services that make the consolidated city of county a great place to live and maintains the administrations commitment to fiscal stability and long term financial planning this balanced budget has been accomplished through tough decisions regarding spending finding innovate ways to provide services creating efficiencies where possible and identifying revenues that directly benefit public safety while challenges lay ahead the financial plan presented in this budget continues to serve all citizens of county and makes a great
