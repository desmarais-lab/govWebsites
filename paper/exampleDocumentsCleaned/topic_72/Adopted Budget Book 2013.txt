items fiscal environment revenue surprise the fiscal position of the consolidated city of county entering the budget cycle was substantially different than anticipated when the budget was adopted due to two significant revenue surprises a lower than expected property tax circuit breaker loss and a major correction to local income tax distributions from the state based on final property tax levies for all county taxing units as approved by the state department of local government finance the property tax circuit breaker loss for all taxing units was less than projected for the budget this was due mainly to approved school district levies for debt service and capital projects being much lower than expected as a result the combined property tax collections seven property operating funds are now estimated to be million higher than budgeted as for local income tax revenue a major revelation occurred in when the state office of management budget announced that million in local income tax collections due to counties had been mistakenly underreported by the state department of revenue as a result state distributions of local income tax to counties for all of and through had been too low for the consolidated city this error corrections means that income tax revenue will be million higher than budgeted million attributable to reporting errors that lowered our actual revenue attributable to reporting errors affecting our expected revenue together these revenue surprises have reestablished operating fund balances that were previously projected to be substantially depleted by the end of in fact million of the income tax error correction amount was deposited in our rainy day fund furthermore the income tax error correction also revealed that our underlying local income base was a bit stronger than previously assumed when adjusted for the error correction the consolidated million peak in is now million decline instead of an million drop decline anticipated when the budget was adopted fiscal conditions despite the good news of bolstered operating fund balances and a stronger income tax base the consolidated city still faces a very challenging fiscal environment for put in broader context the million drop in income tax revenue is equal to approximately of our adopted general operating fund budget of million thus we enter the budget season with an operating budget gap of million comparing projected base operating costs to projected baseline revenue expectations for both property tax revenue and local income tax revenue are essentially flat for in fact baseline revenue for both property tax and local income tax are down slightly from the latest estimates for revenue assuming no tax policy changes and after adjusting income tax collections for the state reporting error correction baseline property tax revenue estimates are down because the reduced circuit breaker loss surprise from is not expected to repeat baseline income tax revenue estimates are down because a balance in the levy freeze local income option tax stabilization account held by the county treasurer for all government units in the county will be exhausted in this means distributions of levy freeze monies to all taxing units will be reduced in for the consolidated city the reduction will be million despite continued revenue weakness expected in there is reason for optimism that the consolidated continue to improve in and beyond future revenue outlook the general outlook for growth in the consolidated remains weak reflecting the sluggish state of the broader economy in there is generally a two year lag between economic events and the resulting impact on municipal income and property tax revenue thus our tax revenue for and will generally reflect local economic activity from and this lag is due to structural occurred in are captured in the tax assessments in those tax assessments then define the property tax base for billings for local income tax revenue earnings realized in are reported on tax returns filed with the state department of revenue in the income tax filings then define the local income tax base for certified distributions to local government units expectations for property tax revenue growth remain flat until broad based economic growth triggers an escalation in property values we can expect property tax revenue to remain stagnant in the property tax cap era when property value growth is stagnant allowable levy growth authorized under state law is offset by rising property tax circuit breaker credits however there is one major bright spot for revenue a unique and sharp in our certified distribution of local income tax is expected in approximately million unrelated to underlying economic activity this will be the result of resolving an income tax collection vs distribution imbalance between the state and counties that occurred during the period of through over certified income tax distributions to counties far exceeded the local income tax collections received by the state department of revenue this happened because the great recession produced a drop in income tax collections so sharp and rapid that the legal mechanism in place for adjusting certified distributions to counties could not keep pace thus the state treasury found itself in a position where it was carrying a large negative balance in the clearing accounts used for processing local income tax collections and distributions to counties to correct this imbalance in the state instituted a cap on local income tax distributions to counties the cap holds the certified distribution to each county level for and forward until rising income tax collections offset the subsequent local income tax reporting error and correction in and referenced above certainly added an additional level of complexity to process of determining the correct clearing account balances for each county those issues have now all been reconciled we estimate that the county clearing account negative balance will be resolved in and thus the cap on local income tax distributions lifted this explains the unusual million expected for the consolidated of the certified local income distribution beyond we expect local income tax revenue growth to return to a normal relationship to underlying economic activity but lagged by two years as explained above key fiscal features budget plan this adopted key features are it does not increase taxes on a recovering local economy is does continue to pay down the general obligation debt burden of the consolidated city it does continue generational investments in repairing critical physical infrastructure and it does however the plan that were not supported by the mayor these changes were striking the proposed elimination of the local homestead credit reducing general operating revenue by million per year reducing the appropriation of fund monies for infrastructure improvement by million and invoking a million payment of taxes weakening ongoing operating revenue funding for the drawing cash from the into the city treasury consequently the mayor chose to exercise his authority in response to these changes to the budget more detail on this veto action is presented below close the million operating budget gap the adopted budget includes these key financial features million spend down of general operating reserves million spend down of rainy day fund reserves leaving million balance million reimbursement from tax increment financing district reserves for past infrastructure investments million from suspension of scheduled pay raise for police and firefighters million savings for year million revenue from new vehicle personal use surcharge for metropolitan police department and fire department and million reduction in and overtime in addition to seeking a reimbursement from reserves the consolidated city is also releasing approximately billion of allowable tax increment assessed value av to the general tax base for this represents more than the total allowable tax increment capture this action will generate the combined benefits of a lowering total property taxpayer liability by over million and reducing the revenue loss due to property tax caps by nearly million for all taxing units across the county of this million revenue impact the consolidated city will realize more in net property tax revenue than it would have otherwise this budget plan will also enable the consolidated city to continue its investments in core information systems to modernize internal operations and financial controls this is an investment necessary to both support productivity gains essential to navigating lean times and prepare the city to continue to excel over the long term at the crux of the the local homestead credit under this subsidy program homeowner property tax bills are lowered by using some local income tax revenue to pay down the property tax liability before tax bills are sent to homeowners thus the property tax distributions bills with the advent of the property tax caps this property tax subsidy has lost its original impact it has morphed from being a primary tool for protecting homeowners from rising property tax burdens to an ineffective program that no longer achieves its intended purpose general operating revenue came their in essence a plan to swap an million annual revenue stream for a million onetime cash infusion furthermore there was much uncertainty as to whether or not the million payment of taxes could be legally invoked on the in million payment of appropriations his veto options for addressing the fiscal imbalance in the budget were limited ultimately his decision was to strike a provision allocating million of county option income tax revenue to the county general fund the resulting effect of this action is that this money will be held in abeyance by the county treasurer awaiting future guidance on when and where it is to be allocated the underlying rationale for this veto action is that withholding this approximately million in would make it available to address the approximately million budget gap in it must be noted that this veto action reduces funds available for county agencies by about in if the funds are not eventually released it is toward a mutually acceptable resolution to this disagreement through the end of the year and into if necessary strategic fiscal actions in the consolidated city closed a deal transferring of its water and wastewater utility assets and debt to citizens energy group is a local public trust originally created in to unique structure was devised to protect the citizens of from the twin perceived threats that access to natural gas energy might fall prey to the price inefficiency of a private monopoly or the political patronage exposure of a government run monopoly the deal generated over million in cash proceeds putting in the enviable position of being able to upgrade its physical infrastructure while many other municipalities across the nation continue to struggle these proceeds will fund improvements to roads bridges sidewalks and the demolition and deconstruction of abandoned properties through mayor program mayor is committed to protecting funds thus no funds were used in the operating budget nor are any proposed for use to support the operating budget for the consolidated city furthermore million of the proceeds were set aside in a new not be spent for any purpose until it is no longer necessary to maintain our rating then those funds must be transferred to the fund for future investment in infrastructure projects by year end more than million will have been invested to improve roads bridges sidewalks or demolish abandoned properties in every part of our city in over million dollars more in addressing remaining infrastructure in a single stroke this transaction positioned to be stronger both in physical assets and financial resilience as a result when a sustained economic recovery does eventually take hold will be poised to leap forward while many of our peers will have to first play catch up on rebuilding their financial reserves and physical infrastructure base however we cannot be complacent because major issues still remain to align permanent infrastructure funding with longterm reinvestment needs specific budget elements general funds vs dedicated funds the fund structure for municipal government is exceedingly complex there are many many distinct funds which comprise the overall fiscal structure of the consolidated city in the face of this complexity some simplifying assumptions are helpful to bring order and context to the fund inventory that can appear overwhelming at first glance most of the operating budget for the consolidated city is funded by general tax revenue both property tax and income tax general funds are funds which receive a substantial share of their revenue from taxes that have very broad flexibility dedicated funds on the other hand are funds which receive revenue from taxes or sources that have very restricted legal uses a more detailed description of the fund structure of municipal government is provided elsewhere in this report base budget action on county agency funds the adopted budget sets funding for the general fund supported county agencies and city departments at the proper level to fully support current operations a base budget this means that adjustments were made to the budget of each agency and department to a close known gaps between budgeted appropriations and current operations with a particular focus on public safety and criminal justice and to fund rising fixed and costs pension contributions health insurance rent internal service charges contracts fuel etc in total the general budgets for agencies and departments were increased by million key features of the adopted budget for public safety and criminal justice are general operating budget increased million to close gaps in funding for their salaries and benefits jail ii operating contract and arrestee medical costs general operating budget increased million to close gaps in funding for rent utilities maintenance and equipment replacement general operating budget increased million to close gaps in funding for salaries and benefits funding for inmate and arrestee medical care and guardian ad services is consolidated into separate funds to highlight their significance and isolate these expenses from the normal operating costs of the sheriff and superior courts and the million crime prevention grant program will be continued additional key features of the adopted budget for other general government functions are reduced election board budget by million to reflect that is a year increased information services agency internal charges by to bring them into proper alignment with actual costs charges up by million while budget is essentially flat continued capital investment in park grounds and facilities to further enhance these key public assets and the million grant to the arts council will be continued dedicated fund departments there are four city departments whose operations are funded completely or substantially from dedicated funds the largest of these is the department of public works the others are department of metropolitan development department of code enforcement and the public safety communications division within the department of public safety because income tax revenue their budgets have generally not been directly impacted by the sharp downturn in income tax revenue since with as the only exception however they each face other types of revenue challenges in this introduced budget ability to deliver high quality snow and ice removal services this winter and necessary street and walkway repairs next spring remains intact work will also continue in earnest on flood control improvements across the city in road and street maintenance operations are heavily dependent on motor fuel tax and vehicle license fee revenue shared by the state both the economic downturn and structural changes in the demand for motor fuel have caused this key revenue source to wane over the past decade thus must continue to strive for savings and service level improvements in response to the weakness in this revenue stream fortunately the fund has taken some pressure traditional dedicated transportation revenues however when the fund is exhausted now projected for early in the pressure is funded largely from federal grants and legally restricted tax and fee revenue though shielded from the sharp decline in local income tax has suffered from a similarly dramatic tightening of federal grant funds as the weak national economy and serious federal deficit concerns has slowed the spigot of support for local planning and economic development efforts in response the introduced budget includes a million transfer from the city general fund to maintain at its current service level will continue to operate at the level their dedicated revenue support charges fees only to those who use its service freeing all taxpayers of the burden of funding this department so its funding level depends more on the effectiveness of its operations than on the general tax revenue climate of local government from a funding perspective the division is the most unique of the dedicated fund supported city departments it does in fact receive a substantial share of its revenue from the while the division is also eligible to receive fee revenue all of that revenue has been allocated to emergency dispatch operations in because the method for allocating revenue to is uniquely prescribed by state law this income tax revenue has legal characteristics more like a dedicated funding source than a flexible general funding source allocations balance is distributed to all other eh shifted to other uses within the operating budget of the consolidated city because the division is so dependent on local income tax revenue its funding has suffered as a result of the sharp downturn in local income tax distributions to county since the adopted budget restores funding to a more appropriate level to accomplish this the was increased by nearly million this will enable the division to proceed with an initiative to replace an aging dispatch cad system support for the county public library finally the matter of funding for the county public library has also been a growing concern over the past few years during the session of the general assembly municipal finance laws governing county were changed to allow a portion of the revenue to be allocated to the the fact that local income tax revenue is currently stagnant makes the idea of adding new uses for these scarce funds less appealing fiscally however with an eye on the long haul adding the library to the allocation formula is the right policy of the county total this same policy is continued in the adopted budget providing with looking forward the adopted budget for the consolidated city once again sets forth a responsible fiscal plan by which agencies can continue serving all citizens of county making a safe livable city now and for decades to come however with the still unresolved structural deficit and the a sharp million rebound in local income tax revenues for the consolidated city anticipated in provides reason for optimism however serious fiscal challenges and decisions still lay ahead based on the adopted budget summarized in this report the budget gap entering the budget cycle will potentially total million this estimate recognizes that a a portion of the million gap for is closed with the spend down of reserves fixed and costs continue to rise and tax revenue growth will likely remain stagnant aside from the unique million income tax in to bridge this gap it is imperative that we maintain some reserves and continue to find meaningful operational savings the office of finance management must seriously consider exercising its authority to invoke a management reserve requirement on department and agency budgets under this authority up to approximately million of the general fund appropriations be withheld from budgets also mayor ballad has tasked the office of audit performance to identify at least million in savings from elimination of added redundancies remaining across the operations of all departments and agencies of the consolidated city for example the sheriff and the now engage separate vendors for psychological testing of deputies and officers also the sheriff superior courts and county prosecutor are exempted from working through the central human resources division of the consolidated city such work is the official charge of by virtue of its authorizing code cite delivering on this savings goal will require the cooperation of all city departments and county agencies and is critical to managing the finances of the consolidated city until a return of broad based economic growth starts helping the local tax base recover funds the state board of accounts defines fund to mean cash or a group of accounts set aside for the purpose of accounting for monies or other resources of general functions or specific activities in accordance with the system of accounts prescribed by the state board of accounts or as required by statute state board of accounts accounting and uniform compliance guidelines manual for cities and towns state of reissued funds that the prescribes for use by cities include but are not limited to general funds special revenue funds debt services funds capital projects funds internal service funds and agency funds funds included in the adopted budget represent those that require appropriation by the council appropriation is the authorization of the council by ordinance to make disbursements or to incur obligations for specific purposes general funds are funds which receive a substantial share of their revenue from taxes that have very broad flexibility for example the county option income tax distributions and the county general fund property tax levy legally be used to fund any governmental purpose the core general operating funds for the consolidated city are county general fund consolidated county general fund aka city general fund metropolitan police department general fund fire department general fund and parks general fund additionally in there are six other funds that are also defined as general operating funds they are public safety income tax fund county public safety income tax fund city personal services contingency fund county personal services contingency fund city guardian ad fund and medical care for inmates fund what all of these funds have in common is that they each will each receive a substantial amount of flexible tax revenue in thus there is the ability to reallocate the flexible revenue flowing to these funds across many competing operational needs dedicated funds dedicated funds on the other hand are funds which receive revenue from taxes or sources that have very restricted legal uses a more apt of a dedicated fund description is a fund that receives little or no revenue from flexible tax revenue sources some examples are the parking meter fund and the permits fund these are both dedicated funds because their revenue sources have strictly limited legal uses the consolidated city also uses dedicated funds to account for the proceeds of specific revenue sources special revenue funds for expenditures restricted to a specific purpose debt service funds enterprise funds debt service funds aka sinking funds are used to account for the accumulation of revenue for the payment of longterm debt principal and interest grant funds finally the consolidated city also employs grant funds to collect revenues and track expenditures for grant monies received from other units
