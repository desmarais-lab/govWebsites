out with the old and in with the new now that the holidays are over you have new things it might be time to go through the cupboards and closets and clear out some of your unused items many items that you no longer need still have lots of good wear left in them consider taking clothes you no longer wear that are in good shape to a thrift store charity or church clothes closet for others to use perhaps you have extra patio furniture a ping table stuffed away in the garage or even a stereo system that still works that just takes up space consider selling them or donating the items to a group that would use them by choosing to pass on items in good condition rather than tossing them out you save space in our landfill and give someone else the opportunity to get some good use out of them keep on reducing reusing and recycling if you are in and need a container for your recyclable materials call the sanitary district at and request a blue roller for your curbside pickup
