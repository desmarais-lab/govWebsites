members present brown the meeting began at am in the engineering conference room in the municipal building we approved the commission minutes we began by discussing commission membership renewals and the need to elect officers for the coming year since several people were missing today we decided to defer officer decisions until our next meeting we have already asked the mayor to renew terms for existing commission members whose terms have expired we agreed to continue meeting in the engineering conference room for the coming months since the availability of the community room on mornings at the time when we meet is not yet clear there is no official way to reserve the engineering conference room but we should be able to meet there and if necessary we can move to the council chamber down the hall we spent the remainder of the meeting working on the environmental resources guide especially the sections drafted by on sustainable living and on local organizations and contacts we also brainstormed possible issues questions for the pollution remediation section agreed to work on the industrial side of that area while will keep working on residential issues we will continue to work on other sections of the guide next month as time allows we decided that the guide can include both questions and answers facts as well as lists of organizations and contacts our main goal however is to direct people to places where their questions can be answered not to try to answer all possible questions ourselves in some cases we can provide both a brief answer to a question when it is straightforward and links to more information and resources if needed we will not list the names and titles of specific people as contacts just overall phone and email contact information for organizations or departments both because specific contact names are likely to change over time and because the main contact sources will be more useful for answering peoples questions we decided we will publish the guide only online not in paper to save money and avoid the issue of funding and because we can provide live links online and the guide will be easier to update in that format we should think about dovetailing our questions and answers to possible searches to lead people with questions directly to the guide asked people who are still working on their sections to send them to him by the before the next meeting in he will again send out a reminder a week before that day
