mayor remarks about wiretap case ruling in a few weeks after taking office i learned of a situation in which police officers were allegedly recorded in violation of the federal wiretap act cassette tapes were made of these recordings i did not then and do not now know what is on those tapes because of rumors about the content of the recordings i came under enormous pressure to release these cassette tapes the common council issued a subpoena to try to force the administration to give them copies of the tapes we did not do so because i was concerned that doing so might be illegal instead we turned to the courts today a federal judge confirmed our concerns the judge issued a decision that the recordings made after are illegal under the act and prohibited from disclosure this means that there is no way to satisfy all the councils demands without breaking federal law todays ruling makes it clear that all but one of the cassette recordings created by former chief and ms and subpoenaed by common council were illegal and violated the wiretap act making them was illegal listening to them would be illegal copying them would be illegal and disclosing them would be illegal under this decision the only exception that we are aware of is one conversation allegedly recorded on on one cassette referred to in footnote of the decision our attorneys will be reviewing this to i do not see this as a matter of the administration winning or the council losing it is helpful to know that we did not waste everyones time and money by resisting pressure to do something unlawful the toughest thing about this situation is that people in the community will remain curious about what is on the tapes i am curious too but we cannot violate federal law just to satisfy our curiosity and we must remember that listening to the tapes would not have completely answered community concerns the truth is that this is not just about some cassette tapes this is about issues much deeper and those issues deserve to be taken seriously communities across are struggling with deep concerns about the role of race in the criminal justice system and as long as there is mistrust between members of our community and the men and women in uniform whose job is to keep us all safe we have work to do the fact that some people believe police officers in this community are capable of the existence of that itself something that we must address and we have to do it together we know that there are police officers who serve every day with courage and integrity risking their lives to keep us safe we also know that some in the community do not feel they can trust the police our entire country is facing that problem and south bend is no exception no one can rest until there is both a perception and an undisputed reality that racial bias is not practiced or tolerated anywhere especially on our police force moving toward that future will not be easy but i am committed to doing whatever it takes to make that happen all of council members community leaders police officers faith community neighbors even the of us have to work together on this so that we can share a life of safety justice and harmony
