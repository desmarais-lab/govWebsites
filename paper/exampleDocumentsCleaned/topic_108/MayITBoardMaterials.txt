request for additional information to help troubleshoot has been made with no response from to date performance issues related to running the test instance on a virtual server still need to be

application mimics the approvals that were already in place complete development begin testing completed development moved to user acceptance testing complete user acceptance testing deploy application following feedback mini customization enterprise application mini is a version of the search engine dedicated to searching the website although just as simple to use for basic searches as our current search engine mini can provide more robust capabilities for our more advanced users since searches are performed in the same fashion users will not require any additional training perhaps one of the greatest benefits of mini is that it is capable of searching the entire domain rather than just this would include other hosted sites such as etc complete testing implementation completed testing and moved tool into production has contacted selected agencies for additional feedback and we continue to monitor help desk requests for any issues none project completed web redesign

modifications and provided results of the enterprise deployment the automated mapping engine will allow users to create a high cartographic quality map without the need for desktop software to be installed the application has been designed with a nontechnical user in mind and will simplify the process of creating maps it will only be available to users on the users will be able to select from a set of predefined datasets to be mapped on top of a base set of map layers they will also be able to further refine the data to be displayed by specifying an attribute filter to be applied a geographic region such as a township council district or neighborhood organization boundary and a date range the user will be able to specify the size and orientation for the map and then the application will create a pdf format file of the map in question and ship it to the user the is being developed and deployed in phases functionality included in phase i is described above phase ii will add the following the ability to save map definitions for repeated use the ability to subscribe to receive a map based upon a saved definition on a regular basis via email this map would of course contain current data such as all citizen calls to the mac within the past month reporting capabilities so that a tabular report could be included in your map subscription move phase i to

phone update we have been working on the sheriffs project and have gotten most of the forwarding mailboxes and stations configured we worked on a caller id issue that occurred when they had their new installed we are waiting on some additional port space to schedule the actual installation the sheriffs civil office is cutting over to support on the it office will cut on the st we will be working on the schedule for the other sites with major meadows we expect all sites to be completed by the end of the year the lines at and the jail plus any remaining lines within the can move at any time however any remote sites will depend on the metropolitan police consolidation plans infrastructure we received the price for the maintenance with our new equipment we have significantly increased the equipment by adding the duplicate core equipment at our site however the monthly pricing will decrease by if we resign our existing contract that is to expire in and extend it for months from now we will save approximately over the next years it is recommended that we do this has approved for to be a beta site for their new call management system our existing call management system is years old we believe this would be a good direction since we would be receiving the newest technology it would service the mayors action center and all of our other call centers this would be beneficial if we implement a center voting poll locator application quit working worked through the night to set up another server the issue ended up being a programming issue where an application was pointing to a
