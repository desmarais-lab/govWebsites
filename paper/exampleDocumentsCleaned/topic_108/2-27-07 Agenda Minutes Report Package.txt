by end of this year the project which will aid in improving interactions is ongoing with an updated project plan and a kickoff meeting to explain the beta testing process with all the users has received a list of names and a commitment from those users to be involved in testing is yellow on the report due to and can not approve the actual application until testing has taken place the litigation case management application is yellow pending determination of hosting the application or an outside vendor continues to improve customer services with stoneware with production ready by first of stated that there have been issues with users laptops and asked if the issues have been resolved ms explained that users have to have a connected to the network in order for stoneware to work ms continued discussing responses have been received for the outdoor warning systems for with a meeting scheduled for for final comments the liberty shield grant is going well a bill of materials has been received and the funding requirements for phase and have been met the consolidation project has been challenging requiring coordination from all vendors and internal resources the effort has included working with and progress on the portal continues with access the design document is complete and staff is working on a prototype to be presented to the customers the project will be in conjunction with the polis center for incorporation of datasets as mentioned at the last it board is working with channel for video streaming for the enterprise the ms migration continues with of the machines complete the asset inventory was delivered by to last week the board has been provided policies and procedures for review and feedback at the next it board meeting and approval of next year health contracts have moved forward to upgrade the data center to the uptime institutes tier level in operations missed all due to migration major meadows stated that the report presented to the it

expressed the importance of the progress that has been made in order to obtain the green or yellow status commented on the red status on response time and the potential of a financial penalty currently the enterprise is involved with the merging of and deputies into the upgrade issues with asset inventory all happening at a fast pace cautioned being careful in penalizing a partnership in which has done what has been asked of them ms stated that the contract allows the to waive the penalty has been proactive regarding the concern and none of the missed are a surprise ms added that the agency continues to monitor the service levels to identify something other than dropped service due to the migration congratulated staff on the work on the neighborhood portal and the agreement with

not yet been signed and asked if the additional delay will prevent the project from getting back on track the ordinance has to go before city county council and judge young expressed concern that the delay will impact the enterprise explained that contract has been negotiated the issue is that the appropriations have not been approved by council the city county council has asked to hold off until the new county auditor assessor and county recorder have the opportunity to review the system and decided what they would like stated that the project is pending a signed contract and appropriations although it could have moved forward a year ago expressed concern that it would be possible to implement the system for next year factoring in the new elected official and the subsequent learning curve stated that the system is the best one out there and expressed frustration with the ongoing delays although a commitment was made from the former recorder and there is the possibility that the incoming recorder will not want this system judge young asked if the project is now back to square one explained that by statute with six incumbents approval has to be by majority he did not believe

the contract has been before this board and has been approved as city controller can not approve funding until approved by the city county council stated that the ordinance had been written however no one has made a presentation at the city county council level stated that during the review process it was determined that only one system would work for county added that if this system was not purchased there was not a suitable alternative further stated that the delays are a result of a political game that has been played for over a year every duly elected official agreed on both sides the money has been identified now the wait is for someone that has never been an assessor never been a recorder to find out this is the system they want it is a slap to those that made that decision in good faith added that a new property system is needed if one is not purchased funds will have to spent on on a system just to be in compliance with the state continued that it would be foolish to spend million dollars on a system that will not be kept added that there is no need to rush judge young commented on the positive experience on election day with everyones willingness to help out specifically judge young complimented and all staff available on days that are not normally worked judge young asked if it is available on the flex program to include moving violation traffic tickets

funds from parking tickets with the intent to increase the collect rate stated that the possibility will be looked into judge young asked if there is funding for which has been discussed at least months ago ms stated that the funds would be available in judge young continued that the project was known about for six months and asked why it was not put in budget responded that one time capital

that the is unique currently programmers are occupied with ongoing changes to the old justice system which is taking away actual test time the additional testing is required to identify additional bugs the agreed upon solution is to have users test added that there are two items left one security batch job and to test how well they have done needs a user team put together which is different from normal the need is for experienced users to see what works and what needs fixed ms stated that has a list of people and a meeting has been scheduled for the next two weeks ms enders questioned the preliminary on the sow clarified that is an administrative error and preliminary will be removed ms enders requested that tasks be identified as they relate to projects implied tasks need to be

included in future discussions it would be useful availability of fund for important initiatives as a resident and general citizen and member of board if could frame discussion around projects and then around the annual budget process and interdependent of user agencies would be extremely helpful presented the asset management update explained the three main challenges as the first is to purchase and acquire the physical item once the item arrives to enter into software to track that item and ensure compliance most of the problems run into fall under the third category of tracking assets the user has removed the ability to monitor assets live on the network relies on communication one way or another and those that do not the bulk of the assets constantly communicate on the network the enterprise needs to keep current care most of asset portion of the hope to keep tract of well connected on the network if and do not keep current another wall to wall inventory will be required continued discussion of the lost and stolen report which will be run as an easy method to determine assets that no longer show up on inventory without report without software wont be able to know that ms stated this is especially important with leases stated that policies will be required to penalize departments that do not abide by them allowing to properly monitor assets there is also the availability to lock down to be more proactive in identifying what is in the environment discussed policies for the process of transferring assets each agency needs to decide what is acceptable ms added staff is evaluating the service levels of the contract regarding devices since the physical inventory is complete and will bring a recommendation to the it board or will be working with the office of finance and management on disposal ms enders asked if the user agencies and departments know this is coming ms stated members of the it team are aware the challenges will be in educating and communicating video streaming ken lead project manager presented a demonstration on video streaming which allows citizens to view public meetings via the internet contract negotiations are on going
