agency to enter into two master lease agreements on behalf of any city or county entities who choose to lease technology equipment whereas the information technology board approved resolution as amended on and whereas resolution resolution and whereas there are several county and city entities who are desirous of leasing personal computers and other technology equipment to replace existing machines whereas the information services agency issued a request for proposal for master leasing services and received proposal responses on and whereas the information services agency desires to enter into a master lease arrangement with the two most responsive vendors and dell to fulfill the lease services necessary to provide equipment to city or county entities as needed and delegates to the chief information officer authority to award contracts to two vendors and enter into master lease arrangements on behalf of city and county entities to provide leasing of technology equipment memorandum subject master lease agreements structure last month you approved resolution after amending it to have me include improved lease rates based on volume of purchases i apologize for the fact that both turner and i had personal emergencies and were unable to attend since we had been the two people chiefly involved in these bids i am bringing this action back to you at the meeting because i was not able to accomplish what you asked me to do as i understand the issue presented the it board felt we should be able to gain some benefit by buying more units of technology purchase more and we get bigger discounts we have addressed this in the negotiations for our standard hardware with dell and hp our quoted numbers are based on the vendor expecting we will purchase in the neighborhood of a year this is not guaranteed but is where they have priced our items we can and do look for possible improvement if we make a large purchase such as the recent courts of in one step this resolution is to award a contract with two leasing companies to be able to in essence buy a service where the leasing vendor purchases this technology and furnishes it to local government as such the pricing of this transaction is primarily a factor of the credit rating and the current cost of funds at the time of the lease schedule being made our lease schedules will not likely be large enough to see any major rate influence please note that our reason for structuring this to award to two companies was to keep the element of market competition in the mix we will be able to see that we receive current market rates because if one vendor is not competitive they will not get the business at the time of the lease schedule this gives us the built in support of current market forces to keep lease rates as low as possible i hope this explains why i was not able to honor the direction given in the last resolution i will ask for your approval to move forward as originally presented at the board meeting

information to constituents we believe this will continue to grow in utilization across local government our first deployment for emergency management garnered us national press i look forward to our discussions on exhibit what is the list server how can you efficiently improve communications with your constituents list servers are a powerful internet tool that push messages to a target audience promote traffic to the web site and improve communications with minimal effort from the email list or sponsor improving communication the primary purpose of a list server is to improve communication its a convenient way to share information with members and county organizations can use the list server to receive communications staff can receive newsletters announcements and notifications of meetings and events new staff can subscribe to the department or office list this could eliminate the need to maintain personal distribution lists for employees instead staff can receive communications via the office receive emails for specific interests other agencies the public can subscribe to to receive email for specific topics members can receive newsletters announcements and notifications of meetings and events for example the city has used this tool to set up an for flood warnings interested members of the public sign up and then receive automatic notices whenever warnings are issued exchange ideas and discuss issues the list server also provides a forum for the exchange of ideas and to discuss issues information can be submitted to the list to be read responded to by other subscribers this is an informal mechanism to gather more candid comments and opinions than what be received through more formal communication methods can generate electronic conversations much like a public meeting might minimal effort list servers provide dynamic email distribution lists can be restricted to internal use by department and agencies or open to the public once a list server is setup subscribers can enroll and remove themselves from the using the web browser or email commands without manual intervention or assistance from the system administrator this allows the subscriber to with no effort on the part of the government staff can be classified as can be closed so users cannot reply to the sender the list moderator can send a message to all members but the user interacts only with the moderator or the list server and not other users a common use of is announcement and newsletters are open the members can interact with each other and respond to messages posted to the list a discussion forum is an example of a list this service is now available for use every office is encouraged to create to communicate with the public and its staff to establish a new the elected official agency or department head should use the list server request form page at an internal address for a department or an office should be published as part of the training materials for new staff once existing staff have been advised of its features and use currently available can be viewed at the list server questions about the use of the list server can be answered by contacting or by using the list server feedback page at information technology monthly status report management and staff have been busy preparing for the effective date of amendment the
