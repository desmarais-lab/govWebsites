ask for something not planned he discussed the budget variances page of the budget packet has taken in reductions to its base budget other changes reflect the th pay increased fringe costs and security costs as set in guidelines by the auditors office budget is also impacted by changes made for its customers such as added software contract maintenance charges additional servers either added in or planned for and the addition of the juvenile court to our services the budget also includes the increase for the main contract negotiated in also is increasing its budget to more correctly reflect the annual budget for which now passes funds through previously had budget for but their projected budget for is higher this is funded by fund balance already received by overall budget was

reductions ms motioned to amend the resolution to indicate the budget amount is not to exceed ms ms motioned to approve the amended resolution ms enders seconded and the motion passed unanimously sourcing discussion began the sourcing discussion with some history of the key dates and activities from the previous outsourcing process started in ms stated that was doing a good job for the she voiced concern that going out for an while many things in local government are changing and our current financial situation was risky the options of an and were defined and discussed ms stated a baa broad agency announcement might be a better option for government a baa is less detailed than an but allows for vendors to respond with the services they can provide while allowing maximum flexibility for local government the likely candidates are then chosen and a more detailed scope and cost analysis are was tasked with investigating whether the baa process was available for to use asked the board to vote on whether or not to proceed with taking the current sourcing services back to the market the board voted four to one in favor of going to market ms advocated remaining with the current vendor after discussion regarding outside assistance for the committed to the board that no contracts for outside assistance would be executed without board concurrence discussed that it will be critical for a specific communication plan will have to be developed to manage the ongoing communications with all affected parties including staff staff and other groups such as the cc council discussed the initiatives presented in the draft strategic plan and in the recent strategic plan during the discussions the following were listed as high priority being considered or underway it board retreat minutes replacement new constituent relationship management system state supreme court case management system of the financial management systems hr purchasing payroll general ledger expanding services integration of continued code initiatives statewide voter registration system board members added the last two items listed during the discussions within the scope of the the vendor will need to explain how they can provide services assist the move into the future based on the above initiatives and also remain flexible to assist with changes required for the vision necessary for future integration of systems summarized the boards discussion and stated that the team will have to be cognizant of what they are asking for referring to the graph regarding the levels of sourcing agreements he stated that for the to move into more of a transformational contract the upper level on graphic vendor costs could very well end up being much higher than what the current contract spends now posed the question to the board to consider whether to provide vendors with an that includes the current it environment or just provide vendors with a vision for the next five to seven years and have the vendor tell us how they can achieve this vision and at what cost ms felt it would be a disservice if the were to go out to bid asking for just what is in place now ms enders and ms felt all projects and initiatives need to be looked at from an enterprise advantage and not on an individual basis will continue to refine the future state description within the revised strategic plan for use in the this will be distributed to the board for further discussions attempted to define a graphic that ties this future relationship of systems together on the board will try to refine this diagram for use in the plan the draft document of the strategic plan was discussed further the board stated the goals developed in the document are too broad and not measurable the planning group should identify the goals that are easier to track and less generic the document should identify business goals that are tangible and concrete initiatives discussion centered around how to define overarching goals such as improving government efficiency and supporting economic development and driving down to more specific initiatives from those goals such as implementing a new application and coordinating systems to tie together through document management and it board retreat minutes in order to formulate a plan and vision stated he strongly believes that needs to have outside consultants help his staff prepare for and properly write a successful he stated the efforts spent now will impact the for the next five years and that a contract of this size in the million range requires spending some funds to ensure success his staff and other assistance within the city county are good folks but they are not specialists in this highly specialized area this assistance is not to bring in highly paid consultants to write the but it is for outside resources to work with our staff to advise and suggest options and opportunities in areas such as clearly defining the future vision the technology strategic initiative plan for assistance in developing future service level agreements for the new contract for clearly developing the scoring structure for the responses as well as other significant areas stated the board needed to make decisions regarding the scope of the new agreement this includes whether or not to change the scope of services for the the following might be some of the services that can be included or excluded within the scope of services external vendor as a whole voice support business consultants contract applications development contract external applications development others recorder fleet services and ms stated they believe that the potential scope should be open for consideration of all these options it was agreed that each area outside the current scope would be contacted for potential inclusion as an option in the the topic of offshore contracting has become a viable choice for many businesses asked if the board was open to this as a potential source of services this would need to be addressed in the he said that this is becoming a high visibility item in most sourcing discussions in the market today stated more work could be achieved for less money by going offshore the statistics show that the cost for offshore work is about half of what it would cost to have the work done onshore he mentioned that there are significant issues that must be addressed but that many companies are looking at it seriously because of the economics of the services the board agreed that the issue of offshore contracting should not be prohibited in our suggested putting as many options into an as you possibly can once items are omitted the vendor has less room to provide what they can offer commented that this has to be done in a manner that allows the means to clearly evaluate the responses against each other for award without structure in evaluation you cannot make a responsible decision it board retreat minutes another option discussed was remote service management remote service management is a vendor that could operate many of the production services remotely by combining the server or mainframe needs and those of other organizations at a site where the cost to process distributed services is driven down by volume this could conceivable include purchasing the assets and moving them print jobs and reports now on the th floor could be generated from a remote site and delivered to electronically ms stated if there is cost savings in remote service management and it can be justified and secured the option should be very viable in terms of the duration of a contract when developing an the board decided the best solution would be a five year term with two one year extensions an evaluation committee will need to be formed in order to balance the participation and recommendations recommended the following participants three board members chairperson plus two two county representatives two city representatives deputy director of contract compliance ms would like to have the it board formulate and evaluate the ms cautioned the members of the time commitment involved in being a part of the total process the board emphasized they will be willing to make the time commitment throughout the process expressed concerns that while sincere in their commitment the board did not fully understand the hundreds of hours that will be required to serve on this development and evaluation team in thanked everyone for their open discussion and participation as we start this extremely important task for the he

instead is subtitled as of we have struggled for some time with reporting information that is relatively dated by supplying this report on the previous month in many cases we did actually report on current info for the next month given that the it board meeting is usually the third week of the month moving forward we will supply information up to the penning of the report in order to provide more timely information as i sit and draft this three major activities come to mind for the last month these are budgets telephones and worms from my viewpoint this is an issue because the list should have been headed by sourcing we have worked on our preparations but our activities required to keep our customers functioning seemed to have required so much time away from the activities we will discuss these activities at the board meeting regarding budgets worked with the city and county staffs down to the final hours before budget publication working with budget reductions the city and county face difficult financial challenges and will help in any way to work through these issues as is our practice senior staff attends the majority of the city county council committee budget presentations for our customers in order to provide any information regarding the technology budgets we have been able to answer specific questions immediately in several committees which allows the committee to move on and not have an outstanding item they have questioned we also use these sessions to gain a better perspective on where our customers are going strategically with their departments and agencies we had a major software failure on th for our main telephone switch when the system reset itself at pm telephone service was not available for the entire network for about minutes however while the city county building came back online all remote sites outside the building did not at pm we reset the main switch again which allowed all the remotes to connect worked all night to identify what happened and develop a software patch to correct the issue it was completed early the next morning but not early enough for us to apply it before our call load started back we were monitoring the switch closely and had hoped we could make it through the day and apply the patch that evening unfortunately we were not that lucky and could see that the error hard started and we would go down during the afternoon in order to control the issue we decided to take the switch down over lunch and apply the patch after further review another patch that totally corrected the error was applied at midnight on night we have met several times with management and technical staff regarding this outage understands how critical our telephone service is to local government and takes this very seriously when an error such as this occurs and finally there is the worm which attacked us on this week the number of machines impacted was in the multiple hundreds because we used automated processes to fix the problems we do not have an exact count the worm attacked any of our machines running windows of which we have approximately installed it was also said to attack windows and but we did not experience any of these i am extremely proud of the efforts of the staff to diagnose limit its spread and then attack the intrusion we had already developed and started to execute a counterattack to remove the worm and clean up the infection by the time the national companies had published their first signature files which would identify the culprit in developing our plans for protecting the local environment from attacks such as this all the literature and books talk about your prevention strategies and how to keep the intrusion out they also clearly state that you have to have an effective process to correct intrusions because they will happen no matter how good your prevention is we are disappointed that this worm got in but i think we did an excellent job of minimizing the impacts to our customers and to the taxpayers we will be doing an after action review to identify improvements in our process to be even better prepared should the need arise again to perform these services i look forward to discussing these items with you at the it board meeting mike while is typically thought of a time where vacations are taken many requirements of our customers
