later today automation has twenty percent of the configuration done one of the bigger issues is doing all the reporting the camera project final project plan has been received and the vendor is working on site surveys for the enterprise resource planning project we are still gathering information and plan to present in property data conversion is percent complete and going quite well training and testing for the property system is in progress load testing will occur on for the email archiving project will be when it is rolled out standards and policies will be discussed later today there are virtual servers on boxes we did have on three boxes just a few months ago some of the new applications that we are rolling in for example property system etc are all on the virtual server met service levels for two months in a row and met their service levels commented that he worked on election day in the help room and did an awesome job with application of the issues there

vs has spent just under million of the million allocated for this year which is roughly percent we have identified and encumbered dollars for projects and equipment we plan to purchase throughout the remainder of this year you will see the total expenditure numbers go up as we finish this year for the revenue section out of the projected revenue of million we have collected year to date just shy of million which is percent of budget as dollars come in we record them cash basis of accounting the final section in the report is the contract comparison for the major service areas which is just a little over million year to date this year vs last year was million in addition you might note that we are going back to council for appropriations to reimburse our budget in it is due to the fact of the double budgeting as has referred to it will seek to recover dollars spent by other agencies throughout the year which we planned on within our budget asked if we were going to be this much under budget by the end of the year hood stated he did not think we would be since we have encumbered the remaining dollars there are projects and equipment purchases that we will expend in the last months of and ms stated that we would have some under spending in character when we ask for the fiscal ordinance instead of asking for appropriations from departments we will use some of the character under spending to offset there is roughly we will have in under spending in character this year resolution ms contract manager requested the board approval for as it was tabled last month ms reiterated the request of meadows county sheriffs department from last months it board meeting that the contract go out for bid next renewal and request is duly noted in the contract file made a motion and enders second the motion passed unanimously resolution ken presented his overview for emergency phone service these are through and hardwired back to the central switch this system is used for alarms and other things that require a hardwire service ms stated that is single provider that provides this service after discussion questions from the board there was a motion to approve made by enders and seconded by and the motion passed unanimously case management update amber and rick present the case management solution the project is pending considering our review and continuing with the scripting process need to identify new users to bring in for the scripting sessions analyzing reports to prioritize by viewing the number of users touching panels and number of times touched rick manager spoke about enhancement requests and using the new system the state will be sending us this information in electronic format this is not currently compatible with how is set up we will have to modify the system to allow us to process the cases currently we get one charge per ticket with the new system it could be up to four charges per ticket ms white explained that means uniformed traffic ticket this application is much faster and a great application and hopeful to use in a more global way judge said that in other courts especially the court and some felony a lot of the other charges accompany the tickets this is work that we must do to our current mainframe system as explained by it is being taken into account by the odyssey system if we move forward with we will translate this new code and it will carry forward if we move forward with odyssey then that is taken care of by the state asked how many people hours we have saved by using this system rick offered that we have not measured but paper tickets that cost money will eventually disappear and this is very significant a future comparison for and odyssey are taking place and hope to bring to the board time and cost comparison can be offered by a rough idea of comparison between two solutions a true time and cost analysis would need additional resources be working hand in hand with and resources standards and policy update and john manager presented the standards of it industry and updates for the new desktop standard laptop standards better faster and pricing wise we are not paying additional cost the price for new model is roughly same cost as old model tablet standard aggressively priced and comes with a docking station if necessary it meets specific needs in we are in the pilot phase of thin client tablets will only be used if dictated by the environment we wanted to set a standard so if we use in the future motion made to accept the proposed new standards by meadows and second by motion passes energy management discussed the mayors office energy conservation policy at the time we reviewed the policy and sought to see where we were in compliance using our remote management software tools we have set the remote management to comply with policy we are not adding any software we are just going in and adjusting power settings monitors will now power down after ten minutes of inactivity and processor moves into standby after one hour of no activity and two hours will move to the hibernate mode the periods are consistent with policy cost saving in energy cost based on is estimated at we can really make an impact by pushing these savings out other benefits energy use and energy cost can be reduce from million to by making this change happen the stated exceptions were few laptops are not part of this policy technology update thin client and john passed around equipment for the board to experience hands on and more closely view the thin client device is basically a terminal into a windows machine where applications run on a central server which allows you deploy the thin client almost anywhere including locations that not have a high speed connection other advantages are that data is stored on a server and not on a desktop machine benefits also include the cost of the device plus power savings there is an estimated savings in power consumption versus a standard desktop device is administered remotely and the user cannot do anything to change the configuration of the device thereby making the unit less susceptible to viruses ms injected that there is less of an incentive to steal since the unit will not operate without a server management cost will go down since the unit is centrally managed went through all applications that would be operated through the thin client however desktops will still be needed for and certain applications that will not run on the thin client offered that he is an enthusiast for this device cautioned also that we are using and thin clients but server network does slow down client response time as utilization goes up enhanced access review committee third quarter reports and ms president of presented is our new name for anyone going to is now redirected to there have been approx transactions processed resulting in million dollars worth of funds taken in for statutory funds year to date of dollars for enhanced access revenue and that is additional revenue over and above statutory funds collected fees are to each transaction and multiplied by for credit card use contracts under meadows asked about offered the relationship assists us with evaluation of our software processes and making recommendations on improving the processes adjourned the meeting was adjourned at am project has been completed this is the last time it will appear on this report the project is experiencing significant delays potential cost overruns or critical failure hard deadlines be exceed in excess of original budget immediate corrective action is the project is experiencing minor delays or minor cost overruns or the project has encountered problems which put it at risk of either going or missing deadlines hard deadlines can still be achieved but original goal dates be missed cost end up over original budget project is on time and on budget with no delays or budget issues anticipated project including estimates define the work of the project and how the examples improve operation efficiencies and reduce costs infrastructure improvements neighborhood cameras modular messaging business case radio frequency identification move server improve quality of services finished phase of gathering high level business requirements from purchasing office of the auditor clerk treasurer and currently the project is in phase where is gathering market research information on available software options to determine levels of customer service cost and support next will explore best practices in the market to discover what organizations and other governmental agencies are using to improve their financial operations the initial draft of the market research report is targeted for completion the end of case management identified additional users to bring in for user acceptance testing scripting sessions based upon report analysis the team is in the process of scheduling scripting sessions with those users the development team submitted an updated task list with completion estimates to be included in an overall project estimate odyssey the review process is continuing the review team is preparing a feature comparison and risk comparison of odyssey and the team is also working toward a rough estimate for cost and time for odyssey while the project team is preparing an estimate for the completion of upgrade a project kickoff meeting was held on th which included planning and compliance representatives as well as prescient personnel the prescient services include the installation and configuration of on servers conversion of existing document storage from optical to magnetic media and an gap analysis the gap analysis will indicate whether development of an additional replacement software package is necessary to act as a document revision agent in addition to the new software capabilities installation is to be completed by automation analysis is complete the configuration phase updates to to meet requirements is complete interfaces are complete efforts for report development are complete total reports effort the project is yellow for the following reasons delays with deliverable finalization acceptance finalization of interface roles compliance move holiday leave the team will reevaluate project schedule dates such that we can evaluate options including phased schedule extension municipal wireless feasibility study this feasibility study continues to move forward interviews are proceeding as planned with three of the eight scheduled for the first round complete preliminary feedback from stakeholders has been positive with all three of the initial interviewees expressing interest agreeing that this feasibility study is needed to aggregate and understand the demand for municipal wireless they also indicated their desire to participate in a brainstorming session about the types of applications that would provide the greatest benefits if delivered over a wireless network the remaining interviews with stakeholder agencies are scheduled th th external stakeholder interviews are as yet unscheduled pending the internal interview results enterprise resource planning the office of finance and management and are developing a business case for replacement of the financial and human resource systems developing a business case will

service calls and also met to provide a knowledge transfer of the current network design site surveys are in progress upon camera installs can begin liberty zone hardware was received and is being configured for the final camera install of phase once the camera is installed and working properly of phase can take place phase cameras will not be installed until the completion and of the phase cameras phase cameras are expected to be installed by enterprise vault during the last week of and worked together to successfully implement and it is now operational within to the enterprise will be done in phases over the next few months to minimize the impact to end users and the exchange environment in parallel with this the outlook archiving engine will be disabled for each user when automated email archiving is enabled to ensure that users are fully converted to following email archived prior to implementation commonly called will be added to the enterprise archive to complete the property system replacement initial data conversion is complete with property complete the converted data looks good no major problems there are mobile homes and a few condos left to convert liability data payments etc will not be converted until the treasurer module is ready for complete implementation in the time frame county and township assessors subject matter expert training and testing began on and will continue through load and stress testing has been scheduled for th the goal of load and stress testing is to determine if planned hardware is adequate software performs acceptably on hardware network and bandwidth resources are sufficient self password reset as of all active directory passwords have been expired and are now on a day expiration cycle the overall impact to the help desk was minimal and we did not receive any large call spikes due to the expiration of the passwords we currently have users registered to use the tool and the help desk team is actively authenticating these users by using the challenge questions text changes to help desk resolution response emails will be implemented by to inform users of the requirement to use for all future password reset requests the current plan is to begin requiring all users to use the tool to reset passwords effective storage assessment additional storage has been ordered and should be delivered and operational early in work is now focused on developing a strategy for backing up data of servers continues with virtual servers running on physical boxes an additional servers have been purchased to handle the additional capacity needs for all of the ongoing projects and to consolidate existing servers technical resources from were the last week of to assist in optimizing the environment and will continue to work with us as more servers are to ensure a smooth transition modular messaging equipment for the system has arrived and is in the process of being installed will be
