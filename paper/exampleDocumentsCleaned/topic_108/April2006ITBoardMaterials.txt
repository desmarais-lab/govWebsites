seconded by major meadows and carried unanimously demonstration and presented the demonstration asked if the second delay is a hardware issue slowing down the network connection explained the delay is caused by an outside pipe being smaller than the internal pipe which results in the data slowing down when exiting explained that with the firewalls a four second delay from the outside is expected ms enders requested verification that when a user signs on their with the single they are set to pull up judge young stated that the visual available is exactly what the current looks like the transition to will be a seamless transition and users will not have to learn anything new which is what makes the project so exciting explained that the visual presentation is a case file the supreme court in acting administrative rule has now said that social security numbers addresses personal identifiers should no longer be viewed by the public administrative rule for records became effective for records effective forward there is no responsibility on the part of the clerk of the court to go back and delete that information delete those identifiers from earlier case files to do so could bankrupt many offices the example presented was not the best but also not required to be hidden under law the courts are taking steps beginning to keep personal identifiers from public view explained

staff for their involvement in the negotiations asked that in the vendor selection process had there been close competitors stated that after the shortlist and were very close continued that by the time of vendor presentations and second round of questions there clearly was a leader reference checks and due diligence results were positive for both vendors stated that has a longer government services record than most organizations and that it would not be unusual for them to be a top contender asked if any risks were uncovered during the negotiations stated that there are risks and that the intent in choosing is to move toward a single image for all enterprise the process that is going to use is highly automated which is also the main risk concern while that is a significant risk it also is a significant pay off to be able to complete the work with much less labor than with other vendors alternative vendors proposed a manual process with costs in line with what proposed however the internal labor costs were considerably higher the end result would be having all the computers standardized asked who carries the risk in the event the automated tool does not work to the extent it is believed to stated the risk would be that of the enterprises but the tool has a proven record asked for a worst case scenario price if the tool does not work optimally ms stated that the worse case scenario would include hours at an hour versus using the tool ms stated that representatives were present and very comfortable with the project wright stated has experience great success with the

or this amount in industry is not truly a project major meadows stated that he concerned very pleased with being willing to work with the agencies on some of these issues but requested consideration be taken to change the contract explained that the under the contract a per day cap existed as a guideline as long as an agency did not exceed per day there was no additional costs the direction at the time was to look at each project determine how much effort would be involved how much time would be involved and at what cost in the event there were over the determination needed was what kind of resources are required as the service manager to complete the installation if there were no additional costs to then no additional cost was passed to the customer the project could be approached as going to take weeks to get machines installed but if the agency needs the machines to be installed over the weekend additional resources will have to be brought in and overtime paid therefore there are additional costs associated with the install discussions have taken place with to establish time frames to have a no cost install and that mean the install takes three months which would go to the customer for acceptance major meadows stated that he is very supportive of charging fees should an agency request to have additional resources brought in due to various priorities ms stated that there is a section in the contract that states refresh is part of scope the only expense the we could pay is for actual hardware ms stated that this is something in the contract that and need to go back and review stated that the situation is similar to a fixed resource that has to be allocated to departments and wonders if its not so much the operation definition of an as it is deciding on a process that allocates the technical resource to the department asked if the board had enough clarity on the issue to vote on and stated that all that is being awarded at the board is defining the not changing the process or the reference to within the contract judge young moved to accept resolution seconded the motion major ball stated that the definition of is basically the same definition that
