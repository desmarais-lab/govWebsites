appointee the motion carried unanimously ms information services agency presented the information services agency report and stated that discussions had taken place resulting in the agreement to delay the production date of to since of calls have been received requesting changes be made to the system changes made to the system require recoding and retesting of four full time employees are required to focus on development personnel is the major reason for adjusting the along with providing ample time for testing ms continued with discussion on the ms migration four departments have completed migration including the mayors office crime lab staff staff and the juvenile facility issues have been documented and will be mitigated as the migration moves forwarded additional written scripts are necessary at this point ms stated that one individual will be assigned per machines with the goal of migrating machines per day has worked very hard on the asset inventory to meet the deadline that date will not be met for several reasons including added sites to the inventory including the township fire department and the wall to wall inventory is complete and the focus is on cleaning up data establishing standards and procedures assets were discovered with no asset tags the complete asset will be presented at the it board meeting on the state voter registration system project a new build went over the weekend and unusual application problems were experienced all issues have been called into the quest the automated vehicle locator project is moving forward questions pertaining to expectation and evaluation criteria were finalized and submitted back to the vendors evaluations will be taking place after the portable camera project specifications for servers have been received staff is waiting for a bill of materials and then an order be placed for equipment continues to focus on data center health an outside vendor be brought in to review and evaluate the condition of the data center has been looking at electrical issues and has put in blinds to help with temperature control and to provide physical protection a demonstration of the automated mapping engine will be provided to the finance and administration committee ms stated that met all service level requirements last month as did council appointee asked with the uncovering of new machines has there been a need for unexpected upgrades to bring equipment up to standard and has this caused some additional expenditure ms responded that there has been some discovery and will be looking at the migration and with next year county treasurer noted that last month the report indicated had missed four service level requirements and this month is on track asked what caused the missed service level requirements ms stated that had issues with and experienced a loss of employees at the same time conducting memory upgrades ms stated that overall did a tremendous job judge young county superior court took a moment to discuss the disappointment of delay the delay is not attributed to the clerks office or the courts took on additional responsibility without increasing the contract some of the initiatives that contributed to the delay include the case management system the merger which was not anticipated the addition of new judges and respective courts added by the state legislature the old justice system is cumbersome and each time a chance is made resources are tied up should be congratulated with the progress to date judge young addressed the migration and the trouble with learning curves the juvenile migration went okay the mayors office went pretty well although there is considerable size difference between the two on the transitioning judge young asked if the number is a manageable number where is able to move smoothly project manager stated that additional resources are needed and are being brought in the team is getting better with each migration but at the same time constantly finding new issues the environment is not homogenous the team is improving on diagnosing problems with each round judge young stated that the writing of scripts and using a console are ways to monitor progress and catch glitches early the question and asked if the team is comfortable with units a day or if that number could increase stated that the goal of a day is based on the number of mailbox accounts that be migrated in a day there be the ability to add machines to migrate mail an added challenge has been the change in methodology from wiping equipment clean to upgrading what is in place ms enders comment that her experience in the it world has been that any kind of migration is growing work at the start and improves as it progresses ms enders mayoral appointee stated that the migration seems to be going well considering the environment judge young stated that as a big advocate and voice for problems with and contract compliance they have done an excellent job with the asset inventory additional responsibility has been given without complaint and not hitting the target is not their fault judge young expressed his appreciation judge young continued with discussion on the project which locally is green however the state side red the situation is not something local agencies have control over local involvement has worked very hard has done everything requested and tested more than what should have judge young asked if the automated vehicle locator would be ready for snows in as it does not appear as if the application will be available in project manager stated the idea depends on the application being acceptable to the vehicle locator will be available for as many vehicles the department has budgeted for use this year and the same stands for in reference to the data center health issue judge young asked if the enterprise will be bringing in an independent agency to evaluate the status stated that a standard body for rating different tiers levels that has accreditation in that area can tell us how far off the enterprise is and provide an actionable guide the vendor will be able to explain progress made toward reaching tier then tier down the road discussion take place to move the data center for emergency recovery continued that there is concern being a second tier city with the potential of being cut off from the world all routes need to be confirmed but some part of the core activities would remain here with eventually some part moved off resolution authorize execution of contractual agreement for property tax management made a motion to approve resolution judge young seconded the motion county assessor discussed the property system process as long and very close to completion stated the need to continue to move forward with the contractual process an agreement with the vendors is probably complete the property system is something the enterprise desperately needs to meet the trending requirements for next year the system needs to be implemented as soon as possible the treasures office has concern not necessarily for this year but next user acceptance testing is for critical mass needs to be fully tested by of stated that there is a need to continue with this process and suggested giving final approval to ms who has played an integral part of this negotiation asked legal counsel for a written proposal stated that he wrote resolution commented that he did not disagree with but pointed out that the percent of meeting this request is pretty vast the team has been diligent in meeting our request now a way need to be determined to appease the city and county in the event the software does not live up to the standards some third party later would want to any time an entity makes a significant software purchase protection need to be ensured for the entity and the vendor needs to be willing to do so stated that we need to iron out some of those details before the contract can be signed resolution essentially provides ms authority to execute the contract upon review and approval of the office of corporation council stated that moving forward is extremely important to maintaining deadlines and he is comfortable with giving ms authority to close the deal the motion carried unanimously expressed compliments to for hitting all the service level requirements continued that he appreciates and acknowledges the efforts of ms for a good job leading the enterprise as well as deputy program manager additionally complimented staff on the migration upgrade some offices experienced internal problems however deputy director did a great job explaining how to migrate project manager presented the report the services available through continue to grow in demand with totals surpassing the previous performance record team continues to collaborate with to determine the scope of work required to rewrite applications which will interact to via web services many online services depend on a smooth execution of the project including access to court information traffic ticket payments and limited criminal history searches worked with to finalize the project charter and prototype created for the accident report service and also collaborated on the incident report service which is also being rewritten in order to connect to a new data source successfully completed an upgrade to ms access discussed the format changes and operations moving forward has spent the last nine years investing in resources to become self sustained ms stated that is comfortable in continuing operations as always and focus on city county initiatives ms stated will be looking at different initiatives to generate revenue increase efficiencies and add opportunities requested discussion for an agenda item in the future on city county services that could be added online asked a generic question regarding any interdependencies that are apparent for discussion responded that meetings and discussions have taken place with the work to facilitate the transition being quite large ms stated has been working with line by line and intends to remain involved the transition is much more significant than originally thought and requires assistance the additional time will allow for the inclusion of judge young asked if will be ready ms stated that they would stated that the advantage of pulling the work back in and is that the responsibility is relieved from and they will be able to get back to services ms management analysis presented the information services agency financial report ms stated that the report describes the financial position of in four areas expenditures for total million or of projected revenue this includes payments to and year to date has collected of projected revenue for which includes payments received for the th quarter billings ms enders asked for clarification on the second part of the report the bottom three items listed for miscellaneous revenue and enhanced access ms stated that the projected in the budget is for enhanced access but has not used as a result of an audit a refund was made to from oracle for over payment in stated that in looking at the percentages through there be under budget and asked if additional expenses were expected ms stated that open purchases orders are currently being researched and be reported on next month judge young recommended the million that has not been spent could be used to assist for ms stated that will be looked at as well as other initiatives judge young added is now diverting resources that were not anticipated and the additional funding could bring the project back on track judge young expressed concern with the public defender agency case management project which was approved at the it board meeting judge young observed progress has not been made ms responded that she has spoke with the public defenders office and requested involvement at the same time explaining that has tasks to perform on a deadline in order to succeed the public defenders office needs to be forthcoming with information in a timely manner the response provided was that the public defenders office would contact once the contract is signed judge young stated that there is no real control over the project but wanted to make sure that the perceived lack of communication mistrust between the agencies would not prohibit success of the migration update rick project manager and ms project manager presented the migration update project manager was available for questions stated the team got a late start on the pilot and changed the migration methodology as of today machines have been completed with email accounts migrated there are more email accounts to migrate than machines which is true throughout the enterprise migrations completed include the crime lab juvenile the mayors office and and the success rate has improved with each push done getting sufficient notification to users has proven to be effective as well as leaving time between pushing out and migrating overall there has been good success with the team continues to monitor the migration watching what is going on and providing clear instructions for the end user early instructions were discovered to be clear to the team but not to the end users stated that a champion is needed from each agency as the project team can not field people individually also scheduling needs to be kept all in one place and the need to be included in the passing of information added that there are potential bottlenecks using the servers within the environment as well as within the network migrations run smoother if they are staggered additional risks include scripts are not completed which causes more manual touches requiring more resources on site to the point it will not be sustainable during the mayors office migration staff was until am the team cannot do that daily for next months without burning out the process needs to be more automated judge young asked when the scripts would be done ms replied that is responsible for scripting and is defining them now depending on scope of final output once defined a will be added that the ability to do the counter script to find the problem immediately react to that and to keep that in the actual logic process flow or deployment be above and beyond the ability of the resources here to do the counter script keep that beyond what we have here is doing an excellent job determining what that resource is and getting it on site ms added that a number of those scripts are done stated that during the migration process in the mayors office it was confirmed that the enterprise cannot migrate large mailboxes a couple of mailboxes in excess of the limit were not identified and were challenging to migrate stated that the team reviews a list that is generated every week the oversight was human error ms added that the experience provided a great learning opportunity and solidified that the team would like to avoid the delay and make sure the mailboxes are below those sizes for a better success rate added the information available is not quantified with quality data stated that the road show team was flexible the scheduled time picked for the treasurers office was the worst time for the migration to happen the migration needs to happen in concert with auditors office and the team as flexible and willing to work with their schedule update project manager presented the update acknowledged judge support and stated that is frustrated even with the situation being outside of their control stated that the track record proves everyone has been working very hard a message was sent out last week regarding the moving of next weekend and the need to take down the not going live is not absolutely necessary but the superior court wanted to get a true test of the impact the outcry in user community was so significant that the decision was made the enterprise is not prepared challenged their team to bring up last night was demonstrated in production added that had a major role in having the production servers ready ahead of schedule continued that the expectations are being reset and he wanted to provide an understanding why to the user community the new date is st will be concentrating on building up the testing team discussed the human process the way it is entered into court system and asked if that is being looked at judge young stated that the court community went through a redesign of the entire system in the agency an outside vendor was brought in as facilitator to streamline and minimize duplications as well as reduce tasks judge young emphasized the benefit of that it is a seamless transition it is designed to morph itself according to the user continued to explain what will happen in the enhancement process will be requested changes to the applications will not be done until is in production users will see significant leaps in functionality after these future enhancements stated that is not a safe assumption there will not be changes in development with the ongoing evolution of the court system it seems to be inevitable with public pressure to conduct work and all related shaky assumption be before the it board again at some time to request redevelopment addressed discussion of work that need to be done for without looking completely at uses of those funds as important the migration project is would logically fall higher in the scheme of priorities if the board is going to talk about additional funds for stated that the board would want to know alternative uses of those funds added that the current when taken out of production changes will be made at that time but we are always bound to production first we must make changes to production because that that data is certified only in production the it board adjourned at am the next information technology board meeting is scheduled for at in room report the project is and on budget with no delays or budget issues anticipated the project is experiencing minor delays or minor cost overruns or the project has encountered problems which put it at risk of either going or missing deadlines hard deadlines can still be achieved but original goal dates be missed cost end up over original the project is experiencing significant delays potential cost overruns or critical failure hard deadlines be missed without the application of additional resources cost overruns exceed in excess of original budget immediate corrective action is this project has

working prototype with limited functionality report migration and development business initiatives demonstration of working prototype to stakeholders on th complete data compilation of phase i layers schedule demonstration for stakeholders enterprise improve customer service access improve operation efficiencies the team utilizes several to provide specific functionality to various applications within the enterprise the most prominent example of this is the applications are able to send an address string to the service and receive a validated and possibly corrected string back this ensures that the calling application stores a good address within its own database and alleviates the longterm problems associated with bad addresses the primary goals of this project are migrate existing to the platform and enhance them to work together more effectively create several new services that will be used by both the portal and future enterprise initiatives existing to be migrated new to be created continue prototyping of possible enhancements to existing finalize design and xml response structure of the data retrieval complete the migration plan completed the migration plan and

migration communications to pilot users revised text to communicate warnings to users via held meetings for agency points of contact for the migration as identified in the road show problems with pilot migrations need to be resolved to proceed with full pace of production migration the change in migration methodology means that all potential issues not be identified before we move into production migration continuing problems with migration methodology are requiring extensive manual intervention this requires a level of effort that is not sustainable for any of the partners working on the migration failure to resolve the issues or provide the manual support will result in an unacceptable level of down time for our customers the inability to resolve issues combined with poor data about our customers environment places the project team in continual crisis mode data regarding the customer environment must be gathered a minimum of one week in advance of scheduled migrations to ensure time to confirm readiness of machines and email accounts complete migration of court machines readjust schedule to account for missed migrations due to problems and to account for changes

migration batches must be completed two weeks in advance of migration date risk failure to gather the data needed for a successful migration without sufficient lead time leads to problems migrating machines and users time is required to check the health of machines and users and resolve problems prior to migration mitigation have been tasked with gathering needed data and provided access to additional resources to help in this task issue problems with server and jobs are slowing migrations risk problems with the server have required reboots and require rebuilding the server reboots cost time in the nightly routine and rebuilding the server cause the loss of one or two days production mitigation has been working with and to isolate the causes of the problems and all parties are working to resolve issues when identified issue mailbox size issues risk if email size limit policy is not enforced for each migrated mailbox it will cause failure for the migration of that user mitigation is working with customers to enforce the email size limit policy issue automated scripts not resource not on site risk this requires considerable manual intervention to complete and verify migrations the level of manual intervention required is not sustainable mitigation has been asked to provide appropriate resources to finish automating the processes issue additional machines that need to be migrated exist that have not yet been identified risk this could result in machines not being migrated when needed by their users mitigation working with our customers need to ensure that all desktops and laptops that are to be migrated are identified and accounted for in the project plan issue data center health risk this could lead to down time in the data center if it is not fixed
