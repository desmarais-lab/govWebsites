fees and fines and the distribution of funds to city and county the intent is to expand services as it makes sense to do so how it makes sense to do so will depend on the funding model offered another component in process and determining what funding model should result there are two ways to provide information over the internet one is for the agency to make information available with the assistance of the other is to address the difficulty in extracting reports or data and engage services with a company like agencies are able to provide information over the internet for the public

effort balances customer requests and enterprise development initiatives based primarily on resources and the influence of individual customers this does not support portfolio management at the enterprise level nor does it promote accountability and communication between and the departments it is difficult or impossible for to provide a view of the business and foundational projects or to

with several vendors to provide enterprise services the current agreements with and associates incorporated and local government online represent a significant portion of the service delivery and

improvements in customer service it strategic plan strategic goals goal statement financial timing the for all costs is currently allocated to each supported agency completely based on headcount technology costs can be allocated by headcount but others should be based on the benefit received by each customer customers do not understand their bills or the services value they receive simplifying the bills would allow to articulate the value while explain and justifying the cost model implement service level agreements draft draft update the model effort does not currently have documented agreements with customers to identify the services offered the service levels available or the relationship between services received and the cost of those services the current model creates confusion among customers build and utilize the fund balance to support enterprise initiatives fund balance is utilized during the year to pay for technology upgrades and other it needs the current balance is approximately but does not have a defined list of enterprise initiatives for which the fund balance will be used making it difficult to project the amount of fund balance needed for
