revised printer pricing addition of dell printers to standard the standards and policies subcommittee of the it team has reviewed the existing printer standard and solicited current information from leading printer providers to determine what revisions are necessary to our printer standard the process and results have been reviewed by the purchasing department accepted by the standards committee and approved by the it team we are now ready to implement the new standard proposed standard establish and dell printers as a dual standard for the enterprise establish cannon iv using big deal pricing as the primary source for printers establish dell as the source for dell printers and toner the net result of this revision is that the cost of printers will drop by an average of approximately five per cent across the entire product line the addition of dell as a standard will bring competition to the printer arena and significantly drive down costs for the enterprise see

will setup the database does the vendor provide any database recommendations from the application compatibility standpoint what is the volume of daily activity on the database what are the storage requirements for the database how many total users will be setup for the how many concurrent users will be involved will the database platform be oracle or ms server and what version how will user authentication be implemented will it be an application level authentication or database authentication does each user have their own individual login to the database or will they use a common who will support the security does the application have a user screen or does the security have to be setup on the database side what type of the database supports will it be a thin client or a thick
