the budget comparison of versus the second portion represents revenue collected the third section reflects versus contract comparison and the fourth section is application maintenance and support budget asked if the current trend is expected to continue on the ms stated that there are some enhancements processes in place minor things hours and that use some of the hours would be used for the database conversion stated that in the county sheriffs department online commissary deposit had neared completion with the project entering the testing phase a test plan was drafted for the division of compliance to ensure that the planned upgrade will not affect web permitting for the office in addition to the marketing materials the marketing team also delivered campaign concepts to animal care and control for the canine campaign the purchasing division now has the ability to include free county bids available for download from their website deployed the service for county bids in early the new service allows free bid proposals to be downloaded from the purchasing division ms discussed concern regarding the canine campaign which is a marketing strategy rather than enhanced access to data the initial discussion included the spending of a significant portion of the on a marketing campaign rather than enhancement of data ms asked what is being produced as far as billboards and marketing ms explained that the project ended up being very condensed approximately hours and really did not require stated that retention was presented to most of the standards committee for approval the originally policy was titled the acceptable use policy and provided guidelines for email the previous versions of the policy were constraining this version flips the intent around and offers what is wanted from the user asked that the document be considered as software this is version one stated that is asking the board to accept which deals with retention will be distributing a communication plan regarding retention stated that the superusers and those with over in their mailbox will be focused on first the individual or agency can decide what public record is three years is a minimum for retention the agency establish internal policy beyond the three year minimum major meadows asked if users with mailboxes over megabytes have been notified the information will be given to the agency heads and will then work with the agencies to determine how to best reduce the size of the mailboxes and then establish a deadline stated that a full backup of was performed this weekend and everything has been captured ms stated that recently a legal opinion was given by the state public access counselor about email retention in particular that it is not the agency that makes the decision on retention the county public records commission should be involved and meets once a quarter ms recommended having the public records make some decision working with legal counsel because it is a campaign year and these issues are not individual agencies to make other than court records which come through the state court administrator stated that the version format is designed for revision stated that part of the thought process what is a public record requires more education than currently exists and suggested including those type of definitions requested assistance continued that more and more personal email is used as a devise to communicate since it is easier to send an email rather than placing a call and would need to be addressed at an appropriate venue pointed out that under behaviors email was not implemented for personal use but be tolerated per agency or department office guidelines major ball stated that he appreciates the way the policy is being handled but the policy needs to be with training most users reading the behavior section of the policy are not going to understand what that means in order to make policy stick it needs to be with training ms added that the initiatives would be in line with hr policies asked if any attention has been given to redundant storage and establishing a process with the migration before messaging goes out asked if there were a policy prohibiting users from taking home portable storage data or if there were guidelines implemented on an agency level stated that the specific concern is security issues and making sure the user base is knowledgeable judge young move to adopt retention the motion was second by major ball and called for discussion major ball asked if retention has been accepted by the standards and policies committee he continued that he did not want to slow down the process but had quite a few questions including how everybody will achieve megabytes or less how to involve the public records commission and how public records policies could effects retention replied that those issues will be addressed regardless and once storage the enterprise will move forward major meadows asked if legal counsel has looked at the entire policy major meadows was concerned with the use of shall will and asked that if the board approves the retention part of the document are they not in essence approving the entire document ms stated that the guidelines from were still applicable and that will make sure the standards committee and legal counsel are informed before moving ms stated that she would be supportive of accepting retention given a snap shot was taken ms continued that she is uncomfortable with agencies and departments making decisions because she is not certain that is legal ms recommended exploring options with the public records commission ms stated that something needs to be in place in order to move forward with the migration judge young stated that education becomes critical when a document is received that is a determined by your agency to be a public record the document should immediately be moved to a public server to facilitate an individual coming to the

accountable ms stated that the length of time is dictated by the commission and each agency should be communicating with their legal representative judge young withdrew his motion and moved to approve retention subject to review by corporation counsel and the public records committee the motion was seconded and carried major ball added that he supports passing the retention but commented that this was the first stab at an enterprise policy which is an important function of this board major ball requested more time be provided to the board to review and integrate policy migration presented an update on the migration project additional interviews have been conducted as well as interviews with some of the agencies the first phase of the project has been completed including envisioning and discovery so that the requirements are understood a design workshop was held with the technical staff from and to discuss how the migration would take place and what the future state of the enterprise needs to be a determination needs to be made on what package applications to be deployed to user desktops and what information will be put on laptops and desktops there will be issues and risks including procuring and installing the hardware within the compressed needs to ensure sufficient resources are on hand and to make use of servers so what is needed is in place discussed the challenge of migrating excessively large mailboxes and email appropriately another challenge will be to integrate and determine how to best define needed applications the contract with included packaging application once was deployed applications identified exceed the number of current applications in the enterprise is in the thousands with the majority being on or desktops the next step will be to determine how many applications warrant automatic deployment versus manual deployment major meadows stated the importance of including and making sure information is pushed out to the vehicles and communication continues uninterrupted major meadows asked if the end result would be enhanced capability ms discussed that there are two options regarding packaging applications can request the vendor package more applications with a cost association or once the applications are identified that are to be packed they can be deployed through wise asked if the types of applications are specific to a department such as the grant management tool and possibly not synchronized or compatible with responded that in some cases they are widely distributed once a determination can be made that is reporting accurately and users are using applications as intended a solution be identified stated that devices have been identified and managed through commented that of the users within the enterprise have specialty software on their computers ms stated that some applications identified are a result of free installation needs to make sure required licenses are purchased with justified applications recommended as the enterprise moves forward with the current a inventory of applications a residing methodology needs to be incorporated to keep track and control new purchases to the system ms stated that the use of as a management tool will assist in deployment and tracking ms discussed the completion of the remaining hardware and software purchases for the lab has started to package some of the applications that have been identified such as adobe work is continuing on the base image proof of the concept lab and finalizing the email policy as discussed plans for include delivering the signed documents for the active directory and exchange as well as the desktop and design document once the design document is final will be moving into the next phase of actually building the lab environment asked if consideration has been taken in standardizing the applications as policy the current number of applications in the enterprise seems remarkably high ms stated that this type of decision will be part of the role of the standards and policies committee eden stated that will allow for establishing a base line for applications and identify older versions judge young stated for clarification will allow a user to come up to standard but will not allow download and upgrade the way the enterprise is set up does not allow the user to upgrade the machine independently data base conversion update stated the scope is to assist in upgrading retiring or converting to net all identified access databases application front ends users in the infrastructure and to establish an enterprise wide source control library using visual studio team foundation server is technically on the project on an as needed basis will be used as well as questionnaire responses stated that any application that is important enough to talk about is important enough to keep databases that have not been used in a couple years will most likely be retired the communication plan will assist in finding out what is in the environment and allow users to upgrade themselves through an upgrade class currently there are far too many applications in the enterprise for one entity to test staff will help with specific problems access database applications will be checked in for future reference with documentation of the reasons why it was retired the scope will include verifying accuracy before and after versions of the access database applications are checked into the source control library one to redevelopment assistance for all line of business access based applications that will be converted to net with approval phase one involves submitting the statement of work to for approval has been assigned as the pm on the project discussed assistance by using access conversion tool to narrow down the actual size to more a more manageable amount stated that has access to a survey tool that has already met with and created the questionnaire to be submitted by the th of supports those applications that have been complied for conversion or upgrade ms continuing to work on the upgrades from problems left over from the spring thank involved in election day from a technical prospective it went very well demonstration and updated the board on the work station management as well as reporting applications and real time data analysis for software hardware the product comes with the ability to create custom reports patch management will be available not only the work stations but the applications themselves report access is based on security roles and integrated with active directory there is more flexibility that has not been available previously the software portal gives the user the ability to pull down applications on their own there will be a process based on security that allows for more versatility how many physical sites are there stated that sites each floor in this building is a site remote sites are this tool minimizes the need for action technical person drives to an outside location remotely image could use this to determine training needs if new identify new equipment new applications go up in some environment stated if you matched the functionality of with a sound business process yes thank all the effort he put forward getting moving in our environment if he had not been here helping us do not believe we would not be where we are today with this appreciate this level of technical learning better handle on project information and more about the tools emerging ms stated that a stoneware demonstration is planned for the next it board meeting and as far as the structure headed the right direction the it board meeting adjourned the next it board meeting will be it board members present major meadows judge young staff present bob white randy visitors and bill john whistler beth smith bakers the it board meeting was called to order at stated that the purpose of the meeting is to present an update on contractual issues expressed appreciation for everyones attendance and apologized for the last minute cancellation last week contractual issues ms stated that meetings have been held with corporate and that they are

that for anyone watching at the next meeting when the board actually discusses the proposal there will be much more comment and that the lack of comment today is not due to lack of thought and energy put into the situation stated that was a very valid point the it board meeting adjourned at the next it board meeting is scheduled for the project is and on budget with no delays or budget issues anticipated the project is experiencing minor delays or minor cost overruns or the project has encountered problems which put it at risk of either going or missing deadlines hard deadlines can still be achieved but original goal dates be missed cost end the project is experiencing significant delays cost overruns hard deadlines be missed without the application of additional resources cost

review contract working together with to provide clear direction enabling future enhancements plans to merge and in office mitigation process has been determined unnecessary due to the redefined required related fields and are working on required fields for peripheral assets sample reports have been reviewed and we have found that much of the required workstation data is being captured automatically additional data fields will be added as active directory is implemented during the migration to capture further information regarding customer name location department etc for and for have had several conference calls for the mitigation process the stopped this process on but progress has been made incomplete inventory and inaccuracy will cause improper estimates for software license counts supported migrated etc review inventory report is expecting the inventory report to be delivered on we will review and determine if an audit is required enterprise rick complete planning and design phase of project begin lab validation and process development phase of project begin packaging applications for deployment begin building test images for desktops proof of concept lab up and running as of applications have been packaged application configuration forms completed unit testing executed for packaged applications desktop design document delivered which explains how workstations will be migrated single image built and being tested in the lab testing the deployment tool in the lab environment final design for active directory exchange completed messaging components legacy systems installed in the lab for testing exchange components installed in lab and are being tested distributed archive instructions to departments and agencies on how to archive their email files email archiving in process the completion date for the ms migration project is slipping from to this slippage is being caused by delays in the procurement and installation of some key equipment availability of resources to complete some key tasks time lost due to data center health issues and anticipated future data center health issues and a of the number of laptops and desktops that can be migrated on a daily basis availability of resources for completing and subsequent packaging of applications is causing a delay in the completion of the packaging of applications needed for automated deployment of those applications this has the potential to affect the overall project schedule additional resources are being brought in and the schedule is being finessed to minimize the delay there are ongoing issues with the health of the data center electrical heat issues this could lead to down time in the data center if it is not fixed working with to control the temperature in the data center and fix the electrical issues there is additional hardware that is required for the migration that needs to be installed before delays in receipt of this equipment will mean phase iv production build test will be delayed the hardware has been ordered are monitoring the order weekly and will escalate with the vendor if necessary mac enhancements and web portal project need to complete application testing with applications that are not tested with not work in that operating environment and thus need to be rewritten or this lead to delays in the migration schedule or reshuffling of the migration schedule in order to mitigate this risk testing the applications that have not already been tested in a lab environment must be completed prior to the migration appropriate provisions then need to be made for any applications that do not work correctly under add additional resources and continue completing and packaging applications until all identified applications have been packaged mac rick continue designing flow of web portal the project team met several times to review portal design performance issues related to running the test instance on a virtual server still need to be resolved these performance issues be helped by synchronizing the development and test environments with the production environment however the ultimate resolution will probably require moving the test environment to a different server identify and resolve business process and application data flow issues complete portal design data center help vendor finalize the project plan and create the statement of work needed for the project negotiate details of the contract with the vendor discussed concerns about rd draft of project plan with vendor status is yellow because further delay in receiving an acceptable project plan will cause the contract approval process to run behind and could impact overall project time line the rd draft of the project plan is a very good task list tasks but it cannot yet be considered a completed project plan true up the dates add the durations and dependencies and as needed they will then submit the plan for evaluation the vendor must be prepared to present the updated and preliminarily approved project plan to the property steering committee and at the meeting for full approval next steps include evaluation and approval of the th draft of the project plan approving milestones finalizing the contract putting together the required funding and obtaining the approvals from the various boards committees and the council as needed operations met with building authority regarding what options we have for cooling the th floor they indicated that the data center should be cool all the time and they lowered the temperature down to degrees on two chillers electrical upgrades are in process for servers already delivered for and other applications electrical upgrades necessary for the migration production environment are still in the quoting process building authority feels they will not have staff to get electrical work done in time to meet our schedule we have a rd party do the installation to keep on schedule on the data center experienced air handler temperature alarms when the temperature reached up to degrees due to the excessive heat one of the server racks blew the circuit breaker taking down until the breaker was reset came back up in under minutes but the and internet proxy all took longer to restore service root cause analysis was performed and it was determined that maintenance was being performed on the backup chiller when the main chiller failed continue work on electrical space planning and cooling issues the automated mapping engine will allow staff to create a high cartographic quality map without the need for desktop software to be installed the application has been designed with a nontechnical user in mind and will simplify the process of creating maps this application will be available to users on the only staff will be able to select from a set of predefined datasets to be mapped on top of a base set of map layers the user will be able to further refine the data to be displayed by specifying an attribute filter to be applied a geographic region such as a township council district or neighborhood organization boundary and a date range the user will be able to specify the size and orientation for the map the application will then create a pdf format file of the map in question and deliver it to the user the is being developed and deployed in phases functionality included in phase i is described above phase ii will add the following the ability to save map definitions for repeated use the ability to subscribe to receive a map based upon a saved definition on a regular basis via email this map would contain current data such as all citizen calls to the mac within the past reporting capabilities so that a tabular report could be included in your map subscription expand user group gather feedback complete initial phase ii testing deployed phase i to additional users and gathered feedback demonstrated phase i to the it team and provided the application link for their use identified phase ii issues during testing and began working on resolutions based upon user feedback created a document to address some common questions complete resolution of phase ii issues and begin testing communicate with users to help them take advantage of phase i capabilities mayors project initiation this project will involve the creation of a new public internet application entitled is envisioned to become a single source of information related to a citizens surroundings preliminary plans are to consider the following types of items for inclusion elected officials trash collection day zoning flood zone and land use information crime statistics school choices including charters libraries police fire facilities post offices neighborhood associations etc in addition to listing each of these items for a given address and providing more detailed information about each subject later phases of also include the ability to provide citizens with directions from their address to the location of interest the team will be creating this application using a portal approach that will allow us to utilize a common framework to which we can easily add additional functionality piece by piece without redeploying the entire initial projections are to have the first phase of this project available late this kickoff meeting with project sponsors hosted a kickoff meeting with project sponsors to establish project scope and schedule assembled the project team and began creation of interface established the technical architecture that will be employed for this update stakeholders on th present schedule interface data requirements and architecture vision perform tests to validate the validity of some new technical approaches grant funding update security web filter install production web filtering tool and start additional testing with production equipment before vendor engineer completed installation of web
