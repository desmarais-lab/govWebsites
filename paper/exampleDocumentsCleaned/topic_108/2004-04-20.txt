county departments and agencies a was created and entered into a contract with to provide services to the city and county this contact is on an hourly rate with a not to exceed basis though there have been minor growing pains this contract has led to a successful partnership with to deliver services to our customers as a result the division seeks to exercise one of the two contract extensions the division is seeking the contract extension at this time for two reasons to ensure continuity in the provision of services to city and county agencies and to minimize interference with the impact of the larger process of selecting it providers through the sourcing process continued with background information accomplishments plans problems encountered and goals achieved asked why uses an outside contract in response offered that does not currently have application services provided for in the judge asked if the board would be revisiting this contract with whoever the new vendor is through the as a contract or as a whole it was established that this would be revisited once the process has been completed for clarification offered that has been managed separately for a number of years and has a mechanism in place that allows for contractual flexibility with outside firms provides specialized applications development for services when originally wrote the contract it was written for the application services to commensurate with the contract however with the success of operations have been running well wants to keep the relationship with and retain the ability to hire as they deem necessary they prefer not to roll the application services into the the contract with is not an exclusive contract it is written for not to exceed million dollars and specifically geared for related

by legal belch commented that from a legal perspective it was fine major ball moved to approve a contract extension for the calendar seconded the motion motion passed unanimously rickets continued with agenda items stating he would like the it board to review the presentation not everyone was in the room as he had hoped but he chose to take a few minutes at the chairmans pleasure to review what he thought happened the day of the previous board meeting of th he stated he made a very late cancellation of the meeting in light of events that took place the day before in the legislature the auditor was not in town so it was his decision as chairman at that point to cancel the meeting he expressed his regrets to those vendors that were present he felt it was more important the board ensure the funding of the process it was his belief there was a breakdown in the line of communication and the meeting was but not at the request of the chairman an apology was offered to those who waited for any length of time until enough board members were present to constitute a quorum the purpose of the current meeting is for a full board to ratify the activities of th recommended the presentation be made for everyones benefit also stated he would like to vote on the it board chairman position and asked it be put on the agenda for the meeting he would appreciate being considered for chairman and if selected he will work with legal to see the relationship between the members of the board and the duties and responsibilities of the chair are defined if there needs to be a mechanism to override the chairman with a quorum it needs to be clearly defined with the process the it board needs to define all duties in a clear manner he concluded and asked for comments judge agenda called for approval of the minutes for th he asked about the minutes for the th of ms replied that the minutes for the it board meeting of th had not been transcribed completely judge inquired if the board will eventually be asked to vote on those minutes as chairman commented the board would need to discuss the issue and decide if they want to vote on the minutes he noted he would not as an individual vote to approve them because he does not feel the meeting took place judge expressed he would not vote in favor of the minutes he thought the meeting was important enough to necessitate that all board members be present believed this situation demonstrates a need for clearer definition of the boards relationship the recommendation was made that future confirmation of attendance be done verbally ms enders was in attendance at the th meeting and she indicated intent is to serve as needed on the it board her support is for county and the judge inquired about the chair selection process in response belch commented the ordinance provides the chairperson and secretary shall be approved by the board and serve until someone else is selected the term is not spelled out in the ordinance but he believed the procedure is to serve until there is a vote to change that it was clarified is the board secretary made the recommendation that the board vote again to ratify the and the boards intention to support the thanked everyone who assisted in preparing the for the hard work and the time committed to ensuring its success he introduced the document discussed its components and outlined the schedule of key dates added that wants to be flexible in its approach this process allows for more flexibility in developing projects it allows the flexibility to go out and make changes it encourages the use of local talent as well as increases the diversity of our service provider this process will allow the vendors to bid on particular pieces of the contract and not necessarily the entire contract turned the presentation over to to continue discussion about scope discussed the areas covered in the scope along with a brief overview of what the goals are for each statement of work at the conclusion of the presentation asked if there were a legal reason a member of the it board was not on the evaluation team explained there is a reason for board members not being included in the evaluation team the board ultimately votes on the selection and the determination of who the vendor is the evaluation team provides recommendation to the board he noted the is not on the evaluation team speaking from the perspective of a township assessor requested that consideration be given for someone to represent the property system on the evaluation expressed his willingness to consider suggestion as well as any other suggestions regarding other areas not covered particularly well pointed out the reason meadows was included in the evaluation team was to cover a large county law enforcement agency noted he felt the recommended evaluation team consisted of too many members he preferred to see a smaller group to be able to stay focused ultimately the make up of the evaluation team members is the boards decision added the members given are only a recommendation judge asked if the evaluation team meetings would be open to the public and was given an answer the meetings would be closed door sessions requested the minutes from the be reviewed for protocol on the number of board members that could be present at a function and not constitute an official meeting ms said she sure the open door clause applies since we are in an evaluation period the information is subject to confidentiality but it matter if the board appoints the evaluation team members or not it was an issue when the board was putting the together she did not agree that a board member should not be a member of the evaluation team if a board member wants to get more in depth information she felt that would be doing the board a greater service however she did note that time is an issue for herself she added that if the chairman wanted to serve she saw no problem with that responded he was not volunteering himself and asked if the recommendation would be a single recommendation two three or four proposer ms asked if the board would actually see the scoring for clarification asked if the board members want to sit in on the evaluation process they as long as there are not more than four members at any one time in attendance the board will be abiding by the no quorum rule the evaluation team meeting will be much like the presentations according to they will not necessarily invite the board members to attend but certainly make that an option ms added that all individuals attending the meetings need to sign confidentiality statements belch stated such a document is being prepared by legal for the evaluation members and the board members commented that when the evaluation team is finished and ready to make a recommendation to the board he did not think they want to fully disclose the scoring if they are going to go back and make a best and final offer stated the scoring would not be disclosed to the public but it would be disclosed to the selection committee in an executive session and a nondisclosure statement would be signed continued that he would appreciate having the board members as involved with the process as possible however being on the selection committee will require a significant investment of time particularly in the month of it be very difficult for the board members to include the evaluation sessions on their schedules judge expressed concern for board members ability to offer input in the evaluation process when they had not attended all the meetings commented and should bring the board their recommendations he then asked if the budget is outside the budget replied the budget is within the budget asked if the schedule outlined allows for flexibility particularly changing the date of the board meeting he also requested that the recommended changes in the structure be brought to the board as soon as possible ms took the opportunity to commend the team and she thought the was terrific and staff did a great job she expressed her desire to move forward to the next step she acknowledged the challenges in realigning the structure of and managing the upcoming contract echoed ms comments and continued with discussion on the amount of information involved and how at times things seemed to be going the wrong direction he thought everyone involved had done very well and he looks forward to continuing to serve on the board judge noted he has had discussions with both and and expressed a concern at doing three things of this magnitude at one time the for the it restructuring and searching for an it director are all monumental undertakings he was concerned with the time required on the part of the board all three are significant undertakings that will require a great deal of oversight he has reservations about how successful these efforts will be he believed with current leadership and the boards involvement it can be done but it will be very difficult mentioned prior to making a motion he had heard comments that there were amendments to last weeks it was his understanding that the amendments were technical in nature clarified that when the ms word document was converted to pdf an error occurred the instant realized there was a problem it was resolved a fresh version of the was uploaded to the website an addendum
