highlights include an overview of the results from the customer opinion survey sent out last month a total of responses were received this included staff with budget management authority and staff spoke of past plans to providing training the training program was initially dropped because the low number of employees signed up or attending the classes did not validate continuing requested future training initiatives be coordinated with the existing city human resources training program meadows pointed out much of the training provided through city human resources currently is not available to county employees asked if training is currently or could be provided through a stay at your desk broadcast clarified that the type of training needs to be identified first will be hosting a technology forum on and st the state conference was held this past and th shared that many employees presented at the conference and attendees were able to see technology in use that had only been discussed in years prior ms presented the financial report with information compiled from in the database requested some changes in the format of the report it team charter the it board members reviewed the it team charter and the current it team members the following agencies departments are represented the townships assessors office controllers office discussed changing the governance process of the it team function he would like to have the current charter simplified and see the team function as a technical advisory board major meadows expressed interest in why a representative from was on the committee considering is not in scope responded that his priority is to look at projects and having input would be vital for success should come in scope ms emphasized final action remains with the it board the it team recommendations are valuable however the policy and financial decisions rest with the it board after discussion the it board recommended the following be represented on the it county auditors office county treasurers office county assessors office township assessors offices by one member prosecutors office county courts the city controllers office dept of public safety the recommendation was made to include language in the ordinance that the it teams emphasis be the coordination of projects the board has set the board briefly discussed a project the has been considering it was requested further consideration of that project be for an document imaging system this would spread out the financial responsibility and result in cost savings for both the city and county was asked to assist on this search update meadows provided the total number of applications received through evaluating the qualifications of the applicants that number has been reduced to no date certain is available at this time for a successful candidate to be announced status presented the status the current system is or years old and there has been a strict moratorium on changes while the county has been waiting for the statewide system the risk of either an application failure or mainframe crash increases with age now it is estimated that is scheduled to reach county in months that time frame is a scenario the system must continue to be up and running until the new system is available a possible solution would be to change from a mainframe based system to a net platform this would not require additional dollars to the existing contract explained the group has been very involved working with and in evaluating the proposed solution ms stated a risk assessment has been requested which will be available in approximately two weeks the governing structure has been revamped to now include an executive committee a governing board and county input county is taking a very active role to see that this project succeeds property system update ms commented representatives have met with the development is moving forward this is an effort representatives from the county treasurers office and the county auditors office have all been involved spoke on behalf of the mayors action center and on the importance of the new property system to the departments at the conclusion of comments suggested tabling the award of the strategic planning request for service contract until the property system is further along comments were requested from the vendor the point person on the property system project was not available they will be advised of the boards wishes for the next regular it board meeting and be available for discussion a motion was made to table resolution to award strategic planning request for service the motion was seconded and passed unanimously the next scheduled it board meeting will be the meeting adjourned at development and test infrastructure upgrade projects tom upgrade executive overview currently the is projected to be at least three to five years away due to project delays it has now become necessary for county to take steps to ensure will remain viable in due to the project was put into an emergency update only mode has been maintained in that mode for years now due to the above freeze new requirements and mandates been fully implemented into the core functionality forcing manual workarounds at the same time the technology was developed in is now approaching years old upgrade partial list of users upgrade ultimate project

agency wiring standard this standard defines a telecommunications wiring system for city of county agencies offices or buildings that will support a environment the purpose of this standard is to enable planning and installation of building wiring regardless of the telecommunications products be it voice data which subsequently will be installed note this standard has been adapted from the standard this document will periodically be reviewed and updated at this time all new facilities shall be wired with cabling and termination equipment all facilities with existing cat cabling must continue to utilize cat cabling for all additional adds moves or changes unless a complete remodel of the facility is requested proper adherence to these guidelines will reduce longterm building operation costs by providing a better infrastructure that is adaptable to change telecommunications wiring defined by this standard is intended to have a useful life in excess of ten years wiring standard specifications horizontal wiring the horizontal wiring is the portion of the telecommunications wiring systems that extends from the area outlet to the telecommunications closet this includes the termination at the outlet as well as the termination and cross connects at the closet the term horizontal is used because typically the wire in this part of the wiring system runs horizontally along the floors or ceilings of a building the horizontal wiring shall be a star topology meaning each work area outlet must be directly connected to a telecommunications closet the maximum horizontal distance shall not exceed from the outlet to the closet as shown in figure an allowance of approximately was made for the patch cables in the wire closet and outlet end because the total length from the equipment in the telecommunications closet and the device on the end cannot exceed total a minimum of two telecommunications outlets shall be provided for each individual work area a separate pair ohm unshielded cat cable shall support each outlet each of these outlets be used for either voice data since both outlet ports are using the same type of cables its just a simple matter of in the telecommunications closet to either the voice switch or data switch wiring standard telecommunications closet work area horizontal wiring pair cat cables figure typical horizontal and work area wiring wiring standard installation category wiring requires special installation practices pair twisting for instance is one of the critical physical characteristics of the cable that affects cross talk performance as a result the standard requires that the pair twist be maintained to within inch of the termination point on each end of the cable this requirement is imposed to minimize untwisting of wire pairs and the separation of conductors within a pair our standards call for special termination practices when terminating cable to ensure speeds of up to per second to allow users to get the most out of their local area network when placing cables adhere to the following guidelines use a minimum bend radius of ten times the cable diameter equivalent to placing data wire around a conduit follow building and fire codes on all penetrations made during routing of cable through firewalls firewalls must be sealed with fire stop materials this stops the flow of smoke flames toxic fumes and etc avoid routing cables near electromagnetic interference noise sources such as motors transformers and power lines hangers are necessary to support the cable a minimum of inches above fluorescent fixtures and other sources of interference which can induce noise on the cable cables in the termination closet must be dressed using cables ties and cable management and terminated in a category patch panel use the same cable throughout do not mix cabling from different manufacturers avoid excessive coiling of cables this can lead to degradation of its performance a service loop of approximately must be provided in the termination closet and included in the overall length of the cable run cable ties should be applied with just enough tension to hold the cables in place but not tightly enough to squeeze the cables also space the ties randomly cables must be supported at a maximum of feet intervals and cannot be attached to electrical conduit heating or plumbing hardware or ceiling grid wires wiring standard work area outlet location the work area components extend from the telecommunications outlet end of the horizontal wiring system to the station equipment the station equipment can be any of a number of devices including telephones fax machines and personal computers work area wiring vary in form depending on the application a cord with identical connectors on both ends often is used our standard calls for a cord when the application is a data device when adaptations are needed they shall be external to the telecommunications outlet each pair cable shall be terminated in an modular jack as shown in the example below wiring standard pair pair pair pair jack positions figure jack assignments designation wiring standard telecommunications closet a telecommunications closet is an area within a building set aside for the exclusive purpose of housing equipment associated with the telecommunications wiring system every building shall contain at least one telecommunications closet or equipment room there is no upper limit on the number of telecommunications closets which be provided within the building the telecommunications closet shall contain the mechanical terminations for a portion of the horizontal wiring system and a portion for the backbone wiring system in this usage the telecommunications closet shall provide facilities space power grounding etc for the passive or active devices or both used to interconnect the two all termination of station wiring at the telecommunications closet shall be terminated on category compliant equipment with red designation labels backbone riser or tie cables shall also be terminated on category compliant equipment using green designation labels the termination equipment must be placed at normal working height and be at least feet from powered transformers and power panels wiring standard labeling each telecommunications outlet shall have a label placed on the faceplate or cover of the jack this label is to identify the outlet for record keeping as well as for maps or floor plans and identification during troubleshooting labeling will be structured as a identifier utilizing the following format the building number in the first position the floor designation in the second position and the patch panel port in the third position building panel port example city county th panel a port building identification the four position street number in the address will be used to identify the building in which an agency resides this will be used in the first position of the cable identifier th street will be identified as example floor panel port the exception to this convention is the city county building will be used as a building number example panel port floor designation in any given building there is a floor designation if the building were a building the floor designation would be in the case of the there are towers in the building with many floors in each tower there is a central tower which is referred to as tower there is an east tower police wing and the west tower courts to take this even further the central tower has electrical closets that act as horizontal distribution points for each floor these are referred to in terms of east and west as well if a user is on the th floor of the central tower and horizontal distribution comes from the west electrical closet the floor designation would be another example could be a user on the th floor of the police wing the floor designation would be example panel port patch panel port the third position will be the patch panel port designation identifier in every wiring closet all cables shall be terminated on a category patch panel with a minimum of ports per patch panel each patch panel will have an alpha designation the first patch panel will be labeled a the second and so on on patch panel a there will wiring standard be ports through therefore the patch panel port would be a through a the second patch panel would be through and so on example the label shall also be affixed to the front panel of each patch panel affixing cable tags all cables will have the complete cable tag identifier affixed to the cable behind the wall at the faceplate location this tag should be placed on the cable in a permanent manner within of the termination point on the back of the faceplate at the closet location where the cable is terminated on the patch panel each cable shall be labeled with the patch panel port number this tag should be placed on the cable in a permanent manner within of the termination point on the back of the patch panel faceplate labels all faceplate will be clearly labeled with the entire cable number each faceplate shall be labeled at the top of the faceplate in a permanent manner see exhibit wiring standard exhibit testing is critical if the installation has now been completed and all the recommended practices were followed how do you know the cabling is up to the category standard several test equipment manufacturers have recently introduced megahertz cable tester units that will help answer this question each new cable that is placed shall be tested and certified for and standards these standards require the following transmission speed next near end cross talk shorts opens wiring standard backbone wiring the function of the backbone wiring is to provide interconnection between telecommunications closets equipment rooms and entrance facilities in the telecommunications wiring system structure typically cable fiber optics media are used as backbone cables the backbone wiring shall use the conventional hierarchical star topology where in each telecommunications closet is wired to a main or an intermediate then to a main backbone wiring defined by this standard is applicable to a range of different user requirements depending upon the characteristics of the individual application choices with respect to transmission media have to be made in making this choice factors to be considered include flexibility with respect to supported services required useful life of backbone wiring site size and user population to determine the size of the backbone cable you need to estimate the number of users that could be assigned to work out of this particular closet you then double that figure and round up to the nearest example if phones faxes or modems are utilized double it to and round up to the nearest hundred so in this case a hundred pair cable should be sufficient wiring standard fiber optic technology fiber optic technology is now economically feasible and strategically beneficial for use in systems other than telephone trunking applications optical fiber in campus and premises communications system is becoming commonplace because optical fiber systems can handle very high data rates over long distances in campus environments optical fiber is mainly used between buildings for voice video data trunking in premises environments optical fiber is mainly used for backbone applications data security video systems wiring standard optical fiber standards several fiber components are emerging as our standard for premises application building and campuses of distances less than miles our standard components are um optical fiber connectors patch panels for premises application building and campuses of distances greater than miles our standard components are single mode compatible optical fiber connectors patch panels for present and future premises requirements fibers offer the best combination of available attenuation bandwidth light coupling power fibers are frequently referred by the core and cladding diameter in um for example a fiber with a core of micrometers and a cladding diameter of micrometers is typically designated um fiber wiring standard fiber count fiber count is the number of fibers used in the cable plant the fiber count selected for a communications network impacts both the current and future capabilities of the in addition to present and future communications requirements a design must address redundancy system administration and maintenance the decision regarding the number of optical fibers to install is largely dependent upon intended end user applications both present and future level of multiplexing use of physical topology of the network our standard calls for a minimum of fibers to each building telecommunications closet todays data communications systems generally employ two or four fibers between nodes to meet transmission requirements the primary applications that require two fibers are channel extension multiplexing the primary application that require four fibers is ring architectures wiring standard fiber count continued the most significant factor influencing the choice of fiber count for a data application is the level of electronics that will be used to combine like dislike networks onto a common backbone to what extent if any will bridges routers or concentrators be used in the network users often conclude that the most cost effective and manageable networks are those that require more fibers but fewer sophisticated costly bridges and routers the illustrations on the next two pages depict two different though equally acceptable solutions when choosing a fiber count consider the cost of additional fibers versus the cost of sophisticated desirability of keeping networks separated versus the advantages of combining networks for security performance and reliability wiring standard standard electronics option a

adopt wiring standards for the city of county whereas the standards and policy committee conducted discussion evaluation and review of current wiring operations and determined that standardization is necessary to increase efficiencies and whereas the adoption of a standard and uniform approach to the planning and installation of wiring for voice and data will improve efficient operations and maximize flexibility and service and whereas implementing and following these standards will ensure the wiring infrastructure will allow for the highest degree of stability in the selection and implementation of existing applications and future innovations now therefore be it resolved the information technology board authorizes the chief information officer to establish uniform standards for wiring for all existing and any future facilities operated by city of departments and county agencies and courts resolution to approve disbursal of enhanced access funds whereas a calculation error related to property taxes requires programming changes in the property system and whereas the corrective action will require the commitment of programming hours to complete at a cost not to exceed and whereas discussion by the enhanced access review committee determined the best means of offsetting these costs was a disbursement of funds from the enhanced access fund and this recommendation was unanimously approved now therefore be it resolved the information technology board authorizes the county treasurer to disburse an amount not to exceed from the enhanced access fund to cover costs associated with the issuance of corrected property tax bills report to the it board the operations division dedicated significant resources to activities related to the planned new asset management tool for the environment there are also numerous department moves in the planning stages to include several parks locations and two courts the project management office is helping to coordinate the efforts of voter registration election board county clerks office and other divisions in the conversion to the state voter registration system major milestones include technical infrastructure deployment user training training practice period conversion data conversion signature clipping of voter registration signatures and implementation readiness and support county is scheduled for implementation by rd of this year the major focus area for and early was budget meetings two and fluke resigned from to take new jobs in the private sector the remaining staff supplemented by the training communication staff are being deployed to cover the budget meetings and to make every effort to meet other customer needs the original organizational plan called for a total of six began the year with four staff with plans to hire two more two new staff and will begin work in the two of them will be taking over flukes clients please see the executive summary of the customer opinion survey included in a separate section following the report those who wish to see a full analysis of the data can contact bob for details the application development team made significant progress in the web content management system implementation working with our customers they launched new and improved websites for the following departments and agencies clerks office coroners office department of administration public defender bond bank township assessors council department of waterworks also the team is continuing to work with on the development of online supervisory special forms to automate the existing paper process they are currently in the requirement gathering phase through the month of continued to refine the help desk tool set the knowledge management system and the lex asset management system to make them compatible to the environment several enhancements were added for ticket queues service level requirement monitoring and reporting in addition technical expertise were to develop and test required modifications while this expertise also conducted some user education the system updates will facilitate improved service delivery the education will ensure all users will input and handle tickets in a standard manner over help desk processes and procedures were entered into the knowledge database these process and procedures have been reviewed with and are the foundation of the standardization being brought to bear on the help desk operation more processes and procedures will be added on an as required basis to ensure the help desk operation keeps pace with changes in the industry the access issue for is resolved and full access to the knowledge database has been provided to management lex was loaded with the asset information from the former system hat heat asset tracker while the data being loaded was voluminous it is incomplete in some areas and departments and are partnering to ensure the data is comprehensive a work group and a plan is in place to ensure the data accuracy meets expectations at budget development time for proper forecasting the work group verified the inventory information and from four separate reference points determined the number of desktop and laptop assets to be approximately units further refinement is being performed on the inventory and software license information is being gathered and loaded into the database hp is a product to sample the health of all devices and send health reports for technical staff review this product is installed on the network and is monitoring network and server events on a proactive basis the technical staff received training in on this powerful tool and plans are in place to install application agents to measure and report response time for all critical applications help desk statistics for are as follows total calls for the month total calls answered total calls abandoned abandoned calls seconds abandoned calls seconds average speed to answer seconds performance answered is performance abandoned over sec is performance is approximately the same level of attainment as the month of careful analysis indicates that while the help desk is handling normal levels of help desk calls satisfactorily peak periods are not being handled within service level limits therefore will increase staffing during peak periods to ensure service is at or above the levels expected by the at all times service area application services for had a good month in terms of ticket processing and service level requirements they hit of the problem ticket response and resolution
