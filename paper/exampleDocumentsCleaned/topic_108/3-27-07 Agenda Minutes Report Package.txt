report covers high profile projects including the asset inventory has completed plans for asset disposal and tracking an change request has been received the change to service levels of the contract will be reviewed and discussed with auditors office and the controllers office ms continued with discussion of the project and stated the migration is in the final phase stoneware project resolved the load balancing and clustering issues is waiting on a new release and will be testing the actual release as works on a backup plan the automated mapping engine project is complete training will follow for and mac liaisons the automated vehicle locator project is going well the next step will be to finalize the data terminal design for driver input for snow and solid waste vehicles also planned is to test mapping interface used for locating vehicles and showing status the installs for snow and trash trucks will be this month ms continued with updates on the enterprise messaging project which the and court are interested in a system to replace current system as well as provide additional and more advance functionality is looking at the project for potential in coordination with the and courts in the initiation phase the fugitive safe surrender project will establish an arrestee processing center at the messiah missionary baptist church a draft charter and project plan will be needed as operations are involved in preliminary requirements gathering the portable project next steps include installation of antennas on the roof of the city county building and to finalize with building authority that all information has been provided to complete all electrical installation and verify antenna locations planned for this period on the moss implementation will be to prepare for a planning workshop and continue to work on the project charter on the video streaming project the date is set and work will begin on encoding council meetings from the beginning of the year ms updated the board on the operations report missed major meadows questioned the waiving of missed and asked if they had been missed two months in a row ms stated that if misses the next month they will not be charged a penalty most of the not met are due to the migration major meadows pointed out that the have been missed months in a row and asked if the and the board will continue to waive the penalty major meadows continued that in previous it board discussions the emphasis was put on the vendor knowing the project was coming the board had requested step up and be proactive major meadows stated that he is not opposed to waiving the penalty but stated concern ms commented that the vendor has brought in additional resources but the increase in the volume of calls to the has been incredible county treasurer explained that the pattern the board has established has been to take a good hard look any time a has been waived the enterprise has seen superior cooperation from and the reasons for missing the performance levels requirements are understandable expressed that new members would follow the steps of previous members and take that very hard look to make sure waiving the is justified stated that he had concerns with the last two indicators response and call abandonment the speed to answer appears to be more of a problem increasing from of the calls to almost a third those are severe performance problems whatever the reason with some serious portion of the work force calling and calling again the issue is getting worse resolution to finalize negotiations with for application upgrade rick powers administrator and and ken were present for the presentation powers explained that this day was contemplated following a labor intensive tornado damage assessment in and each one since then at that time the department of metropolitan development was simply looking for ways to streamline disaster mitigation efforts an overview demonstration of a component of the system was received and will be discussed today during that demonstration it became painfully apparent that current technology was lacking in many areas maybe most of all in the area of integration with other agencies and their respective technologies since then other factors have been contemplated and acted upon that will be covered for the it board now those factors have also made this a breakout year for and the division of compliance in particular the department is in the midst of adding the staff and services needed to address insurance survey office findings that are related to home owners insurance rates in county when these service level enhancements are completed a substantial fee increase has provided for part of which is devoted to perpetual technology improvements we will also have added the following staff to our division additional building inspectors building code analysts zoning inspectors a legal case specialist and a landscape review specialist the business licensing inspection role and plan review have moved into offices considering the dramatic changes made by adding staff and equally if not greater changing policies and processes to improve oversight of the construction industry and code enforcement to address public safety the results needed to resolve our shortcomings will also require a robust technology upgrade to carry us the distance with this huge challenge the realization was made that there is still even greater opportunities has been working with many other departments on the software integration committee established by the mayors office researching this system known as automation that will provide for integration across department lines and provide a means to remove many of the silos of our legacy systems currently technology is aging but is still on the forefront of developing new ways to do business technology must keep abreast of the requirements and in turn must keep abreast of technology the city and county are using limited wireless applications is integrated into the inspection operations via cellular phones and vehicles are equipped with docked laptops that operate remotely however the enterprise can only go so far with the legacy systems that these enhancements are providing a means to update a third party system is in place that is actually impeding moving forward the proposal today will provide a solution and an opportunity to change the landscape of technology in our city and county the automation product is a suite of software modules that will allow to upgrade and enhance our current software table editor and possibly other applications as capabilities are realized as well as provide the opportunity to integrate several key business processes that rely on additional rd party software systems this software will also provide a means to support the enterprise in including planning permitting licensing inspection enforcement interactive voice response citizen access and services and a huge leap forward in emergency response all of this functionality equates to dramatically increased service delivery in but more importantly for the first time the ability to truly integrate technology in support of like core functions and even systems across the enterprise the system is envisioned as an enterprise solution to many processes a brief description of each module follows land management this core module would allow us to replace and table editor it provides a complete solution for planning permitting licensing inspecting enforcement and damage assessment citizen access this module provides a complete solution where citizens and contractors can access services and carryout entire processes online in essence this would allow us to create an for public use that provides many new abilities and others currently facilitated by other software and in some cases outside vendors this module would not replace our current reliance on the staff or data but it provides an integrated tool within the application to view data for example it would allow you to view all sewer connection permits in a given area on a map without having to leave the application and use a data viewing tool such as it will also provide graphic depictions of assessment of damage during disaster mitigation efforts wireless this module allows field staff to have direct wireless or an extension to automation this module will be essential to increasing the number of inspections that can be performed during a day by decreasing the time it takes to cases this integrated interactive voice response system allows citizens the ability to call in and gain hour access to services powers added an increase in the permit fee was made in anticipation of this upgrade and subsequent expense presented a presentation of the project summary questioned the prepaid maintenance and asked how would the vendor be held accountable once the maintenance is paid become expensive how will or the board enforce the contract or show the vendor has not provided adequate support explained that through contractual milestones and the vendor would be accountable additionally stated there is a guaranteed percent in escrow that the vendor will not be able to utilize unless authorizes and a zero percent financing was negotiated requested background checks on be done and other agencies located that have used prepaid maintenance stated that information is available and be put in report form mayoral appointee stated for clarification that the enterprise will host the data but the cost is for the information to be available and could the data be queried was also interested in the possibility of data linking to other data bases ms stated the data will link to the new or current property system and will integrate with asset management asked if the system is based on a query stated the system is parcel based commented that is not used in public safety and recreation and wanted to know if indicators could be used to receive information such as community and economic queries local taxes public safety nuisance events could be helpful to potential businesses looking to relocate ms stated that information of that type will be accessible through portal and will be available end of or the first of director public safety noted that training is mentioned but not specifically addressed as part of the roll out explained that the training will depend on the level of the user and the type of reports needed as well as the number of classes and people in those classes a block of training will be available asked as host what will it take to get back on line explained the host is on a real time replication transmitted to data will be live and up to date asked what the potential impact will be on bandwidth ms discussed researching options and evaluating alternative solutions ms white commented the upgrade is a long time in coming and supports this solution ms added that any is covered including fire inspections environmental services and taxi cabs stated that the project before the board is much larger than discussed at council he recommended moving forward but suggested revisit the department of metropolitan development or administration and finance committee and explain the expansion explained that the permit section increased fees in order to fund the upgrade and increase inspectors at the request of building community the revenue source has been set ms white made a motion to approve resolution the motion was seconded by ms enders and carried unanimously resolution to approve an agreement between and dell marketing ms operations manager and service area manager were present for questions narrated a presentation including factors considered lease vs buy budget equipment flexibility technology and total cost of ownership stated that the refresh plan was competed through city purchasing and dell is of the current provider of leasing services with the current master agreement on released a request for proposal in order to procure a vendor for the leasing of computer hardware has selected dell marketing in response stated the total cost is based on the budget this year the total is roughly asked about the status of hardware throughout the enterprise that is not accessible through stated approximately ten to fifteen percent does not hit the network regularly with the majority found in public safety vehicles the assets have been identified in physical inventories but not through active reporting to clarified the refresh is based on the total inventory and not reporting confirmed that was correct stated that is working with dell to boost the minority participation number on the hardware purchase end such as imaging the machines tagging storage and delivery ms narrated a presentation of the current standards and proposed refresh schedule will be working through the and the agencies on the slated number of identifying who they belong to and when replacement is planned major meadows commented that a refresh program is a long time in coming but suggested exceptions will occur and a plan is needed to accommodate agencies need to have recourse or the ability to challenge decision the process needs to be clearly defined within suggested that exceptions could be addressed through the office of finance and management although the refresh is clearly driven by the age of the equipment major meadows stated the he did not agree and there be situations in which an agency has a business case that does not agree with and there needs to be some type of mediation suggested including some type of flexibility or balance into the refresh schedule and proposed work with an advisory group as a contingency from month to month or quarter to quarter stated that the office of finance and management would be considering changes from a budget prospective suggested taking the proposed refresh schedule to the it team for acceptance questioned how failure within the first days would be handled and recommended negotiating for replacement for machines that are faulty in the contract continuing related to actual failure rates dell does not have great record expected that in the field the failure rate would be higher for machines bouncing around in police cars than desktops and asked if there are greater failure rate in some parts of the enterprise suggested tracking failure rates as a learning tool going forward and proposed monitor failure rates in response stated that the model is the same for the police vehicles and the desktop asked if any on the proposed refresh plan are grant specific stated that some grant specific will or do hit the network voiced concern in grant specific equipment being identified and processed appropriately moved to approve resolution the motion was seconded by and carried unanimously resolution to approve an agreement between and software techniques inc and were present to answer questions explained there have been problems with the current evidence inventory system since it has been in place two and a half years ago a number of different programs were considered with being selected is the next generation of ace which is the program in place prior to bard explained that in part bard was not successful because the capability of importing data from ace was not there as a result of extreme cost for ace to help with the importation resulting in the two programs being maintained both old and new employees have had hands on exposure to and were able to maneuver successfully through the program stated that came to to work with negotiate on upgrade with the owner of source code as well as software asked if data can be imported confirmed that it could and the vendor has agreed to make sure data is ready by the start date ms enders made a motion to approve resolution the motion was seconded by and carried unanimously resolution authorizing the to execute an amendment to the information technology services agreement between associates inc and the city of and county and project manager were present for resolution stated the background for the amendment table of the revised statement of work details database administration roles and responsibilities the original table has roles and responsibilities the new table has the amendment is to properly reflect those roles and responsibilities judge asked that a copy of the roles and responsibilities be forwarded to her for township assessors made a motion to approve resolution the motion was seconded by ms enders and carried major meadows abstained resolution appointing members of the enhanced access review committee presented resolution per section of code of consolidated city of stated that as written the resolution takes away the township assessors representation suggested the board amend the resolution to add to the enhanced access review committee rather than replace ms price ms white asked how she was appointed stated the it board appointed the members further stated that in an effort for bipartisan representation he would support adding and allowing ms price to continue to represent the townships on the committee ms white commented that there have been many changes through out the township ranks and suggested the board seek the will of the township assessors stated that the board need not delay appointment moved to appoint beth white county clerk to replace and county auditor to replace and add county assessor to the enhanced access review committee will confirm the will of the township assessors ms ender questioned the committee being comprised of an even number stated that the committee discussed membership at last meeting and did not feel an even number would create a hardship the committee historically has worked together well the motion was seconded by ms enders and carried unanimously suggested postponing resolution and resolution to the next it board meeting update and project manager were present for the narrated a presentation discussed issues and risks ms white asked if the go live date had been pushed back responded that the date remains depending on types of errors that could come up that would be difficult to fix responded that it would depend on how testing goes and the customers approving and signing off that the application is ready to go judge requested a copy of the presentation and stated that it is imperative the project keep rolling there is great risk continuing to use the current justice system which is very fragile should the current system go down the result could be a great deal of jail overcrowding requested that and be added to the it board each month as well as keeping certain board members informed migration and project managers and project manager were present for the migration update stated that the project has been in production phase since early the migration of workstations and email
