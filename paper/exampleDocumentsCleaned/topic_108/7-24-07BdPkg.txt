the system will maintain a history of the last passwords used the end user will have to provide a unique password times in a row the account will lock out the user after invalid login attempts this makes it very difficult to use an automated tool to break into the system stated that tools make attempts in a matter of seconds the policy will automatically the account after minutes or the user call the to unlock the account discussed the complexity aspect to make sure users have at least characters in the password with characters from three of categories upper case lower case a number or special character ms enders stated that the invalid login attempts is very generous and asked if the reason is to encourage users to call the replied that the concept is to establish a balance between individuals attempting to break in and allowing end user enough chances to get the password correct ms added that is a password implementation tool that will allow end users to establish questions to help get away from users calling the in a normal year the receives approximately calls for password resets asked if would be implemented at the same time as the password policy if so the situation

provide tips to identified high maintenance on how to remember passwords added that the implementation will be in phases to minimize calls to the mayoral appointee stated that users are writing passwords down and asked what the best practice would be for the ordinary person that does not use all the technology all the time for maintaining passwords the recommendation was made to include in the policy a statement directing users to not write down their password and posting it on their monitor or underneath their keyboard commented that best practice is to not write down passwords but if a person is going to write down their password they should do so on something they carry on their person ms enders stated that the password cycle is rather stringent and suggested the number be lower
