board minutes director meadows county sheriffs department made a motion to approve the it board minutes the motion was seconded by ms beth white county clerk and carried unanimously report and status updates ms information services presented the update including discussion on the refresh project the status of this project shall be changed to an operational activity going forward the automation team continues to work through the project charter process the neighborhood cameras will be sent out for installation maintenance and support of the next phase of the camera new portals were added to the project to add functionality the capital improvement program for was added the property system replacement is going well although challenged with a couple of delays related to the tax bills ms stated that and have finished crafting amendment that accounts for increases and decreases in the volume of work and assets that occur throughout the year is working with dell to perform at no cost a storage assessment to consider methods to reduce costs and improve efficiencies has been working with the it team on standards and policies with the goal of having a policy to bring before the it board in presently the enterprise has production servers that average utilization of their many of the servers need to be replaced will reduce the overall expenditure for the physical hardware held the second annual picnic with a great turnout and raised for the guardian home ms stated that missed two service levels which were also missed last month a process will be in place in the future to prevent the same met all service levels hood chief financial officer presented the financial report and stated that expenses for through were million or of the budget revenue collected is at based on total budget contractual services utilized by is better off this year through than last year at this time with a variance of ms beth white county clerk asked a process question regarding budget and board action city controller stated that the board will review the budget prior to presentation and added that there are major issues with the reassessment which will result in the full levee coming in the delayed billing will cause cash flow problems and numbers presented in the budget not end up in final budget chief deputy treasurer asked if part of the revenue source is effected by the property tax explained that the budget for comes from other city county agencies of which many be subject to property taxes coming in status hood presented an update on the minority and business enterprise program including the purpose and definition is committed to utilizing when applicable as well as partnering with major vendors to accomplish this hood recognized the major vendors for their efforts and commended them on a tremendous job asked in reference to the presentation what pass dollars are ms stated the pass revenue is related to equipment hardware and other standard commitments that pass from other departments agencies the remaining dollars are those that are actually available to bid out director meadows requested the materials be provided electronically and commented that the total percentage is good earl director of public safety requested a list of the vendors utilized to achieve the total fifth amendment to the contractual agreement for technology services between information technology inc and the consolidated city of county information services agency hood narrated a presentation including the introduction to the fifth amendment with and stated if passed the amendment would move the contract end date to from of the same year the main purpose of the amendment is to reconcile actual service volumes against service volumes identified in schedule it allows for compensation or credits to the appropriate party for volumes in arrears this is known as a process ms stated that the enterprise had added servers customers and install move add change and will be monitoring on a monthly basis and have numbers available to discuss in detail once the numbers have been confirmed will submit an invoice for services provided this year the process will be ongoing and potentially could work in favor should the numbers decrease ms commented that as a result of the migration users were identified that might not have actually been on active directory resulting in a head count change additional laptops and desktops were identified through the inventory process director meadows explained that with the consolidation and staff shift devices that were once shared with number of employees now be assigned to a single staff member as employees are reassigned they now need workstations that previously were shared ms stated will work through the changes ms also discussed relocations such as and that have an established deadline a situation occur in which the agency is not willing to pay for additional resources or overtime to remove laptops or the vendor will not be hit against the service levels and have to bring in additional resources because the request is over of the total projected volumes requested a summary of where additional laptops and users identified are in order to allocate expenditures in future budgets hood explained the reconciliation will happen at least yearly and more often if the parties agree the amendment states for the year will be made no later than the st quarter of the following year for example the will be paid or credited no later than the reconciliation would also occur if there was a termination the pricing rates are also spelled out in the amendment as will as a placeholder for years and pricing the amendment also states that the initiative process as provided for by article of the agreement will be triggered for large increases or decreases in volume of work finally the amendment provides a definitions section to provide a consistent and known way to identify volumes and all parties are on the same page hood also stated that both and management have agreed to the amendment as well as corporate counsel of both and hood concluded the presentation director meadows requested the presentation be provided electronically legal counsel added the materials had been reviewed and met approval after minor changes program manager stated that appreciates the opportunity to be involved in work with to craft this amendment to be able to be fair to all the parties and to be able to reflect positive and negative changes with the levels of work that have occurred and is very supportive of this process earl moved to approve the amendment the motion was seconded by ms white and carried unanimously master agreement for information technology services with for office server moss implementation services presented the office server background as shown on the presentation ms added that the project has been planned for approximately eighteen months or so but was delayed due to new product availability continued that worked with for a phased implementation of the new moss product with fixed cost proposals for each phase previous analysis work by was incorporated ms added wanted to present the full implementation to the board from beginning to end rather than phase by phase asked specific to this contract what kind of participation does the vendor have stated the company is small with or people and only a couple individuals would be working on this contract director meadows stated that as he understood the process a vendor still has to submit documentation no matter how big the operation and asked if the vendor went through the purchasing division explained he is not aware of the specific policy in when the services were initially competed has had a relationship with the vendor for several years and has not gone through the competitive process recently ms white stated that the vendor was procured in and asked what best advice on another competitive process would be advised in this case the work already done will be used for implementation and in looking at a cost analysis from a business sense it is cost effective to maintain the vendor should a new vendor come in extensive cost could be required recommendation was to advise to compete out contracts as they expire concluded that the vendor has been working for sometime on this particular project and upgrade analysis determining the needs of the enterprise and has put together a very good detailed project plan the vendor has extensive knowledge about the enterprise and current situation that any other vendor would have to spend considerable time working with the agency and enterprise to gain stated that it would be fiscally prudent to keep this vendor commented effort should be made in bidding out expired contracts rather than renewing them because a relationship exists that is not providing alternatives consistent with the goals of city county council stated he is impressed with participation as presented by hood and request that as a minimum given a contract like this part of it be outsourced to bring in minority business ms white stated that the process is complicated to talk about using local vendors but her preference is to use local vendors especially when most cost effective agencies should consider local presence especially in the current climate county assessor made a motion to approve the moss implementation services the motion was seconded by director meadows and passed enterprise messaging ms amber pm presented the enterprise messaging project that is currently engaged in ms explained the courts and sheriff came forward with messaging needs all departments and agencies were surveyed to determine additional needs an was submitted with three vendor proposals received through an evaluation team the proposals were reviewed and narrowed down to two ms discussed needs to be addressed and features of enterprise messaging as included in the ms requested board approval to move forward with contract negotiations director meadows read the following statement from judge since the court has been interested in installing an communication software suite designed for everyday and emergency security communication messages we have wanted to provide real time communication to public communication devices such as public address systems and visual displays as well as private communication devices such as telephones pagers and email we have waited and worked alongside the sheriffs department and and other agencies to review all available systems and to recommend getting a messaging and communication system that is modular and scalable and that can grow as needs the court believes that we have found a communication system from systems that will not only be very for us to use but can be used by the sheriffs department the department of public safety and other agencies as well the enhanced system will allow a message to be delivered audibly visually or both audibly and visually at the same time it can direct a message to selected areas or to all areas simultaneously from a public safety angle within our court rooms the system can be integrated into the multiple public address pa systems to produce an unified system that meets the needs of the hearing and as well as the hearing and sight impaired the court feels that this technology will make us more and efficient in allowing us to simultaneously provide detailed information at multiple locations for general announcements public information emergency notification and instruction court session announcements synchronized time and much more it will allow us to deliver emergency messages while minimizing human error because the courts will share the same server as the sheriffs department it will be a very cost effective solution and the software and system will be available to other agencies as well like the clerks office auditor and prosecutor etc in the building the court has waited in implementing this solution since especially at our juvenile location where this is required to allow for appropriate calling and notification of cases in a crowded court room area we are fully supportive of this system and are also aware that the sheriffs department needs this on an urgent basis as well director meadows added that an enhanced messaging system will allow removal of the two existing systems that need replaced and are not cost effective to support the two systems only service a unique set of users and an enterprise solution servicing not just the county sheriff department and metropolitan police department but the enterprise should be considered ms stated the proposal falls in middle of the budget process and intends on working with the office of finance and management to get through the fiscal ordinance asked where would this project fit into the budget process how large of an investment is it estimated to be has a analysis been done and were public safety representatives on the review team ms responded that a financial review has not been completed in full as contract negotiations have not gone forward a amount has not been determined the impact of a possible initiative has not yet been considered on this project ms explained that coming before the board was planned before heading in that direction and emergency management were on the advisory team ms white commented on the servers being used at and asked if there were not room on the servers that are currently in the environment ms stated there very well be but that has not been analyzed nor has a specific vendor been narrowed down requested more detail for the project with the understanding the courts want to move quickly asked if has been before the county justice planning council as an agenda item continued that he is aware of the criminal communities need as well as the courts desire to get people in courts the decision should be rational and not just a reaction suggested adding the requirement that vendors provide applications that be used on a virtual server do not accept vendors that are not able to do that the process is the one that most efficiently manages the system ms stated the agency will be working with to ensure a process requested provide a business case including benefits provided to the sheriff and the courts the business case comes first not negotiations money will not be put in the budget without a business case asked for additional information on the vision impaired or hearing impaired capabilities ms stated specifics were not available at the moment ms amber and project manager presented the update ms narrated the presentation ms stated that in reference to project concerns the goal is for to be proactive and identify if problems are training related explained testing is not ongoing the team is building test scripts and meeting with agencies involved in developing tests the team is logging and tracking which panels are being used approximately panels in coordination with script writing to make sure scripts are hitting the panels and menu items there are still technical hurdles to resolve ms stated that the need to bring additional staff into the workshops has been identified the it board adjourned at the next information technology board meeting is scheduled for at in project has been completed this is the last time it will appear on this report the project is experiencing significant delays potential cost overruns or critical failure hard deadlines be exceed in excess of original budget immediate corrective action is the project is experiencing minor delays or minor cost overruns or the project has encountered problems which put it at risk of either going or missing deadlines hard deadlines can still be achieved but original goal dates be missed cost end up over original budget project is on time and on budget with no delays or

the sign off from and a business case from xerox during this period the proof of concept began and was a huge success is the tool to convert the scripts for batch jobs for use in the windows environment the team successfully converted of scripts with resolution toward the th the client is ready for testing when the scripting and security tasks are complete unfortunately during this period the project team has encountered some the production support hours have remained at high levels pulling over hours away from the project in the past months two production bug fixes were found and fixed resulting in hours worth of time with an additional days to dump the code into the build the team experienced hardware failures that brought the development environment down for days delays in identifying enterprise solutions for batch scheduling and report distribution lead to an extension of time required to work through any technical challenges the scripting process and security profiles have become major concerns for the project team there is concern that the project will not be able to move forward successfully without resolution to these issues automation the initiation phase concluded and has produced a baseline schedule and charter for the project orientation analysis phase management and case owner training has begun for and health hospital of the analysis sessions have been completed one of the challenges will be the coordination that needs to occur with both the upgrade and the new automated vehicle locator devices have been installed on all vehicles programming for the mobile terminal devices has been completed and the vendor will be the week of th to begin installing the mobile data terminals camera projects this project is now divided into two separate projects neighborhood cameras the released a for this portion of the project and held a conference on th with the due back on th a communication plan for the neighborhoods needs to be developed in conjunction with this project liberty zone of cameras are now online and camera wireless access points are fully functional two of the three cameras that were on the state have been brought online and the square mall infrastructure has been installed maintenance and support of all cameras will be included in for the vendor of neighborhood cameras over the next few weeks we will be identifying the infrastructure costs for putting the camera up at square mall and working with the vendor to resolve the video quality issues municipal wireless continues to gather the requirements for this project a proposal to perform the feasibility study for the municipal wireless project will be presented at the meeting property system replacement property tax bill issues and a mandated reassessment have been encountered since the it board meeting there are requirements within the divided among functional groups gap analysis meetings continue where project team area coordinators and subject matter experts have been comparing what is currently available in to the requirements because of the mandated reassessment and several other state mandates the executive enterprise print assessment completed assessment and final results have been provided to the office of finance and management on the study identified the following employee to device ratio to cost per page sponsors committee has altered the project implementation the implementation of the auditor and treasurer modules has been moved from of to spring of guts will make the state mandated changes to instead of the changes being made to the current system at no additional cost a new implementation schedule will be published next week one major area of concern has been data conversion with the mandated reassessment resources have become very tight and the data conversion tasks for the property tax system replacement project were at risk guts has agreed to take on the majority of the data conversion at no additional cost to the project the enterprise remote access solution is up and running we are currently working on a marketing and communication plan to roll out to the user community we expect to have rolled out to the enterprise by the end of and server consolidation currently in the planning stage several assessments have already been completed and work is underway to architect the production environment including research on several technologies that will be implemented as part of this project our current production environment is being upgraded to handle new applications being deployed before the solution is available budget process is working closely with the office of finance and management to shore up the information technology budget will be presenting to the and finance committee on th this meeting will be held at the theological seminary at west street at pm calls into the continued to show a normal trend post migration completed for the month of in addition to the related to the refresh one was missed for the month of and it was call abandon rate this is the first month that has missed this in several months true up in order to complete the mechanics of the true up process four teams have been composed of both and to address the following topics development of improved invoice amendment reconciliation process tracking and defining new initiatives review of schedule all parties are committed to working together to provide improved services achieved all for the month of primary focus continues to be on the and property projects along with these two projects there are several smaller projects that are in user acceptance testing that should be deployed by mid standards policies the policies group met several times throughout the month and submitted an internet acceptable use policy to the it team the it team approved the policy and has submitted the policy to the it board for final approval at the it board meeting in the focus will be on updating the standard desktop and laptop models for our financial report this report describes the financial position of in three areas vs budget comparison revenue statement and vs contract comparison expenditures as of total million or this includes payments to and the budget includes million in prior year purchase orders the expense for character includes million carried over from revenue has collected million dollars or of our projected revenue for which includes payments received for the th quarter billings the projected revenue does not include million to be billed for the remaining balance of the camera project and the fusion financial report includes credit includes amendment credit includes time warner proposal executive summary time warner is seeking the approval of a local exchange service agreement between the city of county and time warner for voice services this contract covers service locations at street post and state street time warner is committed to keeping the city of as a customer they have provided a fiber based voice service to the city and have not experienced one outage or even one trouble ticket recommendation for renewal is based on time warner telecoms reliability coupled with cost effective benefits of renewal pricing and no transition dollars spent due to the contract expiration of the current contract state is as follows upon expiration of a term contract the service will automatically renew at the same terms and conditions for successive month terms or as otherwise stated in the standard terms and conditions if applicable unless either party notifies the other in writing thirty days prior to the expiration of the then current term that it wishes to terminate the service the renewal of this contract is with an understanding that bidding process should occur prior to renewal current rates for currently range from each current cost for monthly on average is monthly renewal rates month renewal rates each month renewal rates each month renewal rates each monthly monthly monthly under current auto renewal we are spending more a month than necessary if contract is renewed at the month rate time warner has committed to making adjustment upon the renewal of contract estimated cost savings for the month renewal is requesting the board to approve the renewal of time warner for voice services for and for a service contract period of months effective through note that renewal rates have been verified through purchasing as rates lower than and allowing a delivery of ultimate cost savings of public internet acceptable use policy policy

environment meaning they are presently delivering applications that are used in the day to day operations of the many of these servers are no longer under warranty and approaching the end of their useful life need to be replaced in addition we have several large projects moss property that need to have server hardware and storage purchased through two separate studies it was determined that the utilization of the existing servers was rather low on a per server basis although higher than industry averages this presents an opportunity to consolidate many of these servers into a virtual server environment in the past it was typical to put one application on each server as a new application was deployed a new server was also purchased and installed a virtual server environment allows for larger servers to host multiple virtual servers thereby reducing the total number of servers and increasing the utilization of each though not all applications are candidates for due to specific hardware or high performance needs the vast majority of our applications can run in a virtual environment in order to migrate to a virtual server environment there are several steps assess the current environment this includes collecting statistics and determining which servers are candidates for collect information about our storage environment current hardware utilization performance and future needs architect the solution based on the number of servers and applications that will be migrated performance needs and project needs a production environment will be taking advantage of existing hardware if possible it is critical that the environment be correctly so that no issues or performance problems are introduced as a result of a environment will also be during this stage build the production environment based on the solution hardware will be procured and deployed as the environment is setup testing will be performed to insure that the advanced features such as automated are working correctly technology update migrate from physical servers to the virtual environment during this stage each application and server that was targeted to be migrated will be moved from a physical server to a virtual server within the production environment extensive testing will be done to insure that no issues are introduced during this phase while this is a proven process we currently run over virtual servers today and is fairly straight forward the amount of work including testing at each phase makes this a lengthy process within the budget money was allocated to replace some of the servers out of warranty plus the major projects have funds available for hardware purchases these funds should be sufficient to cover hardware and software purchases necessary to implement our vendors have provided the assessments storage at no cost to the these engagements are typically each an enterprise license agreement with has been negotiated and purchased which allows us to deploy as many licenses as necessary over the next years with a fixed maintenance cost in years provides several benefits to the cost savings rather than replacing existing outdated servers and continuing to expand the number of servers within the data center due to new projects will allow us to save money by purchasing fewer larger servers and increase the amount they are utilized reduced needs fewer servers consume less power and generate less heat thereby reducing the power and cooling needs within the data center improved service levels due to automated for some applications a failure would result in significant downtime with automated if there is a problem with one server the load can easily and in some cases transparently be transferred to another server with minimal interruption to the ease of expansion as new applications are deployed instead of purchasing and deploying a new server which can take weeks they can easily be added to the virtual production environment in a matter of days also if additional capacity is needed new servers can be added dynamically to the environment renewal global circuit addition to community corrections global rental of
