viewer metadata repository saga applications plans communication es engage evangelize development strategic plan competition participation innovation value efficiencies and during this period i managed to finish my top priority project ahead of schedule team accomplishments very well be the most successful period thus far for the team while much effort was expended during in response to natural disasters such as floods and and to dealing with the challenges of an expanded staff and a new services vendor brought the realization of goals carefully drafted in our year strategic plan much of this work was really behind the scenes and not immediately to the enterprise but these projects have prepared a solid foundation for some very exciting improvements to the capabilities that we provide our customers the past months have also seen tremendous professional growth for our staff stronger project planning and tracking procedures have been put in place as well as a strengthening of project and application documentation procedures a concerted effort was made to acquire needed technical training that has already proven invaluable the team also provided formal classroom instruction to over city county employees and presented nearly papers to various conferences the following are highlights of accomplishments during data viewer the is a fully functional web based map viewer to be utilized by the majority of enterprise user who require access this is a replacement for an existing application and will eliminate a significant support burden metadata repository this new metadata repository will serve as a single source of related metadata for both the enterprise and our internet application users in late the group took delivery of an exciting new product the easy to use application and its specialized oblique angle photography have proven to be much more useful to our customers then we ever imagined data maintenance enhancement although not nearly as flashy or exciting as the previous item the ongoing data maintenance and enhancement that are performed throughout each year ensure that our customers have the most current and reliable data available in the area master address perhaps the most project this year has been the implementation of the master address database mad the mad is comprised of two main components an oracle database containing a comprehensive set of street parcel building and unit addresses and corresponding map layers which provide the spatial component at this time the mad includes way integration with work management system way integration with permitting system and way integration with the new system server the server product is an exciting new offering from our software vendor at its simplest the server allows us to build customized that include a very robust spatial capability we consider this product to be a foundation for much of our work in the next few years in fact as the very first nonmilitary enterprise to actually implement this technology has seen a great deal of interest from others within the community as well as from itself we now have three server based applications in service and three more are in early development snow map automation during late the staff developed an application that allows staff to print snow route map books for use during this snow season this tool greatly simplifies the creation of these books which are an important reference for the snowplow drivers integration as the mayors action center began in the discussions regarding the purchase of a new system the group recognized that much of the eventual success of the project would hinge on the ability of any new application to have access to an address validation mechanism with this in mind we accelerated implementation of the mad database and began the development of an address validation utilizing the as of then unreleased server technology although this early adoption did present some risk it was necessary to ensure success of the system saga applications these applications are examples of behind the scenes work undertaken during which will provide tremendous opportunities for our customers next year the automated geography generator and the automated geography application saga are fully automated processes which will maintain map layers as entries are made in other oracle databases for example when a mayors action center phone representative enters call information from a citizen the address is verified against the mad data and stored in the system the saga process the automatically creates a point within the map layer which represents calls for service effectively adding a spatial component which is easily accessible to all levels of the enterprise in the case of the same process is followed whenever a permit is issued by allowing easy mapping for analysis apartment address compilation although the layers represent street and parcel addresses the identification of apartment unit addresses has long been a desire during tasked our services vendor with a field survey of all apartment complexes within the county at this point the fieldwork has been completed and data entry of the unit data within the mad database is underway project the group is providing technical resources and project guidance for the implementation within of a new set of applications which will be used for crime analysis and to make the resulting data much more accessible within the departments and to the public this project is funded by a grant for which the group provided in matching funds solid waste billing project the group has recently developed a method that allows to identify residential properties that are receiving trash collection services but are not being billed accordingly during the first months of this project we have identified approximately in annual missing revenue and anticipate additional significant amounts prior to project completion in software environment upgrades beginning midyear the has worked through a series of software upgrades published by our vendor because of the complexity of our current enterprise environment this required careful planning to ensure that our customers received uninterrupted service as comes to a close the team has begun application development for next year and is in the process of creating a formal work plan initiatives planned or under consideration include an server based application that will appear as a map window within the existing interface used by mac telephone representatives this window will automatically show the location for the service request being taken as well as other service requests within the same area this will allow the reps to spot problem areas and notify pertinent operations personnel as well as give the citizens better information the data source for this display is actually provided by the saga application that was completed in in preparation for this type of use two more server based applications that make use of the saga data the first is an viewer that lets all types of city personnel view real time customer request data in a format the second will be a service that will allow operations management and elected officials to receive daily weekly or monthly maps and tabular reports of customer requests within their area of interest for instance a councilor could decide that they would like a small map and report emailed to them on the first of each month which lists all calls received by the mac during the previous month that fall within their district a manager wish to see the same data each morning and then receive a report only on a monthly basis both of these applications are being to allow easy transition to other data sets and purposes development of a street closures web application to allow the public easier access to this information the data flows required by this application would also be of value to public safety and the establishment of formal and agreements with our customers to take ownership of pertinent data sets development of standards for field data collection and inventories this would allow more timely responses to our customers requests for guidance continue fieldwork to gather additional addresses for inclusion within mad beginning with strip mall type properties many other cities of our size utilize based video displays during public meetings such as council committee and board hearings it seems to be a valuable tool to ensure that everyone involved is looking at the same picture and helps to visualize issues quicker we would like to explore this approach with city county agencies as in previous years we will continue to maintain and enhance our existing datasets and to develop new data sets in response to customer and project the team will continue to strengthen our current effort to develop sound documentation products for both applications and analysis projects we currently have a research effort underway to assess the feasibility of utilizing a metadata storage mechanism to archive these documents and to make them accessible to the enterprise the team will continue to provide support to existing projects such as the initiative the neighborhood information system and the digital standards we will continue to look forward at new technologies and to assess their applicability to the enterprise lastly we will continue to support the professional growth of our team and actively participate in the new organization annual progress report internet division the main focus of the web development team in was the implementation of the web content management system the is a web update and publishing system designed to allow business users to compose and publish web pages without the need for technical resources the system enforces a standard template to maintain a consistent look and feel throughout the website also it provides an approval process to allow managers to review and web content submitted by authors the team implemented a pilot project in to launch the system and host the home page and upper level pages in the web team was able to migrate a number of departmental websites to the including the mayors office county auditor assessor prosecutor treasurer and this effort involved assisting users in the restructuring and redesign of thousands of web pages the web team completed training for users who are now able to update their web content or remotely without the need for technical assistant users can login to the system with their network login id and password and they can post content using a web browser the web team will continue this effort to complete the migration of all departments and agencies to the new system by as scheduled the web team worked with on a project to replace the outdated email notification system list server the joint team did a thorough evaluation and testing of leading list servers available on the market upon the evaluation the team selected as the preferred list management software and then the system was purchased and installed on the network the new system offers the same capabilities that were available in the old system such as and email lists in addition the system provides additional functionalities such as maintaining user profiles and composing newsletters the user profile function allows internal list managers to target specific citizens groups by zip code voting precinct or any other criteria specified in the profile the team will continue work on this system in and throughout the first quarter of to customize the system according to customer needs and extend its functionality after receiving numerous requests from internal users for more online calendars the internet division purchased additional licenses of the online calendar product at bulk rate the web team configured the system to display new online calendars and trained new users on using the system the system currently hosts public meetings for all boards and commission in addition to other activities the system allows citizens to access public meeting calendars and meeting agendas and minutes online in addition to directing web projects and monitoring progress the internet manager was involved in the it sourcing process he participated in the development of the reviewing proposals
