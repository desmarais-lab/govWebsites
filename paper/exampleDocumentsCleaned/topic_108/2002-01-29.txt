points reasoning behind the recommendation to extend the contract changes that would take place within positives and negatives of the extension and discussions dealing with the next steps of the renegotiation and final decision process issues brought forth dealt with the first years of the contract however most individuals stated they had seen an improvement within the last two years those improvements are met with skepticism from some wondering if the improvements made in the last months are due to the contract expiring in general the comments were supportive one individual strongly believes that the extension is not in the enterprises best interest many said they would like to see more defined details in the service level expectations several individuals found the incentives portion of the amendment was not appropriate because an organization doing business for the should already be motivated enough to go above and beyond what is customer comments mark from the sheriffs department stated he was employed at the time was first brought into the he spoke in favor of the amendment and the full extension period in the sheriffs area a new vendor would need to be reeducated about the processes in the department the it people currently in have a working knowledge of the departments it processes if were to go out for an the risk of losing that institutional knowledge is greatly increased said he liked the arrangements proposed and the penalties associated with them but would like to see develop a clearly defined procedure to measure the service levels in the area his great concern is in the application development area the sheriffs department has their own application development staff working directly with the application development staff he sees this area needing a significant amount of improvement and would like to see grow in this area but likes the ability to break that portion of the contract if improvements are not seen in response to ms question stated in the next three years the sheriffs department would like to see the systems moved into a managed process and the system interfaced with the jail management package one of the deficiencies seen in the original contract was the leadership expected from the it vendor believes he should be able to approach with his problem and should be able to help him determine how to solve it using technology replied it is the responsibility of his staff to utilize the vendor to assist in getting it knowledge needed to solve the problems would like to see the leadership more clearly defined so that the users know who to direct their needs to finch finch from said he was in favor of the amendment and a extension his major concern is the phrase its not in the contract he believes the contract needs to be more clearly defined to include instances where that particular phrase might adhere due to security issues with the law enforcement computers it was brought to attention that would not be able to benefit from the restructuring of the portion of the contract stated they are recasting portions of the contract to specify issues with high security areas such as the law enforcement community and courts ms from permits has been with the for years ms stated she is in favor of the amendment and the duration of the extension is not an issue has been an application that has been working with on from the beginning the response from on any improvements or requests has been very good the recent upgrade was well planned and executed by their support bill young judge young is not in favor of a extension his recommendation is to agree to a extension he specified he was speaking on his own merit and is not representing the views of the courts judge young stated he thought the improvements seen from are due to the contract expiring soon he is against the rewards portion of the contract and feels they should not be rewarded for something they were expected to do all along judge young is concerned about the standalone systems that do not communicate with one another the system is not easily accessible because the different systems are not integrated and he believes the problem stems from the lack of leadership shown by at the time the standalone systems were brought in asked judge young if it is fault because the data is not accessible or if it is the organizations fault because the funds were not provided to integrate the systems piper explained the systems further for clarification stating is integrated with other systems but and are not integrated due to the languages and ages of the two systems he stated that the problem is not fault the problem lies with the inability to integrate the two languages clarified further stating associates inc is contracted
