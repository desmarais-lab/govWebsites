and switches installation of voice and data cabling throughout the facility and implementation of a new circuit the move provides more room for the public defender staff and enables increased efficiency additionally the communications group completed the project for moving of the drug diversion treatment court from the building into their new offices at street new voice and data cabling was installed along with a new switch the new switch was connected to the existing data network already in place at the building deletion of the circuits results in combined yearly savings of over mainframe support efforts the production control team has updated all batch jobs that execute and create data files used for the creation of microfiche media this effort was undertaken to reduce the amount of time it takes to identify data files and transmit those data files to for processing since its inception data files are now being sent prior to the start of the business day thus improving the turnaround time required to get the finished microfiche product back to the customers server improvement efforts the systems group implemented updated procedures to reduce the need to recycle the network printing facility when printers became inoperable due to hardware or communications errors these individual errors are troublesome because often all of the printers in the enterprise had to be brought down as a result of isolated printing issues the new practices include a proactive hourly review of the print queues immediate problem determination and resolution steps should a problem be recognized and trouble ticket logging should more experienced support be required as part of our ongoing project to reduce the costs associated with delivering data communication connectivity to remote locations as well as to remove obsolete technology from the enterprise two more legacy mainframe data circuits have been deleted and converted to newer cost effective technology the first was the analog circuit to state police that was previously used to provide connectivity to the mainframe this line became available for deletion because of the states conversion to the client server based connection to the second was the analog circuit to the speedway police department this deletion was made possible because of conversion from old data equipment dumb terminals to tn processes on personal computer workstations and updated printing processes on network printers the server team installed the latest and hp support to all servers in this included the implementation of operating system updates and hp hardware updates which will help resolve administration and support issues for necessary for maintaining the stability of the storage management improvement efforts since the process was implemented calls to the relating to printer problems appear to be in the decline the systems team along with the production control staff made significant improvements to the internal processes currently utilized to automatically generate mainframe terminal ids to ensure report accuracy additional checkpoints as well as streamlined recovery procedures have been added in the event that terminal id definition tables become corrupt the past month has been extremely busy for the storage management team which had moved from a environment that was at the end of any expansion or growth capacity to the new clarion the successful implementation of the which has of usable storage will allow future growth and expansion the storage was divided into two sections with of slower drives for archiving new imaging file system that is currently in development the remaining that is allocated for file and database growth for all departmental storage needs this new storage system has the potential for clustering for fault tolerance which implemented along with other existing technologies can now share a common storage environment that can provide a greater compared to unused attached server storage improvement efforts prior to each election the team works with the election board to understand the unique technical needs of each election as it pertains to the distribution

enhanced access review committee is charged by the it board with making pricing recommendations for online applications defined under enhanced access statue the enhanced access statute allows for pricing access based on marketing criteria in order to provide revenue for the establishment maintenance and enhancement of those online systems current appointed members are chuck white and price over the past months the enhanced access review committee has reviewed a request made by the county bail agents association to consider a fixed or reduced price to court records in order to entice their members to use the services for court records on a frequent basis the committee first considered whether or not they might be able to recommend the requested pricing change solely for these applicants counsel for the review committee and the it board provided the committee with the opinion that law requires uniform pricing of access to all users of a given data set it seems therefore that the it board cannot offer a preferential pricing policy for any particular group not specifically mentioned in state enhanced access laws the media and the university community at the committees request tested several pricing schemes and did marketing studies to test their clients possible reaction to the new pricing in their analysis of the court records service determined that a decrease in price would not appreciably increase the demand for this service the anticipated additional use of this service cannot be expected to make up for the losses caused by the price decrease the changes requested by the applicants would not only lead to a revenue loss but would require significant changes in accounting and systems programming in the model revenues pay for the costs of these service changes there are no funds currently budgeted by the clerk for these expenditures the use of tax revenue might be appropriate if the administrative costs of providing service could be substantially decreased by the use of online service note the use of the term also includes taxpayers that request public information via telephone staff interviewed the courts and deputy clerks about how much time they actually spent providing this information to the public in person learned that the court staff is currently able to adequately provide service to customers the modest reductions predicted by the marketing studies would not allow for a significant reduction in court staff finally changing the pricing method for enhanced access transactions would result in the need for to make programming and billing changes the committee felt that it is inappropriate to ask to expend the resources to make these changes in light of a statewide case management system that will be implemented for court records in the near future there is uncertainty as to what impact this implementation will have on applications but it is likely that it will be necessary to change the current billing method that would result in a duplication of substantive and significant programming changes in a short period of time in summary the review committee finds that the proposed change would significantly reduce revenue to the project without providing significant benefits to either the community through increased real use of the system or to the custodial agency through a reduced demand for services that the reduced revenue from the proposed change would result in a reduction of the valuable services the clerk of the courts receives from including the implementation and marketing of new applications and current systems improvements that the proposed change would require systems accounting and programming changes which without increased revenue have no identified source of funding that the implementation of a new statewide system obviate any work done to accommodate the proposed change and waste those efforts therefore the review committee recommends this request be denied at this time board resolution to approve an amendment to the internet services agreement between inc and city of and county whereas the information services agency and entered into an agreement hereinafter referred to as original agreement for to provide internet access and bandwidth to the and whereas has offered to provide double the bandwidth currently received with no additional increase in cost and
