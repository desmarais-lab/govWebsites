received memorandum dated and has reviewed it when this contract was approved it was recognized as one of the most advanced it contracts it nailed down so specifically the large number of requirements she had concern that the people that negotiated that contract specifically corporation counsel and lewis and have not been involved in this reconfiguration of the they be able to provide some explanation for why there are she did not believe the board gave the the authority to modify the contract when the contract presented was so specific for a reason there is a reason why there are those reasons need to be examined ms did not agree with the reasons given by to lower the dollar amount should abide by the contract they agreed to regarding the credit issues she stated these are difficult financial times budgets are being cut entered this contract knowing what the were ms does not agree with the strategy to avoid dispute resolution by simply agreeing to a dollar amount the board gave authority to negotiate that amount she hoped to receive a recommendation from banning banning stated he would like to avoid the cost of dispute resolution the points were directly from and were not

contractual obligation if they do not produce she recommended the board request additional details and push the vendor harder stated he did not believe the were liable the contract was awarded as a result of a best and final offer the selection was based on what each party negotiated this is after the fact and separate from the bid process as for the having the authority to reduce the according to municipal code and the contract section allows and to have discussions as a process of managing their relations stated this is a policy making board and why are we not enforcing the penalties that are due per contract he expressed how concerned he was about waiving the credits he stated they should be enforced for two reasons if in a contract there should be a penalty then there should be a penalty second these are tough financial times and to not collect what is due is not being a responsible steward of the taxpayers funds all that aside he stated the board picked banning as and should not micromanage expected that if a penalty is not truly a penalty when discussion turns to bonuses he would hope that they be negotiated also agreed with ms that the would be vulnerable if the board agrees to reduce the suggested the board agree to a letter of understanding that legally supersedes what is in the contract commented that no document had been drafted the agreement is between the and

and track performance each of which store information in their own databases it was a very tedious and time consuming task to extract and gather the required information and format it into an easily readable and detailed report in addition it was very difficult to monitor performance on a daily basis management needed to be able to quickly access performance data on a daily basis to identify areas that needed an based graphical digital dashboard was suggested the dashboard application would extract the required performance data from all of the disparate data sources and store them in a

resources are required to develop the proposed solution documented above developers this project will require developers for approximately each they are currently in the midst of a major development project for the coroner if they are ahead of schedule i will pull them off for this file access the developers will need to have access to the database the analytics copy of the database located in this is critical to the success of this project the current method of manually exporting data from to excel is not an option the file is too large and the process takes too long we must be able to directly run queries and crystal against the database in order to extract the required data tools business objects sells a integration kit that makes the development of crystal reports against the database much quicker and easier at this time the cost of this tool is unknown this tool is not critical to the success of the project it would just speed it up hp has an available this would make the extraction of information from the hp database easier and quicker the cost of this is unknown at this time we are not sure if we can extract the information without this tool it be critical to the success of the project version letter of understanding between information technologies inc regarding administration of information technology services contract acknowledging that the information
