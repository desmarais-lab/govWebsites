phase of their wireless access project this project was designed to enable patrol officers the ability to securely login to our network via laptop computer while in their vehicles on the juvenile facility began a day transition period to fully move the facility to the enterprise network on the th th approximately staff will be on site at the facility to accomplish the change over and finally successfully converted the mainframe computers operating system from to provides more reliable data transfer rates between the processor and storage and provides easier connectivity in support of client server applications technology facilitates data sharing between city and county division of compliance has grown with the use of their new web interface to the point they were ready to try sharing electronic plan documents with the township assessors offices these plan documents had traditionally been accepted in hard copy by and picked up on a monthly basis by the township assessors

paperless law library a system at the jail the facility is to be used by the inmates of the jail and possibly by inmates at other annex facilities to accomplish this project several new dell computers were purchased as well as a couple of printers a new server will be installed as well security measures were taken to separate the computers from the rest of the enterprise by establishing a private virtual local area network and installing security software on each to lock down the device limiting access to only designated applications the test was quite successful summed up their testing with a quote from jerry you had us at hello they were pleasantly surprised with the new mainframe operating system now in production successfully converted the mainframe computers operating system from to is a highly secure scalable enterprise operating system on which to build and develop a comprehensive and diverse application execution environment additionally the is now in a position to take advantage of the mainframes internal hardware architecture including more reliable data transfer rates between the processor and storage and a means to provide easier connectivity in support of client server applications juvenile court becomes newest customer after months of research planning and the collaborative efforts of and representatives of the superior court juvenile facility the juvenile facility came into scope with the enterprise effective at that time the team began a day transition period to fully move the facility to the enterprise network there are two separate networks located at the

action center application implementation is well underway the vendor has begun implementation of the new application that will eventually replace the mayors action center mac expert advisor application miller from has created the oracle development database instance in support of this project and is in the process of creating a separate test database instance that will be used for training van of is working closely with the vendor to provide linkages to the infrastructure management system and the master address application will continue to support our customer on this very important project major technical improved infrastructure and processes last year requested the implementation of a wireless access system this project was designed to enable patrol officers and new recruits at the training academy the ability to securely login to our network via laptop computer while in their vehicles this means of network connection saves the officer the trouble of hauling inside all of his materials from his car finding a suitable computer in the district office to use and then potentially getting stuck in the office benefits of this project are that the officer is back out on the streets more quickly data is entered in a more timely fashion and the officer receives updates from his superiors more quickly the necessary hardware including antennas and access points have been installed at the building the training academy as well as the north south east and west district sites operated by this represents the first phase of implementing a wireless access system for and is to be followed by other locations in the near future improved server environment three servers were upgraded with more memory hard disk space and faster processor speeds this implementation will provide cost savings by using existing server hardware that will be used to enhance authentication services and application deployment through improved security measures web security was enhanced with the installation of a new switch in the secure web zone this zone is designated for web applications that require authentication using or require additional protection from public access this zone will also prevent any malicious public activity because services will be limited by the firewall which will be segregated by this switch since the start of we have seen seven major virus outbreaks that had very high distribution rates this activity has caused the security team to be very busy controlling viruses from entering the city network we have the latest virus protection and have been on top of the situation with protecting our environment the virus works by spoofing the address in the from field the email virus gateway protects us by removing the viruses from all attachments but will send the email message through after it removes the virus the security team does block all known subject lines that are known to carry the virus but some of the viruses will randomly create other subject lines which makes it hard to block the message itself we have not seen any internal outbreaks or know of any infected machines which we continue to monitor during
