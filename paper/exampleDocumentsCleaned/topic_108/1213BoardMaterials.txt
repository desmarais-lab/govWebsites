users was based upon the list of those users who submitted security requests to receive access to this user list was later revised downward to after was able to obtain a list of those users who had actually installed the application then the list was reduced again to after removing users who are no longer employed after verifying user information prepared an online survey to solicit users input the survey was launched on and closed on the survey was sent to users responses were received type document short title indicated that they use indicated they do not inactive users active users

as a marketing tool for economic development projects and proposals uses in addition to the oblique photography usage mentioned above there are a variety of uses for traditional photography within the city county enterprise the is most commonly used as a backdrop for the other available layers more importantly though the photography allows these additional uses the photography is a source for updates existing layers such as buildings roads streams fences sidewalks etc are compared to the photos and updated based upon changes that are clearly visible utilizes the photography to verify solid waste pickup locations and to search for new homes that are receiving service but are not being billed this was done for the first time in and resulted in a increase in annual revenues staff that deal with the public including zoning inspectors planners hearing officers and people involved in the courts will use the archived photos to determine the time frame that a feature appeared for instance a property owner might be cited for an outbuilding and claim that it has been there long enough to be grandfathered the photo archive helps to prove or disprove such claims staff also use the latest vintage photography to create land use plans determining existing and historical land use are important aspects of the planning current and historical aerial photos are used by the assessors to provide field staff with comparative measurements of improvements and natural features pavement lakes etc verification of an improvements existence during a particular tax year and verification of legal descriptions type document short title summary the survey results indicate significant time savings per staff person on an annual basis based on a sample of users who responded to the survey users reported time savings of approximately man hours per year if we apply the same percentage to the entire users population then the projected time savings are approximately hours per year using an average hourly wage of hour per employee as a conservative estimate the projected cost savings will be per year this does not take into consideration all other indirect benefits and time savings from using spatial data derived from also it does not measure the value of improving the quality of service to citizens from using technology based on this analysis feels that the product adds a

against the decision criteria duplicate the evaluation process and including the question after for each solution being considered provide a solution identifier for each solution a or and a brief title in short solution title to easily identify each solution only one solution be considered description of solution in the box provide a brief description of the solution being considered the description should include enough detail to provide a clear understanding of what the solution will do and differentiate it from the other solutions being considered also describe how this solution will resolve the business problem defined in section decision criteria the decision criteria below are recommended for evaluation of each potential solution additional criteria be added when needed it is essential that all solutions be evaluated against the same set of criteria a business process impact describe how the potential solution will impact the current business processes and what degree of organizational change and stakeholder resistance is anticipated technical feasibility describe any special considerations such as technical experience required for project team members also describe the level of technical complexity associated with the solution maturity of solution describe the level of technical maturity for the potential solution the description should address how technically proven the potential solution is for example is the solution a recent innovation has it fully matured is it nearing obsolescence are service and expertise readily available to support the potential technical solution resources estimate estimate all the resources required to implement the solution resources include personnel facilities customer support equipment and any other resources needed to implement the solution constraints impact describe how well the solution fits within the identified constraints in section specifically address any time or schedule constraints answer yes or no to the question based upon decision criteria is the potential solution a viable solution if yes continue to section solution analysis part ii if no discard solution solutions analysis part ii only if a potential solution remains viable after analysis of the criteria in above perform a cost benefit analysis for the solution and calculate return on investment project management guideline provides additional detail on cost benefit analysis and return on investment duplicate the solutions analysis part ii for each viable solution remember to enter in the unique solution identifier and brief title in short solution title for each solution cost benefit analysis summary present a summary of cost benefit analysis for this solution see the project management guideline for instructions on cost benefit return on investment summary present a summary of the estimated value of the solution in terms of an investment there are several ways to calculate return on investment any are acceptable but the same method must be used for all solutions analyzed see the project management guideline provides instructions on return on investment calculations comparison of solutions enter the unique solution identifier in boxes that are shaded based on the analysis performed rate how each solution measured up against the decision criteria used for the analysis a recommended rating scale is very poor poor fair good very good if a decision criterion is more important than others weights be assigned to each criterion to reflect the level of importance once the ratings for all the solutions are complete compare and contrast the analysis and ratings for each of the solutions to the others identify the solution that best satisfies the previously reviewed criteria summarize the results and identify the solution that best satisfies the decision criteria many methods be used but the weighted matrix evaluation table is recommended see project initiation section of the project management guideline to provide additional detail on comparing solutions using the weighted matrix evaluation table preliminary recommendation describe the recommended solution and provide a summary of the rationale for selecting it recommended solution specify the solution selected based on the analysis use the description previously provided in section of this document enter in the unique solution identifier and title of the recommended solution in the appropriate areas recommended solution justification explain how and why the solution was chosen over the other solutions considered if more

the strategic initiatives or issues identified in the or agency strategic plan every business objective must relate to at least one strategic initiative or issue and every initiative or issue cited must relate to at least one project business objective or agency strategic plan critical issues project business objectives core business activity impacted core business activities are agency defined processes that produce the primary products and services or support their production list the core business activities impacted by the project and identify the impact agency core business activity impact on core business activity constraints constraints are items that by their nature restrict choice identify constraints that will influence the selection of a solution to resolve the business problem constraints can include but are not limited to time funding personnel facilities and management limitations preliminary project description provide a preliminary description of the project approach the customers served and expected benefits the approach is the overall strategy for solving the business problem the preliminary project description is derived from the project description statement and section project purpose this description establishes the framework for identifying potential solutions solutions analysis part i describe each potentially viable solution and evaluate the solution against the decision criteria described below in duplicate the evaluation process for each solution being considered only one solution proposed description of solution provide an identifier and a brief title of the potential solution the description should include enough detail to provide a clear understanding of the solution and should differentiate it from the other potential solutions also describe how the solution will resolve the business problem defined in section of this document solution identifier short solution solution description and detail decision criteria the following decision criteria are recommended for evaluation of each potential solution all potential solutions must be evaluated against the same set of decision criteria additional decision criteria be used if needed a business process impact describe how the potential solution will impact current business processes and the degree of organizational change and stakeholder resistance anticipated technical feasibility describe any special technical considerations that would be required to implement the potential solution such as technical experience required for project team members also describe the level of technical complexity of the solution maturity of solution describe the level of technical maturity for the potential solution the description should address questions such as is the potential solution technically proven or a recent innovation has the technology solution being proposed fully matured is it nearing obsolescence are services and expertise required to support the potential technical solution readily available resource estimate estimate all the resources required to implement the solution resources include personnel facilities customer support equipment and any other resources needed to implement the project team customer support software tools other be specific funds available provide the amount of funding identified for each source category in the tables below provide clear and specific reference for the source of funding within the categories listed funding source specific fund cite grant or budget line number fund constraints impact describe how the solution fits within the constraints identified in section specifically address any time or schedule constraints based on decision criteria is the potential solutions a viable solutions if yes continue to section solutions analysis part ii if no discard solution solutions analysis part ii solution has been proven viable perform a cost benefit analysis for the solution and calculate the return on investment provide a summary of the results below a cost benefit analysis and return on investment must be performed for each viable solution duplicate solutions analysis part ii section for each solution being considered solution identifier short solution cost benefit analysis summary summarize the results of the cost benefit analysis for this solution see the project management guideline for information on how to perform a cost benefit analysis return on investment summary summarize the estimated return achieved as a result of the investment made and explain the method used there are several ways to calculate any method is acceptable but the same method must be used for each solution analyzed see the project management guideline for instructions on return on investment calculations comparison of solutions based on the analysis performed rate how each solution measured up against each decision criterion a recommended rating scale is very poor poor fair good very good compare the rating results to determine which solution to recommend enter in the solution identifier in boxes that are shaded decision criteria business process impact technical feasibility maturity of solution resources required constraints impact cost benefit analysis return on investment total score preliminary recommendation describe the recommended solution and provide a summary of the rationale for selecting it recommended solution specify the recommended solution selected as a result of the analysis use the description previously provided in section of this document solution identifier short solution recommended solution justification if more than one solution was evaluated explain why the recommended solution was chosen over the other solutions considered decision document the project sponsors or designated agency managers decision regarding the recommended solution if the recommended solution is accepted a project proposal is developed accepted rejected on hold requesting more information approved by chief information officer information services agency county name approved by agency department head name

to begin the phase major project updates statewide voter registration in was successfully implemented in county during the week of all counties have implemented in is operating on an integrated statewide system internet capacity at the desktop is no longer an issue end user response time remains an issue latest samples show that it takes from minutes to minutes to complete a voter registration compared to an average of minute in the old system major project updates statewide voter registration county has volunteered to serve on the improvement requirements county has encountered very few problems due to our robust and accurate data a new version of in is tentatively scheduled for implementation beginning within the next few weeks registrations entered at branches
