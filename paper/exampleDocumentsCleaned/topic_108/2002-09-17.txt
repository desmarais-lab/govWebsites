complete the required changes to tax bill generation etc to meet the deadlines for tax bills this is being worked through with and the affected customers another item of interest is about our dell standard if you will remember we adopted a new standard of dell desktop and laptop equipment last year about this time i asked for figures to see what has occurred during that time and thought the figures should be shared with you since we have purchased dell desktop units and dell notebook units for comparison purposes we looked at the standard dell price and the standard price before the change for desktops this is and for notebooks the price decrease is per unit so our total savings from this new program equates to approximately additionally our technicians have been pleased with the equipment from an installation and support direction as a side note to the dell standard information you are aware that dell offered an employee purchase program to all staff they went beyond their normal offering of an additional discount from their line of products to actually offering the same business line machines and prices as we order for our offices the only difference is the employee pays shipping charges this has been a significant benefit for our employees to date employees have purchased machines for if we use similar savings number as above our employees have saved approximately i actually believe these saving are understated as many employees upgraded their systems which would then show larger savings dell has told us that is their number one program in place

meetings regarding technology within local government we will provide a link on that calendar that provides our documentation for the meetings agenda minutes handouts etc the exhibit calendar also allows for automatic reminders a preset number of days before a meeting and can send updates if any changes occur to the calendar we think this will provide improved information to interested parties
