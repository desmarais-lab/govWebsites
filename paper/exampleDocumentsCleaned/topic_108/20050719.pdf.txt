contractual requirements this month are being reported of these are meeting contractual requirements more are being reported in service area the hp and capabilities should report about more but these tools have not been implemented the improvement plan was successful in that more of the unreported in are now being reported for the first time from this data a benchmark has been established for that area so that it will be possible to focus on performance improvement however it cannot be assumed that those not reported are being met therefore at this point officially only of the are attained performance numbers have remained stagnant while there was slight improvement in attainment from last month from to there is a concern that there are significant underlying issues not being in a root cause analysis was requested by to determine if the new tools being used in delivering services could be a factor in the poor attainment per this request the leadership team and technical team were brought to to understand the issues complete the report and begin remediation plans the team in conjunction with identified issues operations worked with during the month to prioritize and escalate the infrastructure projects in the queue the backlog of infrastructure projects is the result of internal staff being dedicated to milestone deliverables and training on the new tools being implemented at the request of two new project managers have joined and are charged with working on this project backlog has taken charge of prioritizing the backlog for in an effort to help major ball stated that a session is scheduled for to assist banning and the team to identifying what issues customer have and improve service ms stated that regarding the milestones the good news is there has been focus on getting them complete through stated that one measure provides information here and now on performance new user accounts and the percent established within business days he stated that he believed the figure given was not close to meeting the requirement and asked if was related to the infrastructure project backlog in some way ms replied that she believes it is a staffing issue agreed he stated that had a similar service level but had twice the staff has acknowledged that staffing is an issue the help desk manager has committed to supplementing the security staff with help desk staff asked if the level of severity escalates as the response time elapses stated it is not handled that way now currently severity does not escalate however it could in the future asked for characterization of the interface and level of collaboration between ms stated that it has been difficult in the past few months in general there have been some communication issues and frustration over staffing issues ms enders asked for a representative from to give their perspective on how they think things are going stated that since he became interim program manager in he has tried to open up communication he is working largely with the same staff that worked here in years prior with and when the contract compliance issues surfaced looked for differences in staffing differences in resources differences in leadership in he recommended move forward with filling the vacancies and that other changes can lead to a more collaborative environment also gave an update on the status of a permanent site director two candidates are being interviewed by management this week in those two candidates will be here the following week to meet with the new the selection can be made in the next couple weeks has committed to staying on for one month during the crossover then he will be available as needed requested input from on the situation stated has started reporting an additional this month over the last month which is a significant increase they missed two which he believes was because they were late there are some that need tools implemented before they can be reported an example is the tool that allows for customer satisfaction reporting currently the reporting of customer satisfaction on ticket handling for all the service areas is missing that feature when implemented will cover about out of the missing sees good progress being made also remarked that the are best in class finally in months coming he stated that needs to work with on policy on security solid policy would help to facilitate the standards which will help narrow the scope of products which will ultimately result in more productivity it will also require less turnaround time to fix things plans to work with consulting group the next couple of months to work on establishing it policy he believes that will create a more effective work force ms enders asked about the backlog and plans to avoid getting behind in the future stated will be in catch up mode for another month or two he believes that once they get past with a number of milestones and a number of products they should be able to get out front policies and standards that set the direction to narrow the different varieties of laptops and desktops and several different varieties of software should be a priority if the focus could be narrowed the desktop support team and the help desk would be much more effective asked about his role in working with the and the customers he asked if these policies could have been recommended in asked if could have been more persistent with these policies or if was prevented in putting recommendations before the it board stated that needed to familiarize itself with the environment and see what policy was needed prior to making ms commented that one of the reasons the it board selected was that they were impressed with experience with the federal government the board was cognizant of the fact that county was one of the first local government contracts for the board believed that commitment to turn to this line of business would ensure stellar performance ms said she has been told there has been a reorganization within since the time of the selection she was interested to know the current commitment to the line of business she stated it is alarming that there is still not a permanent program manager she appreciates is in catch up mode but the are the very least the board expects out of the contract and the enterprises business is starting to suffer responded that there is still corporate commitment to the whole line of business reorganized to enable that knows that until they have a satisfied customer here the likelihood of pursuing additional contracts and getting good references is low judge miller asked if the it board is enforcing contractual penalties and if not why not he continued that when the court system is nickel and indigent people for or for public defender costs it seems that when there is an enforceable contract in place that calls for certain penalties the board ought to be enforcing them he thought the backlog would get resolved once the penalties are applied he added he did not know what the status of that enforcement has been in the past commented the it board still has that option it was or early when the it board first became aware of the shortcomings on the service level agreements enforcing penalties was left as an option the board discussed at an earlier meeting that they would like to see some improvements in moving toward reaching those agreements the boards time frame was by the point of the contract was to have a partnership believes that those are usually good for the city and a natural tension has to be maintained stated he has not made a recommendation to push for enforcing the penalties that is a decision the it board should make commented that he would like a public commitment from to work with banning in the next days to bring any policies needed forward to the it board in he suggested deferring to banning regarding the level of cooperation that he has seen at that point in time major ball stated he is both encouraged and disappointed at the same time he sees the improvement in the service levels and is encouraged to see such improvement in the reporting and achievement levels but is disappointed that it took the work of a consultant to bring that information to the board what major ball hopes to see is working with banning staff is very dedicated both in and and want to see good delivery of services he hopes to see the management of the two agencies working together to not just meet because some one is looking but to look at good business practices he is encouraged to see improvement but wants to see a change in philosophy stated one of the points of learning from the search and interview process was the need for a greater degree of clarity and a strategic plan commented that he did not know if the contract had mandatory or negotiable penalties but he thought that by the next meeting in the it board can take a stand on whether the penalties are enforced asked for a recommendation from banning in days based on cooperation and progress made in the next days financial update ms presented the financial report including the budget comparison of to the revenues are on track at she stated a concern regarding application maintenance based on the trend it run over budget she suggested better managing some of the contracts and asked to come forward and the board members individually thanked him for his service thanked the board and wished them well with the new ms made a few comments on the report pointing out that the team has been very busy that the standards committee should be bringing a few new standards forward shortly and that has been increasing revenue with new applications such as the online pet adoption for animal care control wanted to clarify to the it board that the treasurers office employees referenced as being totally dedicated to this task in the report actually have additional duties that they perform advised the it board on the six contracts for signature and that with the selection and approval of a new the authority to sign contracts would be reinstated therefore the only contract that needs formal approval at the meeting is resolution a motion was made to approve resolution the motion was seconded and passed unanimously addressed the it board and introduced his student interns he stated

county used the system averaging searches per month there was a total of inquiries for and because the clerk was absent and expressed an interest in all the access falling under one central area the committee was not aware of whether there was any movement to organize their access requests therefore land made a motion to continue these two temporary accounts on a month to month basis until such time as can report some progress with motion was seconded by and unanimously approved reports laura reported is testing with the division of compliance for property owner permits they will be going live at the end of this month there was an expansion of to include two more township schools and is working with the treasurer on bulk property records laura distributed some of the various marketing pieces designed for city and county agencies during the past year waiver request from the this request was discussed by the review committee and requested the request specify specific agents for access to the records he moved to approve the request subject to furnishing three specific staff to have logins and subject to custodial approval of and the clerk motion was seconded by and unanimously contract review committee report and discussion reported on the letter he received from interactive in response to his request to grant the a one year extension to the agreement rather than a three year extension as currently provided in the contract laura indicated the current model has served the well for the past ten years from a cost avoidance cost savings perspective in the division of compliance there were some real cost savings in using a approach she indicated interactive welcomes competition in an but it is their perspective there will be rework for about of the applications during the next year because of the project and the new property records and there would be no opportunity for them to recoup their costs in one year for the efforts that will be needed to rewrite applications the purpose of asking for the three year extension was to have more opportunity to recoup investment in all the changes needed in the next year chuck white asked if interactive would grant a one month extension of time through st to make whatever decision is necessary about a contract extension or intent to issue an said the extension of time would be amendment but easy to accomplish the committee discussed the if interactive loses the state portal which will go out for bid later this year reported there have been plans to move the applications under the infrastructure but this is not an easy effort since there are about applications the state of has a time and materials contract in an environment geared towards a partnership candy said she has seen it not work well and felt this approach would destroy their success with the might not want to undertake a time and material model also chuck white asked about operating costs and candy explained they pay for a set staff and sometimes they work hours per week while other times they work longer if something breaks candy said the contract with the state is through and they are getting a one year extension through of the state is going for an and will make a decision by of next year whether to continue the contract if the agrees to a three year extension and interactive loses the state business where does that leave the the committee emphasized this makes them feel uncomfortable candy said if we are no longer happy with should they lose the state business we will have the right to cancel our contract we can pursue other options too as this is not an exclusive contract made a motion to request prepare the material to amend the current enhanced access agreement to allow a thirty day extension to the notification for consideration and signature by the motion was seconded and unanimously approved the review committee decided to hold another meeting on th to further discuss the proposal from interactive and the possibilities of releasing an to meet the needs of the portal within the remaining months of will schedule the afternoon meeting as peoples schedules permit there being no further business the meeting was adjourned at pm enhanced access review committee room pm in attendance chuck white representing the controllers office land representing the county treasurer the county auditor representing the department of metropolitan development from the information services agency price representing the township assessors the county clerk and from the office of corporation counsel also present cluck from the department of public works chuck white called the meeting to order at pm he recapped the background on the subject of the meeting the contract this contract is scheduled to expire at the end of and the must give six months notice of their intentions to interactive there was a contract review committee appointed earlier in the year and in the committee members changed and began actively working on this issue the recommendation was we request a one year extension with the current provider to give the sufficient time to prepare an or was directed to present this option to the provider just before the rd meeting received a letter from interactive and shared it with the committee ii indicated they had been performing up to the expectations of the contract and felt they were good partners and offered only a three year extension for various reasons after length discussion at the last meeting the committee learned the access contract with the state was expiring in of this year and the state was planning to do an interactive agreed to give the state a one year extension indicated there is a strong recommendation from the it board to look at an process chuck said since we have not taken any action to renew or terminate the contract at this point we requested the provider grant a thirty day extension of time by amendment to allow the to figure out what the next steps would be said he already drafted an extension request expressed at the prior meeting he did not believe it would be physically possible to prepare a quality select a different service and transition applications within the remaining time this year also emphasized the two major application rewrites that will happen in the next year and offered an alternative suggestion to renegotiate and reduce the revenue sharing agreement there followed discussions of how to change the model expressed a concern to chuck white about why we are charging rates to certain individuals said she has a concern of renewing the contract for three years without going out to bid explained the contract requires they provide twelve months of transition assistance until the end
