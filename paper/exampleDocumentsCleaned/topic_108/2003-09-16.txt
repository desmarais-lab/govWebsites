appliances which are specially designed servers to run checkpoint firewall the primary firewall is used in production and is protecting the network the secondary firewall is used for testing and as a back up both the firewall appliances were upgraded to the new version called checkpoint with enhanced security intelligence the upgrade benefits will provide new application layer intelligence which will better help secure web applications improved security functions improved application administration new authorization process which will allow the network administrator to control who uses access the worm which began at approximately pm on specifically targeted windows operating systems newer than with an identified vulnerability and other virus vendors did not have a signature update file to block the virus from infecting windows computers at the time of the attack the successful containment of the worm helped minimize the impact of the virus to a limited amount of desktop computers all servers had been updated with the latest operating system patches and were thus not vulnerable while it is impossible to determine the exact number of devices that were impacted it appears that the number is in the range of devices approximately devices were actually reported to the corrective action was applied immediately to the network filters to limit the propagation of the virus this was followed by the distribution of the two application object templates first fixing the vulnerability and second fixing the registry entries along with the distribution of the updated file the containment of the mass emailing worm was blocked by using the gateway that was purchased less than a year ago this software scans all incoming email for viruses and has the ability to block subject lines since the outbreak on th over infected emails have been blocked from entering employees mailboxes disaster recovery test in early performed a disaster recovery test at the facilities in and the
