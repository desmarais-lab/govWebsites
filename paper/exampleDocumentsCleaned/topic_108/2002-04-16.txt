technology sourcing discussion continued discussions regarding the contract information was distributed to the board members concerning new options for the costs of extending the contract based on it board comments new figures were developed attempts have been made to level out the increases across the extension periods also another set of options were developed removing four application development from the new pool of hours as discussed at the last meeting asked the board what the next steps were to arrive at a resolution for moving forward ms voiced her concern with the cost increases shown in the extensions compared to the increase in the county budgets stated that cuts could be made in the amendment to adhere to the tight constraints of the budget but that the leadership needs to define what needs to be cut he also cautioned it would be important that the administrations be notified of the cuts being made in technology due to the curtailing of the budget suggested addressing the two caucuses to determine if the costs presented for the extensions are feasible cuts in services will occur only if the council believes a seven percent increase over a period of three years is not possible asked to summarize the discussions from the last meeting a sheet reflecting new cost options was distributed and people addressed the board the group that has been assisting us in this process and lee the account executive for shared with the board perspective on the renewal process based on his staffs quick review the projected costs are believed to be within the expected range of other competitive vendors and perhaps slightly below market he stated the only way to get a true test regarding cost would be to go out to market he shared with the board that the overall essence of the current contract is a facilities management type of agreement he believes that based on the uncertainty of the future it needs the best solution is the recommended extension of the contract to allow time to better identify and prioritize the it direction clearly defining these needs will allow for a better position to get the leverage needed when going out to market and providing an opportunity to take this sourcing arrangement to a higher level without a clearly defined plan for future it direction believed local government was not in the position to gain the benefits from the cost and efforts of a full process although he feels the has a good beginning to its visions he stated it would take at least months to establish an that would result in more than a facilities management agreement lee stressed the key points of the amendment he felt were critical to the continuing improvement of services he also commented on the quality of his staff and that is very interested in continuing to do business with the in response to original question stated his goal is to complete the discussions and take action at the next it board meeting scheduled for th reported staff is actively working with local staff and the state supreme court staff reviewing the responses to the state public notice of contracting opportunity for a new statewide courts application at its recent meeting the it team approved a new standard of as the software for local government replacing windows was also approved as the new desktop standard full implementation will begin st with some initial departments who will be using it on a limited basis until then this delayed implementation allows for appropriate technician and help desk staff training as well as procedure development reported on the progress of the court installation on was prepared to install the computers but a shipping issue occurred resulting in a delay in receiving the machines has reconfigured their plans to accommodate the delay and plan to start installation the week of th the continues with departments remaining initial issues have been worked through and anticipates completing the by mid as commented on the most recent months customer service card responses return rates continue to be lower than we would like but in general the ratings continue to come in at a very good level voiced his concern with the apparent difference between the negative statements he heard from users and the positive reports from the cards he stated the conflict between the two data points needs to be reconciled and suggested that a different method need to be considered to insure accurate service responses replied is calling the individuals who send a negative response for further information the next scheduled meeting is in room exhibit resolution board resolution authorizing the chief information officer to finalize negotiations and execute an amendment extending the information technology operating agreement between and the city of and county whereas the city of and county acting through its information technology board has entered into an information technology operating agreement with software and resource management corporation now affiliated computer services inc and whereas the term of the information technology operating agreement is scheduled to expire on and whereas information technology operating agreement provides for extension of the agreement for up to three additional years and whereas the chief information officer is negotiating an amendment

and oracle corporation whereas oracle is the enterprise standard for database services and whereas the previous enterprise wide software license and services agreement and the municipal payment plan agreement with oracle corporation was approved by the it board on and whereas the current oracle structure is based on processor power and will expire in whereas the city of county has a need for additional capacity whereas oracle has offered a new pricing model based on numbers of processors which includes reduced maintenance costs if an agreement is signed before the end of authorizes the chief information officer to finalize and approve an agreement between the city of county and oracle corporation for the enterprise wide software license and services agreement and municipal payment plan for an amount not to exceed oracle proposal the and oracle corporation have a longstanding relationship covering oracle database licenses oracle is currently the enterprise standard for our database services our current oracle contract structure is based on processor power the current software license and services agreement with oracle was approved by the it board on we have been reviewing our options with regards to the existing licenses and our growing need for oracle capacity our servers that utilize these database licenses are getting older and will be upgraded in the near term we also will soon need to deploy some additional capacity both of these issues have economic impact to oracle has changed its license model and is offering incentives to move to the new model has worked with oracle corporation to develop an updated software and services agreement that allows us to grow in processing power while at the same time keep control of our costs is proposing a new year agreement with oracle that converts our existing licenses to processor licenses adds named user licenses and increases our number of processors to this agreement also protects us from maintenance cost increases for the duration of the agreement below is in summary of the transaction being proposed processors processors and named users term interest rate reasoning reduces and freezes maintenance costs reduces interest rate provides needed capacity for growth maintains growth within given cash flow exhibit vision presentation for the it board what are we asking for improved technology new

consulting needs applications development needs data and systems needs appendices appendix a list of resources appendix request for qualifications draft planning document draft draft draft since the of county has recognized the benefits of and invested in geographic information systems technology the effort has grown from the creation of the consortium to the development of staff in individual departments to pooling resources into a common area to contracting with a consultant to provide direction and resources for efforts to most recently bringing staff into a division of the information services agency during this time has become widely recognized as a valuable information technology it tool for local government the division has matured along with the profession while initially required expensive equipment and intensive training current applications run on standard desktop computers with minimal training over time the role of the staff has changed from analysis to providing the tools and support that allows department staff and the public to do analysis the division proposes a new structure and methodology shifting strategic planning and management from the outside consultant to internal management under the proposed plan responsibility for directing and managing services will rest with the division with the current contract for consulting services expiring this year the division has the opportunity to take the lead role in providing services to staff and the public while supplementing its resources with outside vendors the division will consist of three operational units business consulting applications development and data and systems business consulting will be the user interface of the division this group will provide the direct user contact in the area of needs analysis business process training and support applications development will be responsible for the design development testing and maintenance of applications and tools data and systems will provide and maintain the data and underlying system architecture upon which all of the depends all three groups will work closely together to ensure that the needs of the users are met efficiently and promptly the division recognizes that the volume of work exceeds what internal staff can accomplish contracting for specialized skill sets and additional resources will allow the division to concentrate on strategic direction knowledge of business operations and project management draft planning document draft draft draft introduction one picture is worth more than ten thousand words proverb stands for geographic information systems basically allows users to combine information or data collected in a database with address or spatial information to visually represent the data on a map the layering of information in the form of a map creates a picture of the area of interest the picture changes depending on what information is layered together examples environmental data layering permitting data and environmental data together show what pollutants are affecting which areas and who is generating them crime data layering permitting data and crime data together show what kinds of crimes occur in an area and if there is a particularly high crime area where it is structures data layering infrastructure data together shows where roads streets rivers bridges and a multitude of other utility pathways are located data layering political boundary information with a information shows the public who their political representatives are and where they can exercise their democratic right to vote allows the to combine data with maps to quickly create a picture of the situation in a particular area that would take longer or never become evident with traditional reports or queries from these pictures managers can make decisions based on the information and the patterns that emerge the public can make better decisions for their family and community and businesses can make more effective decisions for their businesses draft planning document draft draft draft background the startup costs for were significant because the equipment and systems were highly specialized project began in the individual departments because of the need to more effectively manage property development streets and sewers and available funding birth of in recognizing the benefits for other entities and the continuing maintenance costs the put together a consortium called mapping and geographic infrastructure system an ordinance solidified the consortium of local government utilities and to collect and provide county land based data and aerial photography the initial million investment represents one of the first attempts for any local government nation wide to implement an integrated continues to develop and maintain the base map as the foundation for all of data layers consolidation of resources in staff from various city departments and county agencies were pulled together to pool their resources the division also contracted with a consulting company now to provide planning project management and coordination for services through this combination of government and contract staff works together to provide applications data maintenance and user support for the enterprise in the division of the information services agency was created accomplishments to date has become an enterprise tool accessible to all users with over installations across local government address information has been standardized and reformatted to become the foundation for linking information to a map data viewer allows novice and veteran users to access the most common data layers and to create maps with minimal training general viewer allows anyone to access information over the internet without training draft planning document draft draft draft changing times the last decade has seen remarkable changes in technology costs have continued to decrease technologies have improved as a result better tools are emerging for management and is no exception lower costs in the past a special more powerful computer was needed to run or other software had to be installed on the users computer and special training was needed to use the software now the standard computer is sufficient to run while the application allows users to view geographic information over the internet these advancements have decreased costs in hardware software and training for every city department and county agency they have also allowed the division to provide services to an increasing number of users the net effect of these improvements has decreased the per user cost of see figure costs users introduction of intro of introduction of approx of users technology costs per user users draft planning document draft draft draft the technology itself decreases the cost of storage as it is being used increasingly as a data integration tool when data is integrated redundant data no longer needs to be stored in multiple locations data maintenance costs are also decreasing for example the cost of aerial photography has decreased from in to in the aerial photography is used for updates and allows the data to be updated more frequently at a lower cost technology improvements over the years tools have improved for all levels of users in the beginning users plotted lines with then users work was split between and now one application merges the tools available in and for heavy users however many users can use over the web to get the information that they need another technology improvement for has been the perpetual increases in processing speed which improves the computer resolution of aerial photographs to match the actual resolution of the photograph recently the aerial photography resolution has improved from foot pixels to inch pixels and users will be able to see this difference in resolution with existing computers also color aerial photography is becoming more affordable color aerial photographs greatly assist the update work the technology improvements that are helping with other applications also assist users the hardware needed to run is smaller in size and faster to respond state of the county program provides services to many individuals currently the system maintains desktop users layers of data master address database address information web mapping capabilities general viewer law enforcement incident viewer locator route map polling place locator government profile a user friendly mapping interface draft planning document draft draft draft eight custom applications support for the city of integrated permitting system solid waste automated vehicle location pilot the division has developed the foundation for future use of spatially enabled technologies it continues to provide services to an expanded audience through development of and internet applications that make data and analysis tools available to all staff and the public its challenge will be enhancing the quality of information delivered to users in a fast reliable and fashion expectations of the public will drive future enhancements the division strives to stay on the leading edge of technology to deliver high quality spatial systems to the program has come a long way since the database has more than layers of data that assist staff in doing their job and managers in making decisions although these data layers will be maintained and increased is continuing to evolve of the data collected by local governments is related to addresses or parcel numbers adding and using those data layers will increase the possibilities for creating applications that can answer questions provide analysis and educate the public on issues relevant to their communities the future of is moving beyond mere data collection and compilation to applying that data to our business processes draft planning document draft draft draft future vision mission to provide employees and the public with spatial information and the tools to make informed decisions will define and control the strategic direction of information and technology for county be the hub of spatial information throughout government develop tools for improving customer service the ability to expedite responses to inquiries and complaints identify common organizational objectives and opportunities establish a computing environment where executives management and staff can easily access and manipulate data allowing for more informed improve departmental and coordination through integration of new and existing systems and reduce the cost of doing business the division spent some time reviewing the progress of the last six years and looking at the future opportunities in figure depicts the resource allocation changes over the years and what is envisioned for the future since the knowledge base has expanded the decision was made to reorganize the division and to recommend changes in the vendor relationship to align with the future vision and to strengthen the divisions resources this will continue to give the division the ability to leverage itself for the enterprise while maintaining direct control over appropriate resources data systems program business consulting resources per operational area the division will now consist of three operational units business consulting applications development and data and systems these operational units were chosen to strengthen strategic direction and to provide a holistic view of throughout the enterprise working hand in hand draft planning document draft draft draft with each other will allow all three units to maintain an appropriate awareness of the progress and opportunities created by each project this shift will allow the division to develop a longterm sustainable model for providing services business consulting business consulting is the user interface with the division where relationships with current users are strengthened and new relationships are cultivated business consultants will work closely with senior planners and staff to understand the users business unit and to explain the flexibility and possibilities with to increase the units productivity currently many of these skills are provided by outside consultants however to retain the knowledge gained through projects the division will be working more closely with its users business consulting will be focusing on projects business consultants will provide review and analysis of business units processes to determine which alternatives are best when applications are necessary the business consultants will work with the applications development staff to develop a detailed requirements document for the project training and support training and support are functions that keep the division with the current users the business consultants will concentrate on enhancing the users skills such as map making data scrubbing or implementing productivity tools and assisting users with their technical concerns the vendor will handle routine services such as standard software installation and trouble calls communication the division will deliver user services through an enhanced enterprise approach resources will be leveraged for all enterprise users the foundation of the enterprise approach is the enhanced web site an enterprise communication tool that provides information about project status training web tools and a method to get feedback from users research and development the business consultants will take the lead in researching existing and future technologies integrating wireless document management and global positioning system technologies tremendously benefit the enterprise applications development application development will be responsible for the design development testing documentation and maintenance of desktop and applications and tools the applications development staff will establish the software architecture in conjunction with data and systems staff the applications development analysts will work with the business consultants to identify application needs and priorities and determine application requirements draft planning document draft draft draft the applications development staff will complete smaller projects however for most new applications contract personnel will provide the technical resources to design and code applications as well as develop the applications help documentation and training materials the applications development analysts will work closely with contract personnel and clients to ensure that client needs are clearly understood and met additionally the analysts will test applications to validate requirements applications development will run the change control board the change control board will review all applications on an annual basis the reviews will help determine if an application should be enhanced or modified to meet the clients continuing needs or if the application is obsolete the change control board will prioritize any changes and work with contract personnel to implement them data and systems data and systems will primarily be responsible for providing the with fast reliable and state of the art access to the most current and accurate data this will be accomplished through several areas of focus data layer management and delivery key data layer maintenance data creation and enhancement metadata data standards enforcement data update process documentation hardware and software architecture planning data and systems will work with the rest of the division to ensure that data requirements are met in general and for applications in development the data advisory board will establish data standards enhancement priorities and distribution guidelines the division is currently seeking representatives from the user community to comprise the board and begin work data and systems staff will continue to maintain key data layers such as street centerlines parcels and addresses these key layers form the basis for many city and county business processes examples include work order processing and permit issuance time sensitive require the updating of these key data layers on a daily basis in addition data systems will continue to perform updates and migration to new data models of certain departmental data sets such as the sanitary and storm sewers major enhancements to key data layers will be performed by vendors with lesser enhancements performed by temporary staff data and system will take the lead in coordinating with the consortium to provide access to annual aerial photography and layer updates data and systems will also advise the departments in their development and maintenance of their required data layers data and systems will deliver data layers and associated metadata to desktop applications and web based viewers data and systems will establish a draft planning document draft draft draft data architectural plan including data standards and a documented data update process and properly administer hardware and software environment to create a reliable data store each of these operational units will be responsible for program management documentation staff training and support where these skills do not exist they will be developed

upcoming upgrades to the enterprise for the new client and internet explorer attended the association of information and imaging management conference this is the national meeting regarding effective deployment of document management technology exhibit turner attended a business continuity conference in aimed towards improving our capabilities to respond to a disaster and to assist our customers plan for business resumption the planning staff started working with customers as the first steps of prioritizing development work and initial discussions for the budget forecast the planners and consultants are meeting with every department in and to score any pending projects those projects will be prioritized by the different function teams and finalized at the it team has joined our telecommunications division as a lead telecommunications analyst with over years experience in the telecommunications industry most recently with bank one continued working with and staff to correct ongoing problems occurring across the remote telephone environment we have a special swat team working directly with engineers to identify isolate and correct these issues we have seen significant improvement this month in resolving several lingering problems this process of review and correction will continue until we are satisfied that service is as it should be two new remote sites are coming online in early so significant focus has been on completing installation activities these sites are for the family advocacy center at rd and for the probation satellite office at rd a follow up audit has been conducted involving certain areas of the to determine if the recommended changes have been implemented and to verify the since the last audit the results will be published in and started a process to clean up our technology asset inventory in with the goal of having the updated information available for this budget cycle there are still approximately groups that have not completed their review to assist us in updating the inventory this will force us to have incomplete information as we move into the budget process has been notifying our customers of any past due charges this effort has been very successful in working with the customers on any past due issues as well as collecting outstanding revenue for the agency exhibit the budget questionnaire was developed on line and is ready for customers to input their information on the a memo will be distributed in to explain who should complete the questionnaire as well as information explaining to the customer that an business consultant will be contacting them to set up a meeting time to discuss their budget needs as well as their future strategic it requests capability to create customer enrolled email lists for specific departments was completed this month this allows citizens and internal users to subscribe to email lists through a web interface and via email this service was first deployed for our emergency management area and has received national recognition for the service a complete announcement will be sent out soon for all customers to be able to add such lists for their use the redesign of the township assessors website is nearing completion the budget questionnaire application was completed and delivered to administration deployed new web site for the animal care and control department an updated version of our polling place locator was put into production in it adds functionality to indicate if a party is registered and where they should vote this brings the web interface up to the same functionality as our application developed for the last election new color aerial photography has been flown the resulting digital is due to be received in was a month that seemed to be more focused on working the plans significant efforts are underway on many projects but we did not see as many completions of activities this month we have continued our activities within preparing for the budget process exhibit the main of the courts installation was completed with excellent results and ahead of schedule the cascade of the used equipment will keep staff occupied into i want to commend the and staff especially who led the project for their dedication in making this project a success once again we look forward to the opportunity to bring the discussion regarding the sourcing contract to a close i look forward to speaking with you at the next exhibit information technology monthly status report one of the more visible and important activities by during the month of was the initiation of the annual work plan process consultants and planners began the process of identifying potential it projects for the year this activity was initiated to coincide with the budget preparation process in addition all functional committees and the it team have received training relative to the project process that must take place prior to adoption of the annual work plan after a quantification and validation review of all current development service requests the sequencing of current projects and those to be addressed during can be accomplished management also spent considerable time focused on the major desktop deployment project for the county courts as of the end of the project was a week ahead of schedule and would soon be completed the and courts teams worked well together and the high level of cooperation and advanced planning paid off as over desktop computers were installed without significant interruption in services or degradation of courts business activities cards distributed cards returned ratings with being the highest level of satisfaction assistance received timely service friendly helpful accomplishments and other points of

of manages the program with a access database the database records data about the projects property owners parcels billings and payments this revised application has been put into production enterprise document management pilot project has completed all initial activities for the county assessor and the county assessors office have implemented all three applications initially designated for the pilot as part of that pilot project the auditor was also identified as a participant their forms have been set up and have been given to them for testing building upgrade project the circuit has been installed and activated and phase of the remodeling has been completed this circuit is for handling the additional bandwidth requirements due to relocation of users from the building to the building the server was upgraded to a gig connection and moved into the new computer room the new megabit per second data circuit to provides fold speed increases to the clients at this facility those who use the geographical information systems resources are very pleased as they now have the same application response time as those who are stationed within the network this link has also reduced the time needed to backup and restore the server at from hours to a few minutes vulnerability issues simple network management protocol is a language used by network equipment to allow them to monitor each other and produce data for performance and error reports this language protocol is used by every piece of network equipment in the world recently a security breach was discovered in this protocol all vendors quickly responded to this by providing patches for the software in the equipment all equipment on the network has been patched and tested remote access server the remote access server that allows employees to to access the network was replaced the old server only allowed up to connection speeds for those dialing in to the network the new remote access server operates at nearly twice the speed of the previous server providing improvement in response time to our clients it also provides for access authentication so that we monitor the use of services and the use of the regular login names and passwords thereby eliminating the need for separate accounts and maintaining two sets of configurations the new server is also better supported by the vendor at a less expensive maintenance cost implementation an additional of disk storage was installed into the storage area network cluster as well as an increase to cache memory and an update made to the controllers the result is improvement in performance of the as well as a significant increase in storage capacity this will allow for the additional departments to be integrated to the file service cluster to improve redundancy and major project highlights business support services all online are completed as defined and are being tested by the client the state revisions of the cost tables for commercial and residential properties still have not been received most of the batch processing programs have been modified and tested there are some requirements still being defined by the state and the applications will be modified and implements as they are defined the conversion program has been rerun several times with modifications from the township assessors to tailor the process to their specific requirements as identified in the system testing the schedule to move the system into production has been delayed by the township assessors until late due to the uncertainty of the state implementation schedule or possible delays the township assessors at the next arts meeting will decide this the yearly rollover for property and and the tax bill calculation and printing processes have been completed for this year focus alternative analysis the purpose of this project is to research other products that can be implemented that will replace the focus application with the same functionality the product needs to be user friendly and not cost prohibitive frees has been researching alternative software products on the internet as well as checking out which is the web version of focus met with porter from information builders for on to discuss the functions of continues to coordinate with our clients to see if there are alternative reporting capabilities if the data was readily available in an access database or similar format upgrade treasurers cashiering system the treasurers office needs to upgrade their current cashiering system as it is no longer supported by the vendor and uses outdated technology the new system will require an application server and space on the oracle server as well as new workstations that are connected to the network the vendor will install the application software needs to coordinate server resources oracle requirements configure application server and setup new workstations frees is waiting for the treasurers office to provide the proposal from the vendor to define the scope of this project and what role will have has written the sow for this project with the information that has been discussed to date the sow will be submitted to the financial functional group for and approval to proceed after approval to proceed a project definition will be written water quality database this project provides a new relational database application and reports for the tracking and monitoring of water quality data in addition sharing of data via web pages with mapping views is required initial meeting was held on to gain a clearer understanding of the scope of this request this is anticipated to be a large project we are seeking approval and direction from mike on whether wants to proceed with this project a review meeting is scheduled with on streaming video this project is for the cable agency for a solution to integrate streaming video services within the cable agency completed the project definition and presentation materials he then in turn presented the project to the clients on met with clients and mike on to review specific needs and to answer questions from this meeting the client will review funding alternatives to move this project forward for approval online time information system phase i user acceptance testing began the client has been very pleased with testing met with the auditors office to discuss how to identify changes on the vouchers will continue with phase ii development and will test using different color print and highlighting for voucher changes and will present examples to the auditors for review records management database client has been testing the application and and have met with client personnel to answer questions and discuss possible changes made minor changes and testing will continue through th also provided a user manual to the client enhancements to online election results client continues to perform acceptance testing completed some minor changes other changes identified will require a change form including the date for testing to be completed the clerk of the circuit court would like to have the ability to collect and maintain accurate information via the internet concerning campaign finances the current process for public access is for them to go to the clerks office and ask for a paper copy of the information they require the goal of this project is to provide this information via the internet enable the public use of all state forms and provide instructions for electronically extracting the information requested has been reviewing the requirement document to determine if the current requirements document meets our needs or if a change form will need to be completed request for qualification department of public works user testing has been proceeding with minor issues identified we are still on schedule to complete testing on report testing will begin on application is scheduled to be put in production on community development financial services application the dept of metropolitan development needs to monitor and track funds projects units contractors and activities for all neighborhood redevelopment in county using federal housing and urban development funding development and testing of this supporting application continues to proceed as scheduled reports were generated this past week for client review with minor changes identified the reports were well received by the client the clients reviewed the application and they were pleased with what was presented the project is still on schedule to move into the testing phase on the week of will be used to make any necessary fixes modify list server configuration jerry brown worked on creating the list server interface html pages and two scripts to handle mail from the internet and users html forms were created and the mailing list opportunity to the customer is now setup to allow configuration approval of submissions submissions subscribe
