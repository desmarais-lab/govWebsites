as well stated he and ms have been speaking with the customers and researching these issues further it projects transition planning and request for qualifications presented the vision to the board since and county recognized the benefits of and invested in geographic information systems technology the effort has grown from the creation of the consortium to the development of staff in individual departments to pooling resources into a common area to contracting with a consultant to provide direction and resources for efforts to most recently bringing the staff into the information services agency during this time became widely recognized as a valuable information technology tool for local government the division has matured along with the profession while initially required expensive equipment and intensive training current applications run on standard desktop computers with minimal training over time the role of the staff changed from primarily data handling and analysis to providing the tools and support that allows department staff and the public to utilize the division is implementing a new structure and methodology shifting strategic planning and oversight from the outside consultant to internal management under the new structure responsibility for directing and managing services will rest with the division with the current contract for consulting services expiring this year the division has the opportunity to take the lead in providing services to staff and the public while continuing to supplement its resources with outside vendors the division has been reorganized into three operational units business consulting applications development and data and systems business consulting is the user interface of the division this group provides the direct user contact in the area of needs analysis business process training and support applications development is responsible for the design development testing and maintenance of applications and tools data and systems maintains the data and underlying system architecture upon which all of the depends all three groups work closely together to ensure the needs of the users are met efficiently and promptly the division recognizes the volume of work exceeds what internal staff can accomplish contracting for specialized skill sets and additional resources will allow the division to concentrate on strategic direction knowledge of business operations and project management the division will publish a request for qualifications document to identify vendors qualified to support these three areas of responsibility this document will be published in the next month or so with the goal of having vendors selected and under contract by the end of ms commended the division on their mapping system and its many uses that prove to be extremely helpful for local government as well as the public her office relies heavily on services judge suggested coordinating mapping system information between various departments and agencies to provide a single geographic information site concurred and mentioned several initiatives underway resolution oracle proposal stated for the past four to six months has been reviewing the entire midrange server area oracle has been the database standard for many years but the licensing structure was recently changed the new licensing structure works to the advantage with the licenses equated by processors instead of power units oracle has translated the number of power units into processors which is equivalent to eight processor licenses the owns to gain discounts on cost proposes buying an additional eight processor licenses plus named user licenses these named users would have access from their workstation to any oracle database which is more cost effective than buying licenses for all users for smaller application services such as test servers is seeing growth in this area as more applications utilize oracle in the new agreement maintenance costs are reduced significantly the funding from ongoing cost savings can then be used to update hardware within the current budget ms motioned to approve resolution oracle proposal resolution contract renewal updated the board on the activities of the previous two months after many discussions the term appeared to be the best approach to accomplish changes that are necessary as well as sufficient time to see results this option will allow local government the most options in the decision process for the future the budget numbers for a term were ranging in the range the belief was local government did not have it within their budgets to support those percentages a range seemed to be more palatable for local government to afford with this in mind had to cut out certain components within amendment to bring the costs down summarized to the board those areas that were cut or revamped he believes the outcome is a workable combination of the lights on approach and the activities needed to improve technology reviewed the following components key delivery focus not want to discontinue the improvements being made within the applications area the number of people available for the to utilize is a pool of resources that can be used to determine it priorities for both development and maintenance this can change on an annual basis based on the work plan and projects if these resources are not used a credit is issued or the hours can be banked into the next year also included in this pool is the activity which is the programming efforts for those applications purchased or developed that are not working properly the final point concerning the applications pool is the option to always purchase more resources needed for projects this amendment has been reduced by to reduce costs point out to the board that cannot commit to being able to finish the services removed from the contract at the same rate in the future they would be subject to negotiation at that time specifically inquired if the needs more than included in the pool is the going to pay the same rate currently negotiated or will there be renegotiations of this rate answered the rate for additional has already been negotiated into the amendment a great deal of time has been spent on the applications area but additional time is needed to improve processes evaluate staff and ensure the right skill sets are in place to address the programming maintenance development and business needs has developed several programs to address the applications area business consulting pool the business consultant is the liaison between the technical staff and the user departments they are the advocate for computing within the department and become the departments link back to technology they help to identify systems projects equipment solutions to business needs and become the advocate for the departments it solutions stronger relationships between and the consultants have been formed because of the addition of these business consultants within the last year this component is formalized within amendment if all of the resources within the business consulting pool have not been used they also can be credited or banked improvements giant strides have been made within the desktop support area area and overall customer service area wants to continue to improve this area the amendment continues to include significant focus on improvements in this area financial components the new amendment fixes costs for this year and the two years following a credit was identified for an shortfall in this amount has been decreased from the original proposal to the penalties and incentives portion of the contract was also renegotiated the total amount of penalties was reduced to month and the incentives were reduced to month the individual penalties and assessments for specific requirements did not get reduced another portion previously discussed is the shared savings between and the if or identify savings to provide technology for less will share in that savings with the the item suggesting research into a remote data center was also retained should the find moving the mainframe operations to an regional data center an attractive cost option an analysis is being done currently regarding the possibility of moving some of the processing into a remote facility thereby saving significant costs to the a proposal for consideration will be presented if the analysis indicates advantages performance measurement this component is key to be able to report against the and performance the reporting criteria were developed with the help of recommendations modifications eliminations the assessment of all legacy applications has been removed along with a remote security assessment process and a detailed assessment of the security environment has removed them as far as outside support costs are concerned but will make an effort to accomplish some of the assessments with internal staff instead of bringing in outside staff the specific requirements for additional training in the and applications areas were eliminated has agreed to provide all of the development and training plans for the staff to the for review the gap analysis for the courts software was eliminated this was a study proposed to research the way the courts environment currently runs and match it to the courts software the waiver of the courts licensing fee was also eliminated from the proposal the technical architect position was removed this position would have really helped to define strategies and visions for technology in the future is going to try to be creative in finding an alternative to provide this resource using their staff the business process topic was modified has removed the outside consultant to supplement the current business consultant team on a quarterly basis will continue to work and improve this process as a part of their efforts will continue to bring the resources and invest in moving the it organization forward highlighted five areas that appear to bring additional cost possibilities elimination of the applications portfolio analysis training plan reduced security policy solutions to mitigate risk and implement selected solutions is assumed will be at additional cost set analysis and structured training elimination of gap analysis for the courts and license fees asked if his analysis is accurate replied in the area of training training plans are comprehensive and provide an industry standard training programs for the technical staff the original amendment provided specific levels of annual training in applications and these staff will still be trained but will identify additional training they feel is needed after the plan is reviewed resources can be shuffled to accommodate training in one area over another the amount of training dollars has can be managed feels this is the common theme in the other areas as well is going to try and do the best with what they have but if an outside penetration test in security is needed additional dollars will be needed stated the list of possibilities for additional costs is only a caution to the it board and staff to remain aware of the risks and to exercise more control over these judge stated his disappointment in losing the technical architect position judge requested a be published to clarify the implementation periods of the various projects stated to the board that the process to replace this contract will need to begin in in order to be written published awarded and contracted by ms motioned to approve resolution seconded and the motion passed unanimously the next it board meeting is scheduled for in room exhibit resolution a board

busy with major site moves this month requiring coordination of voice and data additionally will be reporting on the completion of several major applications projects for customers staff has been very active in the budget development process both from supporting the customers as they develop their requirements as well as developing our internal budget we have several new twists to account for such as the new way we will be supporting as well as the new contract one item i have added to the agenda for discussion this month is the reach of our support with regards to web sites and funding has always looked at any request for services and having to have a direct link to an authorized customer direct sites are easy but things start getting a little gray when the site is in support of something that is a joint project or not clearly labeled as a city or county function we have followed the logic if one of our customers sponsors the site and will accept financial responsibility for whatever charges might be incurred it is a viable site for us to work with we have now come across a new scenario brought to our attention by members of the enhanced access board we have developed a site for the police athletic league pal club as a division under the site this clearly fit our definition in that it is supported by and has officers as staff assigned to the program the twist came in when they requested the online capability to accept charitable donations for the pal club we have the capability under our agreement with to do this and have coded to be able to support the request however when the subcommittee of the enhanced access board looked to approve the new offering they had several questions as to if they needed to approve this i would like to spend a few minutes discussing this and gather your thoughts on future direction i look forward to speaking with you at the meeting on exhibit information technology monthly status report a major event for administration during the month of was the it boards approval of the extension of the agreement with the management and staff have worked very hard to improve services and add value to our partnership with the and are honored by the confidence exhibited by the it board in our ability to continue this trend over the next several years management also focused on continued improvements within the applications group through the implementation of several key processes and procedures among these are a quality assurance guide will be used to help those creating plans for individual projects this includes documents for creating a testing plan testing strategy test error report usability testing report and test error log a new requirements document has been placed in the document repository along with a how to document this is a combination document that walks people through the process of defining unambiguous requirements and then taking them into the next steps of functional and technical specifications specifications we have created a how to on how to develop and document functional and technical specifications it is imperative that once the requirements have been defined we build the appropriate models to help the client visualize what is necessary this document speaks to what is required in such a document and how it will be documented for approval project entry and time tracking system we have updated the database to be the central repository for project information at this time it will allow for the capturing of weekly and monthly status information and we will be able to track issues and risks that will show whether a project is on schedule within budget or has a scope issue by using in this way we will be able to create the monthly it team report for all projects by functional committee and department showing where a project has any open issues that could affect budget schedule or scope configuration management plan we have created a standard configuration management plan that documents the way we expect each project to be documented and stored from a very small project to the largest it states which artifacts need to be captured what they need to be named and where they need to be stored this ensures that all information is maintained at the proper level for each size project and reduces the prejudice against process by not requiring the same level of complexity for each project type customer service cards results cards distributed cards returned ratings with being the highest level of satisfaction assistance received timely service friendly helpful accomplishments and other points of interest business support services monthly statistics from the calls to answered by presented to night abandoned calls to daytime time daytime

service requests received service requests closed all groups quick calls received the new system was converted and placed into production on the weekend of there were only a few minor problems and those were resolved quickly there be additional conversions if the township assessor chooses that option if they choose to reconvert they will lose any changes they made in the new system the property record card layout has had major changes and after approval from the committee the state also has to approve the layout and content request for qualification this web application was put into

this is the first phase of a renovation project for the entire facility located at the move began on with the of equipment and was completed with the on and at the next phase will affect completion of the entire project will be late crime lab expansion the crime lab expanded their offices to include space at the new county coroners facility and also the coroners former space at green ctr worked with on the equipment transfer and installation the jail upgrade project called for the replacement of the crime labs existing panels with new the wiring for the new drops has been completed and verified seven new have been installed as well as several this project is complete project the project went as scheduled and was completed on time unlike most deployments it required the user to first remove software and then reboot to receive the new software in any other circumstance this have occurred over the course of two days however since our clients our vulnerable to thousands of viruses it was imperative not to leave the workstations without virus protection it was necessary to remove and install the new software as a single install considering the amount of user intervention required to install the deployment was a success and relatively uneventful project the project was completed on time with little or no intervention with the install process from the user the project started on and was completed on the speed of the process was achieved due to the years of the entire system from the previous upgrade from to this was done by reducing the number of and placing them on their own individual servers calendar update message was sent out on to all users to update their personal information this included over individual responses with department group updates this was completed in the message also stated for the user to contact the administrator when you have changes in the future this will again be sent out to all users later this year and fisher police departments both departments have been connected to the network via a circuit this provides these departments with connection to the system for which police department is the regional center is a service ultimately provided by state police both departments also gain access to the system provided by through this new connection to the network these systems give and fishers access to national and international data concerning crime criminal records and other data vital to a modern police departments operations jail upgrade all functional areas of the jail administrative central records crime lab and the lockup areas have been upgraded to speed switches and now have feeds to each of the distribution closets at the same time the older unreliable hubs have been removed the customer benefits from the upgrade in that it offers increased speed and better reliability for the computers in the jail network it also offers better monitoring of network traffic and statistics reporting for the technical services staff additionally the upgrade allows the newer computers in service at that location to take advantage of their speed major project highlights business support services web courts online time info system the user acceptance testing of the access administration application was not progressing as quickly as anticipated at the clients request the delivery of the web time entry application was delayed until on it was once again delayed until a date to be determined the clients have not been able to dedicate the time resources necessary to build the employee database the web application is

has reviewed the requirements documents created approximately one year ago by corporate personnel he feels that there is adequate information there to begin the technical design phase there be a few issues and questions that will need to be discussed in a little more detail with the client before the technical design phase can be estimated once we get the go ahead we will begin the next phase web content management system management technical resources and the are working closely with the internet group to plan for the enterprise deployment of the product to all web stewards this project will entail a phased approach which is intended to augment the redesign of the web site the current tasks underway are focused on the technical infrastructure and how the web servers can be configured to adequately house the product and the thousands of active web pages associated with in addition the process through which web pages are published will also be reviewed for streamlining and enhanced flexibility list server alternatives recently installed a product to handle basic list server capabilities the most recent use of the majordomo product was the implementation of the emergency management notification system list server function for the department of public safety during the course of this implementation it was determined that the majordomo product was severely limited in its flexibility and required source code modifications to accommodate fairly remedial changes the internet group requested the to evaluate alternative products and make a recommendation to replace majordomo this effort known as phase is now underway with a recommendation expected in streaming video this project is for the cable agency for a solution to integrate streaming video services within the cable agency consultant has completed his review and recommendations and presented them to the and customer in the cable franchise board is now scheduled to undertake this issue at their meeting

be implemented that will replace the focus application with the same functionality frees has been researching alternative software products on the internet as well as checking out which is the web version of focus has been coordinating with porter from information builders to set up a meeting to discuss the functions of with the clients to see if it will meet their needs due to the reporting needs of the clients any software option must also contain a robust reporting capability conversion of the current applications is also an issue and considerable expense if another product is selected upgrade treasurers cashiering system the treasurers office will upgrade their current cashiering system as it is no longer supported by the vendor and uses outdated technology the new system will require an application server and space on the oracle server as well as new workstations that are connected to the network the vendor will install the application software will coordinate server resources oracle requirements configure application server and setup new workstations the statement of work was completed for by the financial functional group which met on and approved the scoring the it team at the meeting on gave approval to proceed a project definition will now be written online license application city controller this project will allow the public to submit license application forms via the internet for the most used license forms this project was started in of it was decided that since the internet group was implementing adobe acrobat to use for interactive forms on the web that tool should be considered for this application acrobat was thought to be faster and easier to develop online forms for access on the internet after it was determined to be more than originally thought and would perhaps require too much maintenance by the customer to use it was decided that the application would be addressed through some other means frees gave a draft copy of the functional specification document to review for completeness is also checking into using to implement this project as well civic net for the fee collections will coordinate with to get approval and a that this can be implemented if she uses online deductions on the web for the assessor this project will give public access to the assessors property deduction forms and allow them to enter the information and submit the forms directly to the assessor this project was started in of it was decided that since the internet group was implementing adobe acrobat to use for interactive forms on the
