validated stated an email is sent to the filer with a unique id which is to be sent back to the administrator for a unique match requested the internet staff research the possibility of filing permits online for the townships implementation will begin in evaluation committee the structure previously recommended and approved was made up of the following it board chairman board members two county representatives two city representatives and deputy of contract compliance inquired if a member of the board has an obligation that does not permit them to attend the meeting is it possible to send a proxy to gather data the division director in corporation counsel appointed by mayor answered board questions regarding the committee in response to question stated there are two choices the boards ultimate goal is to have participation by board members in the development of the criteria as well as the review process of responses from vendors first there cannot be a quorum of the board sit on the committee as a developer and reviewer of the and keep the information confidential a quorum of the it board is four members not including the in government the majority of business is done publicly this is a unique circumstance where the law permits and requires the committee to keep information confidential because that is what engenders the competitive process the theory is it gets you to a better contract in the end than you would have gotten if every single piece of information were public from the onset the two goals of the board are to make it competitive and therefore keep all or some of the information for a period of time confidential and have some members of the board participate directly in the process these two goals are going to compete at various stages suggested two ideas the board could create an official committee that is open and if done in this manner the options are gain members superintending all the processes that need supervised lose the ability to have deliberative discussion about what the bid details example if you would like to have free willing deliberative discussion with candor about problems have been identified over the years with the current contract or ideas about the future and not open it up to the public for comment the board cannot do that under this arrangement the only thing that can be kept confidential and should be confidential is the actual content of the responses when they are received under the operating agreement statute before a final recommendation is made to the definition governing body means two or more individuals who are any committee appointed directly by the governing body or its presiding officer to which authority to take official action upon public business has been delegated an agent or agents appointed by the governing body to conduct collective bargaining on behalf of the governing body does not constitute a governing body for purposes of this chapter sect if the makes a recommendation and the board ratifies the recommendation it would not fall within the word directly in the definition of a governing body the competing concern that is engendered is those competitive processes in an extremely important contract to get the best contract in the end ms clarified if the committee was directly appointed by the board that committee would have to comply with the open door law the committee would have to meet publicly prior to receiving any responses and any deliberations as to what constitutes the would be open once the responses were opened the meetings would be held in executive session confirmed she was correct the board keep the responses confidential until there is a formal recommendation to present to the board at a minimum the board has vested an ability to keep the contents of the responses secret until the appropriate time which is strongly supported in the general statute procedurally what it contemplates is a best and final offer negotiation the board will absolutely want the secrecy between the proposals inquired if there was a recommendation on the structure and if the positions were filled within the next thirty days is there anything that keeps that team from operating until the next board meeting at which time the board would ratify the team chosen stated there is nothing that would hinder the team from starting once it is formed in reference to his initial question asked about the potential of sending a proxy stated as long as there is no quorum and the board does not directly appoint the committee any board member interested in the meeting can attend in reply to question regarding the scoring procedures stated the best scenario would be to have the same members scoring every time if it is not done in that manner it is not inherently jeopardizing the credibility of the scoring exercise especially if the scoring is objective ms inquired about the board members who wish to attend the meetings as merely audience members replied a member attend if the result is a quorum members in attendance are deemed to be there in official capacity as a board member a suggestion would be to have rotating attendance by board members minutes and work products can be confidential and distributed as stated under the records law ms stated had outlined the boards options very well ms said she believes the board should appoint the committee she would like input on who is making the evaluations and she is uncomfortable with the concept of getting around the open door law she believes there are great advantages to doing everything publicly prior to the responses the vendors be able to glean a lot of information about what the board is looking for etc it is her understanding the board want to keep some deliberations confidential but she feels the advantages far outweigh the other option if all meetings are public then any board member can stop by any time because it is already an open meeting finally the best scenario is to have the same team throughout the evaluation process if the board formally appoints the committee there is an expectation that given few exceptions those team members will be doing the evaluations and not various staff members throughout the duration commented if this is the route the board chooses to go and all meetings are open there absolutely cannot be any conversations regarding price or any expectations the team have regarding pricing nothing is more corrupting than discussions of price when doing a competitive bid process ms motioned to formally appoint the evaluation committee with as many specific members as possible ms seconded ms stated she believed at the next meeting the board would decide whether to appoint the committee or ratify the recommendation ms stated she was still absorbing the information had stated and would like more time to decide which direction would be best judge asked whether the formal appointment or ratification of a recommendation was most common answered most of his experience was of a confidential nature if there is an official appointment all meetings will have to meet the hour open door notice policy voiced his concern with employee turnover in regards to open meeting conversations dealing with what if topics ms restated her motion to say the board acknowledge the formalized process that would be subject to public access laws and the members affirmed today with further appointments to made as they become available herself earl mark and mike ms seconded and the motion passed by a vote turner and judge both voted against the motion document imaging discussion stated a meeting was held on th and at that time several issues were brought up including the need for document imaging enterprise wide locating the money to fund this initiative will be difficult believes the it board needs to appoint a governing board to pursue the document imaging project ms motioned to allow the president of the it board to choose a person outside of the board to appoint people to the document imaging board ms seconded and the motion passed unanimously requested a detailed discussion be held at the next it board meeting stated the report is as submitted stated the report stood as submitted court management system project update distributed reports concerning progress there is no definite yet once the project passes the validation phase a more definite will be developed county is one of the leading counties for this project however clay county was selected for the pilot project because they do not have a current system in place is the date set for the completion of the design phase believes it be difficult to meet that deadline from stated he believed that deadline will be met but the changes that ca and will need to respond to cause time constraints ms stated justice relayed the urgency of this project at a meeting she attended judge also made it very clear this project needed to be accomplished and system should not be fit into another design scheme ms committed in the meeting she attended to have the it board provide their influence and participation to help move this project along stated he would like updates as well as solicitation from the justice agency for additional support whenever necessary the next it board meeting is scheduled for in room the information

kickoff meeting regarding document management led by john the attendance and feedback at this brainstorming session was very productive the attendees all seem to sense that a technology like document management can play a major role in improving efficiencies in local government but we do not know at this time what the true impact could be and how to fund it in total the consensus was that more study is needed to better understand the opportunities for sharing and then we can use this knowledge to develop strategies for deployment and funding a series of action items were developed to help move this forward with the biggest being a review by business consultants of the different and who uses them by department and agency we will be discussing this in more detail as the process progresses our important constituent relationship management system is on the street we had a good number of vendors at the meeting held th the city will have opened the responses and started the

process with fairly tight we published the request for information seeking ideas and suggestions from the vendors in this market we received responses that are being reviewed now please let us know if you would like to review them we can make them available to you electronically development of the scopes of work that describe our activities and our requirements for our next agreement will take a lot of work and focus on all of our parts decisions will be made shortly on how we want to structure our next agreement including what services are included or excluded additionally the ways we want to change the agreement must be defined and documented so that we can allow effective competition for the services much of the teams discussion has been around the process they will use to communicate with the different areas of affected parties the biggest area is our stakeholders and the customers of these it services while we will be working on a pretty tight we are dedicated to gaining appropriate feedback and suggestions regarding department and agency it needs at multiple points during the process we are developing a specific communications plan just to address these different areas and track our activities as we move ahead getting to a final set of it solutions that are flexible and meet the needs of all our customers is the primary goal of this process i look forward to discussing these items with you at the it board meeting mike exhibit the month of was fairly typical for and the computing enterprise at the many important activities took place in support of our more than customers and the highlights of some of those efforts are included in this months report in addition technical staff was engaged in a critical database recovery effort for the mainframe system no data was lost and downtime was kept to a minimum thanks to the coordinative efforts of and professionals one of the significant activities in which i was personally involved was the session for document imaging management was pleased to host such a great discussion of leaders ideas issues and visions for addressing the possibilities associated with the use of this wonderful technology business consultants are currently following up with the attendees to gather further information and to keep the momentum going it is hoped that a strategic vision and plan for practical and

user acceptance testing chief deputy coroner plans to continue testing throughout and the project will then enter production status st the contents of the system will be the department plans to input documents and data files for open cases into the system as they are generated then as the investigation proceeds the case can be accessed by any staff member from their own desk rather than retrieving it from a central location in fact everyone could view the document simultaneously this will also eliminate trying to find a document if it is not in the central repository the estimated scanning volume is representing cases system problems database recovery procedures require on the mainframe system required emergency intervention and database recovery as a result of complications caused by an system software trace tool there was a scheduled ca upgrade to version which ultimately caused a mainframe lock up when engineers started the trace facility the mainframe went into whats known as a wait state or in other words the mainframe went down database administrators discovered that evening that the automated recovery of the database during restart did not process the active at the time of system failure transactions correctly miller and spent several hours reviewing the problem with ca support it was eventually decided to wait until the following day to make a decision on how to recover and notify all users during that time the system was available and very few cases were negatively affected then worked that night to rebuild all database indexes approximately million records and then ran a forward recovery of the minute time period that was in error during the restart the recovery was completed at am the following morning the recovery reprocessed the transactions for the time period in question coming to a finish the house bill remediation project is almost completed the cycle a close and distribution programs were run with no major problems the fall tax bills were produced and were sent to be printed by a vendor selected by the treasurers office of the programs in the after spring bill processing only are in the phase waiting user acceptance testing and final

program a node connection based on fiber technology was agreed upon as the solution for this project coordinated a presentation with and the various state at this point neither the city nor the state of have ordered the services and there is no connectivity for programmers or a permanent link between the and the several projects are now close to implementation with no means for connectivity head end the purpose of this project is to provide connectivity and distribution capabilities to allow for the training academy to become an alternate site for city county business relocation in the event of a disaster once this project is finished remote sites will still have connectivity to network resources even if the building is disabled the circuits will be cut over in a phased approach one head at a time with completion expected by the end of is still waiting for implementation of a link between the and the to begin moving forward with the head end migration projected installation date was installation has been escalated to management the systems group successfully installed in the mainframe environment advantage database services option supports full and multitasking functions transparent to application programs to ensure exceptionally high throughput it enables users to control online system resources and display status information online and provides online tools for

pool the computer in the pool shack was connected to the network utilizing wireless technology requiring the installation of additional cabling access point antenna and wireless card in the this solution eliminates the need for access to run the application and eliminates the need for the modem line to be installed every summer as an added benefit it gives public safety officers that have wireless laptops in their patrol cars the ability to pull into the parks parking lot and access the network the application allows the technicians access to the heat database allowing the monitoring and updating of heat tickets from remote locations via a web browser the server that was running on could not be patched because the process would break the application and is also not supported by the vendor this presented a security risk to the network and the and applications running on the same server as to resolve the issue frank iii created a web page that links directly to heat so there is no further need for this will result in a future savings of approximately per year in maintenance support fees as well as allowing the server team to maintain security and patch management on server while preventing future disruptions to and the midrange group installed the web component of the election system software software this effort allows for the posting of election results in near
