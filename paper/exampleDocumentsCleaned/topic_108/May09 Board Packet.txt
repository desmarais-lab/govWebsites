desired functionality in an intuitive and efficient application the objective of this initiative is to move services off of the aging server infrastructure to the server platform in order to reduce data center operating costs by consolidating server hardware platforms this initiative has three phases database application and infrastructure services migrations the objective of this is to migrate off of the legacy circuits to less expensive circuits for all offices that require wan services to connect to the network regional center design guidelines in order to undertake development in the
