is continuing to forge ahead into new territory way to go critical child support data captured on the county clerk has three systems that contain the child support payment data the old mainframe system and client server system are used for research purposes only and have no update capabilities is the statewide system that is currently being used the data from the prior systems were not converted to the system so the county clerk and prosecutor personnel have to look on three different systems to research payment data the county clerk requested all the payment data from the old system and system be archived in the same format on the data will be indexed by various keys to aid in the research of payments the data was extracted off by john using the same format as the mainframe extract file applications then extracted the mainframe data and merged it together with the data into one file and a report was created there were multiple data issues that had to be programmed around to get a meaningful report and have all the data for a given case accessible then the report was written on a by the vendor with the ability to search by the requested indexes will use their existing frame relay service to access and the system in addition to the cost savings provided by the elimination of the unnecessary circuit and equipment the conversion provides a faster more stable connection in addition to allowing access to other applications making for a more efficient work a legend of the codes used in various data fields was also included on the to ensure the code definitions are available to anyone who is viewing the data this was delivered to the county clerk on mainframe support efforts applications service request summary the application services group continued to focus heavily on maintenance and support requests during the month of a total of application services requests were closed during the month while new requests were opened a table showing the breakdown of these tickets follows heat category total total maintenance total service requests problem calls total problem calls major technical the following projects were addressed during the month and their current status is presented improved infrastructure and processes the network communications group completed the conversion project of moving the police on th st off of a baud line they have used to access the application they will be able to eliminate a mainframe style terminal and printer baud data line and a baud modem they on performed a disaster recovery test utilizing our hot site in wood dale and the cold site on avenue in during this test we successfully restored the new operating system used by the environment and successfully restored all of the data volumes for the online applications the server team successfully restored that is the backup master server used to facilitate the restoration of the server enterprise the server team also successfully restored ware server that was then used to restore windows and windows base ware images the team also restored active directory services and validated that defined users were restored in the systems group successfully completed the conversion of mainframe connectivity from analog to digital for the airport police department as well as the police access to the mainframe for these agencies over established frame relay improves reliability and online response time additionally annual budgetary requirements for these agencies are collectively reduced by nearly the systems group also successfully completed the installation of host software component version into production the automated tape silos which house and mount the tape cartridges to facilitate batch processing on the mainframe utilizes this software library software enables automated tape libraries to operate in an environment this upgrade was installed to comply with software currency requirements as well as in preparation for the update of the operating system software security improvement efforts the security team installed the and checkpoint patches and hot fixes to the firewall which were deemed necessary by the vendors the applied patches will enhance performance and prevent denial of service vulnerabilities additional maintenance was also performed to establish better communication with the election board firewall the installation was successful with no disruption in service the maintenance performed helps ensure the integrity as well as increasing the efficiency of the server improvement efforts the which stores all authentication and access rights to files on the network was upgraded by the server group in to version the upgrade was successfully applied on all servers to resolve known database issues that could arise and potentially cause problems in the future improvement efforts final approval was recently granted to shut off the last remaining server of the old web server farm earlier in the month all of the old remaining oracle server farm equipment was dismantled and sent to asset management for disposal a few selected components were retained and consolidated into two racks in anticipation of being moved to training academy this is just the start of what is expected to become a more properly provisioned site to have sufficient capacity to be an adequate hot site to host critical applications in the event of a declared disaster at the building recycling of retired equipment is seen as a low cost low risk method of the initial provisioning of the anticipated facility and a prudent use of the assets asset management support efforts the inventory administrator reconciled equipment marked surplus in the inventory database with equipment actually this reconciliation allows for a look at what equipment is available for redeployment at any given time providing a more means of supplying agencies with resources necessary for the successful performance of employees work responsibilities without incurring additional costs by purchasing new equipment also completed a successful test of modifications to the heat asset tracker inventory scanner allowing it to run in the background no longer requiring user input through an online questionnaire this test ran for both and with no reported problems this improved method of asset scanning provides greater accuracy in the reporting of assets while alleviating the need for customers to verify asset information manually modifications were also made to the software table in the inventory database and statements have been generated to produce purchased vs scanned information for software license usage data from the report has been validated and statements will be used to create crystal reports that will provide greater reliability in reconciling software licenses for auditing purposes disk storage enhancement in the it board approved the expenditure of to replace the aging disk storage technology used to supply the network storage to the plus desktops commonly referred to as shared drives the cluster within our infrastructure provides this storage by using an obsolete storage area network and associated disk storage array this project is now well underway the hardware was delivered in late and has now been installed during much of the configuration and software installation work was completed and the new storage array is now plugged in to the this allows the new storage to be accessed by the cluster while the cluster still maintains connection to the old storage the dual connectivity is a transitional configuration which will facilitate the data migration efforts to take place planned to begin in late in some components of new document management system arrived the new storage array has the flexibility to provision two classes of storage technology simultaneously from the same platform fiber channel storage for response applications as well as but storage that is especially suited for document new document management application will capitalize on the latter allowing to access online archived monthly statistics from calls were presented to
