is for a continuation of the previous contract approved by and the board for a renewal with the photography options range from to per year depending on our selection of color or black and white photography this decision can be made up until the day before the flights start costs have increased slightly from the previous contracted amounts due to our need to improve the quality of the data by having greater overlap to improve final data quality this will allow more users to benefit from the digital photos judge requested to amend the resolution adding the language per year following the cost ms motioned to approve resolution as amended ms technology sourcing discussion recapped the previous sourcing discussions for the board recommendation is to use the three extensions of the contract utilizing this full extension allows to sustain the current momentum of delivering technology to local government the loss of momentum is of great concern to it is his basic belief that going into an would prove to be a significant distraction to internal it staff and to key customer contacts the team tasked with delivering technology is now poised to focus on projects that could greatly impact our delivery of services and to take the time and efforts to go through an with only the possibility of limited gains would be detrimental to local government in the long run in response to ms question regarding this contract extension and providing web resources stated has been bringing in resources to support the specific skill sets to the web needs of the under the new agreement through the applications development pool there is maximum flexibility to adjust the skill sets to fit the enterprises needs ms commented the auditors office historically has had to find the it solutions to improve their business needs and it is her belief the vendor should be familiar enough with departmental systems to recommend ways in which to use technology to achieve a more environment reiterated it is the responsibility of staff to utilize the vendor to assist in gathering the it solutions and recommendations to help determine the needs of the customer would like to see the leadership more clearly defined in the presentation is the senior vice president of and managing director of the information management solutions division distributed a slide handout and presented information about and the services they provide to commercial businesses judge asked if he believed that has the ability to carry out both the lights on and forward thinking visions replied has made a career in the lights on delivery of outsourcing with significant demonstrated results for their clients is also a proven company in delivering dedicated service and has the capability to bring in experts to supplement local staff in order to achieve the forward thinking visions stated the existing contract as amended does not provide significant funding to carry out the visions but does provide the ability to redirect resources to achieve what can be accomplished asked if he believes is going to be a leader and make recommendations or if is going to be a resource and let be the leader feels the amendment is designed for them to be the resource to advise on technology ms voiced her concern with the projected costs listed on the option analysis handout explained was asked to look for any additional cost savings in the year extension and they were able to provide an additional savings amounting to approximately also spread the cost differently over the duration of the contract helping to reduce the impact on budgets for ms indicated she felt the council should be informed on the details of the recommendation and associated costs stated he had sent a letter to many members of the council and has talked with several councilors was asked about the belief that this pricing is a fair deal for local government stated that he and his staff have done due diligence research to establish this it appears that this level of cost is still to our benefit we will see some increase for even extending the contract without any changes due to the vendor quote delivered on the analysis sheet stated it is a challenge to explain a recommendation based on estimated costs the only way to obtain exact numbers is to do a full which has additional costs and risks ms indicated there might be benefits in exploring other options through an she voiced her concern and stated she remains in a dilemma ms concurred with ms concern said based on conversations with outside resources he believes has a good deal of material gathered to begin work on an but not enough of a head start to complete the in less than eight to twelve months an for the scale would cost between and just to gather the information and hire outside resources to develop the full document and perform any evaluation this amount does not include any additional legal services to assist legal counsel stated again that his biggest concern of an is the loss of momentum within local government this was experienced in the last process and should not be dismissed this can cost up to a slow down of attention to new projects while everyone is looking at the the period includes development publishing evaluation contract negotiation and award and transition periods between ms requested the board have another meeting before the next regular meeting to discuss the contract further dates and times for this meeting will be forwarded to the board as soon as they can be established and a room identified the board discussed rescheduling the th regular meeting any changes to the date will be determined later exhibit minutes miller turner and mike turner turner ruby bob corporation counsel lee van leer bill visitors parks finch ms in the absence of called the meeting to order at pm presentation introduced vice president of group has been an integral player in the contract renewal process since last fall stated that he has received valuable assistance and support through the assistance and counsel from asked to come in and address the board today made a presentation to the board a document was distributed to the board summarizing the work and have done in the renegotiations overall objectives for the process included improving service optimizing value and leveraging the renegotiation or competitive bid process to provide access to new technologies and solutions available in the marketplace issues identified as part of the objectives included simplifying service levels resolving application development management clarifying inventory asset management and baselines establishing cost saving objectives and incentives as well as several other stated a common issue found by with other outsourcing contracts is that the recipients feel it has not brought technology innovation or process improvement to evolve the customers enterprise a survey also shows that almost half of the outsourcing clients have been involved in renegotiations most contracts now include a built in renegotiation clause on an annual basis reevaluation of the original contract is expected at some time during the term in response to ms question regarding when to go back to the market for an replied currently there is not a significant amount of research in this area of outsourcing due to the relatively new nature of this market was one of the leaders in taking their it business outside he stated that most agencies will go through the full term of the agreement before making an informed decision he felt that using his personal knowledge many renew the agreements when they are comfortable with the services being supplied by their vendor some do go to also discussed the cost trends in the marketplace through for various it service categories he noted that one area growing substantially is for external it services like our sourcing contract that is in place today this is definitely the direction more and more government entities are moving towards the graph showed that contracts for external services will surpass the expenditures for internal it services ms asked if the escalation in cost was unusual she believes if the is spending more in it outsourcing then savings should be seen elsewhere stated it should be an enabler in improvements in the organization using it as the enabler means focusing on using it to improve operations such as permit tracking systems etc once the operations have been improved reducing overall costs can be evaluated it is the responsibility to set objectives and evaluate the expected return from the agreement he stated this has not always been an area that government is good at following up systems be installed but the follow up to be sure savings were delivered always occur ms commented that in the past the thought they were being sold a vision explained it is a mistake for an agency to assume the it visioning and leadership can be outsourced ultimate responsibility resides with the agencies for visioning strategies and deployment of dollars spent agencies can expect to have a good partner to help in that responsibility but ultimately it is the agencies responsibility to decide what makes sense for them the primary goal in renegotiating and restructuring the current contract is to realign the relationship if a new vendor were brought in as the provider the whole process of reestablishing the relationship would need to be done ms asked how the match was between amendment and the realignment of the relationship stated the amendment offers a solid foundation in renewed relationships he believes the issues were properly prioritized and addressed in the proposed amendment ms inquired how different an would look if a whole set of new goals were established replied the overall essence of the current contract is on a facilities management type agreement in order to have more than facilities management in an the needs to determine where the enterprise wants to be with it in the future in the first discussions concerning the contract questions revolved around where the expected to be in the next months and if those improvements required significant expenditures in the discussion it was determined the is not firm on its future it needs if the answers were more positive it would have been beneficial to go out to market but based on the uncertainty the best solution is to recommend extending the contract to allow time to identify and prioritize the it needs determining these needs will allow for a better position to get the leverage needed with the market currently if the were to go out to the only thing the would be offered is a facilities management relationship the would probably not attract big innovators to the procurement offering or result in any significant price savings miller asked if there were best practice comparisons to the current trajectory costs of it and on average how long it would take to establish a vision stated the vision process averages six months but if the process includes going out for it becomes a month process in response to the projected costs believes the is within normal range of other competitive vendors and perhaps slightly the overall contract objectives were reviewed concluding presentation to the board lee stated his perspective of the renegotiation he believes the amendment has been structured to reflect the improvements needed in it from he stressed the technical architect position will help to initiate dialog between the customer and the vendor to help achieve the it needs of the enterprise he also feels the changes in the service levels presented in the amendment have improved immensely are measurable understandable and can be attained the relationship has with departments and agencies within the comes from hard work through all the discussions disagreements and compromises the end result is always the best solution for the is certain the team spirit has been the key to and the successes together is willing to work together with the business consultants and departments to find answers and research alternatives to it needs and feed those back to each department stated and the are fortunate to have some of the finest most dedicated it professionals in the area and will continue to provide quality individuals while contracted with the final thought about momentum and was this we have all worked very hard to do a good job and i believe i speak for my entire staff when i say we are dedicated to the in all that we do we are certainly loyal to but we are very loyal to the also this is our business and we are proud to provide services to the someone said recently in
