through the whole process or will it be real time stated that the mac is already and put into the map major ball asked if a clean address would be available stated that in that case they can override the address given asked if it is available to tie into crime statistics explained that eventually integrations in place be tied into the data in the instance data is updated weekly preventing live data but would allow for data current as of one week out ms enders asked about the integration of infrastructure improvements such as resurfacing and is the product for use only stated that a kick off is planned for the completion of phase update pm presented the update stated that the decision to move the hard date to was difficult to make discussion continued with what has changed and progress made since then explained that this project was proposed because county has no where else to go at this time last month the presentation explained the distribution of the team the goal was to get one tester and one and work up to five emphasized the need to full time testing of as stated in the original statement of work the sow was based on the changes to justice being put completely on hold the team believed that was possible it was required is not a normal development project one of the reasons the agreement was at no costs was being able to free up labor last month the team was at the end of the changes to be made with the exception of the new three court project which was built into the new change has to be complete by for unfortunately that has not taken place due to the courts need for a new randomizer the way the court randomizes now will not work with the addition of three new courts the team now has another commitment and is committed to meeting same deadline staff are not able to out of the busy room stated that county still has no place else to go stated that he can not see a way to get this done unless the changes to justice stop stated that there is a need for a

in a normal and why it is important to the development of ms continued that everyone needs to understand it is an important point the issue is not about the issue is development in beta the concept is completely different discussed the goal was to get the application as clean as could be before sending to the users for testing the plan included setting the old justice up next to with side by side screens for comparison explained with the recent changes and new commitments the users can not expect a clean system the team knows it does not work when bugs are found they are run through the tool which fixes all those programs a session was held right after the board meeting last month problems were found but the team was able to navigate successfully and on a scale of one to five the lowest rate given was a three stated that is encouraging ms enders asked if the justice community agreed to the solution stated that they were but the need is to free people up to do this the team needs relief and champion users to run with testing ms stated the customers have committed to assisting but the beta team needs created continued that security needs to be completed as well as other things justice is already in production in a testing environment and because of that the team has gotten over major hurdles asked what the it board and need to do stated that the testing needs to happen and a team that is able to support the application once in production needs to be established suggested put together a plan the board will assist in identifying expert testers contracts report major meadows asked if the specialist contract was in lieu of hiring a employee ms stated it was the it board adjourned at am the next information technology board meeting is scheduled for at in room report the project is and on budget with no delays or budget issues anticipated the project is experiencing minor delays or minor cost overruns or the project has encountered problems which put it at risk of either going or missing deadlines hard deadlines can still be achieved but original goal dates be missed cost end up over original the project is experiencing significant delays potential cost overruns or critical failure hard deadlines be missed without the application of additional resources cost overruns exceed in excess of original budget immediate corrective action is this project has
