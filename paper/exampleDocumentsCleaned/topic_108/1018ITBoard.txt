approximately am on a power capacitor failed in the eighth floor wiring closet tripping a amp main circuit breaker in the central electrical distribution area of the building operations machine room this resulted in a power failure to sections of the center tower of the building from the subbasement through the th floor the impact of this became apparent very quickly while the help desk remained operational and could apprise callers of the situation the greater concern was the loss of power to the air cooling units in the server room management and staff immediately began assessing the situation consulting with building authority and taking action to ensure the temperate did not reach critical stages one of the immediate steps was to commandeer personal household fans used by staff requested that building authority have building reduce temperature settings on thermostats on the th floor a high capacity fan was borrowed from and delivered to the doors were opened to increase air flow from the cooler areas of the floor to the warmer the fans were deployed to further facilitate this despite the challenges of the situation and the ever changing status the communication was excellent and did much to allay concerns and alleviate confusion and frustration an automated message informed callers of the situation prior to their calls being answered an all message was sent out regarding the failure and others followed updating the progress the staff worked closely with to keep their clients informed and staff worked together during this time ensuring that system integrity was maintained and valuable equipment and data was protected the temperature in the server room hovered around degree during this crisis when power was restored the cooling units were quickly able to stabilize the temperature and return it to normal level the situation was challenging and demanded decisive action and creative solutions the team worked well and kept the situation in hand a number of valuable lessons such as the need for securing emergency power for server room air cooling units were learned during the event and these will be added to operational corporation it board report
