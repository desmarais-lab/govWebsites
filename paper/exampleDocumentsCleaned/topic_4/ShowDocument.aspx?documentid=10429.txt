the new phone number is las covers six months a year and covers the remaining six months along with private attorneys the day of caring date was th we had six volunteers to write the closing date on outside of closed files and set aside the adoption files to keep forever alphabetize our open and closed and advice only files and pick up and deliver fliers from other agencies we provided lunch for the volunteers one volunteer will come back and continue to work on project and as her workplace provides her days per year for community volunteering sue also asked to keep us in mind if an educated person who understands confidentiality would need community service on a criminal matter to complete the project two additional volunteers were to have worked on creating an online application form so applications would be paperless support staff made it clear they were unwilling to work on this project right now sue indicated it will have to be done in the near future this year is sues th anniversary at legal aid judge has been appointed to the pro commission by the bar foundation when sues term ends she was appointed by the supreme court we will still have representation but if asked sue would like to recommend or or an attorney board member for the position sue will attend the pro commission meeting in on and did attend a southern regional meeting by telephone conference call funds are down substantially this year the supreme court and bar foundation have allowed the use of of the remaining reserves and districts have no reserves at all our district has gained two new counties and so our district expands to sue would like to step down from the volunteer lawyers program of southwestern board on which she has served since before it was incorporated in she was an or would need to replace her there are four quarterly evening dinner meetings somewhere in the district and four executive committee meetings in sue has been either the secretary or the treasurer each year sue told and this fact weeks prior to the board meeting neither responded when asked to serve and indicated they would flip a coin the meetings one of them needs to attend in are at pm at the or office for the executive committee and in the evening somewhere to be announced in the district for the board meeting juvenile court has adopted a rule sue suggested which has been in place in divorce court for some time stating an attorney is considered withdrawn from a case once completed after days have passed this means las will not have to formally withdraw by certified mail in each juvenile case or have the client sign a voluntary withdrawal in most cases the prosecutor iv no longer will meet in person with mothers or alleged fathers and file new paternity actions paternity is established by the alleged father and biological mother signing a paternity affidavit the affidavit says mother has physical custody and father has parenting time pursuant to the parenting time guidelines if the parents sign another portion of the affidavit and obtain within days they have joint legal custody over decision making thus the prosecutor iv is only filing petitions for a support order and not mentioning custody parenting time the notice of relocation law the law that says both parents have equal rights to school and medical records las anticipates this will increase the number and type of applicants this comes on top of the change in handling chins child in need of services cases previously the caseworkers department attorneys and public defenders would handle chins cases and provide services to the parents until the children were reunified with the parents or it was determined reunification was not possible then those actors in the chins court would litigate who would have custody of the children now due to lack of funds the caseworkers are not providing services and not making a decision on where the child should be placed but leaving it up to private attorneys to litigate that issue in divorce or paternity court formerly las was not a part of this most chins parents qualify for our services so we are getting more applications for contested custody cases we cannot handle properly because we have no funds to purchase medical records pay for the testimony of doctors and counselors or get information from caseworkers who now have no opinion las will attempt to keep statistics on these two kinds of applications and cases to see the impact there was discussion at the family law section about creating an informational video for parents of newborns to view before signing the paternity affidavit the new law requires hospital staff to advise the parents of their legal rights separately and allow them the opportunity to talk with whomever they choose before signing the hospitals and their lawyers should be happy to pay for the production of such a video las has attended the family law section meetings and probate section meetings to help judge institute new rules to ease the extremely large and growing docket sue is one of several family law attorneys who volunteered to pro for half a day during the two month period when the magistrate who helps in juvenile court on afternoon is out she is doing this on her day off our wait time for an appointment is back up to weeks vacation time and holidays make it worse between her
