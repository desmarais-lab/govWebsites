definitions governance group the governance group will consist of a representative sample of the major departments within the city mayors office public works public safety administration and finance community investment parks and information technologies this group will meet regularly to direct the actions outlined in this plan and recommend policies procedures and standards for all information technology efforts additionally this group will be responsible for prioritizing all information technology projects based on the administrations goals and efforts established devices software or systems in which a vendor has established a sizable market share due to superior technology or customer acceptance such as active directory for directory services and networking infrastructure devices mission critical systems systems that are essential for the city of south bend to function effectively public safety systems such as police and fire dispatch and water works distribution as well as critical city services systems such as the line and telephone service must be restored immediately in case of disaster ideal state the optimum level of technology provided by st as dictated within this document information technologies service management catalog a catalog of all technology services offered by an it department catalogs include the procedures for requesting services and list department protocols the service level agreement and any costs associated with the service the catalog is usually in the form of a piece of software but can also be published on a or a paper manual service level agreement documents that define the level of service and response times for different service requests for example if a mission critical system is down there be a that it will respond to the request in minutes a critical system have an of hours to respond will transparently let employees know when their request will be processed and resolved good government to provide timely effective and efficient government services to the citizens of south bend one of mayor tenants for providing the best services to citizens in the most efficient and timely manner possible system a software package or technology such as south bends and systems final definitions data management how the city of south bend captures stores shares disseminates replicates and reports the data collected prior to this document the city has not focused on collecting and managing data best practices the best way to consistently and effectively execute a task often times industries or organizations develop their own best practices change management procedure a process to minimize service downtime by ensuring that requests for changes are recorded and then evaluated authorized prioritized planned tested implemented documented and reviewed in a controlled and consistent manner open data platform a publicly accessible portal that centralizes data collected by disparate city departments this allows departments to access and analyze data more effectively generates solutions increases transparency and allows private developers to develop innovative ways of handling municipal problems hardware physical machines computers servers printers peripherals software programs that run on hardware office short for enterprise resource planning systems use an integrated suite of software modules that support the basic internal business processes of a company or organization it provides an integrated view of its core business processes supervisory control and data acquisition is the centralized computer controlled industrial control system that monitors and controls all water and wastewater processes systems often consist of remote terminal units programmable logic controllers telemetry systems that connect and with the control center a human machine interface and historian software which accumulates timestamped data used to populate trends geographic information systems integrates hardware software and data for capturing managing analyzing and displaying all forms of geographically referenced information systems allow users to view understand question interpret and visualize data in many ways that reveal relationships patterns and trends in the form of maps globes reports and charts a system helps answer questions and solve problems by looking at data in a way that is quickly understood and easily shared final executive summary executive summary the need for a strategic plan the strategic plan for the city of south bends information technology department aims to effectively communicate the technology direction priorities and policies as the city continues to improve a strategy for the development of technology will lessen duplicated efforts and improve efficiency furthermore this plan demonstrates the information technology departments ongoing effort to implement strategies that further the goals of mayor administration process a committee was formed and met several times in and of the committee consisted of representatives from all major departments within the city government along with mike retired for and vice president of technology at teachers credit union these working sessions helped define the role of technology efforts within the overall vision this document is largely the outcome of those discussions as a result this document will serve as a blueprint for the information technology departments direction through st technology vision the plans vision can be grouped into four categories information technology services strategic partnerships governmental systems integration and community engagement for a visual graphic of these four categories refer to page developing strong information technology services within the entire organization is critical to support the business functions of the city of south bend the establishment of governance will ensure technology efforts are prioritized and aligned with the business needs an emphasis on technology training for information technologies staff and the general workforce is required this investment will easily be repaid as technology is more fully utilized the development of formalized standards procedures and policies will allow employees to understand information technologies role within the city the establishment of a tactical path will enable the department to focus on prioritized items helping the city to realize the strategic target provide mission critical systems effectively and securely final executive summary strategic partnerships with vendors allow it staff to focus on prioritized projects while vendors and partners deliver other necessary services services such as office and platform as a service similar to the implementation of telephony services are constantly becoming more attractive and will play an expanding role in our strategy the establishment and maintenance of vendor relationships is needed as technology continues to change at a rapid rate when a solution does not exist commercially custom application development can help bridge gaps to fill needs interdepartmental and intergovernmental system integration is needed to provide more accessible data remove duplicated data collection continue to develop our open data platform to transparently share data across departmental lines share data with st county to eliminate duplication engage the community by looking for opportunities in the local school systems universities private companies and nonprofit organizations these community partnerships can help accomplish tasks and deliver services strategy the steps to realize the ideal state will be accomplished by implementing a formal governance group strengthening organizational aptitude establishing policies procedures and standards developing an effective data management strategy and centralizing resources for a flow chart of data management refer to page governance a governance group will be created with the responsibility of aligning technology resources with the business values the governance group will meet regularly to prioritize projects recommend policies and review progress of this plan a chief information officer position will be created to help guide the governance group and assist in the execution of this plan final executive summary strengthen organizational aptitude a concerted effort to build organizational aptitude with a foundation of technical knowledge among all of south bends employees must be undertaken advanced technical training for the information technologies department staff as well as a clear understanding of software and basic technology tools office etc by the general workforce is an essential element of improving organizational aptitude policies procedures and standards formalizing information technologies policies procedures and standards are critical this effort will cumulate with the creation of an information technologies service management catalog which will allow users to identify available information technology services and streamline the process of requesting those services this effort will provide service level agreements for the delivery of service requests data management an effective data management strategy is required to define how we capture store publish aggregate analyze and consume data such a strategy will increase transparency and accessibility for south bend citizens this strategy will be a holistic approach to all data including public safety and centralization of resources many applications and hardware touch multiple departments such as database administration and design networking infrastructure and backups these activities should be centralized to eliminate duplication and more efficiently utilize resources final vision vision to build and maintain a technology platform that allows employees at all levels to quickly and efficiently identify and resolve problems by using intelligent principles process improvement and technology the administrations major platforms of good government making the basics easy and promoting local job growth will be the driving force behind project and technology address problems effectively improve response to citizens in the constant pursuit of more accurate and timely responses to citizens needs technology can lead the way as south bend strives to be the smartest city in the the city must continue to respond to current problems and address looming challenges each decision requires internal discourse on how it affects the community as well as south bends continuing efforts to entice investment planning horizon with the target date of st this document sets forth the plan to coincide with the final budget of mayor first term it is expected that a new plan will be created following this strategic plans conclusion course corrections to the strategic plan the strategic plan must remain flexible and in line with the administrations goals any correction or modification to the strategic plan will occur within the governance groups normal meetings the governance group should review the progress made on this plan and make recommendations on project and resource allocation yearly if not more frequently technology vision the technology vision for the city of south bend can be grouped into four categories information technology services strategic partnerships governmental systems integration and community engagement final vision governance organizational strength standards procedures and policies tactical path with eye on strategic plan and business needs cloud services telephony office vendor management custom application information technology services strategic partnerships engagement governmental systems integration local school systems local universities and colleges private business nonprofits open data solutions city county integration city state leader in local government it space develop strong information technology services developing strong information technology services within the entire organization is critical to support the business functions of the city of south bend capacity as the use of technology continues to expand network infrastructure and systems must have the capacity to accommodate current systems as well as the flexibility and excess capacity to shoulder future needs reporting departments must be able to run reports and process other paperwork without the intervention of the information technologies department departmental ownership of simple processes such as reporting will free up information technologies staff to accomplish more transparent and open data as the city continues to increase transparency and provide accessible information to the public the publishing of data will be done publicly as a default clearly some sensitive data must be kept internal final vision but data collection must be done with the mindset of providing public information this approach is furthered by the development of south bends open data platform which will serve as a central location for both public and internal data the open data platform will enable departments to access aggregated data allowing better analysis of problems and databased solutions data will be removed from internal silos which makes the data widely accessible and eliminates duplicated inefficient collections by disparate departments the platform will allow proactive based on concrete evidence furthermore vendors and private designers can easily access the data opening the door for innovative by outside actors investing in current systems as new technologies arise and the information technologies department purchases new systems current systems must not be forgotten systems already in place require constant upkeep and upgrades and will fail to perform as expected without continued investment centralization of information technology resources currently many disparate offices throughout the city have differing levels of information technology functions many of which are somewhat independent of the central information technologies department at times this creates duplicated efforts and wasted resources better collaboration is needed and more control of operations must be allocated to central information technologies all major expenditures and it decisions should be run through established governance procedures data management to better collect store manage and analyze data a data management strategy is needed with a centralized storage plan single point of data entry and strong data architecture the city of south bend could better capture and analyze data build organizational aptitude in order to build organizational aptitude and better utilize technology the city of south bend as an organization must cultivate a culture that views technology as a tool rather than an obstacle technology has the power to improve processes create databased and improve services to citizens to do so we must invest in human capital after determining where skills are lacking training must not only be completed but taken seriously when training sessions are not attended fully or done haphazardly the it department spends valuable resources answering questions and troubleshooting for employees to utilize these tools and not overuse the it department training final vision is paramount at the same time the information technologies department will continue to provide city employees with the proper tools to do their jobs effectively access to systems as technology continues to develop access to information and data remotely will enable city employees in the field to better do their jobs from police officers accessing information at a traffic stop to code enforcement the location of abandoned houses greater access to systems will increase efficiency the information technologies department must continue to implement innovative technologies to make mobile access to data secure intuitive and efficient leverage technology technology should improve the city of south bends regular business efficiency enabling employees to do their jobs easier and more effectively to do so the city must leverage technology to fulfill basic needs in the most efficient way from investing in training to devising better protocols greater levels of efficiency are clearly obtainable lastly the establishment of a tactical plan that prioritizes projects will allow resources to tackle the most pressing challenges strategic partnerships with current strategic partnerships vendors offer needed services that cannot be provided efficiently by core information technologies staff these relationships are essential to the functioning of the department and the city as a whole today software as a service solutions such as office and platform as a service will play an expanded role in south bends technology functions custom application development by private developers will also play an essential role often bridging gaps and filling needs establishing new partnerships and maintaining current ones will allow the city to adapt quickly to its constantly changing needs and new innovations external partnerships and community engagement the community should be seen as one of the biggest resources members of our community have the capacity to help solve a myriad of problems and community engagement is the only way to utilize them many resources in our community remain untapped our community is full of innovative people some of whom are already using data to help the city solve problems and improve quality of life with a set of common goals and a focus on community outreach these resources can be more fully utilized dames investment of a year towards research can be leveraged to analyze some of south bends problems such as dealing with vacant and abandoned homes enticing businesses to invest in final vision south bend and spurring economic growth many startups have already helped the city such as with many colleges nearby the expertise of students can also be leveraged through internship programs joining with the south bend community school corporation the city could potentially receive reduced prices on technology purchases as well systems integration and centralization currently many systems duplicate efforts and fail to share information interdepartmental sharing as well as sharing with st county can provide data in a more timely and effective manner some systems simply need to be integrated with others while others require consolidation in the end these efforts will reduce duplication and free up resources technology as the solution technology has the capacity to fix problems save the city money and create more effective government locally the use of to handle sewage flow has saved the city alone from advanced technologies such as to simpler technologies sold by vendors south bend should continue to look for technological solutions mission critical core infrastructure such as hp servers active directory networking systems etc platform as a service managed telephone service network device management office etc innovative solutions for student projects etc final vision when it comes to mission critical systems technology services will be delivered using solutions with continued investment in hardware and software mission critical systems will be supported with a proficient staff and reliable infrastructure strategic partnerships and innovative solution providers will also play a significant role keeping south bend on the cutting edge of technology some strategic partners will even provide services as a commodity such as telephony services as recent history has shown with projects like and partnerships often create innovative solutions to some of south bends most specific and troubling problems the utility these partnerships provide to the city cannot be understated final strategy strategy at the broadest level the strategic plan can be grouped into focus areas governance strengthening our organizational aptitude establishing policies procedures and standards data management and centralization governance centralization data management strengthen organizational aptitude policies procedures and standards governance a governance group will be created to ensure that the information technology departments resources and effort are allocated in a manner that furthers the goals this group will be responsible for the implementation of this plan and any corrections the governance group will meet regularly to prioritize projects recommend policies and standards and review progress of this plan strengthen organizational aptitude a concerted effort to build a foundation of technical knowledge must be undertaken sadly technical knowledge is lacking throughout our organization without departmental ownership of systems and technical proficiency this plan cannot be realized all departments including the information technologies department must increase training efforts and boost understanding of systems lastly as new technologies garner attention and resources existing systems must be preserved through final strategy continued investment outlined below are the three steps needed to increase city employee technical understanding a technology assessment of each employee and department should be completed to benchmark current skills this information will help prioritize and target areas needed for improvement improve information skills departmental ownership investment in existing systems both skills and staffing levels must be increased within the information technology department to support current and future development more staff would enable the department to pursue more developmental projects while continuing to maintain current technologies additional training among staff especially in will increase the it departments capacity to execute the strategic plan departmental ownership of software processes and training is critical too often departments rely on information technologies to troubleshoot pulling staff away from important projects to increase the capacity of information technologies departments must learn to thoroughly document manage and assess their processes as new software packages are implemented or technology processes are altered to increase the organizations capabilities and efficiency departments must attend these crucial training sessions final strategy a better understanding of current systems will add productivity as well unfortunately many systems have yet to be fully utilized for example software office and outlook require further training to increase productivity and efficiency policies procedures and standards the information technologies department along with the governance group will recommend the establishment of formal policies procedures and standards that make processes repeatable and efficient ensuring that policies procedures and standards are maintained allows our organization to establish and adhere to best practices policies policies will be will be developed and maintained by the recommendation of the governance group with assistance from the information technologies legal and human resources departments following the formal adoption the policies will be published on the website at any modification of the plan will follow the same procedures below is a comprehensive list of necessary policies current policies must be reviewed as quickly as possible currently many of these polices are maintained by the human resources department or are published on the website in addition this list be amended by the governance group information technologies legal and human resources as needed computer hardware information technologies policy computer software information technologies policy it purchasing information technologies policy email policy information technologies policy internet usage acceptable use information technologies policy remote access usage information technologies policy wireless usage information technologies policy bring your own device to be developed social media to be developed policy on city equipment issued to employees to be developed acceptable usage policy to be developed change management to be developed website content management to be developed final strategy open data to be developed privacy policy crime victim to be developed software compatibility to be developed purchasing review policy to be developed peripherals to be developed printers video energy facilities management etc it remote control policy to be developed backup policy to be developed security policies to be developed purge policy to be developed employee status change to be developed obsolete equipment disposal to be developed workstation replacement policy to be developed training and policy to be developed file structure and naming convention policy to be developed policy enforcement policy to be developed procedures creating effective procedures will establish best practices and repeatability documenting and formalizing best practices should be done wherever possible to perpetuate accepted processes establish an information technology service management catalog which identifies current information technology services the catalog will explain the process of requesting services and publicize service level agreements develop a business continuity and disaster recovery procedure mission critical systems must be identified and protected in the event of a disaster a plan must be in place to recover these essential systems in a timely manner and restore services systems that are defined as critical will also have an appropriate protection and recovery strategy creation of a procedure for effective implementation of new systems to enable systems to cohesively become a part of the organizations everyday processes a procedure must be created final strategy standards with the approval of the governance group the information technologies department will maintain a portfolio of standards to ensure systems coexist and function correctly below is a sample list of processes and technologies that require standards which will be published at a later date the governance group reserves the right to amend this list at any time database standards workstation specifications for desktops laptops and tablet computers workstation privileges server specifications including physical virtual and cloud computing infrastructure including routers switches wireless and firewall standards platform mission critical systems standards systems are required to protect citizens and provide effective efficient services database dual band radios storage infrastructure etc expertise in partnerships uptime and reliability critical systems allows innovative solutions at potentially lower cost of operation peripherals such as printers and copiers final strategy data management as the city continues to pursue databased solutions a data management strategy is needed data entry analyze storage publish replicate effectively capturing data is the first step data that is not collected cannot be reported so an emphasis on complete data capture is crucial once data is identified it must be stored in order to store data efficiently and avoid duplication a storage strategy will be created with many systems that hold different yet related sets of data replication is often necessary replicating data into and out of disparate systems will create consistency among data sources allowing for better analysis publishing data in human and machine readable formats will allow city departments to share frequently requested data when made widely accessible and consumable data will enable vendors to build applications departments to create innovative databased solutions and citizens to access data increased transparency and interdepartmental sharing is an essential part of good accessible government final strategy improved analysis of data will enable the city to pin point problems using concrete data better analysis of data will help create better solutions to pressing issues in south bend centralization strategy currently many processes are duplicated by different departments creating inefficiencies and wasted resources to eliminate these duplications many functions must be centralized after defining responsibilities with service level agreements departments will be able to better manage their technologies and contact the appropriate group or department for assistance public safety software centralized information technologies infrastructure backups database hardware software that touches multiple departments software final tactical path tactical path governance committee the governance committee will prioritize projects and recommend the creation of policies procedures and standards with a focus on realizing the goals of this plan the governance group will align technology development with the goals of the administration creation of policies procedures and standards the creation review and modification of policies procedures and standards must be completed as quickly as possible portfolio management as soon as possible the governance group will convene a meeting to prioritize projects all departments with technology needs will be invited to this meeting an independent and experienced rd party will moderate this discussion develop organizational aptitude employee understanding of technology as it relates to their job functions must be improved this plan cannot be realized without training and development across the entire organization not just within the information technology department to achieve the goals set forth in this plan assessments will be done to determine current skills and develop training plans information technologies training within the information technologies department further training and skill development is constantly needed currently the department primarily needs a better understanding of the system creation of departmental technology officers in an effort to create departmental ownership and bolster organizational aptitude each department will be assigned a technology officer technology officers will report to the director of information technologies examples of responsibilities include tier help desk support training and administration of employee training plans projects the list of projects below is a representative example of projects that must be completed actual identification of projects will be a shared responsibility for all departments including information final tactical path technologies to prevent biased the city will bring in a third party arbiter with technological knowledge to help assess the priorities open data initiative the development on an open data portal began in in an effort to provide data to code for and after researching various means to provide accessible data an open data platform fully met the needs of the previously mentioned vendors and additionally provided greater governmental transparency to citizens the open data platform allows the city to publish consume and analyze data like never before even providing the capabilities to make visualizations maps and charts that allow for better analysis with the platform in place data can be shared publicly and privately the public can view and download information freely private developers can access data to create new innovative applications at the same time this project presents challenges in determining what data must remain internal ultimately requiring the creation of data collection and dissemination protocols upgrade or replace current system the current system must be upgraded or replaced the importance of this system as well as the challenges of replacing it cannot be understated the city of south bend must fully commit to this project this project will require the most proficient staff from many key departments to be fully immersed on this project for many months or years to help complete the replacement although replacing the system is a giant and risky endeavor the outcome will provide additional capabilities that the city desperately needs in order to replace the system a needs assessment must first be conducted to analyze which system will more closely meet our current and future needs at this juncture the next system must offer more robust user reporting mobile access an database backend and a more intuitive user interface information technologies has included funding for the needs assessment in the proposed budget implementation of the new system would begin in early with a year implementation schedule depending on many factors including the vendor and product selected business continuity and disaster recovery plan the creation of a business continuity and disaster recovery plan is needed to ensure mission critical systems are protected at the highest reasonable level and that they can be restored as quickly as possible in the event of a disaster mission critical systems must be identified after combining many essential technologies and locations to better protect them the information technologies department will also develop a recovery plan that outlines processes to restore mission critical systems in the event of a disaster final tactical path establish integration to st county for critical data the city of south bend and st county duplicate many processes creating inefficiencies and wasted resources establishing integration with st county will help several departments be more efficient ideally the city of south bend and st county can integrate data collection and freely share data this will enable the city to access warrant information property ownership records assessed valuations zoning information commissioner sales tax sale information and other data consolidation law requires the consolidation of public safety answering point centers to no more than two locations per county by the end of currently st county clay fire and south bend all have locations necessitating immediate consolidation mobile field connectivity increasingly departments need to access internal resources while in the field the city must continue to secure private data while making mobile access intuitive and efficient resolving this challenge will increase efficiencies in all departments where considerable time is spent in the field vacant and abandoned housing data collection of vacant and abandoned houses has yet to be formalized continuing to develop tools and procedures for an effective vacant and abandoned housing strategy is necessary to meet the mayors goal of dealing with houses in days land management cleanup policies and procedures the city currently lacks an effective land management strategy a successful plan will create protocols to addresses remove duplicate entries and generate more accurate information technology also can be used to provide landowner information and create a field for the state tax id additionally the amount of incorrect information can be reduced by ensuring an address validation feature is enabled and the number of personnel with access to enter data is controlled an authoritative database would allow the city to more easily share data between systems such as and improving reporting and route optimization the networking infrastructure as the city constantly demands more of its network the information technologies department must assess the current capacity of networking infrastructure and plan for the future an examination of the network must confirm the infrastructure has the capacity to fulfill current needs but is also robust and flexible enough to deliver services in the future some of these steps include closing fiber loops for redundancy improving the backbone of the network to to assure available bandwidth increasing final tactical path internet connection speeds reviewing the network hardware and infrastructure for capacity and completing a security audit this examination will ensure the network and systems can withstand the burden of current needs and remain flexible enough to accommodate tomorrows demands strategic implementation an enterprise level strategic implementation will address many issues including governance database design data integrity data maintenance software training and infrastructure strategically investing in our current environment will give decision makers access to more complete data final tactical path potential tactical path establish governance group consolidation expand open data portal continued expand open data portal continued replacement replacement continued review and create policies needs assessment to replace develop organizational strength expand open data portal continued vacant and abandoned continued vacant and abandoned integration with county data systems open data portal effective land management strategy optimize use of code enforcement software business continuity network assessment strategic implementation strategic continued network backbone upgrade to implementation business software mobile field connectivity the realization of the ideal state will take multiple years and clearly there will be new goals and challenges that arise the governance group will be responsible for prioritizing projects assigning resources and monitoring the progress of this plan final organizational aptitude organizational aptitude a strong organizational aptitude is needed to execute this plan in addition to strengthening information technologies all departments must work under the same policies procedures and standards the chart on the next page illustrates the organization and leadership needed to execute this plan final organizational aptitude final organizational aptitude governance group the governance committee will meet regularly to discuss project further develop policies procedures and standards and alter the strategic plan when necessary of projects will be determined by several factors including impact efficiencies return on investment risk mitigation internal resources and the availability of outside expertise the governance group bears the responsibility of achieving the goals of the strategic plan the governance group will allocate resources and budgets for projects and should require performance measures to determine project success an initial project portfolio management discussion involving every department and moderated by a disinterested third party should be held as soon as possible in an effort to remove bias the disinterested third party will help prioritize the most important projects chief information officer the chief information officers role is to provide vision and leadership for developing and implementing information technology initiatives under the framework of the governance group the chief information officer directs the planning and implementation of enterprise it systems in support of business operations this individual will be responsible for all aspects of the organizations information technology and systems
