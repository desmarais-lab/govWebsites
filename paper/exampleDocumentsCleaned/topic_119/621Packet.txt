were discussed milestone quality and service level attainment milestones are onetime improvements that make our environment more productive single capability service levels measure performance such as availability of mainframe and servers the following discusses the progress made and additional issues to be resolved as part of the improvement plan service level improvement plan are ongoing performance measurements such as availability of mainframe and servers there are service level requirements in the contract last month it was reported that only of the were being reported of these met the contractual requirements this month are being reported of these are meeting contractual requirements this is largely due to an increase in the number of being reported in service area the hp and capabilities should report about more but this is dependent on implementation of those tools the improvement plan was successful in that more of the unreported in are now being reported for the first time the chart below describes the improvement in just the past month from this data a benchmark has been established for that area so that it will be possible to focus on performance improvement however when considering that we cannot assume those not reported are being met only of the are attained performance numbers have remained stagnant while there was a slight improvement in attainment from last month from to there is a concern that there are significant underlying issues not being addressed the progress is very slow outcome has requested a root cause analysis for in the area focused on desk top support and security request by service area reported only by service area met of total it board report monthly total of by service area per the contract of performance all service areas reported met not reported root cause analysis ticketing system in a root cause analysis was requested by to determine if the new tools being used in delivering services could be a factor in the poor attainment per this request the leadership team and technical team were brought to to understand the issues develop and complete the report and begin remediation plans the team in conjunction with identified issues the findings were mixed as no silver bullet was found call takers continue to have difficulty entering tickets there is a great deal of data entry required the problems were split between software fixes that will not be available until the st quarter of issues surrounding trying to fit needs into the standard configuration such as adding a department field and issues surrounding inadequate requirements gathered during transition it is unclear whether fixing these issues will lead to improved performance at the help desk outcome progress will continue to be updated weekly at status meetings at this time no status meetings have been scheduled by the it board has requested a meeting scheduled for th be held to gather information about the impact performance is having on the customer customers have been invited this workshop will be facilitated by consulting group root cause analysis hp hp is a product intended to sample the health of all devices and send reports for technical staff review this product has been installed on the network however there are some customization still required to realize the full benefits of monitoring network and server events on a proactive basis the technical staff is installing agents on the critical applications to monitor response time the full benefits of this product will be realized in the when the response time service level requirements are enabled there are over dependent on the implementation of this tool the report for it board report monthly this tool has not been delivered yet a consultant was assigned the week of th to work on an analysis of the tool milestone improvement plan as part of a milestone improvement plan had provided feedback to and executed a day plan to fix ten milestones asked to provide resources to work on milestone deliverables to improve the quality of the milestone deliverables and allow staff to focus on operations the improvement plan has been successful in that there has been progress made on milestones that were languishing delivered more milestones the past month for review than for the previous months of the contract because so many are in review at this point an assessment cannot be made as to whether quality has improved more information in will be provided of the ten milestones due previously and being reworked as part of the improvement plan have been accepted fully two others which require plans followed by implementations have had their plans accepted four are in the review process one is a scheduled test two contract milestones are being considered for scope changes at the request of these are the technology refresh plan which be trimmed down because an accurate asset data ensures a better plan and the technology plan where the

network response time analysis of existing of implement new user accounts within day benchmarking program service area projects backlog a third area of concern is being watched this month operations worked with during the month to prioritize and escalate the infrastructure projects in the queue this backlog is as a result of internal staff being dedicated to milestone deliverables and training on the new tools being implemented project management was minimal the first four months but at the request of two new project managers have joined and are charged with working on this project backlog has taken the charge of prioritizing the backlog for in an effort to help customer moves are prioritized the highest usually because of date requirements with upgrades and financial savings driving the priority of the remaining items on the list is recommending to that additional staff be brought in order to catch up the backlog and improve customer satisfaction service area asset management per request has assigned an additional project manager with project plan writing expertise for the purpose establishing a workable asset project plan for getting the asset database to the agreed to accuracy for legacy assets and accuracy of new assets currently has estimated that the legacy asset database is approximately accurate although requested to date has not been able to validate this approximation this project plan will also identify and establish uniform policies and enforcement as the method to achieving and maintaining the accuracy the progress of this project will continue to be monitored and by reoccurring updates feedback and consensus will likely be sought and needed at the it board and it steering committee levels as the asset management and enforcement methods are established as this will require enterprise in order to be successful it board report monthly service area application services application services had a good month in terms of problem tickets they
