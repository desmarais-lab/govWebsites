effectively its function is to provide a space for the computer to think usually the more memory a has the better able it is to perform multiple tasks at the same time or to run programs which require larger amounts of memory early computers required or megabytes or ram memory but with todays newer and faster computers the more memory a has the better it seems to work with memory intensive applications such as windows or office recently approved windows as the standard operating system for computers within the city of county enterprise with the introduction of many departments are either in the process of upgrading or will be upgrading to the new operating system managers should be aware of memory requirements for efficient operation of their when they begin planning for acquisition of new equipment windows needs more memory than previous windows versions just how much is the question says you can install on a machine with megabytes of ram granted will run on a with this much ram memory but it will probably run slowly and lock up occasionally we have with megabytes of ram in our enterprise runs on these systems but some applications not open or will open slowly a better guideline might be at megabytes a suitable level to handle most applications if you have a number of applications open simultaneously you need more memory or more to keep your running smoothly has approved the office suite as the standard for office applications this change should also be considered when deciding memory requirements as an example of the difference in memory usage for the office suite word excel access etc has published the following suggestions windows second edition requires of ram plus an additional of ram for each office program such as word running simultaneously example open applications windows with ms word and ms access memory required windows professional requires of ram plus an additional of ram for each office application such as word running
