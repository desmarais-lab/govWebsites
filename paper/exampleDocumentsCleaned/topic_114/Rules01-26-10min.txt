is referring gray said that the money was promised and then was suddenly no longer available for a project at th and said that he does not know the answer to that question offhand but he will inquire

important it is in helping to keep neighborhoods safe and strong said that it is very important and the mayor is taking the census very seriously he said that they are working closely with congressman office and census brown and smith and are committed to getting everyone counted he said that no budget comes with the census so there will be some bumps in the road and they will have to find funds elsewhere for media and getting the word out he said that they are meeting with schools and the business community and are talking about the census at every turn he said that the census helps cities get dollars from the state and federal government and right now is ranked as the th largest city with cities through being very close in numbers if citizens do not return their census forms it could result in dropping its rank and those rankings are very closely tied to formulas from which federal and state dollars come he said that there is a form of mistrust of the government with regard to the census in that people believe the government is tracking their every move he said that they want to diffuse this notion and help people understand how very important it is for each household to answer these very simple questions he said that with the last census taking place years ago reeducation is needed to look at the effects of the census in a broader way and they will rely heavily on

carried by a vote of chairman asked if there are any questions for regarding his reappointment sanders asked how perceives his role in relationship to the council stated that he has been doing this job long enough that he feels he has a more than fair conception of what his duties are he said that the rules of the council state that he is to represent the president and there is a whole series of administrative tasks with respect to the preparation of proposals upkeep of the municipal code advice and drafting of legislation and acting as parliamentarian during council meetings he said that he does his best to give an honest opinion when asked about procedure and to do so in a way that hopefully facilitates the process he said that this is not always achievable in the political realm and he does not always do it perfectly but he tries his best said that she has had some concerns over the past couple of years that when an opinion is asked for sometimes seems to give a personal opinion rather than that of actual law she said that she does not feel it is necessarily a partisan thing or a simple difference of opinion she stated that recently introduced legislation to allow for more meetings for commented that this proposal had to be addressed in that particular year because they could not change compensation in the subsequent year she said that she asked for the part of the statute from which derived his opinion and he did send it to her she said that she and other counsel looked at this citation and it is really referring to salary and per and not the number of meetings she said that there is also a provision in their own rules which allows the council as a whole to authorize a member of the council to participate with pay on a board she said that taken in totality the setting of compensation was clear and this proposal did not fall under that statute she said that she hopes going forward that will be a little more thorough before responding and giving advice chairman stated that any time an attorney gives an opinion on the law it will not necessarily agree with every other attorney he said that there are volumes of appeals based on varying opinions and not everyone will agree with one attorneys opinions all the time he said that has a wealth of experience in municipal law and he places a great deal of value on his opinion said that at one point in his career he oversaw the legal staff as a part of his duties he said that he learned that if he asked lawyers for their opinion he would not get a unanimous decision on anything and there is a variance between lawyers on lots of different subjects he said that he supports experience in this arena said that it does not seem to be just a difference of opinion such as in an instance with the recent proposal requested that an amendment be prepared by and it was not done in the proper format and was not consistent the administration has been adamant about things being done consistently and properly and this amendment should have been consistent sanders said that she understands that there are always different opinions but she has concerns about consistency across the board she said that she understands that is often flying by the seat of his pants and asked to render an opinion without notice but consistency seems to be lacking she said that she realizes there is a wealth of institutional experience but that does not give carte she said that everyone should be treated fairly relative to language submitted and information given without an infusion of personal opinion into ordinances plowman said that he has known for a very long time and he is also a constituent of his he said that when he has gone to with a question or a proposal he has at times told him things he did not want to hear he said that sometimes he is told that he can draft it however he wants but that it is not correct he said that takes time to show him why he cannot do it a certain way because of the council rules or laws he said that has always been a straight shooter with him whether he wanted to hear it or not he added that does a good job as general counsel and he would like to see him continue he said that even outside of differing legal opinions no one is perfect and able to make the correct judgment every time moved seconded by plowman to recommend the reappointment of general counsel to the full council the motion carried by a vote of with gray and sanders casting the negative votes chairman said that while he knows they usually prefer appointees to appear in person is extremely knowledgeable and to the committee members he said that has served administrations on both sides of the aisle and he would favor the committee moving forward with approval of his reappointment in his absence sanders said that did send an email asking for consideration to be reappointed and that goes a long way with her in showing that he recognizes this appointment is not an assumption to be made she said that is one of the reasons she continues to push to make sure these recommendations come through this committee as all appointees are subject to accountability she said that she appreciates that took the time to send the note chairman said that he also received the same note plowman said that he has dealt with for many years even before he was on the council even when is not in town he always responds in a timely fashion to his phone calls or emails he said that normally he would feel like this position needs to be filled by someone living in but has never been inaccessible and therefore he supports the reappointment chairman said that never has a negative word to say and always talks in a positive light he added that he is a wealth of information and totally forthcoming said that she cannot speak to the past two years but in her first term as worked with them in a very bipartisan manner to help solve funding issues she agreed that he has always been very accessible and responsive gray said that it will come as no surprise to that he will be opposing his reappointment in light of a letter sent to him by at the end of the budget year when he was president of the council moved seconded by to recommend the reappointment of chief financial officer to the full council the motion carried by a vote of with gray casting the negative vote
