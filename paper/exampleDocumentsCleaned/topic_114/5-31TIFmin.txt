several legislative changes that have impacted their ability to raise funds in capital projects especially for infrastructure said that in warren township they have had five consecutive years of av decline he said that five years ago their av was billion and now they are at about billion said that warren township has a growing school district infrastructure needs repairs to buildings maintenance and providing quality education stated that his capital projects fund is decreasing and they are able to do what they need to do with making the necessary changes but they battle av every year he said that he firmly believes that there has to be a balance between economic development and the granting of tax abatements or chief of financial and business services public schools stated that she agrees with she said that warren townships school corporation does not have any where has a ton of them ms said that has had six years of declining av and they are hit heavily with the circuit breaker ms said that the first year the circuit breaker impact was million and now for this year it is estimated to be million she said that when the are taking away av they are hitting the circuit breaker a lot sooner ms said that the way the department of local government finance calculates their budget is that the circuit breaker hits all of their funds based on the rate so they have to make up on debt service payments out of their funds which impacts what they can do in the way of buildings and technology ms said that she hopes that this commission considers the impact of not only the schools but other units of government when it comes to the impact on av stated that one of the things he has learned that was disturbing was that the current process does not provide adequate notification to affected local units he asked if ms or re familiar with limitations of notifications to local units after the fact said that he cannot speak to that from a warren township perspective because they do not have districts ms said that receives notification on hearings if there will be possible in the district she said that it is not enough detail and it would be nice to have the option of being on the committee as a discussing member even if they did not get to vote at least they will be heard as to tax increment financing study commission what kind of impact it might mean to them asked if ms and has an interest in doing that and not only coming before the commission but going before the council ms answered in the affirmative stating that she believes that all the school districts need to be a part of the discussion if they are affected executive director bond bank bond bank asked how many meetings they have attended ms said that usually the notification comes to the business office and it is forwarded to their facility management she said that young usually does the follow up asked if ms knows if young typically attends those meetings ms said that she is not sure city controller office of finance and management asked if either ms or have done any calculations with regards to what they think is the impact of capture ms answered in the negative stated that can be very beneficial but the creation of the should also include the opportunity for av he said that in several communities that has not happened where the revenue is exceeding the needs of the debt repayment and still capturing and keeping that additional av for future project needs he believes that additional of the should come back to the local government units to help supplement the loss of av that they have occurred said that it was believed that if a is established the base remains and the other taxing units do not get the increment but they will be no worse off in terms of av than they would the day the was established he said that they have learned that is not true and that base has further been eroded by the capture of increment necessary to shore up what is needed under the stated that with capital planning and the they require some sense of what the revenue streams will look like said that they have to make assumptions and understand where the av is he said that the surprise is down and if they got a one year they could not count on it being ongoing beyond that asked if has thoughts of expecting or counting on development to help with the av said that the initial intention is to benefit an area that has low assessed valuation and hoping to capture that in the future he said that in the district there are several that do not have expiration and there should be some end to a district and should not be ongoing state representative asked if and ms can share with hope council in writing an impact analysis of from different school corporations mike terry president and chief executive officer stated that from a perspective he thinks that it is a good instrument for economic development he said that is impacted when there is a freeze yet the hope would be in the future that they would reap some of the benefits terry said that when looking at some of the tax increment financing study commission benefits related to as far as an investment in infrastructure it primarily talks about streets and sidewalks he said that the importance of this transit system as another infrastructure should be invested in part of the community terry said that looking at the uses of funding it should be considered to invest in transit said that deals with the whole county not just providing service to select areas he said that this commission has learned that is a great tool but cannot be used to cover the whole county said that when the talk is about supplementing transit people will still need to walk to bus stops he said that they still need to figure out a way for walkable sidewalks and the like terry said that having a good pedestrian walkway or is critical other amenities in areas of development need to be transit ready rep asked if services township terry said that they partially cover going to ivy tech and the finance center but they do not contribute to their finances in terms of property tax rep said that has a good system to get people downtown but difficult to get across town he asked what benefit has been achieved from for crosstown or neighborhoods that are more isolated terry said that anytime there has been a redevelopment project those are individuals that are using service increasing their mobility he said that it has benefited them in terms of increasing their ridership terry said that anything they can do to support those developments and make them successful but he cannot say if they have benefited directly rep said that there has been some publicity about a proposal to expand that will be fueled by an income tax increase he asked if any portion of that will be property tax reliant terry said that his understanding is that the funding in county will remain the same he said an addition would be whatever the referendum would be said that he thought were going to be a part of financing terry said that it is probably still in the mix but be for a specific mode rep said that he did not know that a portion of this was going to be said he thought he had heard that could be a source said the when development is done it puts demand on he said that depends on additional revenue sources asked if it is fair to say if a puts a demand on the system and they will not see those dollars because it will be used for terry said that would play out if they were adding service or maxed out their capacity terry said that of their is their budget he said that the rest is state federal and local tax he said that they are using their federal dollars for capital and that capital is important to them because they have aging fleet said that in terms of capital planning a more reliable stream is either an overall increase in av or not capturing that is a positive thing for tax increment financing study commission because of the dependability of that income he asked if terry could speak to funding capital needs and revenues associated terry said that if the av is increasing and given all of the caps issues if they have more property tax revenues to support they will not have to use as much of the federal money said that is basically in need of capital and they are using what would be funds that could be used to expand service but because of the capital needs they are using federal dollars for fleet terry answered in the affirmative asked if created will bring residents that ride and additional funding to terry answered in the affirmative stating that the current federal funding formula is based on miles and ridership but it is an average and it does have impact asked if has ever had an analysis on how much they are losing due to being here or there terry answered in the negative ed chair metropolitan development commission asked when terry became the president of terry said that he came in asked if terry could give an indication of the amount of property tax money that has gone to over the last five years terry said that it is more he said that the council supported an excess levy that they were able to increase their property taxes terry said that the tax caps have been a challenge asked if income remains flat and their expenses go up how will they meet that terry said they have been able to find a number of efficiencies by managing the workforce better costs and managing fuel costs terry said that there is a point where it comes beyond their challenge trying to keep service on the street and their fare structure at the same level asked is it fair to say that operating tolerance is given in to the impact of property tax cap and that there is not an insignificant impact terry answered in the affirmative stating that they are living hand to mouth they have no reserves and they have to manage whatever the projected revenues are asked when terry sees development happening if they anticipate looking to the future of hopefulness to see development that might be av collected terry rep asked if receives a percentage of the states sales tax terry answered in the negative stating that because of the public mass transit fund which was a contribution by a percentage of sales tax it is now line item in budget in the state budget rep asked if they still have access to the funds terry said that they still have distribution it is not sales tax funded just a line item asked what operating levy versus their cumulative fund amount is financial consultant stated that it is nine cents he said that one cent goes to the cumulative fund two cents to the debt service and about four cents to their operating fund asked if their operating levy is not a maximum levy controlled dollar amount said not anymore he said tax increment financing study commission that there are several things to add to it and the growth factor increases the rate which gives more money said that operating is levy controlled asked how much is receiving in their cumulative capital fund said it was about million asked if terry felt better or worse about their contribution from the state terry said he would much rather have dedicated funding sources trustee warren township stated that when used appropriately is an excellent financial tool one of the few that generates economic growth in areas that might not otherwise be developed he said that with four districts two of them located at warren township includes approximately one percent of the total av said that successful areas catalyze projects that would not have otherwise occurred but for the action of the city he said that without net av remain stagnant in once blighted areas and the city would continue to have blocks and blocks of vacant lots and neglected housing said that when development is done and those developments do not pay into services that are provided through property taxes he asked if it is important for warren township that the ability to provide public safety services with limited public property tax dollars and other funding sources said absolutely with the issue of the circuit breaker as it was he said that when he looks at development in warren township the first thing he thinks about is new jobs said that would ultimately impact their budget more favorably because their primary source of funding is county option income tax rep asked if the is in warren township civil said that is correct rep asked if park village is still a disaster area said that park was the victim of part of a massive mortgage fraud scheme and half of the neighborhood remains empty rep asked what has been the benefit of in that particular neighborhood said that he cannot say that had any impact on that neighborhood he said that it has benefited the property miser director department of public works reviewed a presentation in detail which is attached as exhibit a ms miser said that four main areas are policy and planning engineering operations and fleet services she said that the deteriorating infrastructure is a significant local and national issue is also faced with adequately maintaining and replacing their fleet recycling solid waste park maintenance and forestry management all with a declining revenue ms miser said that in overall infrastructure need was almost billion she said that in they spent million and is on track to spend around million in ms miser said that even with that amount of spending their remaining needs continues to grow and will be in the range of billion going forward tax increment financing study commission ms miser said that historically they have used funds from the utility fund and traditional transportation fund to address infrastructure needs she said that in and those traditional sources were a bit higher thanks to the stimulus funding from the recovery and reinvestment act ms miser said that when the funds are depleted in there will be a dramatic decline in revenue they are already working on creative ways to increase their funding for infrastructure needs she said that without any additional resources will only have less than million a year to spend on capital projects ms miser said that on average resurfacing a road can cost about per lane mile she said that if they wanted to do curbs and sidewalks it is per linear foot with existing sidewalks on both sides of the street ms miser said that traffic signals are about per intersection asked that with regards to curbs and sidewalks it is referenced at per linear feet he asked if that is standard width deputy director of transportation engineering said that it is an approximation based on a sidewalk on both sides of the street ms miser said that has used very little funds she said that they do a lot of work in districts with other types of money ms miser said that their use of money is about million and the most was in for street in million was used in the united northwest area and the asked if the city has always been falling behind with infrastructure said that they have not caught up he said that estimated to maintain their current status they should be investing about million every year and that is based on the inventory they had at the time said that they have only reached that once and that was with the addition of funds asked if there have always been parts of the city that were neglected said that there was no way that could serve the needs of the entire county based on the funding structure asked at one point did it get so overwhelming and if there was ever a time where the city did not have any infrastructure deficit said that he does not know if they were as knowledgeable at the time he said that has been reducing their budgets almost every year in the last years which gives them less money to devote to capital asked if the million is across all categories of infrastructure said it is just for transportation asked in terms of bonding or borrowing what role acquiring of debt has on the kind of infrastructure to reduce maintenance costs ms miser said that these are revenue bonds that have been acquired over the years by currently paying on tax increment financing study commission those she said that is reluctant to do any more of those because the gas tax is declining and that is their only source of revenue if they bond against that will be paying for it for the next years and will not have enough funds to maintain what they have asked if it is true that at one point the city took on the responsibility to maintain the roads for a single payment ms miser said that was done back in the early and it was a relinquishment deal the value of that infrastructure was determined and the state gave the city a lump sum payment to take over those pieces inside i asked if that helps explain why the need seems to be greater said from a capital expense yes because is responsible for the roadways within i and it is also an operational impact because they now have to plow when it snows rep said that some funds were used for infrastructure in the and he thought it was money generated in excess he said that there was no debt so this was all increment rep asked if supplemented those funds or if that was from the increment on that said that in used about million of revenues to do the martin king street corridor rep asked if there were other in the county that has happened to or if this was isolated said that it was relatively isolated asked if there was an ordinance passed by the council that placed an infrastructure obligation on developers of new development said that he does not remember the year it was done but new developers are now required to put sidewalks on their perimeter boundaries brad director ball state university center stated that have to come from some place he said that if they do not come from anywhere then it is kind of like shooting from the hip he said that some issues arise when there are that are done in a vacuum there is no form of strategy policy or vision behind them said that without investment in planning activities it will be realized later that it was not a good choice said that are one strategy to deal with abandon houses he said that do not solve everything they are an important tool if they are backed up by longterm public policy strategy regulations and vision and to do that there has to be an investment made in the people and the capacity of the city to plan asked if agrees that a is an almost tactical tool used in a small relative area said that are strategic surgical tools he said that the goal is to always increase the tax base said that he often finds it disappointing that do not expire he said that redevelopment is never cheaper than new development said that if there is ever any hope of attracting massive amounts of new development something has to be done to offset the tax increment financing study commission cost differential he said that in certain neighborhoods are one way to do that in redevelopment areas have to be done to make it attractive to redevelopment asked if it makes more sense to redevelop the existing structures from a cost perspective versus doing brand new housing developments said that the problems in the decaying neighborhoods are that the city is not growing as much as a region people are being moved around said that housing policy is not necessarily a neighborhood or county problem it is more of a regional problem in that we are robbing peter to pay asked if the city could benefit from a more comprehensive economic development plan said that he is a firm believer that communities need to drive their future he said that there are communities that have made investments in transit said that this city has chronically undervalued the public realm in the communities for decades chair stated that a few meetings back asked for an explanation between bonds and general obligation go bonds stated that the go bonds are and therefore comes with the lowest interest rate possible he said that most of the bonds are and can vary based on the district said that the difference between an bond and an go bond is basis points he said that one basis point is one of a percent and basis points is point two percent said that there is an additional cost for the bond and having a reserve fund because interest is paid on the reserve amount until it is used to make the last debt payment he said that it varies depending on the size and the term of the bond said that the other consideration taken into account is that state law requires a referendum through go bonds and there is a cost associated with that he said that another consideration is the risk of a go downgrade said that the more frequently used go pledges the lower the ratings will be he said that the city currently has about million in outstanding go debt asked how much extra is borrowed said that it is of the principal amount asked if the basis points will go up said that it can go because it is a snapshot of the market he said that right now there is no difference asked what types of expenses will be paid on a million bond said that it is used to pay legal fees to financial advisors and investment bankers hunter asked who holds the reserve amount said it is held by the trustee who is a representative of the bond holder hunter asked if they reinvest those funds and if the interest goes back to the project or if they keep it answered that it goes back to the issuer hunter asked at the end of the project if the million goes back into the fund said that it would go back into the debt service fund to pay the debt payments tax increment financing study commission said that the reserve funds are set aside for interest payments answered in the affirmative he said that when paying bond holders they would have to be paid from somewhere it is not an additional expense because it is already there he said that the cost is the interest that is paid on the capitalized interest asked that when doing interest rates according to that are attached to an already existing and productive if it is far less risky than establishing a new one said generally yes pat citizen stated that she wished that there was an organization that could have been called on to speak for the taxpaying public outside the government ms said that the overriding purpose of a is to give the executive of a city a fund that can be established so that money can be put in toward businesses who seem to benefit more than the residents she asked that if a had to be sold in a referendum what kind of real promises are to be made ms said that she lives in a affected area and she feels the effect of a poorly thought out impact from the the homeowners in township have to cover the cost of the schools ms stated that do not always work well for everybody and giving a false impression that this type of economic development is going to benefit everyone is wrong citizen stated that this city needs to get back to the basics of what has already worked he said that this city needs to have actions congruent to what everyone has been saying for years this city needs a new strategic way and the four or five economic development areas to be he said that this city needs the center impact projects and they need to have sustainable solutions that will leverage the private equity to come back in and leverage other private equity to create other successes
