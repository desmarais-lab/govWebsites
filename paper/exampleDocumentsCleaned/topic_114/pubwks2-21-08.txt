foundation chair hunter called the meeting to order at pm with the following members present scales and mike speedy arrived shortly thereafter proposal no appoints smith to the board of public works scales addressed chairman hunter with an amendment to strike the name smith everywhere it appears including the digest and replace it with the name scales moved seconded by speedy to amend proposal no as shown on exhibit a the motion carried by a vote of chair hunter asked if was in attendance was not present chair hunter said they would move the proposal to the end of the agenda to allow time to arrive department of public works transportation general fund to fund the resurfacing design inspection and construction of the streets used in as local detour routes for the super project financed by reimbursements from the department of transportation cleaver assistant administrator of capital improvement financing for department of public works said that this proposal requests that from the transportation general fund balance be reimbursed by monies from the department of transportation he said that last year during the super project the state agreed to enter into an agreement with the city for damages to local streets as a result of detour routes created by the work performed on the interstate this year they are actually doing the work and they need the money appropriated in their budget money was not appropriated in their budget he said at the time they were requested to come back before the council committee and seek to put that money back into their budget this action has no impact on the transportation general fund balance since it will be reimbursed with dollar amounts that will be spent from this appropriation cleaver introduced who is over the transportation section in the engineering division and asked if there any questions about the streets that were on the list asked what streets were going to be covered distributed a handout attached as exhibit and said that part of the agreement with and the city of includes a specific set of street segments and estimated costs to do repairs on those segments he said this negotiated agreement with was based on anticipated damage of the streets which would receive the most traffic and could incur the most damage said these street segments were agreed upon in and it was agreed they would reimburse for expenses due to resurfacing all except post road because it is a concrete street which will receive a concrete joint speedy asked when they anticipate the state reimbursing the city for this money cleaver said they will be reimbursed after the work has been performed he said they have to do the work up front and the first project is in design right now the first project is pending going out to bid and waiting on council action to approve or deny he said they invoice one at a time and the project is completed based on the agreement speedy asked if the state had the money already budgeted or if they have to seek certain appropriations as well cleaver said that in the past they have issued purchase orders for a dollar amount to reimburse he can find out for sure but that is the typical way he said just like the city they would have issued a purchase order to a particular vendor if they had awarded a contract speedy asked if the state paid pretty promptly cleaver said they are still in negotiations from the first round of reimbursements on this particular project he said as part of this agreement last year they purchased speed indicator signs for school zones used a police helicopter for traffic observation operations group patched potholes and extra safety personnel were put on the streets for handling traffic he said there have been three invoices submitted and the state is still reviewing those invoices two invoices were submitted in and a revised one was submitted in currently the reimbursement amount is approximately asked if this was going to be one bid or separate bids for each street said that currently design and inspection is under contract he said they not be blended with one program they are bid out in two packages and maybe three confirmed again that there could be more than one company to do all of these projects replied in the affirmative asked about the other streets that be impacted in that area that are not listed on attachment a and if these streets will be worked on she asked if there is any type of consideration for the streets that have not been listed said they have their program which is county wide and there are some streets in that general area that are selected to be a part of the repairs he said they are still reviewing that program as far as the total amount from a funding standpoint he said the potential be there to consider other streets but they have to take something off the table he also said they had planned on doing a street in that area if it had gotten real bad but he said they had already negotiated these repairs a year ago as to what they thought the condition would be this time this year he does not think they have the ability to change these segments or limits and the only other way they could do it is with their own funding commented that later on they have to approve other streets with the funding they get replied this would have to be done with normal funding asked when they might be finished with the repairs she said she realizes they did not have a start date but asked when they hope to be finished said they hope to have everything done by at the latest but he thinks it be sooner he said if they could get council approval on these bids and get them under contract they could start work immediately because asphalt plans start up in said east th street is in pretty bad shape from avenue east and she was not sure how much of that traffic was redirected off of avenue or avenue onto th street she asked if there are any plans for th street in that area said he knows they have it on their list to look at but he does not know that it is an issue right now he said that he will look into it and get back with her asked since these are separate from the normal list the have and since they have already been discussed with the people on the committee are they going to be easier to bid than going through the normal process for or will there be a different process for all the different districts cleaver said the only thing different is that they will bid it in packages for only these streets he said that there might be five street segments in one and four in another normally they have bigger projects sometimes projects all over two or three townships cleaver said they are keeping them separate to make it easy to reconcile financially said she noticed that in their bid these costs were figured a year ago she wanted to know since these costs were done a year ago is it a possibility the cost will be higher now and if so who would pick up the difference said they are estimates and if it goes higher than the dollar amount the city would have to cover anything over that he said that is the way the agreement reads they are estimates and they are fairly comfortable with the costs but the market will tell them for sure clerks note arrived at pm asked at the time of the estimates if they knew that it was not going to be done for another year said that was correct they knew at that time it would be bid chair hunter asked if east street from i to post road is in included in the first phase with this being under control does have to do anything with that said outside of i is an project and it is not the moved seconded by to send proposal no chair hunter asked the clerk to add his name to proposal no as well proposal no approves an appropriation of in the budget of the department of public work transportation general fund to fund the construction of phases and and the related project design costs for future phases of the downtown cultural trail funded by a grant from the central community foundation cleaver said that miser administrator in the engineering department of is the in the department overseeing this project he said this proposal is a request to appropriate of funds donated to the central community foundation and provided to the city of through a grant to provide for ongoing design and inspection of the cultural trail project he said the first phase is right outside the window on and is nearing completion the landscaping should be done by early spring that project is winding down and the next two phases will be going to construction later this spring or mid summer he said the funds they are appropriating today will probably be spent over the next twelve to months and will be used to match some federal funds that have been earmarked for downtown projects he said he could answer any questions on the funding aspect and could answer specific questions about the trail project and its impact scales asked if there is something written into this agreement that if the expenses exceed what has been granted would the city be responsible to complete the project cleaver responded that it has been their consistent commitment since this project started that there would be minimal contribution by the city he said that so far the only city funds that have been applied to this project were for the resurfacing of street last year in conjunction with the trail project construction the city agreed that they should probably resurface the street as a part of the project and replace parking meters for projects since the city administers the parking meter program other than that it is a case by case basis he said if they find an unknown that they feel is their problem and creation then the city be involved financially from the standpoint of paying for any overruns on the construction or any aspect of the project their limitation is very clear and it has been from the beginning he said this project is to use only the donated funds from the central community foundation donated to the city it is appropriated in their budget and should be spent as matching and direct funds to contractors and design and inspection firms for the completion of this project he said they are trying to limit any funds of any capital improvement that would be dedicated toward this project he also said to date they have reserved about of actual city funds for this project which was for the resurfacing of street cleaver said there was some minor cleanup at one location and a purchase of replacement parking meters but other than that they have spent million dollars to date and of that are city funds said that she just wanted to stress for the public that these are private funds that are going for the cultural trail she said as someone who travels on street it desperately needed to be repaved said that sometimes when the public sees these appropriations it is really a formality or technicality that they have to go through when they really private funds she wants the public to understand that these are not city funds going to this type of project when other streets desperately need repair asked if they know how many people are going to be involved in the next two phases he said is a straight shot and probably the smallest phase so far but it took every bit to get it done in time and now there is going to be significantly more work being done in these next two phases next year ms miser explained that there are two phases the first phase will be the northeast corridor that will start at north and and extend to the and that will be bid as one contract she said the second or third phase is the north corridor from north and all the way to and at the campus a map of the boundaries is attached as exhibit she said there will be two separate contracts and two contracting firms will be working on that scales said that she had the opportunity to attend the storm water drainage symposium the other night and they were talking about using some innovating new techniques for overflow to provide for bike paths she asked if the department is familiar with that and if they had given that consideration in this project ms miser said they are doing that on street she said they are called planters and they trap extra they provide filtration so that less of the discharge goes into the combined sewer overflows they are being used throughout the trail scales asked if they would continue to be used ms miser responded in the affirmative chair hunter said he would just like to echo what stated that it is important for the public to understand that these are private funds this project is great for a city of this size and it is great that then are able to raise the funding to do this speedy moved seconded by to send proposal no to proposal no appoints smith to the board of public works chair hunter said the committee members have a brief resume from whose name was substituted for the original appointee smith is now present and ready for questioning said she looked over the resume that was provided and obviously adds a great deal of benefit to this board she asked if he or his company provide services to the city of answered in the negative and said that they do no engineering consulting through companies with the city asked if he perceived that there would be a conflict of interest replied that he did not asked if he could describe a little more about what his company does said his company provides engineering and management services he said for example he does engineering for a company that is in the wastewater treatment business they produce oxygenation systems for wastewater he is the pump consultant for them and has spent years of his career in the pump business that is what he is focused on now he is also working for the employer from which he retired as an engineering consultant and that is also pump business asked if it is related to the city said that it is located in but they do not do business with the city he said he has no way to do business with the city through that company asked if there is anything that he would like to tell the committee about himself other than what is on his resume said when an acquaintance of his called and mentioned the possibility of serving on the board because of his engineering experience he did not have to think about it very long he has lived in with his wife and kids for a total of years they have raised their family here he started his engineering company upon retirement from the pump company although he has lived all over the country he made the decision to stay in because he loves the city he said that he could not think of a finer place to live having said that he now has some time available he thinks that his engineering and management experience will benefit the city if can benefit from that that is what he would like to do thanked for the dedication that it
