refund a portion of the bonds due to a lower interest rate the city used the savings generated from that refunding to pay down a portion of the lily obligation the key benefit of the refunding bonds

that the appeals for through were resolved and lily will be due a refund because they paid the taxes as if there were no appeal asked if the situation will get worse said once the appeal is settled

lily paid the short fall they would still receive reimbursement from the city answered in the affirmative he said whatever the interest is on the bond that lily is required to make a payment on is the amount that carries on the reimbursement chairwoman asked if the annual revenue of million includes the tax abatement answered in the affirmative referred to page six of exhibit a and asked if lily

bonds that are being paid on he said that the bond issue contained different structures within the bond asked if the blended rate is specific for the bonds or if the blended rate is for both the and bonds said that the bended rate is only for he said that in the refunding was only at the bond bank level so the taxpayer agreement is on the city bonds which are all bonds chairwoman asked if the city will save money by paying off the obligation answered in the affirmative asked if there is any other debt against this answered in the negative said that he had many issues with this refunding but after reviewing what happened in the early years he was concerned that during those years there was an increment because lily had successfully appealed all the assessed values drove the cost down paid the difference and then earned interest on that but that was not the case he said that the first appeal was in and that is when things started to change with the market values and the city fell behind in property tax billings said the other big issue was in when the school general fund tax rates the welfare tax rates and police and fire pension tax rates came out causing tax rates to go down of the rate he said when entering into these types of financing seek a firm that knows how provide better projections he said that this is a good opportunity to do the refund based on the current

the affirmative he said that if they use these funds for an economic development project it would allow the city to do it on a basis asked if the city issues these funds as tax exempt if lily will have to use the fund for something in economic development said that is the easiest solution but if does not use the fund for economic development then it would just take a more thorough analysis asked if the city will require any kind of new taxpayer agreement for their use of the funds said that if the north of south development is approved then they would agree include a new taxpayer agreement if not then they would probably continue the analysis and see if they could get there on a basis asked if lily could be asked to invest the funding into other types of economic development said that they could be asked moved seconded by to send proposal no vote of with lewis and casting the negative votes asked if there are any other types of agreements like this taxpayer agreement said that this is the only transaction that he is aware of he said that part of the reason is because the city was so concentrated on one taxpayer said that part of her reason for wanting to get this transaction refinanced is not only for the favorable interest rates but also to get rid of this particular deal she said that this transaction was more favorable for lily
