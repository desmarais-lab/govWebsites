metropolitan development said the designation is along a portion of the canal and white river state park cultural district she said this law was passed to create an incentive for retail development along riverfront areas she said in the past a restaurant would only need a letter from the mayor and evidence of expenditures in the area but now the area requires a previous designation of a revitalization district ms banning said one of the top amenities that visitors would like to see the most is and restaurants along the canal she said some disadvantages that property owners and potential retail developers have cited are the perceived lack of parking lack of street level visibility and access for deliveries she said this designation and the ability to obtain an off quota license will help counter some of these disadvantages ms banning said retail development is also an economic development and work force development strategy stated that at this time he is not in support of the proposal because of the four million dollars of city funds and fifteen million dollars of state funds being used he also stated his concern that the canal will no longer be family friendly with this proposal and there are no places to park ms banning said the money spent was from a revenue bond that was generated therefore no money came out of the general fund she said full

of life for those who want to live downtown asked why the designation is not the length of the canal ms banning said one of the criteria was the area had to formally be designated as a redevelopment
