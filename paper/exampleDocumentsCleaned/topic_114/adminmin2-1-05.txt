acting chair proposal no creates a fund to be known as the delinquent business personal property settlement fund proposal no approving the installment tax payment plan for certain real estate taxes acting chair called the meeting to order at pm with the following members present brown plowman and also present was and earl proposal no creates a fund to be known as the delinquent business personal property settlement fund acting chair said her concern with this proposal is that it represents a significant contract that is not included in any of the agencies budgets she said the contract is being treated off line without an appropriation from the council township assessor and president of the township assessors in county said the assessors have the responsibility of auditing personal property but have not been able to have a significant amount of qualified people to audit the returns he said tax management associates offered to provide audit service to the assessors will charge a fee per file and the assessors would be able to receive the money that was under valued or omitted the assessors will then pay from the amount received and then distributes the remaining amount said the contract states that if collects a million dollars and their fee is million can never collect more than what they find in the under valued property he said the case history on returns has been about for every million dollars one can expect million back in return said the problem they ran into was tracking the funds to pay their property system does not have the ability to track funds he said it was the auditors opinion to have an ordinance enabling to have a special fund said he has spoken with a representative from information services agency who has indicated that it take hours to reprogram the current system to be able to track funds center township assessor said over the years the assessors have came to the council suggesting that there was additional revenue the assessors could receive if they had the ability to hire someone to do audits center township deputy assessor said since has found in assessed value in center township alone which roughly estimates to taxed brown asked if there are any draw backs to the business community said it actually is a positive for the business community too is not only looking for just under valued or omitted revenue but a business can find out they are over reporting this service can be an up side for business and residential properties brown asked if each township assessor is picking the criteria for the audit from the same objective material replied in the negative and said they have a group that meets with the business personal property deputies and they look at universal companies that are throughout the townships then each township has the opportunity to choose which businesses are audited he said the township assessor can pick all the businesses to be audit the groups goal is to get a good cross section of those businesses that are over or under certain limits brown asked if their method and choosing which businesses are audited prevents discrimination said all the details that are discussed with personal property deputies are the same criteria he said he cannot speak for individual assessors but added that they do not intend to discriminate against anyone the main goal is to get the best and most correct assessment representative of said they suggest to audit anyone who files and above clarified their method of choosing who is audited he said cannot do all their and above audits in the same year therefore the assessors will pick those who get audited in addition to the universal businesses asked the following questions how long are the audits how long will the fund be needed what is the time frame on distribution of the funds when does the money get back to the entities said some townships sent their entire lists others picked their audits for the first year he said will most likely pick a certain amount of audits out of each township said they should have all their audits completed by he said the fund will be needed until the end of due to the distribution of funds at the end of said it is up to the auditors office on when funds are distributed initially the auditors office will make sure is paid before they distribute any money asked if they are doing townships simultaneously replied in the affirmative asked how the funds are being disbursed said the assessors agreed to pool the money and pay he said the auditor makes the decision on when the excess funds are distributed deputy auditor said she is unsure of the to distribute the money but the excess funds are to go back to the taxing units that are entitled to the money asked what happens to the money in does it go to the taxing district or to the fund said this would need to be worked out between the auditor and the treasurer he said these are details that have to be decided asked if they are sure that enough revenue will be collected on the under reported funds to exceed the bills said he believes there will be a ratio if the bill is million then the income should be to million said until they can track revenue onto the main bill they will not have an absolute figure said she believes some of the questions on the fund can be answered if the assessments are approached on a county wide basis she said maybe the fair way to distribute the excess money is to take the tax break out and divide the money by those tax rates for every unit said he does not understand how doing it on a county wide basis will change the situation the statute says that the excess money has to be distributed back to the taxing unit he said having one assessor is not going to change the relationship on how the money is distributed the advantage of having nine assessors is that they know their townships and will audit those they suspect first and eventually audit everyone else said an amendment to the proposal has been explored to put a sunset end date on the fund she said the thinking behind the amendment is to have a fresh starting point but eventually have the personal audits be treated as a normal cost of the assessing process said she has an objection to the sunset date she said indicated that the agreement for the special fund would be to to prevent any problems with distribution she said budgets are done before the end of the year therefore the council will know the cost if a budget is foreseen in ms said the auditors office can make the end dates to any preference the council requests this will prevent anything from processing after that point of time land treasurers office said the treasurers office believes this fund is workable just a matter of mechanics she said the auditors and treasurers office will be required to do extensive manual labor in tracking the special assessments ms land expressed her only concern with the proposal is being able to track additional distributions moved seconded by brown to amend proposal no per exhibit a this motion carried by a vote of moved seconded by brown to send proposal no to the full council with a do pass as amended
