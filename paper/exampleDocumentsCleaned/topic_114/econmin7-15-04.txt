development presentation city of economic development director presentation on recent economic development activity in the city of chair sanders said that would give the council an update on economic development activities in the city headquarters project ms said there are two major and exciting economic development projects happening in the city of she said the first project is the headquarters project and john chief administrator and operating officer for property group will join in the presentation she said director of the airport would present the second project will discuss the former united airline facility now the maintenance facility and the new tenant that the airport authority city and state recruited to locate in the facility ms said the new airport tenant would provide hundreds of jobs ms said the project is a terrific opportunity for downtown to retain a headquarters that any other city would die to have she that it would keep over employees in the downtown area she said it is a project where the company is willing to commit millions of dollars approximately to the project she said that showed a significant commitment that they will be in the city for the longterm ms said it is an opportunity to take what is currently an open space and enhance it by adding the building on a very small portion of the space and work to preserve the remainder as open ms said the capital improvement board owns the land at issue and according to legal counsel the land is not currently protected as open space so it could be developed she said as part of the project would transfer the land and work with the company to accommodate the headquarter on a small portion legal protection will be put in place for the longterm for the remaining land to be committed to open space ms said it is important to note the impact of having a world headquarters like in the downtown area she said there are an estimated employees spending approximately annually this is important to downtown businesses such as the mall which relies heavily on downtown patrons as well as convention visitors she said the project will bolster center townships tax base over the long term currently the property does not generate taxes in addition to the investment from there will be hundreds of thousands of dollars per year in new taxes generated that were not previously on the books ms said financing for the project is tied to the new increment in the downtown area the new increment associated with the new building will generate funds as well as other downtown development that will support the bond issue which has already gone through the economic development commission the metropolitan development commission and the metropolitan development committee she said the city is supporting a year tax abatement the abatement is not an exemption because the company will still pay over the year period approximately she said once the abatement runs out after years it is estimated that property taxes will be about ms said john from was the lead negotiator on the project for and he would give an update on the project from perspective said is pleased about the prospect of building their worldwide headquarters on capital commons which is across the street from where the company has been for the last years he said it is important to make the project happen and it is the first time will own real estate in which offices will be housed he said ironically being in the real estate business and having property in states it is remarkable that they have yet to build a corporate headquarters said for the last years has looked at owning a corporate headquarters said the new building is approximately square feet he said it will give about square feet of expandable space he said today has employees and over the course of they will be adding another employees he said previous information provided to the various city organizations had numbers that were lower but had a recent acquisition and did some expansion said they are in the process of filling a number of jobs that are above and beyond the budgets so the population is growing at a rapid rate he said takes between hotel room nights per year for national retailers coming to visit the headquarters said they try to get many of the retail deals done in versus the conventions that take place in various cities around the country having properties in countries with high prospects for china no one knows what that could mean for the city of in terms of exposure around the world said they would like to have a showcase building to show national retailers vendors and partners said the building is going to be as high as the national city center building and could be potentially as high as the top of the restaurant eagles nest he said they tried to situate the building so that it would be on minimum footprint with the thought of preserving as much of the park and its value as possible he said there are thirteen building scenarios in the design and they are working hard to create a building that will do a number of things that will allow pedestrians to experience both ends of the green space by having a view through the building he said the building will be three levels at the lobby he said the building will be on the northeast section of capital commons and will allow for a view from the main entrance of the convention center to the state capitol building the vista that everyone wants will be preserved this was another reason to locate the building to the far northeast corner said when they studied where to put the building the northeast was the best location to preserve the value of the park he said they have gotten a lot of feedback and challenges from people to look at other options but after a lot of research and thirteen architects going through the information it was obvious to that capital commons was the best location said the project is very expensive for in the area of he said when they analyzed where to put the building they had three sets of objectives and looked over two years at possible sites one was a building that was economically and financially viable some sites are more expensive than other sites and wanted the location downtown and wanted it to be suitable to the shareholders and employees said the project continues to grow in scope design changes to accommodate the park and public are very expensive he said has an premium they are putting on the project to stay downtown and said is making a big investment to stay downtown he said they predict they will put between into the reconstruction of the parking deck he said when you put into a deck and compare that to free parking during the day for people investing that money into stock alone pays dividends that will pay for the parking therefore it is a trade off it is contribution to the site in return for the city providing with parking said it is a fair deal on the part of and the city he said also stepped up to make the project work said the project has been creatively structured and a lot of hard work was done to make it happen said the building is going to be approximately fourteen floors he said wants to put a on the building which has a reflective capability both on the front center section and back section on the front section of the building with a rounded glass that is tilted somewhat as you are coming down capitol street you can see the reflection of the statehouse dome from the back of the building with the southern exposure it is more difficult to get a reflection because of the sunlight but it will have some of the reflectivity of the visually from both the pedestrian perspective and from other buildings it creates some harmony for the site said they are behind on the design project because of challenges and had hoped to have something to show the city by now he said they expect to have something in the next two weeks with more specifics on how the building will be done in terms of structure and he said there are certain things they know which will not change such as the lobby layout ms said there were a few people in the audience she wanted to recognize an attorney with baker and counsel to the bond bank wright attorney and counsel to the bond bank bob director of the bond bank and president of downtown inc she said the bond bank team is available to answer specific questions about financing asked if it would be one building said they have a unique architectural he said the building will have three components but it is really a rectangular building and functions that way it will appear to be three structures connected into one he said at the top of the building in the front and back there will be glass that will be conference rooms and boardrooms which will be illuminated at night said with the use of limestone and glass it will create a unique cap to the building by showing the towers he said the tower on the right will be slightly higher than the tower on the left asked if the economic development committee would see the final presentation of the building or another committee sanders said the committee could see a final presentation but the action that has been taken on the part of the council is not relative to approving the project overall the involvement of the council is the bond bank issue which is taken up by other committees asked what the expected life cycle of the building is are there plans for expansion and are there any expectations of growing out of the building said that right now they have excess square feet he said as they looked at their growth rate over the last years they expect to grow out of the building in years and maybe sooner he said with national city center across the street and one north capitol there are a number of buildings adjacent that they could go to for additional space right now they are in three different facilities he said they have people at west street and people at court said they want to make the building a private corporate headquarters where they can have security in the asked how many new jobs will be added said in indicated they would have new jobs but they are running at about new jobs he said they are executive positions for management project managers engineers and lawyers said this year would probably hire about people above and beyond the original plan said when the budget is complete in and they will determine what the head count increase will be for the following year in the past as few as people per year to as many as per year had been hired he said they have been growing for some time asked for more details on the increment plan used for the project and if the project is the only plan attached to the increment district ms said the project will not expand the boundaries of the current tax increment financing she said the new increment from the project and other new projects in the will be pledged to support the project said the property is within the consolidated district that was created in when circle center mall was first being contemplated he said it is a consolidated because it was stretched to include anthem and the new hotel he said it circles around a lot of new development in downtown said the life of the will not be extended and his projections show it will amortize on the money borrowed for the project by said the current bonds would not be paid off until and therefore it will not impact the length of the chair sanders said there will be additional service staff maintenance staff and things of that nature which not be able to project as far as new jobs created she said when a project like is built in addition to their staff other permanent jobs are created just to facilitate a new building in the downtown area chair sanders said at some point the projections could include the numbers of indirect jobs created relative to the new building she said there are also construction jobs that go along with creating the asked for the number of jobs that will impact minority participation said has committed to minority business enterprise and women business enterprise contracts he said and circle center mall were similar commitments but the amount spent for was closer to he said they are in the process of talking to a local minority construction contract manager who worked with them on and circle center the minority company will work with them on the headquarters building said the business network which is their inside business network has a program as well he said the minority construction company that will work on building the new headquarters is also going to work with to expand their program on new construction and annuities said they have a major commitment to the minority community in more than just what is spent on construction and how they operate the malls but also how they employ people throughout the entire organization said they are doing the project with under the common wage law he said duke realty group is the builder and they have agreed to use common wages and use the majority in labor so a balance was made with their interest and interest he said there are no employment numbers as it relates to the project the number of minorities hired to work on the headquarters will be associated with the amount being spent and it will not change population of people which is about minorities asked if it is or said they have a spend commitment to and to but it will probably be close to sanders said it is a minimum asked if minorities will be included at all levels of the project for example lawyers said they would be in every aspect asked if the money is able to be put in other areas said the department of metropolitan development has maps that will show where are in the city and there are not many that have financing done on them he said the consolidated has three pledges he said the revenue is from all the property tax increments that have come in since the consolidate was started and they are locked into the district when bonds were first issued in to start circle center mall a senior pledge was given meaning all revenue from the tax increment went to pay the mall first in or the debt was refinanced and a junior lean was created because the first lean was too stringent on the new bonds so when money comes in it pays the senior lean first which is the oldest debt and the second fees pay for the junior lean debt which was for anthem hotel and some for union station the junior subordinate lean is at the bottom said if any money is left it goes to the taxpayers stabilization account until is accumulated in the account money cannot be taken out for other uses he said that not happen for several years he said the problem is that it is accumulating and it sits until when all of the senior bonds are paid off asked if that type of formula could be used to fund other types of development in the downtown area or if it would prohibit it said it would depend on the project and the tax increments he said as an example the project almost funds itself with property taxes that will be paid once completed if you factor in the jobs that will support downtown restaurants the mall and businesses that want to be close to headquarters you can say the project will pay for itself over time said there could be other projects like it as well for example the anthem jobs that were brought into the downtown area said she asked a lot questions to ms and previously she said it was a lot to assimilate and she did not feel a large level of comfort with some of the financing questions she said was kind enough to take time out of his schedule to explain the economics of she asked to explain the bond for the acquisition and development of the site and the other bond she said she was intrigued by explanation of the financing of the said is already outstanding from the world wonders garage it is a key bank note which is a junior subordinate debt it prohibits the bond bank from issuing more debt without key banks permission and key bank has agreed to let the city refinance the debt and put on top of it for a total of this is the external financing said on the internal financing there are two proposals because the metropolitan development commission is charged with economic development for the city so they are the ones that will be investing the money into the project cannot put money into a project they have ownership in for example the city put money into the world wonders garage but the owns the property developed the property and let the investors in circle center mall use the property in the project the city will buy the land but will not own the improvements that will be done to the garage itself it will cost to acquire the garage and to assist with the redevelopment of the parking garage the will loan funds to the economic development commission who will then put the money into the project it will be in total debt for the project asked if there would be a better rate of interest captured by refinancing now said that is correct and interest rates are still attractive he said they would finance in two steps one with a loan from key bank and another by fixing an interest rate the rate will probably be for one part and for the sanders said she appreciated the information and looked forward to coming back to share more information former united maintenance center sanders asked to come forward for his presentation said after working with two marketing consultants in the last eighteen months both consultants independently came up with similar analyses the analyses said the maintenance center was too large for any single user the entire airline fleet could be serviced out of the facility which has aircraft and there would still be excess capacity therefore it clearly pointed to a problem with the facility said the building was constructed in a manner that allows it to be subdivided and both consultants recommended that a approach be taken they both suggested that the first phase should be to secure an anchor tenant and that is how came into the picture he said the second phase is to fill in the additional space with services that compliment support or could stand independently of operation said in order to do this the airport authority had to agree to a different approach specifically to lease the building and get rent payments in this particular case the airport authority agreed that baa would manage maintain and operate the facility including all of the permits said there are numerous permits he said they would also have to secure comparable tenants in the future and the authority will fund the operating cost for unoccupied space during the leasing process said the building would need to be modified said is a publicly traded company on the new stock exchange under the code air is ranked as the seventh largest nationally in billed for major repair and overhaul of aircraft services he said is based in with its core business to buy sell and lease airplane engines it also sells airplanes said prior to entering the agreement employed people throughout the world and operated in facilities in twelve countries some employees are unionized and some are not in had sales of and recently recorded a third consecutive quarter of sales growth and profitability they received the certificate of excellence in said they feel the quality of as a tenant will be superior during the period the airport authority approached and had meetings with over companies interested in the facility of those there were three startup companies and the remaining were established firms over tours and meetings were conducted with the companies in order to find an ideal tenant for the facility said because of the global market it was narrowed down to about ten companies worldwide that could fill the niche of being a anchor tenant for the facility at the time the contract was executed there was not a line of people waiting by the door looking for a lease said it was a difficult negotiation partly because the industry is still suffering from the affects of and the industry is being squeezed as the low cost carriers are pushing all airlines to reduce operating cost the additional burden the airline carriers have is the rising cost of fuel said the lease with is a term with a option the term was done because it is important to show stable growth to stockholders since is a publicly traded firm and when they sign contracts with airlines and other operations they can demonstrate longterm opportunities said under the agreement must lease at least two bays and they could grow up to ten bays he said has control of ten bays said they were given control of ten bays so they could begin their work and grow which is what the lease is designed to do said the base rent is per square foot plus per foot for additional rent he said the combination of the two items was designed to cover the base cost on a per square foot basis he said there is a gap until fully occupies all ten bays and the balance of the space needs to be leased to make the financial model work will pay additional rent for profits above margins the profit margins for the industry range from the said the lease includes termination rights for the tenant and the airport authority the airport termination rights are centered on certain goals that must achieve has targets for occupying bays and employment levels the employment level must be employees by the end of the period if leaves it will have to pay the airport authority at least of the targeted additional rent in any period it was a way to ensure is aggressively working to run a profitable operation and contribute to the overall operating cost of the facility said there are incentives tied to the lease they are a combination of grants success fees and activation credits the grants are tied to the tenant activating additional bays as the tenant activates additional bays there is a grant they could get which is designed to offset startup costs and equipment purchases the grants are all tied to physical assets so any assets purchased through the grants become the property of the airport authority said the is designed to help offset the cost of getting certified by the and to get airlines to do business at the facility he said one of the difficulties is getting the first second or third customer said in order to get major carriers to have their maintenance done in needs to go through a quality assurance test to become a preferred vendor he said all of the major carriers in the us require that any provider must go through the process he said it is an incentive to get carriers to bring equipment to the facility said the activation credits are designed to offset operation costs for increases for startup of the various hangars the credits are tied to the number of hangers that uses the credits are paid once per month as part of the rent said there are expansion rights for under the lease can expand into an additional square feet of space which is called the back shop area the back shop area is where composite work and interior work would occur for aircraft he said the plan right now is to have a separate company operate the shop and they are in negotiations right now to lease the spot said it is something that is desired and agreed to by he said is looking forward to the other company being there to help support their services said at some point in the future when is up to four bays operating they will have the right to expand into the back shop he said the company that the airport authority is negotiating with on the back shop has agreed to the terms and conditions for use of the back shop chair sanders asked for the total number of bays said there are twelve bays he said every hangar should have two bays but hangar four is really not a hangar on the lower level of hangar four which is a corner space ground equipment maintenance is done on the upper level there is square feet of office space this is office space that will occupy does not need square feet for the operations right now but the airport authority hopes they will expand the types of services offered in and employ people beyond what is in the targets chair sanders said she was pleased to see the number of people who turned out for the jobs fair and hopes that some of the people who lost their jobs from united will be able to be employed in the area of their choice said they had over people apply at the jobs fair and prior to that they received over resumes for ten management positions that were posted on the website he said many of the people who applied are employed currently he said there were a large number of people who were unemployed mostly related to airline mechanics and those are the folks that has the highest interest in hiring right now he said that also has jobs throughout the world so while we want to see people leave our community there are opportunities for individuals to be employed said one of the things that worked against city was that they have difficulty employing mechanics in their market ms said part of the marketing effort to get was the availability of qualified workers said she has taken a tour of the facility with and he made a statement that the good and bad news is that we have a state of the arts facility so she commended them for marketing the facility successfully she asked if there was any goodwill left from united said it is not necessarily a case of goodwill he said we have a highly qualified workforce that is familiar with united airlines standards of operation procedure and equipment he said when united airlines left they outsourced their heavy maintenance throughout the world united only outsourced for a one year period so there is an opportunity for to bid on future work for united airlines he said the current contracts that united has expire is really the first opportunity to see if united airlines will come back in terms of the maintenance center asked if preference would be given to local applications asked if they were looking for a conglomerate of small businesses to occupy the remaining space or several large businesses so there are only a few occupying the facility said the balance of the space not leased includes two hangar bays a and and they are currently working with two airlines that have expressed an interest in the bays he said they are very far in their negotiations with one of the airlines and they just started negotiations with the second airline said the back shop space is configured into three workshop areas he said they could operate with three entities there but the preference is to have one company to operate all the back shops because there are efficiencies in doing that he said there are two other spaces the supply warehouse is a facility they expect to lease separately but there is the potential to lease collectively the supply warehouse is square feet the office building is about square feet he said they have difficulty in leasing the supply building and the office building because the current bonds have tax restrictions on the types of uses that can be put in the building said they are working through issues and methods to fill the building that will not violate the tax bond restrictions asked if jet blue would come to said jet blue is a phenomenal company he said jet blue had originally indicated they would enter the market in however given the current pressure on the industry jet blue has moved the date back so they probably will not enter the market until asked if they would service smaller aircraft said includes in their business strategy potential maintenance of regional or small aircraft he said the two airlines they are speaking with right now for hangars a and focus on smaller aircraft he said they will have a full range of aircraft types in the facility asked if there is an apprenticeship program answered in the affirmative and said is committed to an apprenticeship program he said one of the approaches of most providers is to have a stratified wage structure united used a single wage structure he said will have participation and participation asked for an explanation of the penalty clause said the airport authority has the authority to terminate rights he said there is a real partnership between the state the city and the airport authority asked if the council could get a tour of the facility answered in the affirmative said there is a process that has to go through to get a part certificate from the he said it could be done in days he said part of the certification was preparing manuals there being no further business and upon motion duly made the meeting was adjourned at pm
