that the auditors office has not yet reconciled the general ledger to their cash book therefore an accurate statement cannot be given however it is known that the revenue far exceeds the amount of the

compensation study and salary scales presented by earl earl director department of administration said upon passage of ordinance of the revised code of the consolidated city and county the human resources department was directed to do a number of things as it relates to the consolidation of human resource efforts part of that focus was applied to compensation and the establishment of rules for a more uniform system of job descriptions job classifications salary ranges and schedules he said that the staff has put in a lot of hours to determine what makes sense and has collaborated with county agencies and partners to ensure that all aspects have been examined said that human resources administrator will present the findings and recommendation that came as a result of the process he said that they are working with the office of finance and management to determine costs and what can be done versus what cannot be done said that there are differences between the and compensation program the city has pay grades and the county has there are different job classification systems the looked at consolidating to come up with one uniform compensation program presentation attached as exhibit a includes the following key points a compensation task force was put together with representation from the city and the county an outside consultant with expertise in the private and public sectors provided guidance the task force reviewed all of the civilian jobs for both the city and the county and the sheriff and prosecutors office also asked to be included the courts were included in the preliminary part of the study but then decided that they wanted to establish their own separate salary structure the study required the review of approximately total jobs of which the county has approximately job descriptions the descriptions were reviewed and ranked from high to low using the new uniform job classification system the factors used in the job evaluation process include knowledge and skill leadership problem complexity scope and effect contacts and work conditions the study was to ensure that jobs that performed the same duties would be classified in the same pay grade the preliminary job classification results were then reviewed with the county agencies to ensure the job rankings were in the proper relationship findings and recommendations include approximately paralegals in the public defenders and prosecutors office were found to have internal inequities twenty two clerk typists secretaries and building deputies in the sheriffs department were also found to have internal inequities it is proposed that a modified version of the salary structure be adopted to expand the number of grades from to in order to better reflect the variances in the job content and number of county and city jobs and provide the least negative impact on employees based on the preliminary new proposed pay grades there are approximately out of civilian employees who fall below the minimum of their salary range grades the cost to adjust this inequity is believed to be about about employees fall below the new proposed grade which pays a minimum of and would cost approximately to adjust data reflecting that over of county agencies are on the hour work schedule was sent to the office of finance and management for their review and analysis the study has not been finalized and human resources and are working with the office of finance and management to review the full cost impact of these proposed salary ranges work is also being done with certain agencies and city departments to fine tune job classifications for certain jobs where job responsibilities have changed chair sanders asked if there is a possibility of decreasing the job classifications answered in the affirmative and stated that part of the process was to narrow down jobs that have multiple levels this will continue to be evaluated brown asked why the courts opted out of the classification system said that the changes did not fit their jobs and their needs brown asked if the courts can do their own job descriptions and pay scales answered in the affirmative and stated that the courts currently have their own salary structure said that the courts were not originally included in the consolidation ordinance brown asked if the courts salary scales and job classifications are turned over to the human resources department said that it would be difficult to determine what the courts end product will be as a result of them doing their own assessments brown asked if there are any plans to add increases in pay for civilian employees seeing that there have not been any pay raises in three years said that this information will come from the controllers office said that the courts opted out because they are a judicial branch he said that though the employees have not received pay raises the city did pick up a bigger portion of the health insurance said that the courts probably have employees comparable to other civilian employees and asked if human resources could possibly design a salary schedule that could accommodate the courts positions answered in the affirmative and said that a separate salary structure could also be adopted for the courts jobs said that if the new system works it would be good to continue talking with the courts about being included asked if this is the year that one salary schedule will be brought to the council for the budget said that they are aiming for that but he does not have a definite answer asked how these pay grades for civilian nonunion employees compare to those of union employees said that he does not have that information but he will obtain it and provide it to the committee chair sanders asked if the positions within the clerks office were included in the salary review answered in the affirmative plowman asked who established the grade amount said that it was initially established through a market analysis when the compensation study was done for the city in chair sanders said that her hope is that all the salary ranges can be examined over time and adjusted for inflation in order to eliminate falling behind the market brown asked if the courts do their own purchasing and if their employees use the health insurance ms said that she understands that the courts are not required to use purchasing for anything related to the function of the court but they are required to use it for things such as supplies or furniture she said that the courts are on the health insurance update on the purchase of a new property system presented by president county township assessors said that there are various county offices along with the city which will be involved in the purchase particularly the treasurer and the auditor he said that he believes that county is the only county that has a fully integrated property system at this time the assessors are in the process of developing a work flow plan that they will be implementing after coming to the committee to get approval for a contract they are looking over he said that they are also looking at the different funding mechanisms that are available chair sanders asked who the technical experts are that are working on the work flow plan said that they are associates and the information services agency he said that the assessing side will probably be fully implemented by as it the most complete at this time the company has worked very closely with the assessors to try to integrate anything that is needed different portals have been kept open for city agencies and other county agencies to add information in the future he said that they are getting closer and closer to trading information and making one system for all departments and agencies said that they had hoped to put the treasurers and auditors parts in but those are still in the process of being programmed he said that they are also waiting for the state to issue their standards with regard to the exchange of data and what is expected the treasurers portion will not likely be fully implemented until as there is a finite window as to when their operations can be shut down for intense testing he said that the system has been looked at by the state but has not been accepted or approved at this point approval by the state will be a requirement of the proposed contract the company developing the system has been very willing to build a system that the city can use as well as meet the state standards stated that they ran into a problem the last couple of years because they use excel spreadsheets to keep track of sales disclosure forms when they submitted these to the state they were found to be because the state uses a text format that was not compatible with the spreadsheets the total cost is estimated at about million and of that has been identified in different funds endorsement fees disclosure funds and excess recorder funds he said that they will also check with the bond bank to see if it will be more beneficial to bond the entire amount he said that there are a lot of reasons that this project has taken so long but they feel it is necessary this system is being built for better integration and upgrades in the future letters and data have been sent to the state about the process and the city is not in danger of losing its property tax replacement credit the safety of maintaining the is expected to be verified in writing from the state by the end of the said that he would like to give the committee a demonstration on the assessment module portion in the next four to six weeks he said that trends are currently being examined from and he anticipates an increase in assessed valuation from the trending and a decrease in assessed valuation from the inventory tax being eliminated he is not sure of the effect of the homestead credit next year but a lot of activity begin once notices are sent out chair sanders asked if the state is comparing systems from other states said that the state does not recommend any one system but sets the reporting standards and has interpreted legislation of one uniform system to mean one system where data can be sent to the state in a particular format and the state can interpret it chair sanders asked when the system for the auditors office will be available said that the auditors office will be up and running and have the capability to put exemptions on in early spring along with the assessors office the treasurers office will be the last part to add added that the contract will be over a to month period with milestones to pay on and monthly fees to pay to it it has also been set up where it can be paid over two or three budget years an incentive has also been negotiated to reflect its success for county therefore if contracts in other counties are signed with the company county will receive credit for those contracts he said that there is potential that the system could eventually cost the city nothing asked how the request for proposal was developed since the state has not issued specific standards said that the was based on the current manual standards for input and output and included the stipulation that whatever the state came up with the system had to meet it he said that certain criteria are given standards with regard to assessing property asked how many vendors were examined said that there were originally six vendors with three making serious bids after looking at the assessors the auditors and the treasurers requirements was the only company that met all those requirements and offered to build the system the way the city needed asked if has other systems operable in answered that does not have any operable in the assessing side but have treasurer and auditor systems running in four or five counties he said however they have an assessment module system in and assessing property in is very similar to assessing property in asked asked if he feels confident that the company can deliver what they are offering even though they do not have the system up and running said that if the company delivers what is already developed he is totally satisfied as it has been watched and tested throughout the entire process chair sanders asked who was involved in developing and reviewing the responses to the said that there was a steering committee of approximately eight or nine people which included associates and people from the auditors office recorders office treasurers office and the assessors office he said that several presentations were also done by different vendors in warren township he said that the final decision on the was made by the steering committee with recommendations by individual subject matter experts chair sanders asked if all the vendors were comparable in their cost to produce said that step was not taken with all the vendors the cost was negotiated once demonstrated that they could offer more of the services that the city needed brown asked if the vendors are local or instate said that has an office in county and another vendor that submitted a bid has an office in but none of the vendors have their national headquarters stationed here he said that he is unaware of any companies that have a national headquarters in but the assessors office is requiring a local office and local presence as the process progresses said that the treasurers office was promised that their portion would be ready to be tested by he was informed three weeks ago that it would not be possible which has decreased his confidence level he said that hopefully everything will work out and he understands that things can go wrong in any software project update on contract with tax management associates auditing services presented by distributed a handout attached as exhibit and distributed a handout attached as exhibit said that he met with earlier today to go over some of the figures in exhibit presented information with the following the assessors office initially anticipated that the money could be pooled but it now appears that it is being done by taxing district some districts have seen an increase in money and every district that has had an audit benefits from the increase in money because it will be there in future years properties over or used to be audited by the state but the state stopped performing that duty some years ago warren township has their own auditor that used to work for the state but he could only cover approximately audits per year for efficiency the assessors decided to contract with which currently has not cost the city or the taxpayers any money but has resulted in two taxing districts realization of money the money received from auditing is what is used to pay without no audits would have been done and no money would have been realized future goals include funding to bring in hired certified public accountants or public accountants but there is uncertainty as to the feasibility of coverage for all properties overall goal is to ensure that the correct assessments are being done more influx of cash in future years is expected exhibit illustrates penalties and fines have possibly brought in about to for last year and that money goes back into the general fund approximately million has been paid out to and they are still owed approximately million because of the possibility of appeals the net gain is unknown until payments are actually received and is paid discoveries of assessed value have resulted in about million of which approximately million in tax flow will be put on the future books based on an average tax rate chair sanders asked with regard to approximately million that has been billed by what amount of money has been taken in by the city said that he does not have that information as it is tracked by the treasurers office chair sanders stated that the speculation when reviewing the contract was that the city would collect three times as much as what would be paid to said that that information was the history that had in other counties but those counties were pooling their money and paying a percentage he said that county is paying a particular amount per audit chair sanders asked if there are taxing districts that owe money to but do not have the revenue to pay the debt stated that the districts do not owe because the agreement states that if there is no money was brought in the city does not have to pay asked if is a local company and who their principals are said that is a national company located in north which has some local representation as one of the members is the former center township assessor for he said that their principals consist of two gentlemen who live in and who both served as assessors in added that he is unaware of any other company in that performs this type of auditing service chair sanders asked if the assessors are looking to incorporate this auditing task into their functions now that the state no longer offers the service said that the assessors office currently performs audits on properties below but there was a statute that said that the state had to audit anything over that amount he said that the counties do not have anyone with the expertise to do audits on anything above but they will continue to do the audits that are allowed chair sanders asked if individuals with spare time due to the new property system could be assigned to perform some of the audits said that it is possible but it would take a lot of additional training and money for new hires brown said that exhibit shows that has received of the taxpayers money he said that if the city was able to collect that money it would have gone into the general fund of those townships said that if had not done the audits no funds would have been collected brown asked how many audits were done by in warren township said that he does not have that information because is still in the process of auditing however will have completed all the audits in all the townships brown asked if it would have cost as much to do the audits if they had been done internally said that he is unsure of the exact amount but many people would be needed to do the audits throughout the county brown asked how many people has performing the audits said that he does not have that information available but he will obtain the number of people used by in each township the amount of money that they were paid and how many audits were performed and make it available to the committee added that though the numbers look as if the city is in the red now there are some taxing districts that have not paid out all the money to said that of the money that was collected for the spring went to the governmental units and went to he said that if the money had been pooled would have gotten a percentage of everything that was collected and individual units would probably not have received any money the positive side is that the contract states that no district can pay out more than it collects and the county and districts have received some funds said that the shown on exhibit to be paid out to the districts does not include penalties and fines of approximately asked if the employees of that performed audits in warren township also audited in any other township said that auditors audited in all townships for example an auditor have had the task of auditing all of a particular type of store that have locations in all of the townships plowman asked if the amount that was collected by each district will be collected each year or will another audit have to be done for the next year said that it should be the same for each year as it will stay on the books the amounts shown are for the spring billing therefore there is a chance that the same amount will come in for the fall billing and there not be any billing for on those funds asked if the results can be from businesses in particular townships not accurately reporting their personal property answered in the affirmative asked if the information is available as to why the townships have large variations in their assessments said that he will try to obtain that information from asked if assessors give advice or direction to business owners as to how to fill out the personal property returns said that a copy of regulation is given but the assessors cannot tell businesses exactly how to fill out the forms however the assessors will work with businesses and provide any information possible or refer businesses to the department of local government finance said that he would be interested in finding out how many billable hours were spent on audits within the entire county so that a comparison can be done to see if it is feasible to train and hire local citizens who are qualified to perform this duty said that he believes that does employ some local residents but he will try to obtain the information requested by asked if he could return to the committee at a later time to present some of the additional information requested chair sanders answered in the affirmative
