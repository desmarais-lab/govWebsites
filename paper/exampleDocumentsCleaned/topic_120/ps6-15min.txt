absent was representing council staff was general counsel chair hunter asked all members to introduce themselves and state which district they represent proposal no appoints lewis to the early intervention planning council chair hunter said that wholeheartedly endorses and supports lewis appointment to this board he said that both have had a long history with the planning moved seconded by brown to forward proposal no to the proposal no amends the code to add a new chapter to establish standards for security companies doing business in county including licensing by the office of finance and chair hunter said that the digest is incorrect and he did speak to sanders but he asked to explain her request said that he talked to sanders who has been working on a proposed amendment with jack he said they both wanted the amendment to be available tonight but they are both out of town he said he believes they relatively agree on the amendment language and sanders asked that the proposal be passed to the full council with amendments offered on the floor by moved seconded by oliver to forward proposal no to the full council with a do pass as amended recommendation the motion carried by a vote of with freeman casting the negative vote proposal no amends certain provisions of the current merit system respecting the metropolitan police department and the fire department brown said that this proposal expands the merit board making it compliant with state code he said it also makes some changes to the hiring and promotional processes in the police and fire departments he said this proposal is nonpolitical and has tremendously helped with some of the language he said some concerns were expressed from the professional firefighters union local and he agrees with their suggested changes brown said he has also heard that some have concerns and questions about the proposal but he has not been approached by anyone although he has expressed his willingness to work with any on the members of the public safety committee process he said that this proposal was going to be amended on the council floor but they decided not to do so and he thought that other amendments would be offered today brown said that the fire union suggested removing the language shall belong to the same political party in section a because they elect their membership and political party is not a factor in that election process he said with respect to section i his intent was to give people who live in county or have five years of contiguous residency status points in the application process because they have a commitment and ties to the community and because they are familiar with the community he said henry human resources hr director and his consultants decided to do an applicant candidate profile that included some things that they felt would be good qualities as listed in this section the fire union feels that a few things should be added and removed from this list including striking the certification from the national fire academy as very few civilians go to the academy because it is for incumbent firefighters striking the five years creditable service brown said that chair hunter suggested and he agrees that instead of striking these things completely maybe they can be included elsewhere brown said that he proposes that language be added in this particular section saying that the final candidate profile could be expanded based upon the recommendations of the department and the consultant and signed off on or approved by the respective merit board he said the promotional process changes depending on what the consultant and the merit board indicate are the needs of the department he said they have several firefighters that speak and write fluently because they are but they do not get credit this is not fair when a certified bilingual translator can receive credit asked if brown wants to amend sec to state that the applicant candidate profile include but is not limited to and then list some of the criteria brown answered in the affirmative asked if he then wants it to state that the merit board will make the final decision as to what criteria will be used to give someone preference brown answered in the affirmative brown said the fire union also suggested that instead of giving a maximum of five points they should give the points in percentage form with a maximum of five percent he said that it has historically been a point process but that could change brown said that this is simple language change and could be offered on the council floor if everyone is in agreement asked bill president fraternal order of police fop if changing the number of maximum points from five to five percent makes sense on the police merit side as well said that this is more of a question for henry in hr vice president local said that brown hit on most of their concerns which are technical in nature he said that tracking the maximum points in percentage form keeps it more inline with the merit process he said they do not have a problem with listing the other things such as residency and language as additional criteria outside of the initial preferences but those things would be up to hr and the merit board members of the public safety committee oliver said that there is some consistency in the language with respect to residency as this is done in many aspects and areas he said incentives are often offered to those who live in a community because they bear the burden of supporting the structures in that community for example students are given tax breaks or tuition credits for attending a college or university in their home state he said he hopes this proposal is supported in totality scales said that this proposal has evolved quite a bit since it was first introduced she said she spoke with some stakeholders that she thought would be impacted by this proposal such as the local and the fop the impression that she has received was that most of those stakeholders do not feel that the system is broken or needs to be changed she said that she is not sure if she could vote for it since there does not seem to be a significant need for the change brown said that he has had many conversations with some of the firefighters and they seem to be okay with the ordinance and he has not gotten any opposition he said that most of the concern that he has received has been from other asked if the current ordinance is in compliance with the state statute brown answered in the negative said that this is unclear as state law requires that the fop and the local have a third of the votes which is not currently the case he said they are not sure how the city got to this point and if the city is legal based upon how it reached this status he said has done some research on the issue and in essence there was a statute that stated that a city could adopt a merit board that looked like a or it could readopt the current merit board that looks like by a certain date county adopted its current merit board and over the course of time the city sought to amend the configuration of that merit board he said there was then a question of whether or not had been amended so much that that the city was in violation of it and were now required to adopt a simultaneously there was legislation that stated that the city shall amend the board so that the locals have a third of the vote said that he brown and others discussed this and have determined that they will likely not know with certainty which one is legal until there is some sort of suit binding opinion or clarifying legislation asked if the council is close to being in compliance answered that this proposal would bring the city closer to being in compliance because it clearly meets the definition of the locals having a third of the vote he said another issue that has not been discussed in committee is whether or not the locals are compelled to ratify the proposal by their own vote said that the original statute said that a city could either go under the statutory system or keep the one they had and kept the one they had when the city attempted to expand it the attorney generals office and a court case concluded that if the city kept the old one it could not be changed he said then some changes were made and it is questionable as to whether the city had the authority to do so said with the police merger a new merit system was adopted that is not anywhere close to any of the others he said the statute states that if the city adopts a new system it has to be the statutory system which is not like anything the city has ever had in addition it states that if a new system is adopted the departments have a right to have a referendum on that new system therefore if this is merely a correction of keeping the historical system which the city is permitted to do then the city is okay if not it most likely has to go to the referendum of the departments said that the good thing with this proposal is that it keeps the current boards in place until therefore if it passes and there is opposition those people have six months to question the legality of the new system before the boards change members of the public safety committee said they do not have the amendment in draft form tonight and the public safety director has quite a bit of technical changes to suggest he apologized to brown for not discussing some of these issues with him and said that he thinks it makes sense to incorporate the changes in an amendment to be entertained in committee he said it also make sense to include that it takes effect upon ratification of the locals this would avoid the legal question altogether scales asked brown how he feels about this brown answered that he does not have any issues with this he said that he has not seen any proposed changes by the public safety director and he has also been told that the attorney for mayor would like to speak with him but he has not heard from him either he said he would be happy to speak with anyone about the proposal he said with respect to the ratification he and some of the fire union people do not feel that it is necessary said that it is a possibility that it is not necessary but his thought was that it would be easier to put in the stipulation as opposed to having someone in the court of appeals make the decision moved seconded by brown to postpone proposal no until brown asked that if there are any persons that have questions about the proposal that they please contact one of the five sponsors of the proposal the motion to postpone with no further business pending and upon motion duly made the public safety committee of the council was adjourned at pm public safety committee
