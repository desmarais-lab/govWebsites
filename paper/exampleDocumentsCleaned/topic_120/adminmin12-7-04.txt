distributed a copy of the final personnel report to the committee members exhibit see file some highlights of the presentation were county vs city comparable positions the project objective was to provide county with an independent evaluation of the competitiveness of the current compensation and benefit programs provided to county employees the study was completed with data from the current compensation structure was originally constructed for the fiscal year the compensation scale has been kept current relative to the market by the county via annual updates that reflect expected market movement the county identified positions they believe are comparable to the city in terms of duties and responsibilities the county positions that were surveyed and reviewed are approximately behind those in the city brown asked why there is no average salary of city positions in the job comparison chart nelson said the information was not available at the time of the study he said he followed up after the study and there was no change there is still a significant difference in the amount of salary needed to make it comparable overall the county is of the midpoints representing the targeted compensation for the position placing the targeted compensation approximately behind the it would cost the county to bring county employees to the minimum of the minimum salary asked if the includes benefits nelson replied in the negative and said this only includes salary compensation benchmark analysis the county identified possible benchmark positions and provided written job documentation for the study the competitive market position was determined by the following criteria market data at the th percentile for market data at the th percentile for general industry geographical preface for market data in escalating order state of or the north central region the salary structure is about behind market and has been behind market since asked if the county is behind market does this mean the city is at market nelson said he cannot answer that question because he is unsure where the structure stands brown asked if it would be beneficial to merge human resources hr departments between city and county to handle the salary differences nelson said there are different functions that each hr department performs and he is not prepared to answer that question accurately the actual pay practices are behind the average market salaries chairwoman asked how some of the positions are over of the market nelson said this is due in part to market demand of those types of positions human resource director said it functions are a huge part of the market demand ms said the council did approve some of the it salaries when the demand was really high asked how the market salary scale works for an employee ms said it is up to the agency head to determine the salary for an employee asked how an employee gets to the midpoint or maximum salary nelson said an employee could potentially be at the same salary when they were hired or the agency head has the discretion in giving a salary increase depending on their budget and employees experience chairwoman asked if information is available on employees who have been given an increase in salaries nelson said he does not have specific information but he is sure that salary increases have been given chairwoman said the statement that no county employee has received a raise because the council did not approve salary raises is not accurate nelson said he understands that statement to mean across the board salary increases chairwoman asked if some employees received raises even though council made no changes to salary increases nelson replied in the affirmative chairwoman said she would suspect that many council members do not know that some employees have been receiving salary increases if the council would want to do a adjustment for every employee it would take an additional the recommendation is to continue to move the salary grade scale annually by the same percentage as expected market movement in order to not fall any further behind salary grades a and a have been deleted causing employees to enter for a total cost of plowman asked if funds still exist in a and a salary grades nelson said a and a still exist for the remainder of the year and will be deleted in plowman asked if the minimum salary in salary grade is nelson replied in the affirmative plowman asked how the county established the minimum salary nelson said the schedule had been put in place in and the county continues to move the schedule to increase salaries chairwoman said these issues are the reason for this study to allow the council to actually spend time researching this issue in order to approve the situation county benefits compared to the market place combined benefits program ranks in the percentile across all three groups national employers government and private employers this is primarily driven by generous vacation policy retirement plan benefit value varies across groups ranging from the percentile low to the percentile midrange health care benefits are in the percentile across all groups paid time off benefits are significantly higher than almost all employers in the database and drive much of the total benefit plan value security benefit value varies the most across comparator groups ranging from the percentile to the low end of the th percentile highest enrollment medical plan is an the bases for this is that the county has two they provide to their employees although the plans are generous the valuation methodology automatically applies a lower value to due to the highly restrictive nature of these plans the dental plan also ranks below average because it is chairwoman asked if it is safe to determine that the benefit package is health nelson said he believes the benefit package is very good he suggested taking a look at the benefits and salaries to perhaps bring up salaries by adjusting the benefit package plowman asked how much an employee would be bringing home after taxes on a salary ms said about a month said an employee that makes salary is eligible for welfare section and food stamps asked how much money is needed to move employees who are below minimum to minimum salary nelson said will be needed chairwoman said adjusting benefits does not necessarily mean money will be generated to increase salaries nelson read an email message from one of the county employees explaining how wonderful the county benefit package is in the message the employee explained how she was able to stay at home for weeks to spend time with her new baby due to the benefit plan the employee stated that she would not trade in the benefits she has for an increase in salary brown asked if the demographics show that most of the employees that are on the low end of the salary scale are minorities nelson said he does not have that information to make an accurate statement but can provide that information at a later date chairwoman said this is actually an important piece of information to take a look at she said action needs to be taken to make sure issues of diversity are being ms said she had a conversation with the county auditor and the auditor indicated that there is no employee working for county who make less than a year ms said if other smaller counties are able to pay their employees above a year then perhaps the county should be looking very closely to what we can do to increase salaries ms suggested putting a task force together to look into some of these issues chairwoman said she welcomes that suggestion and this was another reason for the personnel study proposal no reappoints john to the administrative board said he has enjoyed serving on the board
