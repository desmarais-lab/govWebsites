they look to see where agencies are at with respect to budgeted spending and make adjustments as needed many of these adjustments are handled through transfers due to realized savings and have no impact on fund balances he said that the transfer of in the office of minority and women business development will cover increased costs for contractual obligations and employee reimbursement such as mileage conference costs and cell phone bills the health insurance costs for the and video services agency were underestimated and a transfer of in savings from character to character will cover that cost said that the change in the information services agency budget is threefold a transfer of from character to character to cover a shortfall in supplies appropriations in characters and to make the final payment for the enterprise storage solution for which a portion was planned for in building the budget and appropriations from the enhanced access fund to fund the public request portal and to assist with the county public development of an online card registration system said that these fund balances will remain in decent shape at the end of the year and they planned for this in making their ending fund balance assumptions for the budget process lewis asked why the city is supporting the online card registration brown said that the was set up to advance public access across the county and this project will allow people to do more business online for said that in order to obtain a library card an individual has to be a resident of county when applying for the card in person they check the individuals identification the online registration project will allow individuals to apply for a library card online and will allow them to check their residency she said that because

year ken chief information officer stated that the enterprise storage solution project began in and they did include this years amount for that lease project in the budget however in looking at that fund balance as well as reversions in character and thinking about to agencies it made sense to make that additional payment in order to reduce overall storage costs for next years budget he said that it seemed efficient as they had the fund balance to cover it said that it is important to plan better so that they do not have to continue to have so many additional appropriations in the future said that they always strive to plan as best they can but there is a lot of turnover in their agency also due to the change in administration some of the priorities and direction for their agency changed

have money available in that fund now and it is okay to allow it to go through he said that if it had been presented later he might advise against it because it might not be able to be processed before the end of the year lewis moved seconded by to send proposal no proposal no adopts internal control standards as defined by the state board of accounts and establishes a materiality threshold brown stated that this proposal came about as the result of a change in state legislation which prompted the department of local government finance to instruct all cities and towns to come up with a policy to present to their financial body and then train employees accordingly chuck white deputy controller provided a brief presentation which included the following key points in the compliance guidelines authorized under section of this chapter the state board of accounts shall define and the audit committee shall approve not later than the acceptable minimum level of internal control standards and internal control procedures for internal control systems of political subdivisions including the following control environment risk assessment control activities information and communication monitoring the internal control standards and procedures shall be developed to promote government accountability and transparency after the legislative body of a political subdivision

immediately to the state board of accounts for all material variances losses shortages or thefts the state board of accounts shall determine the amount of funds involved and report the amount to the appropriate government and law enforcement officials determine the internal control weakness that contributed to or caused the condition and make written recommendations to the appropriate legislative body or appropriate official overseeing the internal control system addressing a the method of correcting the condition and the necessary internal control policies and internal control procedures that must be modified to prevent a recurrence of the condition white said that the political subdivision is charged with approving the internal controls and establishing the concept of materiality as per exhibit of the proposal he said that the auditor treasurer controller assessor and were all included in the development of this policy and materiality concept he said that the materiality concept is established to provide guidelines as to whom any erroneous or irregular variances losses shortages or thefts are reported he said that if there is outright theft they believe it be reported to every level but for other situations a dollar level was defined he said that most of this verbiage came straight from state statute with regard to training white said that anyone who has any fiscal responsibility such as ordering paying for or receiving items or handling cash is to be trained on these new controls he said that it was determined that the video on the website is sufficient for this years training and they have contacted all and requested that they go through that training as well as any other appropriate staff members employees will then sign a certification that they did view the video and they will report that training to the state early in brown said that a lot of time was spent on this by many different entities he said that nothing is perfect but this is about as good as it can get and it is a great start and is something that has been needed for a while he said that he has reviewed the policy and feels it will help immensely and provide a guideline for what to do in any event asked if this policy is unique to county or is simply a template every county in the state is using white said that it is somewhat of a template but they made it very specific to the initial principles of the policy however were made clear by the state board of accounts asked if every county will then be asked to adopt those principles white said that every governmental unit in will have to adopt them asked if materiality means the number that is assigned to a particular occurrence that allows a process to begin white said that it could be a single occurrence or an accumulation of occurrences he said that the materiality indicates if the amount is significant enough for all parties to know about that transaction he said that for example if there were a underage in a parks locations fee revenue intake this body would not be advised about that said that this has long been needed and he thanked them for putting in the time to construct the policy he said that sometimes when a policy is enacted they learn things and then changes are needed he asked if they will continue to look at this once a year or every months to it if needed white said that this is just the basic policy over time there be different procedures and processes adopted as well this serves as the skeleton and there be additions going forward that would not necessarily take place annually but they would constantly be looking at the policy and the procedures put into place chair thanked all the parties for providing this important tool to help protect taxpayers money lewis moved
