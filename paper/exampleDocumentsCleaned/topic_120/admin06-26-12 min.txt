proposal no appropriates a total of from various funds for use by various departments and agencies funded by revenues not previously appropriated reductions of appropriations and remaining fund balances proposal no amends sec of the code relating to the delinquent business personal property settlement fund acting chair lewis called the meeting to order at pm with the following members present hunter jack and chair arrived shortly thereafter chief financial officer hope represented council staff acting chair lewis stated that chair is running a few minutes late and she asked to introduce themselves and indicate which portion of the county they represent she asked for consent to move proposal no first on the agenda proposal no amends sec of the code relating to the delinquent business personal property settlement fund county assessor introduced heather counsel from he said that this fund was set up during a prior contract with the vendor tax management associates but had a sunset clause built into the fund provision which eliminated that fund in he said that they have entered into a new contract with and need to bring that fund back to life in order to place delinquent collections into that fund these monies will pay for the contract with any fund balance returning to the general fund asked if the fund balance will then be distributed to the units of government ms said that this is correct she said that she represents a company that works with county assessors to conduct personal property tax audits and recover values omitted from the tax roles when this fund was originally set up the law required a fund for each entity and at that time there were multiple assessors in county they sought language in the state law clarifying that as monies were received as a result of audits conducted by they would go into a fund until the time that the contract was concluded after the cost of the contract was paid then all funds left over would be given back to the taxing units on a share she said that the previous contract generated over for the tax rolls said that the assessor has the legal duty to do these audits but it would be very hard to do with existing staff is paid per audit with a fee based on the value of the property being audited he said that it is not a contingency fee but a fee does the work upfront before the county expends the money so there is no cost for the county does not get paid more than the county would actually take in so the county would never be at a loss asked what is meant by undervalued and if the property owner is notified of this audit said that this is specific to business personal property he said that if a person owns a business they have to self report any depreciable assets to county this process is handled just like an internal revenue service audit might be handled on personal taxes reported if it is questionable that a business has underreported their assets a letter would be sent to the business owner informing them that there will be an audit and explaining the time frame for the review and audit clerks note chair arrived at pm asked the term length of the contract said that it is for three years hunter asked how often the county enters into a contract like this said that the current contract is for the and returns on any value over he said that these are based on assessed years not necessarily calendar years hunter asked if the code requires that they set this fund up on a revolving basis he asked why they are only implementing it for three years only to have it go dormant so that it has to be again he asked why they cannot leave the fund active said that his staff will be working closely with the contractor for training and it is their hope that they not need a third party vendor in the future and could possibly do a majority of these audits so that the county captures all the revenue hunter said that it would still make sense to continue that fund said that he would agree with hunters logic asked if the million from the previous process was the entire state of and not just county ms said that this was million in assessed value and not the actual property tax revenue collected she said that property tax revenue collected was approximately million for county she said that it is difficult to get a precise number because they had assessors at that time and reconciliation was difficult asked if this proposal was mandated by the state said that statute mandates that they must audit all businesses but does not say to what extent that audit is handled asked if as the funds are gathered they are being invested or otherwise leveraged in any way land deputy treasurer said that any funds on deposit are invested she added that during the last audit process they paid a little over million and the units received in additional revenue collected as a result of those audits chair called for public testimony there being none moved seconded by hunter to send proposal no to the full proposal no appropriates a total of from various funds for use by various departments and agencies funded by revenues not previously appropriated reductions of appropriations and remaining fund balances provided a handout exhibit a and moved seconded by to amend proposal no as per exhibit a asked hope council chief financial officer to walk the members through the amendment ms said that the amendment does three major things removes most of the provisions related to public safety except for those items that are grants transfers or otherwise reduces the total amount of the appropriation to reflect those omissions and reduces the mayors office budget and increases the budget of the council correspondingly to account for the repayment of funds for redrawing precinct boundaries ms said that the amendment eliminates sections and which are related to appropriations for the office of corporation counsel information services agency department of public safety and the public defender agency she said that these portions of the proposal will be resubmitted for introduction and assigned to the public lewis asked if all agencies have been notified of the changes ms said that the intent of the amendment was relayed to the office of finance and management who she believes was going to be contacting the agencies said that she met with for the department of public safety and consultant and they are aware that the new proposals will be introduced on and heard in the public safety and criminal justice committee on chair asked if the delay will cause any hardship said that the legal advertisement was held awaiting a hearing date and final numbers and according to ms the delay will not hold up anything of significance hunter said that he is a fan of separating these types of appropriations but asked if this is being done for accountability said that she had conversations back in with berg from and requested that the cleanup fiscal items be heard individually by fund before the public safety and criminal justice committee she said that she believes it provides for better accountability hunter said that he is a fan of this practice and he hopes this sends a message to agencies that submitting their fiscals in this way will make the process easier when the appropriations are not germane to each other chair said that it is her understanding that this has been conveyed but the staff turnover in caused this oversight as communications were held with an individual who is no longer with that office asked if this is a cleanup ordinance and is just moving funds from one character to another within an agency and not from one agency to another chair said that except for the reimbursement to the council from the mayors office for the in section which is a statutory responsibility of the mayor the other sections are adjustments between characters asked for input from keen deputy controller said that they have met with ms and will be able to meet the needs expressed for submission of separate proposals chair called for public testimony there being none motion to amend proposal no as per exhibit a carried by a
