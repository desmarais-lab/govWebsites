assessment board of appeals for several years and really enjoys working with assessor and the other members of the board and would appreciate the opportunity to continue to serve asked how the appeals are going and if they are getting the backlog down said that there are still a lot outstanding but every meetings agenda is incredibly thick and they are working hard at whittling them down asked about attendance stated that he has not attended all of the meetings and have missed one or two the committee clerk stated that attendance records for the appointees are in the meeting packets fanning said that it looks as though has only missed one meeting said that this is more than acceptable for a volunteer position and she is happy with that record she asked if has an estimate regarding how far behind in the appeals they are said that he would not really feel comfortable giving a number but they are probably still about one to two years back he said that there are not a lot of people actually appearing before them but it is a huge task just getting through them all moved seconded by to send proposal no proposal no amends the code regarding the office of audit and performance and the audit committee brown council chief financial officer stated that this proposal makes some changes to the office of audit and performance regarding how the director is affirmed and adding building authority to the list of agencies the department has the authority to look at he said that the director will still be appointed by the mayor but they will now come before this committee every year for confirmation he added that the proposal also makes some changes to the makeup of the audit committee the actual number of committee members has been reduced and the chair who is appointed by the mayor will also come before this committee for approval but it will not be a yearly requirement moved to amend proposal no as per exhibit a attached lewis seconded the motion general counsel to the council stated that in further discussions since introduction the current director of hope felt it was bad policy for the office director to oversee the audit committee as this committee has oversight of the office this amendment puts the director of back on the committee as a nonvoting member and provides for a new chair which will be appointed by the mayor and confirmed by this council the motion to amend proposal no carried by a vote of chairman said that he would welcome any members to join him as a cosponsor to this proposal he said that the audit committee and do good work but he would like to see the council more involved with more transparency and openness regarding these audits he said that he does not want the council involved in the operations but they have a role to play and while their appointees can help the rest of the members with some insight it is important that they know about these auditing finds in order to pass effective department budgets for which they are responsible said that he has served on the audit committee for three years and the audits that they perform and the comprehensive annual financial report are always made available to and to the public he said that no one is ever excluded from any of their audit committee meetings and anyone is welcome to attend to find out more information he said that he would like a better understanding of what the changes actually are he said that the mayor has always appointed the director of and asked if the only change with this proposal is that this appointment will now have an annual reconfirmation brown responded in the affirmative said that he does not really understand how they can bring building authority under the umbrella of the audit committee since they are a separate entity governed by a separate board and he asked how this is possible and why they are adding them brown said that the building funding comes entirely from city and county agencies he said that they are like the bond bank and are funded by the city and are integral in the operations of the city therefore asked them to consider adding them to the list said that there are so many requirements and regulations regarding government accounting and reporting for different agencies and he asked if they are creating any unanticipated consequences by authorizing this audit brown said that there is no requirement for to audit building authority but this added language gives the ability to audit them at the request of the council or the mayor hope director stated that has the authority to perform audits over all city departments and county agencies the five municipal corporations and the bond bank she said that building authority is like the bond bank in that it is a separate entity but yet exists to serve the city and county she said that this proposal expands the possibilities their office can review said that he remembers when they were contemplating adding the housing agency in the city audit and there were some issues with that because of other regulations at the state level that prohibited that he asked if they are not then requiring that building authority be included in the annual city and county audit but are just giving the ability to go in and audit them separately upon request ms said that this is is correct asked why they are changing the signature on the outside audit from the controller to the director of brown said that the contract for the outside auditor will now be signed by the director of after approval from the mayor because essentially the controller is the one being audited and this will give the city more independence from that audit asked if this will not create more of a conflict of interest brown said that it will actually take away the conflict because it is essentially the controller and the auditor who are being audited and this provides a little more independence asked if this proposal still recognizes that the controller does not choose the outside auditor but the audit committee is the entity that makes that decision brown said that this is still correct and that is another reason they want to keep oversight all within fanning moved seconded by to send proposal no chairman said that he agrees with that more independence is needed for the audit committee but there will be some very critical things the council needs to take a look at he said that for example he has spoken with the chief of police about an audit of the police department to get a better handle on their expenses so that they can better understand what the department needs when approving their presentation on proposal no which amends the code to restructure the department of public safety to allow the mayor to directly oversee and to create the office of public health and safety and to the office of citizens police complaints and the animal care and control division corporation counsel presentation purposes only no vote taken corporation counsel stated that on mayor wrote his first executive order which involved hiring metropolitan police department chief troy and fire department chief creating a situation whereby these positions report directly to the mayor instead of to a department director he said that they have accomplished that change and that is how they have been operating since the beginning of the year that executive order also authorized him as corporation counsel to institute a working group to evaluate the structure of the department of public safety bring the mayor recommendations and put together a proposal to make any recommended changes there have been a lot of meetings and fact gathering to figure out the most important pieces of that need to be maintained in the code presented some of these recommendations to the public safety and criminal justice committee of the council various state boards the unions division chiefs several the office of finance and management and the council offices and general counsel he said that they have also worked hard to identify and include some fiscal efficiencies the result of all this work is proposal no the proposal is pages long and they therefore anticipate some technical revisions before the proposal is fully vetted and approved reviewed a brief presentation explaining the main objectives and goals of proposal no including major initiatives and changes being proposed clerks note a copy of this presentation is on file in the council office with the original minutes of this meeting he said that the main goals and objectives are to promote safety and security increase accountability and transparency apply a modern holistic approach to public safety crime prevention and mental health addressing underlying systemic cause of crime poverty and ill health cut bureaucracy create efficiencies and save taxpayer dollars he said that to achieve this they are proposing that the chiefs of and report directly to the mayor with no bureaucracy thereby elevating and to separate city departments with the chiefs essentially becoming directors this will ensure that maintain their core mission in enforcement protection and emergency response and result in increased accountability and transparency said that a provides that the council can create or terminate departments divisions offices community councils and other agencies of the consolidated city by ordinance for all other references to a public safety director in the code or state statute contracts agreements or regulatory requirements the mayor becomes the director of public said that mayor objective is to take a modern comprehensive and approach to public safety crime prevention and mental health to do that they have to define the systemic problems use scientific research methods to identify risk factors and protective factors develop and test preventative strategies and assure widespread adoption of the strategies that prove effective to this end proposal no creates the office of public health and safety to operate similar to the current office of education innovation and within the mayors office this new office will be overseen by a director who is appointed by the mayor after consultation with the sheriff and approved by the council and the office will include a small one to staff with required public safety qualifications the director will serve as the chief policy advisor on matters of public health and safety coordinate the efforts of local state and federal agencies to address the root causes of crime in a comprehensive way across jurisdictional silos and administer the divisions of the divisions of will include some of those divisions which are currently under the authority of public safety communications emergency medical services ems the engagement center and reentry services fanning asked with the director of this new office reporting directly to the mayor would they then be equal with the chiefs of and said that they would operate as a director just as the directors of and which are other such offices within the mayors office fanning asked how many people are on staff in currently and if a one to staff would mean a reduction in personnel brown said that there are or so staff in but some work with or other divisions and therefore will follow that division and be under that direct department he said that they are not really reducing any staff continuing with his presentation said that the public safety board will remain the same in functionality with no change in the appointments afforded to the council and mayor but will be renamed the board of public health and safety he said that the new board would still approve and contracts as well as any contracts under the divisions of animal care and control would become a division of the department of code enforcement which better facilitates the use of limited revenue from fines and licenses to fund the agency the citizens police complaint board would be moved to the mayors office which would ensure more civilian oversight independence and accountability and finally the division of homeland security would become a division of the administrator of would be appointed by the chief of police and detailed to for purposes of planning and coordination said that although cost savings are not the main reason for these changes and no promises are being made toward cost savings at this time analysis conducted by current director indicates there could be a savings in personnel costs between and he said that personnel would be moved to where they function operationally for example personnel are already funded and borrowed personnel from other departments and now those positions can remain where they are funded there could also be some possible additional savings due to operational efficiencies and the elimination of bureaucratic silos said that she was pleased to be a part of the working group to look at this restructuring and she truly appreciates the holistic approach this takes and finds it to be very visionary in some respects however there is often a difference between the vision and how something is implemented she especially appreciates all the components added to address mental health issues in this city as she believes they are the stem or core of many of the public safety problems she said that her biggest concern is with regard to she asked if the regional partners have been contacted regarding their reaction to this change said that he has not personally spoken with the states homeland security head but there has been research done and he has talked to others who know the issues and who say there is no problem with the change he added that they can continue those conversations however and he will be glad to research explicit issues that the state or federal partners might raise said that she is not only concerned with the state and federal partners but with the surrounding counties as there are regional contracts in place she said that her concern is to avoid any unintended consequences she added that she agrees that revenue needs to remain with them in order to help fund she asked if they will have sworn officers detailed to them or have their own officers said that there will be no change to what is currently in place and they are simply taking everything as it is and moving it under he said that enforcement officers have limited police powers and it is not unusual for the director of another department to have authority over individuals who have enforcement powers he said that they do not have full police powers but do have some limited powers that are still granted and controlled by however their paychecks will now come from said that she receives lots of calls regarding animal control and sometimes having a person in uniform on the scene is very helpful she added that it would be very helpful for her to see an organizational chart that shows the various changes being proposed said that he will provide the committee with a chart said that at the university level this would be described as criminology looking at how crime occurs evaluating theories associated with stemming crime and recommending how law enforcement engages with criminals he said that this somewhat turns the city into a working lab and he is not sure this would be a good thing for the community he said that he believes this proposal needs even more vetting and he would like to see several public meetings in the community he said that he knows this has come about due to promises made by the mayor during his campaign for office and he realizes changes always come about with a change in leadership but they really need to look at these changes very closely he said that he is not very excited about the of to as some of the operations of have not served businesses in his district well and are driving businesses across the county line he said that adding another responsibility to their plate causes him some concern he added that referred to breaking down silos but much of those silos are a result of drug or mental health issues and information not being able to be shared across law enforcement lines due to public health and information privacy laws this reorganization create additional barriers or silos he said that the metropolitan emergency communications agency was dismantled under a previous administration and he is not sure who the driver was on that decision but it took them a lot of years to put that together and they had a board that made sure it was completely vetted and there was good he said that he is not necessarily likening this reorganization to that process but it has the same feel he said that as they go about making changes he hopes that they will make sure the community is with more communication said that this process has been the primary occupation of his time since taking office and therefore he gets excited about the possibilities however he does not want his excitement on the subject to create a misconception of what is actually being done through this proposal the only thing that this proposal does is eliminate the bureaucracy of they are not eliminating any functions but are simply moving them and creating some policy capacity to guide them to pull in partners to help the individual divisions and departments said that they can always benefit from some outside resources as there are already universities working with the departments and divisions now to do the same and asked if this just creates a division internally to take on those responsibilities said that they are not taking anything away but are just trying to augment it lewis said that with regard to public meetings she sent notice out to all and the public that the purpose of proposal no would be heard in four different committees at different times with tonights meeting being the first the public safety and criminal justice committee will hear a presentation tomorrow evening the metropolitan and economic development committee will hear the same on and finally the rules and public policy committee will hear a presentation and hopefully act on the proposal at its meeting on she said that the public therefore has four opportunities to be engaged in this process she agrees that this issue is very important and that is why she tried to be proactive in including the presentation on several agendas to promote lots of conversation said that regarding public meetings it would be beneficial to have some out in the community as not everyone can get down to the building for a meeting fighting the traffic and finding reasonable parking she asked if there would be a way for citizens to email questions into a contact site and take those questions live at some of these meetings lewis said that she is not sure they have the capacity to take questions live but they can certainly send in their questions ahead of time by emailing or calling the council office she said that her plan is to hold the rules and public policy committee meeting outside of the building as she agrees that having to deal with traffic parking and then building security makes attending a meeting inside this building difficult at times stated that citizens wishing to provide questions can call the council office at or visit the website at lewis said that state representative bill started the same conversation a while back that if crime was put under the umbrella of public health they would create some opportunities to tap into more federal and state dollars she asked how many communities are using this approach said that a handful of smaller communities have explored this approach but many of them are focused differently as they operate out of their health department he said that here in they are establishing a way to approach this from a policy perspective which is a novel way to do it but they already do some of it now within some parts of public safety even though they do it in silos he said that is doing it now with some of their hot spots the goal is not to stop these efforts but to make connections across jurisdictions to better facilitate these efforts lewis asked if this proposal passes if the council will then confirm the chief of said that this proposal does not initiate that action as they did not want to make wholesale public policy changes that were not related to the restructuring they simply are picking up whole baskets in the code and moving them lewis said that if the chiefs essentially become directors with this action it makes sense to confirm the chief of as they do all other directors within the enterprise said that this is a good point and he will look into it said that she also had questions about other cities that might be doing this and what best practices are she asked with the executive order taking place st if some of the budgets will need to come back before the council for review and changes said that the plan is not to introduce a bunch of fiscal ordinances to make budget changes this year but to instead address these organizational changes through memorandums of understanding between division and department budgets then make holistic changes during the budget process for asked if it is legal to do it this way brown said that it is legal if the council approves it which is what they would do with this ordinance he said that since many encumbrance have already occurred to back them all out and put them somewhere else would take a lot of to do and therefore he suggested it be handled this way for this year asked if city legal has been involved and has weighed in on this said that as corporation counsel he is technically the director of city legal and therefore has been very involved asked if is also okay with these changes said that they are fanning asked if will then be the main conduit to coordinate interaction between the public safety divisions and the county health department health and hospital corporation mental health agencies and other social agencies responded in the affirmative and said that will liaison with these entities and work to build better relationships as well as to build policy capacity fanning said that this is a big job for a staff she said that she understands that bureaucratically speaking this is simpler in a way but the first responders will have a ton of interface and still have to respond so there are a lot of dotted lines which makes it somewhat complicated said that this is no different than the lines they currently have emergency management services will not change and the only intent is to do more if they can the director will simply serve as the administrator over those divisions helping to develop greater partnerships as they can he said that he will not the relationships they hope to achieve but necessary functions will not go away chairman said that he has several hot spots in his district and he likes the message this proposal sends to the community it sends the message that the city is no longer fighting crime with guns but instead is dealing with the deeper issues like gun violence drugs abuse and mental health he said that with this proposal they are saying to the community that they are being heard that government leaders understand the issues and they care he said that instead of viewing some of these offenders as criminals they can see that some of them just really need help he said that he is mindful of how a structure like this could have helped flint better address their water safety problem he said that he receives lots of calls about neglect or abuse of animals and he feels is a better fit for inspectors are out in the community all the time and can witness some of these issues firsthand and help address them before calls come in he said that he believes this proposal sends a good message to citizens that they are heard and that systemic issues are being dealt with said that there is always a layer of big data in running a smarter city he asked if the intention with this new office is to take a look at how that data is used to look for opportunities for smart solutions said that they are collecting a lot of data and this new structure gives them a real opportunity to build that capacity in the mayors office he said that they hope to put it in a more usable format to use as a tool across jurisdictions with the primary goal still being to maintain and improve operations as they are now he said that big data is coming and the use of analytics across industries is taking off one example of this is with ems who is using their data to identify frequent in ambulance or emergency room calls and to go out ahead of emergencies by doing this they have reduced their costs and the city and county are not paying a dime for ambulance services in the city now he added that there are a lot of issues surrounding data and the trick is to disassociate people when examining data because of information privacy laws health information cannot be used for public safety purposes and and are not going to give them that information said that when they disassociate personal identifiers however they can get a bigger data pool and see the trends there is a lot of intelligence gathering capacity within and and they are already doing a lot of that but this new structure gives them the capacity to look closer at those things and take the next steps to increasing their data management chair thanked for his presentation
