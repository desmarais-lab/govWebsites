a charter school incubator program chairman called the meeting to order at pm with the following members present bob angel sanders and gray was absent brown and lewis were also in attendance general counsel represented council staff chairman asked committee members to introduce themselves and indicate which portion of the county they represent he then asked for consent to hear proposal no first on the agenda consent was given proposal no establishes the office of education innovation and creates an education tax credit and a charter school incubator program stated that the mayors office is not yet ready for the committees consideration of this proposal and has asked that it be postponed until the next meeting he moved seconded by to postpone proposal no until the motion carried by a vote of proposal no censures and removes him as president of the council for his unilateral and unauthorized use of council funds to contract with brooks to redraw precinct boundaries said that she was surprised to see that this proposal was referred to the rules and public policy committee when there is an ethics committee that deals with what she deems to be unethical behavior she said that she brought this proposal forward because president entered into a contract with someone to redraw precinct boundaries which was completely outside of his authority it was not council business and he spent on this matter and refused to cancel the contract after she and others brought it to his attention to recoup the funds said that it is disconcerting that the president would enter into such a contract that is completely outside of the authority of the council the authority for redrawing precinct boundaries lies solely with the mayors office she said that while president has indicated that the mayor delegated this authority to him they are separate branches of government and the president of the council should act under the rules of the council and at the direction of the council body and not at the direction of the executive branch she said that this act went above and beyond that authority and she moved seconded by sanders to send proposal no to the full council with a do pass recommendation chairman referred to concern that this proposal was not referred to the ethics committee he asked if actually filed an ethics violation complaint against or simply introduced this proposal said that she thought that introducing the proposal would meet the requirement of a complaint chairman said that when the ethics rules were revisited a year or so ago he believes there were certain steps and a procedure laid out through which a could lodge a specific ethics complaint to be considered by the ethics committee general counsel stated that this is correct and to his knowledge no complaint was filed according to that process said that as the president of the council he is responsible for assigning proposals to committees he said that he assigned this proposal to the rules and public policy committee because there was no allegation of a violation of the ethics ordinance therefore he could not send it to the ethics committee and sent it to rules because it alleges an illegal unilateral and unauthorized use of council funds he said that he did research the proposal to make sure he was sending it to the right committee and he feels comfortable with that assignment said that since this proposal is directed solely at him personally and at his position as president he would like to address not only the claims made in this proposal but also some that have been publicly made in the last couple of months the proposal specifically states that he illegally entered into a contract and comments have been made that he did that unilaterally and the expenditure of those funds and signing of the contract was unauthorized he said that he has combed the code and there is nothing in the code that impairs the councils ability to enter into a contract for legal services as should know as she is also a lawyer he said that this contract was a combined contract for and redistricting and he has been upfront since the beginning regarding the need for this contract he said that when the general assembly redistricted their house and senate seats they did so based on census data blocks which did not adhere to the precinct lines in order to marry precincts with census data they passed a law that says that the county executive which in other counties is the county commissioner but in this county is the mayor was required to and complete the process before the filing date which is basically before the end of the year everyone on the council should know that they did not budget in any portion of the mayors budget for because they had no reason to know they would be compelled to by the general assembly six months later he said that when the mayors office got that letter a representative from the mayors office called him and reiterated that they did not have a budget to and knew that the council had contemplated redistricting and budgeted for it and asked if they would mind rolling the into the existing redistricting contract since it is the exact same data set and a nearly identical process he said that the mayor would then perform the fiduciary functions associated with this process going forward said that he responded that he would have to check into it and he hired brooks to perform these services collaboratively and the contract reflects that noted that the last time this council redistricted it cost half a million dollars and the last time the county clerks office it cost over with this contract the county is getting those combined functions for under therefore even though this proposal alleges that the president was being fiscally irresponsible this contract will actually save compared to historical spending stated that another claim was that this decision was unilateral and unauthorized he said that professional service contracts are not required to be bid under law nor have they been historically bid by this or any other governing body he said that as president he is authorized to sign professional service contracts on behalf of the council he signs the contracts for general counsel chief financial officer and minority caucus counsel he also authorized the services and signed contracts for bob and attorneys for both caucuses during the utility deal all professional service contracts are signed by the president of the council whoever it be at the time a contract is entered into said that there were other allegations made publicly that are not contained in the proposal that he would also like to address the first statement made at both a council hearing and through the media was a claim that the election division of the state of would do the for free he said that this is not true he said that the election division is a bipartisan organization that must agree in order for the office to take official action in this case they did not agree that the election division should offer this service to all counties in or county because based on their staff levels and other required services they could not offer it fairly to everyone the second public claim made in both the media and at the full council meeting was that there were only two or three precincts that were he said that this is also not true as the letter that was sent on listed precincts in the process of addressing those precincts nearly additional precincts were impacted so of the current or so precincts changes are needed in nearly of them in order to comply with law another assertion was that could be done in one day or as claimed in the council meeting within to minutes by a staff member of the mayors office and some geographical information system equipment stated that having spoken with brooks he has invested more than professional hours in alone presented the committee with two large inch binders with a copy of the that was filed with the election division addressing all precincts he said that he does not know of any mayors staffer or equipment that could generate that amount of information in a day or even more incredibly to minutes said that none of the items that have been alleged are based on facts or demonstrate a remote understanding of the law he said that he believes them to be personal attacks that were timed politically to inspire some distrust in this body going into an election and he encouraged members of this committee not to support the said that many of the statements made by are well beyond the scope of the proposal before the committee she said that she believes is treading on shady ground by referring this matter to the rules committee and should instead have himself and had the vice president act on his behalf she added that there was a witch hunt previously on the council with allegations of unethical behavior by a where in the end there was nothing to reprimand him for other than a procedural point stated that she believes the procedural point has been made here as well she said that in this instance was spent on business without council authorization the mayor could have followed the normal procedure and increased his budget by bringing forth a proposal approving an additional appropriation the contract was signed under cover of darkness in and not even members of own caucus were aware of it for months afterward referred to a letter from the election division where they had split up the various counties with issues and county was assigned to part of their staff the letter goes through in detail what could have been done because president did not bring this before the council and have the discussion regarding this matter he missed out on the opportunity for the council to decide that this was not council business and council funds should not be spent on such an endeavor she added that the binders of information provided by go beyond the scope of the work required she said that there was one precinct split in half due to the new maps and others that needed technical corrections due to the census block she said that brooks expanded the scope of what needed to be done she said that however sticking to the intent of this proposal president did not have the authority to execute this contract and did not seek authorization from the council she said that they do not need to promote a situation where a council president just decides on his own to enter into a contract regarding something that is not even council business and spend council funds she said that it is the wrong thing to do said that it is one thing to read a proposal and claim it as fact but it is another thing to go through and articulate facts that support the argument he said that he believes he has done that and is wrong on the facts the law and the policy he added that this is clearly a personal attack and he would again encourage his colleagues to vote against the proposal sanders asked that recuse himself from voting on this proposal chairman responded that had already indicated his intent to recuse himself from voting on this matter asked to explain why this proposal does not meet the requirements of an ethical complaint read from sec a of the revised code of the consolidated city and county which reads an allegation of violations of ethical standards by a with respect to conduct of a not during a meeting of the council or a council committee shall be made by filing a statement of allegation that complies with sec with the clerk of the council he said that the ordinance then indicates that the statement of allegation would be referred to the chair of the ethics committee to then set forth the procedure for hearing the allegation said that she believes spending of council funds on business is a violation of the ethics ordinance the motion to send proposal no to the full council with a do pass recommendation failed by a vote of with and casting the negative votes and abstaining proposal no requires that the president of the council that certain contract for the redrawing of precinct boundaries and of council election districts and to encumber the remaining unspent and remaining funds on said contract in the council budget said that much of this has already been addressed in the previous discussion however in the past when the council has taken part in redistricting it has always been an open and transparent process in and the council passed several resolutions setting forth the okay to go forward in purchasing software and services to deal with redistricting she said that they laid out a very detailed plan as to when meetings would occur and what the procedure would be she said none of that has occurred in this instance she said that the council does not even have the authority over the precincts and this has not been an open or transparent contract she said that when she first brought up this matter in the full council meeting the second payment was due to be paid that next week the way it is arranged now the final payment is set to be paid this week she said that no council president in the history of has done anything so as to not work with the full council go behind their backs and push something through without full authorization she moved seconded by sanders to send proposal no to the full council with a do pass recommendation sanders said that while members of the committee not agree that this action rose to the level of censuring one of their own caucus members the fact that she did not find out about the contract until as the minority leader even though it was signed on is inappropriate she said that she was never consulted and was told for the first eight months of the year that there would be no redistricting until she said she is not sure what happened that this assertion shifted in she also heard rumors that the mayor was going to pay the council back for this cost but does not understand why the mayor did not just appropriate the additional funds she said that she asked president following a committee on committees meeting why he would sign this contract and if it included redistricting and was surprised at his response that he did not recall it having anything to do with redistricting and that it was all about she said that a few days later she received an email from countering this discussion and indicating that he had not been disingenuous and the contract was in fact all about redistricting she said that asked the council clerk during their discussion if the contract dealt with redistricting and the clerk was not certain she said this matter therefore seemed to be clandestine at best she said that after finding out the contract existed it took her an additional four days to get a copy of it sanders said that she understands that the portion of this contract has to be done but the office of the mayor is the entity that has the authority to do that she does not understand why this was done under the cover of darkness and without involving input from the minority caucus she said she recognizes that the cost was much higher several years ago but the software is much more advanced than it was the last time redistricting was done and the matter went to litigation she said they now have districts that both parties have won under and this tells her that they are pretty good districts sanders said that she understands that the needs to be done but this is the responsibility of the mayors office she said that under the circumstances because the mayor signed off last week on an order to accept the precincts they cannot even get an independent review to know if they are in compliance or not she said that this therefore snowball into more litigation or illegalities she added that this is about suppressing the vote and insuring that candidates such as brooks wife who is running for congress under these new districts and precincts has an advantage she said that it is ludicrous that this had to be done under the cover of darkness and for that reason she supports proposal no said there were a lot of assumptions and presumptions in sanders remarks he said that if sanders had taken the opportunity to look at the maps he filed she would find that the proposed districts are equally if not more competitive than the current districts he added that a change in precincts or districts does not suppress or affect votes additionally the general assembly sets the congressional districts and therefore this has nothing to do with any advantages in the congressional race he said that he has not tried to hide this from anyone and everything he does is a matter of public record he moved to table proposal no sanders said when precinct lines are altered and residences are pushed further from polling places they are in fact suppressing the vote especially in poor districts said that that the went from precincts to and therefore they now have more precincts in a smaller geographic area and residents should instead be closer to polling places added that another issue is that this contract does not give the council rights to any software the attorney might have purchased in and software was purchased by the council and was made available to many other groups including nonprofit organizations she said that the conversation they are having presently should have been taken to the full council before any contract was entered into chairman called for a vote on motion to send proposal no to the full council with a do pass recommendation asked if a motion to table the proposal was not offered last said that he did make that motion but realizes it is out of order and therefore withdraws the motion the motion to send proposal no to the full council with a do pass recommendation failed by a vote of with and casting the negative votes moved seconded by to table proposal no said that under council rules they cannot table an item they have already acted on said that the motion to send it to the council failed which constitutes no action having been taken and the proposal is still before the committee the motion to table proposal no carried by a vote of with and sanders casting the negative votes moved in light of this fact to also table proposal no as it is still lingering without action seconded the motion the motion to table proposal no carried by a vote of with and sanders casting the negative votes and abstaining proposal no provides that the committee on committees review and determine its approval or rejection of any contract for services or other proposed expenditures in excess of five hundred dollars prior to the execution of any such contract or of any such expenditure said that she brought this forward to insure that things are done in an open and transparent manner without just saying those words and not having it mean anything she said that she included the amount of as a placeholder to make sure this got introduced but does not want to create a situation that hinders ongoing expenditures in the clerks office or travel to conferences like the national league of cities moved seconded by sanders to amend the excess amount in the proposal to instead of said that he would not oppose such an amendment necessarily but since has said that the goal is to promote transparency he is not sure how increasing the dollar amount promotes such said he is all for transparency and he thinks is a good number and will therefore oppose the amendment said that he also would tend to think is too low he asked if expects the committee on committees to review all contracts or just professional services contracts said that the committee would need to review all expenditures over in the council office most expenditures would not be that high and anything over that amount would most likely be contracts or salaries she said that the salaries however are usually set during the budget and there could be some kind of blanket approval for recurring charges like phone bills she said this would avoid the problem of anyone entering into a contract or spending a large amount of funds without approval by the council said that he agrees that is probably too low but the clerk as the director of the agency approves of the expenditures currently the president only signs off on professional services contracts travel charitable gifts plaques or other things of that nature he asked if under this proposal the expenditures would still be under the responsibility of the clerk or if wants every expenditure above the chosen amount to be reviewed by the committee on committees said that the idea is to be fiscally responsible and review all expenditures over in the council office said that while seems arbitrary seems too low so he would be amenable to increasing the amount asked if the committee on committees would be the final for expenditures said that unless something seems questionable and they bring it to the full council the way the proposal is written they would have the full authority she said that the expenditure would still have to be within the budget she said that while the council rules are not all that clear on larger expenditures she thinks it is clear that they should not be spending council funds on business said that in his experience as president four years ago a lot of things had to happen immediately such as negotiating the contracts for the general counsel minority caucus counsel chief financial officer and those individuals had to start performing their duties immediately and tying up these types of decisions too long might delay the work of the council he said that he did consult with the minority leader on who they wanted for their minority caucus counsel but he negotiated all those contracts and signed them when he was president and it did not require anyones approval he said that he is concerned they are putting a hurdle that might delay getting started at the beginning of the year said that the committee on committees generally meets before a full council hearing so she does not see this as a problem she said that it is a personal preference as to whether they want more open transparency or not she added that she is not trying to create stumbling blocks but feels there should be more fiscal oversight than there currently is stated that a possible compromise might be to state that any contract over a certain amount must be submitted to the committee on committees within days he said that this would ultimately achieve the goal of public openness said that she does not want the council to get into the same situation where someone enters into a contract and it is two months down the road before someone realizes it like what happened with the contract with brooks she said that this cannot happen anymore no matter which political party is in charge said that he understands where is coming from but makes some valid points and he does not want to hinder the daily operations of the office he said that this will frankly affect the democrats more at this point in time said that as the proposal is currently written it actually conflicts with a couple of other rules of the council already in place one rule grants the president of the council the right to act as the personnel administrator for the council office including setting payroll levels secondly there is a provision for the minority and majority leaders to hire their own counsel this has to be approved by one other member of the committee on committees now but this reads a little bit in conflict with current language said that she is open to postponing the proposal and reworking it realizing that it might not get passed until the beginning of next year because she wants to do it right she said that she is not sure she agrees with assessment regarding conflict with the personnel language in current rules said that salaries and classifications are set in the budget ordinance every year and the rules give the president the authority to act as the personnel administrator for the council office sanders said that she does not see how there would be a backlog because the president of the council could still negotiate contracts they could then bring them to the committee on committees for review and approval she said that an extra committee on committees meeting can usually be scheduled pretty quickly if something needs to be addressed in a hurry as there are only three members to accommodate moved seconded by to postpone proposal asked that those rewriting the proposal consider including a period of time for reporting to the committee on committees on how council funds are being spent so that they are not causing a hurdle but still keeping everyone informed
