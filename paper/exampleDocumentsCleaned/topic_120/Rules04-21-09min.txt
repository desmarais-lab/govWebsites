term ending date is chairman asked if ms has the time available to serve ms sanders moved seconded by and to send proposal no to the full council with a do pass recommendation the proposal no amends the code with respect to appropriations of funds from federal stimulus grants said that he had a meeting with and the city controller to discuss the stimulus grants coming from various state and federal agencies and the various requirements that accompany these grant applications he said that the biggest concern was how to get this money out in the community and get projects moving in order to provide jobs he said that this proposal only applies to stimulus funds and would allow for the projects to be submitted to assigned committees for final approval without going through the entire full council approval process this proposal is simply an attempt to streamline the process for getting projects going as soon as possible he asked to explain how the proposal accomplishes this said that after discussions with the controller and council chief financial officer it is the understanding that allocation of stimulus funds will happen through an application process although they are not certain of that at this stage he said that in this process the city would be asked to make application to a federal or state agency or department for funds for a specific project the way the proposal is written the committee would approve the application and then if the application is approved the city can go ahead and spend the money without having to go through the appropriation process he said that the full council approval process can take anywhere from three to six weeks and there was concern about this time constraint slowing down the effectiveness of the stimulus funds he added that state law actually allows expenditures of these kinds of funds without an appropriation by the local agency however it has been the practice of this council for years through a provision in the code that no federal or state grants will be spent without appropriation by the council he reiterated that this is the councils rule and is not required by state law he concluded that stimulus funds therefore would actually be exempt as per state law from requiring an appropriation therefore this is a modified procedure for these funds that are intended for specific projects and not an ongoing program or expense said that she can understand the need for this proposal and certainly supports the objective for getting these dollars into the community with speed because one of the main goals of the stimulus plan is to retain and create jobs however these are still tax dollars and she urged the controllers office to bring sufficient information to the committees for approval so that members can make an informed decision and so that this is not merely a pro said that it is his understanding that the controller will present the whole package in detail of the project for which the application requests funds and this is what the committee would see and need to approve gray asked if the city will make the application and then the committee will make a final decision said that as the city learns funds are available they would bring an application to the council with all of the details on how the money is spent the do not know how long it will take for the applications to be approved or when they will get the funds and this gives the controller the authority to then spend those funds when they are awarded gray asked if the council is approving the application before the funds are awarded said that this is correct and not all applications will be funded this proposal would allow the committees to approve the project for funding with no second appropriation needed gray asked if the city would then have a stack of applications awaiting approval and as the money comes through it would be assigned to those particular projects responded said that she does not see language in the proposal that spells out that the council would review the applications and the appropriations would then just go through committee said that the application is actually just going through committee as per this proposal and not to the full council the committee could still choose to refer the application to the full council but it would not automatically go to the full council sanders said that she has concerns about approving projects but not appropriations as the council is the local fiscal body charged with appropriating tax dollars she said that this process does not seem to provide any accountability she said that there does not seem to be any single point of contact for the stimulus funds being spent by the city and she cannot support the council abdicating their authority to approve appropriations she said that she is concerned that a committee might approve an application but not share the details with the rest of the council and she is not sure the committee would have enough information in a timely fashion to make this type of decision chairman asked if the stimulus funds are like normal grants and are awarded for specific projects and cannot be used for anything other than that dedicated use said that this is his understanding he said that he believes the city will have to make applications to different agencies as there is not one stimulus agency some funds will filter through the state level but no one is yet sure what the exact process will gray said that he is not comfortable with someone else approving use of these dollars without council input he said that he believes the committee process in place now with the council should be used and if something is in need of expediting it can be arranged stated that the point of contact for stimulus funds would actually be the controller as well as the committees to which the applications are submitted for approval she said that the accountability however would be in the hands of the controller she added that as the chair for the administration and finance committee she would be happy to regular reports from the controller who will be receiving and dispersing those funds deputy controller stated that the controllers office is flexible with regard to reporting on the stimulus funds as they will be monitoring them very carefully and would be happy to report to any committee or the council as a whole as requested he added that the main objective of this proposal is to expedite the funds and get them into the community as soon as possible asked if the controllers office has any idea how soon some of those funds will come in and if a report might be appropriate in or said that they do not know for sure but he can do some more research and will keep in touch with to get the committee as much information in as timely a fashion as possible gray said that the city does not know when the money will be coming how it will be coming or what the time frame for the start of the projects will be he asked why the council needs to be in a rush to expedite the procedure until some more of these unknowns are revealed said that there is nearly always a timing issue involved when applying for grants sometimes the funds have to be obligated very quickly and dispersed as soon as they are approved he said that in some cases only a couple of weeks are allowed to obligate the funds and begin work on the project and they just do not know what this process will bring with regard to time constraints he said that each application could have different requirements and the controllers office simply would like some flexibility to move quickly if it is required referred to subsection in sec of the proposal and asked if the word should be changed to shall she said that saying leaves it open for applications to be processed and money spent without council approval stated that he is not sure all of the projects and applications will have a timing issue associated and this proposal is simply offering an alternative to the normal approval process if it is needed he said that in the event they use the expedited process this language refers to the option that the controller or not choose to go ahead through the normal appropriation approval process he clarified that the application approval would have already happened at the committee level and is not optional asked if it would be acceptable to members of the committee if the proposal was modified to allow committees to approve the application but then once the project is approved and funds are awarded the appropriation would come back before the council like a rezoning case where it is introduced and voted on in the same evening by the full council as final approval said that this would be acceptable to her and would alleviate some of her concerns chairman said that he also had some concerns and this would be more acceptable to him he said that the full council recently approved a proposal that gave the controller the authority to spend money and then review an application later and he had the same concerns at that time he said that he does not distrust the controllers office but feels a sense of responsibility as the fiscal body asked if the controllers office would have a problem with this modification to the proposal or postponing it to the next meeting to make those amendments said that he does not believe that would be a problem but they do not know for sure as each application is different he added that the controllers office will be as flexible as possible in making changes and working with the council during this process and would have no opposition to a postponement moved seconded by sanders to postpone proposal no until the next meeting in order to incorporate this change asked if there is another rules and public policy committee meeting before the second council meeting chairman replied in the affirmative and the clerk verified the date of the next meeting as asked if he can incorporate this modification and language into the proposal before that next meeting said that some issues arise due to the state statute requiring public notice of a hearing for things that go through the normal appropriation process he said that this type of process would involve a publication with ten days notice and he will have to do some research in rewriting the proposal to treat these funds differently somehow to work around that delay stated that she wants to make it clear to the public that the council is not in a rush simply to spend money but instead the intent is to get the stimulus money into the community for job retention and creation the motion to postpone proposal no until carried by a vote
