review the current regulations of taxicabs and other public vehicles for hire and make recommendations for updating those stated that the reason for establishing this commission is that while certain regulations provide for the safety and welfare of the general public that far exceeds those of their competition of transportation network companies many are overly burdensome costly and lead to loss
