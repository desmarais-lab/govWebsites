department of education and money that is not raised through property taxes is supposed to be raised by the state through their basic grant said they have some concern due to the limited funding available to the state and the ability for the state to increase appropriations to absorb money that is no longer raised locally he said township is at risk to lose teachers said in the capital projects fund revenue should not be lost but would mean raising local property taxes to offset the loss of inventory tax he said the potential inventory tax loss in township is million acting chair asked if the school board has a preference on how they would want to handle the inventory loss said he cannot speak on the school boards behalf but the state has given authority to the school board to raise taxes to make up for the shortfall that they did not provide asked if teachers were to be laid off what it means to the school system said this would be a bigger discussion but it would probably mean elimination of programs sue representative of the greater chamber of commerce said the council should take into consideration how the homestead credit affects homeowners and renters she said there are other hits that are coming against the property tax that effect the decision on whether to increase the property tax she said there is the trending the property tax replacement freeze and the real estate credit that is against the property tax ms said this issue is going to take some decision making and vision and is happy to see the discussion started acting chair said one of the options is to adopt because it would allow the council to offer a homestead credit to the homeowners that are going to be impacted by the possible increase in property taxes she said to adopt the
