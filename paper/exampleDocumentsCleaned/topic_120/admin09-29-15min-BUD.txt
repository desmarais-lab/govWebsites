on pages through he said that the general obligation debt has decreased because the city has not issued any of that kind of debt since about he said that the city also issues debt through individual taxing or service districts which can be either general obligation or specific revenue debt but these are not considered debt of the city but rather debt of that specific district clerks note lewis and arrived at pm reviewed some of the most recent tax increment financing district projects and bond transactions as outlined on pages through of the handout with savings outlined he referred to the current credit ratings noted on page from the three credit rating agencies with a comparison of ratings of other peer cities on page and notable events in the last year with regard to ratings said that the city must continue to monitor its reserve levels stay on top of criteria and methodology changes by the rating agencies and be aware that structural imbalances in approved budgets will be viewed as credit negatives he said that to maintain credit ratings through the property tax caps and recession period is quite an accomplishment stated that some new initiatives of the bond bank include an annual bond and note report and the launch of a new website to provide increased transparency and disclosure he gave a brief of the website showing members how to navigate the new site brown council chief financial officer said that some agencies have capital funds that are different than their general operating funds he said that when the water company was sold to produce funds to be used for rebuild capital projects it was not really separated from the general operating budget into a special capital fund he asked if an asset is sold again if it would help with the rating agencies if those monies were kept in a capital fund said that the rating agencies look at everything including formal policies issued by the legislative branch and can probably see through that he said that his initial reaction is that he does not think it would have a positive or negative impact on the rating said that there is nothing in this presentation that shows what it costs to run the bond bank he asked what it costs to run their office and if they have a deficit said that this body does not approve their budget as it is subject to their board of directors so that is why the actual office budget was not presented said that they are asking the committee to accept their report without giving them the information chair said that the bond bank usually just makes a courtesy presentation showing the council the impact of bond issuances and debt on the city and county budgets asked why they do not also present their offices budget numbers said that their budget is public information and can be found on their website if anyone is interested asked if there is remaining variable rate debt said that they use only fixed rates asked if the debt capacity could be threatened if the rates rise said that this could be a possibility with future debt said that she feels it has been overstated that a certain amount of money is to be maintained in the stability fund in order for the credit rating not to be affected lewis said that did not make any mention of the fiscal stability fund but it has been explained that the bond rating was coming down because the council tapped into those funds she asked if the rating agencies are looking more at how much money is in that fund or if it is more about the rate of spending being more than the revenue being brought in said that they do look at the fiscal stability fund when that fund was created there was language in the ordinance that indicated this fund was created to help maintain the credit rating at the current level he said that it is not his job to get into a policy discussion regarding this fund but his message has always been that if they are going to spend from that fund then in the ordinance that authorizes the fund there should be an indication of how and when that money will be repaid he said that he does not think the rating agencies would have a problem with that lewis asked if this fund was mentioned in the rating agency reports said that it was and that in particular said that a continued drawing of this fund would be viewed as a negative lewis asked if there is a magical number of dollars that needs to remain in that fund said that there is no magic number but million seems to have worked for a while to satisfy the rating agencies lewis said that they have been criticized for tapping into it but they cannot definitely say that this is the reason they are being downgraded asked if there are no longer any more variable interest rates being applied to any borrowing said that there are not asked if there is any projected intent to refinance in order to take advantage of lower interest rates responded in the affirmative and said that they are constantly examining the current rates and outstanding debt and some refunding is planned said that there has been some discussion regarding a potential raise in interest rates by the federal government and she asked if has any estimate on how long current rates will remain said that he thought they would be raised last week but it is definitely coming county for administration and finance portion only brown said that after reviewing all the presentations and proposed budgets there are no amendments on any particular or departments budget to suggest at this time all of them could use more funds but they do not have the luxury of increasing funding at this time he said that he does have one amendment to offer to restore the local homestead credit in section allocation of county option income tax revenue is inserted to read pursuant to the auditor retains the local homestead credit distribution of ten million dollars brown stated that general counsel to the council indicated that the members of the county income tax council would have had to introduce a resolution to eliminate the homestead credit by in order to do so legally since that did not happen they no longer have the ability to eliminate the credit and in order to be compliant with the department of local government finance they need to insert this language to restore the million for he provided a handout showing the amendment lewis moved seconded by to amend proposal no as per browns suggestion said that she understood the credit was being decreased but not eliminated brown said that by not including this language in the budget ordinance it essentially eliminated it for only the county income tax council can legally eliminate the credit he said that they can still make some adjustments based on how much of this funding is needed and did reduce it from million to million but as the budget was presented all of that revenue was eliminated for hunter said that he wants to make it clear that this is referring to the local homestead credit and not the states homestead deduction brown said that this is the motion to amend proposal no to insert the language for the revenue distribution of the local homestead credit carried by a vote of with casting the negative vote brown noted that the controller will take that million revenue addition and put it through the formula to fix the budget ordinance everywhere else that formula appears they will make technical adjustments for the councils review before their vote on the budget on moved to divide the question on the vote on proposal no to vote separately on the appropriations for the office of the county assessor county general fund property reassessment fund endorsement fee fund and county sales disclosure fund she said that she would like to abstain from voting on this portion of the proposal to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest as she is employed by the county assessors office lewis seconded the motion and unanimous consent was given to bifurcate the vote on proposal no hunter said that he is not sure it is really necessary for to abstain but he honors her request to do as she feels necessary lewis added that she abstained on this portion last year but her spouse no longer works for the assessors office therefore she no longer has a conflict and will be voting on this section hunter moved seconded by lewis to send the county assessors portion of proposal no to the full council with a do pass recommendation the motion carried by a vote with abstaining hunter moved seconded by to send the remainder of the administration and finance committee
