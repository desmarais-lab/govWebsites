long overdue she said that if are doing their jobs properly they are attending many more meetings than actually required as well as attending events holding other outside meetings spending time away from their regular jobs speaking at zoning hearings and alcoholic beverage commission meetings meeting with financial representatives during the budget process attending neighborhood meetings and meeting with the mayor or other appointed or elected officials she said that take an oath of office to serve their council districts and the compensation should be adequate to do that effectively she said that the proposal does not increase any of the additional monies individuals receive as per for attending committee and full council meetings and she is not suggesting any pay increase for leadership positions or chairmanships the increase to the annual salary would be and she believes elected officials should be adequately compensated for the hours they put into serving this city brown chief financial officer for the council made a brief presentation outlining the highlights of proposal no with a comparison of salaries with elected councils of other cities similar to exhibit a he said that he also consulted with the councils general counsel and the councils salary does not have to be tied to the mayors salary by state law he believes they should be independent as the work they do is different than that of the mayor he said that it has been years since since the council received an increase he referred to exhibit a and said that the top six comparison cities listed are other consolidated city and county governments the others listed are only city councils and do not include county government duties this council is essentially doing the work of two councils combined but getting paid as one he said that is the lowest paid of any of the cities that they looked at acting chair said that while this council does both the work of the city and county they also have council members she asked for those only governing a city on this list how many council members they have brown said that some of the smaller cities have seven to eleven members and some of the larger cities have as many as members asked if these are cities similar to in size fiscal analyst for the council said that is most like in size and government structure he added that these numbers are the base salary and do not include per or benefits most all of these except for fishers include medical dental and vision coverage as well as reimbursement and travel accounts acting chair asked if these cities are in a downward spiral of tax collection like because of property tax caps said that he cannot say for sure but would guess that most cities are also facing budgetary issues in this economic climate brown said that he spoke with council staff in and their departments have been taking cuts because of the economy as well this is the first year they are also contemplating an increase as they have also seen a decline in clarified that the last council raise was granted in not and therefore it has been years since they have had an increase asked what has been done over the past years regarding salary increases for civilian employees in the city and county city controller office of finance and management stated that the last base adjustment to the salary schedule was done in they have asked agencies to be lean and implement efficiencies and some of them have been able to give increases on an basis through savings or attrition and combining positions however there has been no increase in the last few years said that it is her understanding that this increase could be absorbed into the council budget for she asked brown if the increase along with health benefits and public employees retirement fund costs could be covered in light of the four positions going away brown said that they underspend their budget every year and also have reserves he said that they estimate an additional would be needed after the savings from the elimination of the positions and he believes it can therefore be absorbed said that she understood that since the positions were eliminated long before this years budget process that those costs were no longer included in the budget brown said that they kept those funds in the budget but shifted them to character said that this concerns her and she asked why brown said that this gives them more flexibility in character especially in light of information services agency increases acting chair asked when the last time it was that the council staff received a raise committee clerk stated that it was three years ago acting chair asked how much the raise was ms said that it was in the range moved seconded by lewis to amend proposal no to eliminate the proposed increase for the mayor taking that salary back to to read as follows sec compensation of the mayor the compensation of the mayor is fixed pursuant to for calendar year and thereafter until modified in accordance with article iii of this chapter as an annual salary of one hundred thousand dollars lewis said that she will support the sponsor on this amendment but thinks that it is the wrong thing to do she said that she believes the mayor deserves a salary above whether it be the outgoing mayor or the incoming mayor and a more competitive salary is needed to attract the best and brightest to this critical position to serve the community said that over the last several days she has had conversations with senior members of mayor administration as well as with advisors to the new mayor team and both have raised some concerns about this pay increase for the mayor she read a press release that was sent out on her behalf yesterday explaining this action since introducing proposal no i have had the opportunity to discuss this matter with both mayor administration and incoming administration both have expressed significant concerns with the section dealing with the mayors salary out of respect for these concerns i will seek tomorrow to amend proposal no and remove the salary increase for the mayor with respect to the council the proposal to increase pay will remain a pending vote before the committee and the full council as an outgoing member of the council who has served for more than three decades i believe we must do all we can to encourage citizens to become engaged in local government and public service i look forward to continuing to discuss how best to do this in the days and weeks ahead said that team has not yet gotten into the budget to determine what positions are needed and what vacancies need to be filled out of respect for their concerns she decided to offer this said that he cannot understand the concerns of the current administration as he recalls that the mayor raised all his staff salaries last year above brown said that quite a few senior mayoral staff position salaries were raised above said that he has an issue with staff members making more than the mayor he asked what the concerns were said that their concerns were more toward the timing of this action and the fact that the incoming administration have a say in this as they were still looking at the budget to determine what is needed lewis said that it surprises her that mayor now has a problem with this and its timing as the salary that is being recommended came from his administration and last year the council was asked by his administration to consider these exact same numbers said that he was not a part of these recent conversations between the administration and with regard to the prior discussions they did look at the existing budget to see if an increase was feasible last year but he is not sure what has changed in this regard between then and now acting chair called for public testimony on the amendment citizen said that it is irrelevant to have this conversation he said that the council is greatly underpaid and to keep the new mayor from becoming corrupt and unjust maybe he needs a raise too he said that he believes each should have a package with a salary and an additional for a paid assistant in the district he said that the council administers a budget in the billions and they are working as slaves and not being compensated properly wade citizen said that he believes the salaries should remain at the status quo the new mayor has not yet proven himself and they are jumping the gun he said that raises should come about through evaluations and the council should be evaluated by the taxpayers not among themselves he said that his evaluation of their performance would be poor and would not merit a raise he said that they have filed lawsuits against illegal actions of the mayor and then dropped them this mayor has shown that the city could be run without this current council he said that he refuses to continue to be financially raped deceived and manipulated the motion to amend proposal no carried by a vote of with casting the negative vote moved to amend sec of section of proposal no as follows members of the council as employees participate in employee benefit programs on the same basis as other elected and employees of the city of however if a member of the council is employed outside of employment with the city or county and the employer of a councilor offers health insurance coverage and the employer pays or more of the annual health insurance premium then the councilor not participate in the city sponsored health insurance program seconded the motion to amend said that this amendment is in response to a conversation with mayor chief of staff who indicated that the mayor would like to see this language included acting chair asked for the reasoning behind this language stated that she believes other employees of the city and county are currently under this structure stated that this is correct and said that the spousal exclusion is in place for other acting chair asked if a spouse has the availability of coverage for the family member they would have to take that coverage and not participate in the said that this is correct asked if this is the same language as what is in the ordinance covering other employees said that he would have to check to be sure said that he would need to see that it is the same before voting in favor said that this exception is included in the employee manual and not actually in the code he said that in the email exchanges he was copied on it looked as if they tried to mirror the language here with what is in the manual agreed and said that he did not check to make sure it was the same language but believes that was the reason for the change to mirror the employee manual said that he believes this language mirrors the intent of the employee manual but have never been required to operate under those guidelines because of the separation of powers he said that the courts also operate outside of the employee manual on some items however he said that he believes this is a good thing to include even though he does not support the overall proposal hunter said that a on the amendment is not clear in his opinion especially since state law prohibits from being employed by the city and county in any capacity anymore said that it is correct that council positions are and that can no longer hold another position with the city or county and still hold their office he said that the intent was that if a was employed elsewhere in addition to their employment with the council that they would have to take the insurance plan of their employment and not the he said that this language was reviewed by the human resources director this afternoon hunter said that he understands the intent but the wording does not make that clear said that changing the words outside of to in addition to might clear that up hunter agreed and said that she would accept that friendly amendment to her motion hunter said that he still has concerns about this amendment however with regard to the hour affordable care act he asked how this legislation weighs in on that and how this amendment might affect other guidelines for federal said that this simply says that a employee who is eligible for coverage with another employer outside of the city or county must use that coverage but if it is not offered by their other employer they would be eligible for coverage under the city and plan hunter said that when things like this are put on paper it can get very complicated in relation to other laws that interplay this amendment was just written today and it has not had time for the proper vetting he asked if anyone has talked to a specialist to see if they have any issues with this language he said that he believes they should consult with a health insurance professional to make sure there are no unintended consequences said that he believes this language mirrors the exclusion that is already in place for other employees withdrew his second and the motion to amend failed due to lack of a second moved to amend proposal no by having these increases take effect for calendar year and thereafter instead of and fixing the date of effect as she said that she did not even know got paid when she first ran for office but most are aware of what the salary is coming into the elections she said that she was under the conviction that the councils budget was reduced by the positions being eliminated and she is simply stunned that this did not happen she said that character is for contracts not salaries and there are a lot of people working in this building who deserve a raise more than she does there are civilian employees working for the city and county in a position who still qualify for poor relief this is unacceptable and in light of this she does not feel she should have a raise she said that while the council salary does not have to be tied to the mayors salary it currently is tied together in the code and reducing the mayor salary back down to causes this increase for council to go against the current code said that both mayors have said they will decline the raise and she believes they should also defer the council raise to vet it more thoroughly and allow the new mayor and council as well as the public a chance to weigh in on it delaying it until would allow for that process the motion to amend failed for lack of a second asked who is responsible for raising the mayors salary said that under state law it is the councils job to set the salaries for elected officials acting chair asked if the salaries have to be tied together brown said that if this proposal is passed it would take the language out that ties the salaries together acting chair passed the gavel to and moved to amend proposal no to phase in the increase for as follows sec compensation of a the compensation of members of the council are is fixed pursuant to for the calendar years and and thereafter until modified in accordance with article iii of this chapter as a each member of the council shall receive an annual salary in an amount equal to twelve percent of the annual salary of the mayor as fixed in section of this code of sixteen thousand four hundred dollars thirteen thousand one hundred ten dollars the compensation of members of the council is fixed pursuant to for calendar year and thereafter until modified in accordance with article iii of this chapter as each member of the council shall receive an annual salary of fifteen thousand dollars the motion to amend failed for lack of a second returned the gavel to acting chair moved seconded by lewis to send proposal no to the full council with a do pass as amended recommendation said that he appreciates comments and intention but he believes this is the wrong move at the wrong time he said that if this had been considered in and discussed throughout the election and budget process not knowing who would be elected and therefore who would be affected he would have been more inclined to support it he said that he is also disturbed about the fact that the salaries for the positions were not eliminated from the budget as he believed they would actually be reducing the council budget and providing some savings for the city as a whole he said that while believes the council is underpaid he did not even know what the salary was when he ran for office and he did not run based on the financial benefits he said that he does believe they need good rules and a basic compensation that helps individuals remain above board but he feels this is the wrong time said that he is not in favor of this proposal and will not support it beyond committee however he will support the motion to vote it out of the committee so that the full council can weigh in on the matter as it affects all of lewis said that she supports and her proposal she said that she is puzzled regarding the comments about timing as mayor shared this exact same salary change last year and no one wanted to add their name to it to sponsor legislation because of the upcoming election she said that she is therefore puzzled by the timing concern as there is probably never an appropriate time and no one wants to give themselves a raise she said that she did know when she ran that there was a salary attached to the position and did know what it was while there probably never is a good time she believes a conversation regarding this issue needs to take place in front of the full council agreed that the full council should have a say in this he added that the mayor also does not get to tell them when it is time to give him a raise as that is the job of the council to decide if they decide that the seat is worthy of a better salary then they should make that change he said that he believes the mayors raise needs to be included in the proposal said that his salary has been consistent throughout his term on the council he added that he did not know anything about a discussion by the mayor regarding a salary increase he said that if the current mayor had suggested it in then the raise would not have affected the mayor because he was not running again if it had been brought to his attention at that time he would have considered it worthy of discussion and believes that was the right time to begin such discussions lewis apologized that the mayor did not have this conversation with the members of his republican caucus but this salary increase was shared with council leadership and no one wanted to sign on because of it being an election year hunter said that he knew nothing about this conversation either he said that a annual salary is small in terms of the size of the enterprise and he does believe the position deserves a higher salary but the current and incoming mayor have asked them to pull that increase and he will respect their request he said that as he is not returning to the council he feels a bit more freedom with regard to communication and can admit that mayor did not communicate well with their caucus and this idea was never brought up to them he said that the discussion never reached his attention or he would have been an advocate for it he does not hide the fact that he believes the mayor other officials and employees are underpaid and he encouraged the incoming council to continue to look for ways to remedy that situation he said that he is more inclined to support the mayors raise than the raise for the council because most council members have another job acting chair said that she also believes the mayor deserves a raise and she has a bit of heartburn about supporting this large of an increase for she said that while she agrees with the principle that you get what you pay for council members know the salary they will be getting when they run for office she said that she would prefer it be put into the budget discussions for next year she is still over whether or not to support the motion out of committee in order to allow all to have their say said that she does believe the new council will have to address the issue of giving city and county employees a raise in the assessors office employees received raises due to some savings and transfer of funds however county elected officials also have not had a raise for a while either and she is thinking about offering a further amendment on the council floor to include raises for them as she believes it is overdue said that the council just voted to give private companies and law firms million at the last meeting without any receipts or invoices and without the criminal justice center project even coming to fruition now they are considering what amounts to nothing for all the work they do and while some of the council members have the wherewithal to work for nothing others do not he said that says he does not need the money yet he had to recuse himself from voting on items this last year because he is getting paid by the city through contracts he said that this council approved a million bond issuance for former mayor proposed project without blinking an eye and without even a hearing in committee acting chair thanked for his support of the work that do and acknowledging that it is worth more she clarified that the amount of money to which referred was million not million said that no one works for nothing and with all the abuse and ridicule face they deserve to be compensated for it said that he agrees they are probably underpaid especially since they are responsible for allocating taxpayer dollars for a budget over billion dollars he said that there is no guarantee that a raise will insure they will do their due diligence as history has proven that they will approve proposals right on the spot without answers to questions or a proper public hearing he said that there is too much ambiguity and things going on behind closed doors that the taxpayers know nothing about he agrees however that officials who manage millions of dollars should be compensated fairly acting chair thanked and for their comments and said that many work way beyond a basis provided members with copies of a letter from attached as exhibit in support of the proposal the motion to send proposal no to the full council with a do pass as amended recommendation carried by a vote of with casting the negative vote proposal no reappoints to the county building authority board of trustees said that he works within the real estate industry and thinks he is therefore able to bring a level of expertise and understanding to the conversation in order to help advance what the authority is doing on a daily and weekly basis acting chair thanked for his willingness to serve and said that she appreciates his service moved seconded by to send proposal hunter stated that he has a prior obligation and needs to leave but he fully supports proposal no clerks note hunter left

have challenged the to continue to get rents and receivables to a more uniform percentage to further reduce that subsidy he said that when the market was gifted to the city the owners required that it

enjoy coming down on a morning with his father to get vegetables at the city market but like the rest of the city it has now been taken over by booze joints he said that alcoholism is an evil sickness and the market used to be a clean wholesome place to bring children but is now just filled with greasy spoons and booze joints he said that they are saying it is dilapidated but a renovation was just completed said that approving this proposal would show complete disregard of taxpayers by approving a year leases for a corporation while thousands of taxpayers are losing their homes because they are being sold out from under them without due said that he would like to see representatives come before the committee more often he congratulated them on their showcase of mom and pop shops instead of big businesses he thanked them for contributing to entrepreneurship in the city lewis said that the market is a great asset and part of the fabric of who they are in downtown she said that it is a great meeting place with business owners always front and center she said that she appreciates the update and it would be nice to hear from them more often she added in reference to comments that she only knows of one tenant in the market that serves alcohol ms said that this is correct and that they collect rent on that space as well brown said in response to comments that the city market

larger cases lately like the home explosion case where they need room to spread out the evidence put exhibits up and work with witnesses she said that they had some space previously at the regional

space available to them at this time she said that this will be an amendment to the current lease in their building and the additional cost will be a asked if due diligence has been done on this lease

agenda for before the full council approved by the rules and public policy committee which will add more reporting on the lease process said that this proposal actually approves the lease and does not

they cannot exceed a certain amount if the costs exceed that amount the tenant is not on the hook for those added expenses said that public notice has been given and the hearing is scheduled for at am she added that they are only four signatures short of reaching the required signatures moved seconded by to send proposal no proposal no amends the code regarding surety bonds for city and county officials introduced deputy controller risk management and said that senate enrolled act sea changed the requirements for bonding to extend to any employees handling cash including contract employees this is an attempt to put more safeguards in place this proposal will bring them into conformity with the new requirements is working to identify the employees that need to be covered and they will issue a blanket bond to cover those employees said that this reaffirms that they will provide coverage for all those acting on behalf of the city and better ties their regulations in with the state statute asked why the amount is only said that this is the amount currently in the ordinance asked how they came up with this amount as this city moves an awful lot of money said that they followed the state statute on that amount which addresses the rates for county elected officials all the officials maintain their own surety bonds but this is a blanket basis bonding for all employees handling or depositing cash clerks note left at pm stated that this bonding will also apply to contractors said that this is correct and he is investigating all of those who need to be included said that he is not familiar with how they arrive at these amounts said that they cannot bond for every possible scenario but the state board of accounts asks them to bond at a minimum most entities handle less than while the county treasurer and a few others handle larger amounts said that this low percentage is questionable as that responsibility would fall back on him as a taxpayer brown said that he appreciates concerns but the appropriate amount has been debated for decades they are not talking about a mistake but about wrongdoing by a public official the city and county would use their own money to cover a mistake with no malicious intent these bonds would kick in when there is a criminal act such as embezzlement this has been vetted by experts and the amount is at the appropriate level said that he thinks the experts are wrong as mayor has cost much more than this and he is tired of the manipulation and deceit moved seconded by lewis to send proposal no acting chair thanked chair

cities exhibit dear members of the and finance committee i had to work tonight until but i wanted to share some thoughts on the salary increase please keep these points in mind the last time the compensation for the was adjusted was years ago the proposed adjustment is less than if regular adjustments had been made over these last years for cost of living increases pay for councilors in similar cities closest to us all also considered part time oh pay for councilors in other cities in all of whom got to keep their at large councilors and both south bend ft this adjustment still has councilors and the mayor making a wage at the lower end of the scales of both national and lists this adjustment will have an increase in the budget for a year but we have an savings from the elimination of the at large council seats so the net increase for all councilors is only only per councilor what i think is most important is the preservation of our representative government i believe not doing this adjustment creates an environment that makes it difficult for working folks to run for office and opens the door only to people who are a retired independently wealthy have day jobs that do business with the government none of which represent the vast majority of the city and in many cases can in some cases even work against the best interest of most people thank you in advance for your consideration
