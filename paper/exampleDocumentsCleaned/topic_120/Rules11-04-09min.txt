provides access to all public records and the statute lists to classes of records that are not open to public access such as personnel information or proprietary contract information he said there are another to classes of information that an agency can have exempted from that open door law he said that is why they are leaving it to the discretion of corporation counsel to identify what information need to be redacted added that an example of the type of information that would be redacted or deleted could be employee social security numbers ms asked for an explanation of section said that simply means that the ordinance is not in effect until or later after passage if the proposal is not passed by that date ms asked if the day posting requirement would then go into effect beginning with contracts on said that the term redacted is not a term the public hears often and for their benefit a definition might be helpful chairman said that a simple definition might be to remove or delete

evening by those who testified moved seconded by to postpone proposal no until the proposal no supports express operations and the city said that this proposal was sent back to committee by the full council because of several concerns that the other side of this issue had not been presented he said that he has met with both parties this evening and there are two committees considering this language in the united states senate one committee has passed the measure without this language and the other committee is deeply involved in health care discussions at this time and will probably not consider the language for several weeks he said that since it be a moot issue it might be premature for this committee to act on the matter he said that he would instead rather table the issue until
