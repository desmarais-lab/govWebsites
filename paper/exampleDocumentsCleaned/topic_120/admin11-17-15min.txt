these were delinquencies from that were included in the tax sale the redemption period for these parcels ended in and the appeal process has now passed she said that the number of properties has reduced from the recession spikes they were seeing since she said that the proceeds of these sales are distributed like taxes back to all units of government in the jurisdiction where those parcels are located chair asked about some of the higher assessed properties of or more and what happens to those with a significantly higher value ms said that they work closely with the city on some of these higher valued properties for possible redevelopment projects or to offer for potential economic development land deputy treasurer said that they work closely with the department of metropolitan development and the assessor to make sure the valuations are accurate and find the best use for these properties to get them back on the tax rolls she referenced a parcel in pike township a couple of years ago that was offered for a expansion and produced several jobs for the community said that the seems low in todays world she said that the council is not able to change that amount but she asked if the state legislature is being petitioned to change that ms land said that they have approached a representative who is willing to carry that legislation for them however in talking with the association of counties some counties view the amount as high therefore they are proposing that it stay at unless a local legislative body sets another she said that they are also looking at the for abutting properties said that this sounds like a fair compromise as this could definitely vary county to county she wished them luck with this change ms land stated that they appreciate the councils support clerks note hunter and lewis arrived at pm moved seconded by to send proposal proposal no approves the lease of property at east market street to the city market corporation john director of real estate office of finance and management stated that the current lease has expired and they would like to renew it for a term of five years to keep the market as a vital fresh food market downtown chair asked what the term was for the lease that expired said that he is not sure but that lease has been expired for some time chair asked how long the lease has been expired property and risk manager stated that he is not positive but he believes it have expired in chair asked if the lease has really been expired for years said that he will need to research that to make sure said that the taxpayers provide substantial support to the market and before approving this lease he would like for representatives of the market board to appear before the committee to give a presentation on how they are being good stewards of this valuable city asset he said that he also thinks the council staff should review the of the board and provide an assessment as to the financial health of the market including the success rate of collection of lease payments from the tenants moved seconded by lewis to postpone proposal no until the committee meeting said that she is surprised they are rushing this through if they have waited since to renew it she asked why they do not let the new administration coming in review the lease and decide how to proceed she said that she finds it odd they are rushing this through at the last minute said that he checked and the lease was actually extended in and ended in he said that they are just attempting to solidify this lease and correct a wrong chair said that since the market is already in a holdover situation where the terms of the expired lease continue a couple of months should not make much difference brown council chief financial officer said that he believes the market was bequeathed to the city by a will and they need to check to make sure they are not out of compliance with the terms of the will or legally in default said that as he understands it he does not believe they are out of compliance with the will unless they change the use from a public purpose use he said that he believes that was the main requirement he added that this lease definitely needs to be solidified however he sees no harm in postponing the proposal at this stage proposal no was postponed by a vote of chair asked brown to work with and the market director to get the committee the information they need proposal no approves transfers totaling in the budgets of the county auditor voters registration cooperative extension and video services agency office of finance and management and office of corporation counsel county general auditors ineligible deduction and consolidated county general funds to cover costs associated with the th pay and other various project costs city controller stated that this is a cleanup ordinance to cover some budget shortfalls for and is mostly funded by moving some surpluses around he said that funding the th pay is the biggest part of this and they have met with these agencies and departments to find available funds he said that the auditors portion of this proposal will supplement their increase with the ineligible deductions fund to lessen the pressure on the county general fund but the other entities included are simple transfers from one character to another he said that the transfer in is possible due to a delay in filling some positions left open through retirement or replacing those employees with individuals coming in at a lower salary he said that this will help fund additional contractual expenses associated with the promotion process for the metropolitan police department and fire department which was previously handled by another department he said that they will not see any increase in overall appropriations and this will have a net zero impact on the budget asked if there is a reason they have never looked at escrowing this th pay over a period of time in order to spread it across the years when there is no additional pay said that he does not know he said that he was not aware of this issue until last year and it is new to him he said that he thinks it might be beneficial for the future administrations to look at it as some other local entities did plan for it he said that they have also looked at a bimonthly pay instead of every two weeks but could not implement that at this time due to different pay schedules asked how often this th pay occurs said that it happens once every years he said that the situation was further exacerbated due to a new administration coming in and multiple payouts for individuals leaving city moved seconded by to send proposal proposal no authorizes the issuance of a general revenue note in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed for the purpose of providing funds to be applied to pay a portion of the planning costs incurred in connection with a proposed criminal justice center and appropriating the proceeds thereof chief of staff office of the mayor stated that this proposal authorizes the issuance of a note not to exceed five years to pay outstanding bills related to the criminal justice center project he said that they began looking at this project in and throughout the process they have sought advice and solicited work from consultants financial advisors analysts design firms and other vendors there were initially six bidders on the project which were whittled down to three included in this work product is some information that the city can retain from those three bidders and hold onto for future planning and discussion surrounding a criminal justice center he said that a lot of these vendors have been with them from the start and have provided legal financial and technical analysis throughout the entire process he said that that this note would pay those outstanding bills as well as provide stipends for the information they will be able to retain from those bidders he said that this has been a long process and although it did not go the direction they wanted it to they want to make sure the vendors are compensated for their work this is an alternative to pay the vendors that would have been reimbursed by the developer had the project proceeded he said that they do not want to saddle the new administration with a large bill like this and this seems a viable alternative to pay those bills over time and retain that valuable work product information provided a handout attached as exhibit a and said that in addition to approving the issuance of the note not to exceed million to be paid no later than years from the original date of delivery the proposal includes some other provisions it also creates a project cost account to deposit the proceeds and from which they will pay these liabilities and it prohibits this account from being used for any other purpose the proposal also requires that the controller consult with the councils prior to paying specific invoices for project costs he added that any interest earnings and surplus will be used to prepay the note and it allows the note to be payable from any legally available revenues of the city he referred to the list of outstanding liabilities related to the criminal justice facility and said that those items asterisked are items that the councils and general counsel had questions about as their amounts exceed the amounts of the original contracts he said that as the project was extended costs exceeded what was anticipated and some of those contracts were extended he said that there is outstanding and the additional amount from the million note will be used to pay for an audit of these bills as well as the debt service in year one so that the new administration will not have to pay in that year he said that they hope to issue the note in a graduated amount and if the justice center is pursued down the road they could ask for reimbursement from the chosen developer to pay down that note sooner due to the available work product owned by the city as a result of these services he said that it is the goal to get most of these bills paid before the end of the year except for those that are asterisked about which the council staff has questions he said that if they do not pay these outstanding bills these vendors could pursue legal judgment against the city which would end up costing even more chair said that these contracts were entered into outside of state law and therefore are void these vendors should know what the federal state and local laws require with regard to contracts especially the legal firms and therefore understand that they entered into an illegal contract she said that she is not comfortable moving forward and does not believe the contracts met legal requirements and the city cannot be bound to them she said that the mayor acted outside the legal authority of state laws and even when the council finally became aware of these contracts months ago and questioned their legality because they were not supported by appropriations the administration continued to ratchet up these costs asked what five years from the original date of delivery means and if this refers to the delivery of services by these vendors said that this refers to the receipt of the bond proceeds asked if the vendors then will be paid immediately answered in the affirmative said that if the justice center had been approved then the developers would be on the hook for these costs and the city would not have to find a way to pay these vendors she said that she finds it commendable that the administration wants to clean this up before the new administration comes in if the justice center had been approved they would have a new jail and more efficient coordination of criminal justice efforts and the taxpayer would not have had to foot this bill however although she is reluctant to support this because she does not believe the taxpayers should have to pay this she feels it is the right thing to do in the circumstances lewis said that she had intended not to speak to this subject but with comments made she feels it necessary to point out that this million is a lot cheaper than bankrupting the city and is a lot less than a justice center would have cost the taxpayers she said that she does not like it either but feels they are obligated to pay off this debt said that given the already dire financial situation he cannot understand how this happened he said that the administration knew they could not pay these bills and the council was never aware of them because the administration never saw fit to come through the council he said that these vendors should have been more like rolls who came before the council even when the administration told them they did not have to because they knew enough to play by the rules said that she studied the proposed justice center inside and out and there were many untruths spread about that project this situation is like someone hacking her charge card and her having to pay it even though she did not authorize the charges she said that she is mad that the council is left with this decision while the mayor can leave and con everyone into believing that he actually did something worthwhile she said that there have been so many holes in this deal and it has been nothing but a con game and would have caused a tax increase this mayor however did not care because he would not be here when it happened she said that she is ashamed and mad about the whole situation and is also upset that these vendors did not secure legal counsel to make sure they were doing things legally while these companies should have known better she feels sorry for those working for these companies who have not been paid asked general counsel if there are any outstanding legal issues or litigation concerning these contracts said that there is no outstanding litigation mediation or arbitration that he is aware of he said that he does have some concerns about some of the law firm bills which significantly exceed the provisions of the contracts he said that he is sure the contracts allow for some amendments to increase the amounts but going from million to million seems excessive he said that he believes it would be worthwhile to make sure they got the value for what they are paying said that he never sees anything wrong with auditing lawyer bills and therefore would concur on that matter he said that when this went public and the proposal was bid that was not done under a sheet in the dark of night it was a public document while the submissions were a little more guarded to say the council was not aware of some of the provisions in the beginning is a little misleading he said that there was early opposition to the justice center and if they had all come in earlier and worked together as a council they might not be seeing bills this high he said that this also provides that if the incoming administration wants to reconsider this project they can use the work that has been done so far in moving forward the opportunity to take advantage of that allow them to incorporate some of those costs into reimbursements and reduce the liability going forward he said that at this point they need to step back and look at the whole thing to see where they can reduce the liability for taxpayers he said that he is not happy about paying bills like these but if they take the stance that they are not going to pay them that is not right either he is in full support of auditing these bills to make sure they got what they paid for but he thinks it needs to move forward to the full said that she and hunter were on board with this project in its early stages but in the end could not support it due to its cost and size and the fact that it ultimately would not include some critical criminal justice agencies like the public defender and prosecutor she said that she can argue the merits of having a comprehensive criminal justice center but they could never close the gap concerning the project as imagined she said that she did know that some of these bills existed in the beginning such as with rendered project drawings etc said that she would prefer this debt not be on the doorstep of the new administration and if they do not pay these bills these vendors will take them to court she said that they could very well order an audit which is not a bad thing but it will cost more in time and money and kick those costs down to the next administration while this is a hard pill to swallow she understands these bills must be paid or will fall on the next administration the cost could then be if it goes to court and she does not want that for the taxpayers she said that she reluctantly supports this proposal in order to clean this up before the new administration comes in hunter said that he agrees with he said that government is the only entity in that feels they can contract and do things and then get services free on the back end he said that it does not work that way city government entered into these contracts and it is on this fiduciary body to pay these bills he said that he does not want this to turn into a lawsuit that has to deal with he said that they need to pay this and get it out of the way because a delay will just cause even greater debt chair asked to speak to the legality of contracts entered into without an appropriation per state law said that state law is clear and at this point the city has million in bills that are not supported by appropriations he said that while the law is clear there are a number of cases where even though the court held that the contract was void because of no corresponding appropriation some vendors were able to sue for services rendered and won he said that in the end some courts decided that it is not fair to not pay a vendor for a reasonable value of services even if it is less than the amount of the contract said that he supports an audit of the submitted invoices and feels that the audit should be completed before this council approves these payments he said that they owe it to the public to insure they are paying a fair price for the work he said that the administration could have come to the council when the justice center proposal was voted down but instead they wait days out from leaving office and the taxpayers backs are then against the wall he said that these law firms knew what they were doing and this should have been brought to the council before now he said that they owe the taxpayers an audit moved seconded by to postpone proposal no until an audit has been completed asked if this is postponed what will change before the next meeting said that he is not a legal auditor but he assumes they could not look through that many legal bills before the committees next meeting on especially in light of the upcoming holiday this is not a simple undertaking in a short time said that this is the part that bothers her as with the lack of cooperation in receiving the regional operations center information she said that if thinks it is not possible to finish an audit by th then she is not willing to spend even more by further delay she is very upset that the workers have not been paid and that the council did not know of these expenses she said that she disagrees with the comment that the council had an opportunity to change anything up front and she has really wrestled with this decision she does not want to cause the taxpayers to have another bill due to litigation as next years budget will be very tight and this will only cause a delay in critical services she said that she will therefore support sending this to the full council for a vote asked if anyone has reviewed the bills they are talking about said that some of the bills noted in the amount paid column were already paid and that work was reviewed before those bills were paid at one point they held the bills aside until a decision was made because they were originally going to be the chosen bidders responsibility to pay he said that there are some outstanding questions on some of these bills and the proposal clearly states that the controller will work with the councils before making any payments asked if it moves forward if there is any intention to do a supplemental amendment to not pay the proceeds of the note until a review is concluded said that there is language in the proposal regarding consulting with the of the council and they are committed to making sure that the council staff is comfortable with what they are paying making sure it is reflective of the services received he said that there is also funding of included for an audit which will further insure they are paying the right amount said that the reason they are just coming forward with this proposal now is because from on the vote kept being pushed back on the justice center project and it could have been resurrected at the full council at any time they did not finally give up on the project until and because that date kept extending this initiative was delayed chair said that she be cynical but she feels they wanted to get past the election so they would not have to go on record as supporting this the motion to postpone proposal no failed by a vote of with and casting the affirmative votes moved seconded by hunter to send proposal no to the full council with a do pass recommendation the motion carried by a vote of with and casting the negative votes said that if the committee so desires he can contact a legal auditor outside of incurring any actual costs to get a better sense of what an audit would cost and how long it would take the committee agreed that this would be helpful
