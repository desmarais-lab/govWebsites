previously budgeted for due to the engagement of outside legal counsel on behalf of the sheriff the prosecutor and information services agency he said that this additional appropriation will allow them to cover expenses and finish out the year lewis asked if these are costs that have already occurred said they have already signed on with intent for these costs so essentially yes they are costs already incurred said that she understands the unanticipated outside costs for the sheriff is related to the collective bargaining process which seems as though it should be pretty straightforward and included in the budget said that the sheriff did not budget for outside counsel for collective bargaining asked if this will have an impact on the budget that was just passed said that it will not impact the budget but will cover expenses for for these three items said that the county general fund is already very tight and she asked how this will impact the overall budget for the year said that

looks like the balance shown on the proposal is for the enhanced access fund brown council chief financial officer stated that when the office of finance and management prepared the budget this appropriation was anticipated and it was accounted for in the budget projections and fund balances for he said that the fund balance in section is actually for the consolidated county fund which will still be left with a positive balance after this appropriation fanning asked if the reason outside counsel was needed is because they did not have the manpower or because they did not have the expertise or specificity of knowledge said that the collective bargaining process historically has used outside counsel because it is not something that happens every year and they do not keep staff trained for that specific type of legal aid he said that one of these was a very large case that was and involved a lot of electronic discovery and they simply did not have the manpower to go through it all the final case for the prosecutor was under the indemnity ordinance and that is not an area of law where they keep someone with that expertise as the need is so infrequent he said that he would say the reason was due to specificity of knowledge and due to limited manpower general counsel stated that an amendment should be offered to change section of the proposal to indicate the correct fund lewis moved seconded by to amend proposal no to change the fund referenced in section from the enhanced access fund to the consolidated county general fund the motion carried by a vote of lewis moved seconded by to send proposal no
