by adding a new sec regarding the reporting of lost or stolen firearms in room of the building chair lewis called the meeting to order at pm with the following members present and john gray and were absent general counsel and chief financial officer brown represented council staff miller and kip were also in attendance chair lewis asked committee members to introduce themselves and indicate which proposal no reappoints to the alcoholic beverage board of county moved seconded by to postpone proposal no the motion carried by a vote of proposal no amends the council rules to reflect the reduction in the number of from to and makes other technical corrections general counsel stated that since the state statute eliminated the council positions the council rules need to be changed to reflect the reduction in the number of and subsequently the majority percentages throughout the code with regard to votes he said that he also made some technical changes in the ethics portion due to some other conflicts with new laws and laws that should have already sunset moved seconded by to send proposal no proposal no amends the code to delete obsolete references to township assessors and to renumber chapter regarding employment of to chapter said that this is a cleanup ordinance to change all references to township assessors which no longer exist to county assessor only it also renumbers the current chapter regarding employment of to chapter which was the old wastewater pretreatment ordinance that was repealed with the sale of the water company to citizens moved seconded by to send proposal no proposal no amends the code regarding parking meter funds usage to align with state law miller said that some discomfort was discussed with this proposal at the last meeting regarding an unintended effect on the local parking ordinance while they cannot loosen the regulations beyond the state statute they are given the authority to tighten them he said that if it makes committee members feel more comfortable they could remove item number four altogether from the ordinance and renumber the rest he said however that he does not believe they should do nothing because these parking funds are being used right now in ways that are not permitted by state statute lewis asked what the proposal actually does miller said that this proposal inserts the state law reference which the local ordinance should mirror and clarifies that these funds really need to be used in places already designated for parking instead of making it sound like they could be used for infrastructure anywhere asked if they pass this proposal what recourse the city would have if someone tries to break this state or local law said that it depends on how blatant the violation is the council could the project or entire fund or they could file suit to get the money back said that he is proud to have worked with miller on this cleanup after some things went through this fund this year that should not have he said that this language makes it clear and keeps the city from facing other such hurdles moved seconded by to send proposal no miller said that the original parking fund ordinance was set up so that presentations would be made to the council regarding the uses for these funds he said that they have a right to ask for this information noted that the correct recommendation should probably be do pass as amended as this proposal was previously amended in committee consent was given to amend the motion and proposal no was sent to the full council with a do pass as amended recommendation proposal no adds a new sec to the code regarding real property leases to improve the planning reporting analysis and negotiation of real property leasing by departments agencies and offices of the city and county said that this proposal was initiated because of the regional operations center investigation last summer an amendment was proposed had some discussion but was never voted on he explained the edited amendment attached as exhibit a to consider this evening and said that of real estate helped to draft section a of this amendment and has updated it to include sections and section a only dealt with the leasing of real property by the city while section adds the same regulations for the disposal of real property and the same for the purchasing of real property this covers all the bases for other similar transactions besides just those defined as a lease section defines leases in a broader manner there was a concern that some agencies might try to get around the lease requirements by calling the arrangement something else such as a service agreement or license agreement said that he circulated this edited amendment to committee members as well as to the sponsors hunter and will today and there did not seem to be any issues he said that he also provided the administration with a copy of the amendment and the new director of real estate john called this afternoon and said that the administration is in agreement with sections a and but has concerns about how and might affect the department of metropolitan development and their economic development efforts indicated that the existing state laws already address these other areas and the administration would like more time to consider any possible implications from adding and lewis asked if the sponsors are okay with the amendment said that they indicated to him that they are he said that he traded voice mail messages with hunter but also received an email from him asking to make the presentation at tonights meeting and said he was good with the changes said that he did see that email thread said that he would like to hear from the administration regarding their concerns asked if hunter was aware of the administrations concerns said that he does not know he said that he sent the amendment to the administration yesterday and to hunter this morning the administration did not contact him with their concerns until after his discussions with hunter said that in section a item the language refers to written confirmation but in sections and this same language is shown as written information he asked if this needs to be changed said that it does need to be changed to confirmation in all three references and he is fine with that technical friendly amendment referred to section ii and said that this seems like semantics referring to real property not owned by the city or county she asked if someone is in the process of purchasing they could say they do not own it said that owning it means they have the title asked if the agency would have the title if they are in the process of leasing to own said that this would be considered a lease because they are occupying property that the city does not yet own he said that this language is to avoid anyone circumventing by taking out a lease and calling it something else john director of real estate office of finance and management said that the administration is in agreement with section a but has not had sufficient time to review and and the implications these sections might have on economic development efforts he added that the new administration also want to look at these as they will be the ones who will be administering the regulations and affected by any such implications he asked that the committee consider postponing action on the proposal until these items can be reviewed lewis said that this is the last meeting of the year and she asked if they can go ahead and pass the proposal out of committee and then use the time between now and the final council meeting on to decide if further amendments need to be offered chief of staff office of the mayor said that they would be open to that he said that they would like to the impact of and on economic development efforts and they could work with the sponsors and to figure out if further amendments are needed they would also use this time to share the information with the incoming administration said that it is very important to share this information with administration as they will be the ones implementing these requirements he said that economic development is a unique creature and might have different concerns than the council would have as the council is more concerned with fiscal stability while might be willing to give a little to get more in return down the road lewis said that she would be comfortable passing this with the understanding that there might be some other amendments needed after discussions take place moved seconded by to amend proposal no as per exhibit a the motion carried by a vote of moved seconded by to send proposal no proposal no amends the revised code by adding a new article ii to chapter lobbyists establishing the county lobby registration reviewed the changes being proposed to the code regarding lobbyists contained in this proposal he said that the new commission would mirror the states lobbying commission this oversight currently sits within the mayors office but this will allow both the council and the mayor to have some oversight by having appointees to this commission he said that after a quick conversation with he did agree if the committee so wishes to give the mayor three appointments to this commission instead of two he said that in his experience as a lobbyist in the city over the last year this position of oversight is basically unmanned lobbyists do not receive any returned emails or phone calls and this really needs to be handled more professionally like at the state level which has a staff overseeing and administering the program he said that a mailing that went out during the election campaign process this proposal as an effort to benefit his personal lobbying efforts and those of his law firm but in reality it does the opposite and gives more oversight and transparency to the said that he previously raised a concern about the cost of this action and asked if has any more information on that said that he asked to provide input on that and he has not received anything he said that there could be an increase in cost but he does not think it would be huge and thinks it is is worth it to insure greater transparency said that he would feel more comfortable if he knew the cost he said that when this lobbying legislation was originally initiated he served on the committee that approved it and a lot of time and discussion went into it he asked why they are removing item four under lobbying activity as it is pretty obvious when paid advertising is taking place said that they are not necessarily always aware who is paying for the advertising deleting it means that there will have to be an accounting this does not happen much at the city level but any money spent on advertising that is encouraging the council to pass an ordinance would have to be reported to the commission asked if a member of the council wanted to speak to another member of the council to encourage them to vote for a piece of legislation if this would be excluded said that conversations between is not addressed at all there is nothing in this proposal interpreted to say that a must register as a lobbyist to discuss legislation with another lewis asked why they would want to eliminate the paid advertising said that they are taking out the language that makes it an exception as it now is considered something that does not have to be reported his feeling is that it should be reported and that is what striking that language accomplishes asked if the administration has any idea of the fiscal impact said that he has been communicating with on this and the administration is not really against the changes contemplated with regard to cost the executive director could be someone who is already employed by the city which would mean no real additional cost but if it is a new hire there would be additional costs associated with that position which is not already budgeted he said that sec also refers to the commission making reasonable expenditures and if they consider additional staff is needed he is not sure what those expenditures would be there is a possible cost but he cannot comment with any certainty until he knows what it will all look like a rough estimate could be anywhere from a to salary with benefits and if additional support staff is needed that number could be much higher he said that he cannot comment as to the authors intent of what expenditures should be said that this seems rather and is a little scary said that it would be the commissions responsibility to mitigate that cost listening to the mayor and the council as their appointing authorities he said that he believes this is important enough to have one full time equivalent position in the city available to administer lobbying laws this is not occurring today and no one is watching the lobbyists on a local basis or providing oversight today which believes is necessary asked what the consequence has been in not having that extra layer of government for oversight said that the law is in place but there is no oversight and the city is not getting what they originally asked for when they passed this ordinance this does not create another layer of government but creates accountability said that they are already required to fill out forms and this seems like an extra layer of government being added said that he is just attempting to button down some things for greater transparency on what is being done he said that they are putting teeth in the ordinance by having an independent commission which will insure that individuals cannot ignore what the council has passed referred to sec a where sec is cited for exemptions he asked for an example of the type of exemptions covered here said that this language is in the original ordinance and is not being changed said that this is part of the ethics code and he does not know what those specific exemptions are off the top of his head said that many of those exemptions are some of the same items for campaign finance forms referred to taking the face value down to from and asked if this is commiserate with the amount on the conflict of interest forms said that this relates to the executive branch and does not affect what do said that seems very low as one cannot even get a cup of coffee in many places for less than said that many states have that number at zero and he feels it is important for sake to know what lobbyists are doing asked if it would then be better to remove it and just say any amount spent said that he made it because buying someone a cup of coffee seems uneventful lewis asked if a lobbyist bought her a cup of coffee they would have to report it but she would not have to stated that this is asked if she met with a lobbyist but they went dutch treat if it would not have to be reported said that they would not have to report the coffee but for lobbyists time is also a reportable activity and law firms record how much that time is worth and that would definitely be an expense to report said that she is in support of this for sake and ethical standards and asked about receiving tickets for sporting or other events like sometimes receive lewis said that sometimes get tickets because of volunteer activity or because of their service on a board or commission and this is not really about lobbying said that this is for lobbyists and has no impact on the ethics rules for or other officials he said that if the president of the capital improvement board gave someone a ticket he is not a lobbyist and would not be registered as such lewis asked if this proposal has been discussed with and the transition team she said that if there is a possible cost associated with this then they owe the transition team the courtesy to discuss the impact this might have on their budget she said that she understands an agreement has been made between the outgoing administration and the incoming administration that any decisions made these final months with a fiscal impact be halted until the new administration takes office or the initiative she said that this is a good thing for sake but she is concerned that there be no fiscal ramifications for the incoming administration said that he is supportive of this regulation of lobbyists and wants to make it clear this does not affect the ethics rules already in place for he is also concerned about the cost but this body will have to appropriate any costs so they have some authority to regulate those however he does agree that this should be shared with the transition team so that the new administration can weigh in on the matter said that he would be glad to talk with the transition team and make sure they are comfortable with it he said that if it passes out of committee he will contact them and if they are not comfortable they could stop action at the full council said that he would prefer they communicate with the transition team first and then the council could call it up out of committee to be heard on the full council floor if they were okay with it moved seconded by to table proposal no to then possibly be brought off the table with a majority vote at the council meeting if conversations warrant lewis asked if it would take votes to pull the proposal off the table for a vote said that it would only take said that his preference would be to pass the proposal out of committee and then if the transition team has issues with it it could be stricken at council he said that it would be harder to pull it off the table than to act on it with a committee recommendation asked if is making the commitment that if the transition team has issues with it he will move to return it to committee thereby effectively killing the proposal answered in the affirmative said that she would agree with this course of action because if the transition team was not in favor of it she is fairly certain the council would not pass it putting it on the agenda for action though makes them look like they are trying to achieve transparency said that he will then withdraw his motion to table the proposal with the caveat that he still has concerns about the fiscal impact and the support of the new administration he said that if an amendment is needed on the council floor he would suggest including a ceiling for costs so that there are no blank checks written asked if they could address the possible amendment for the makeup of the commission as agreed to by the sponsor to make the appointments by both the mayor and the council the same he added that another amendment he would suggest is moving this section under boards and commissions as it currently sits in the section of the code governed by the department of code enforcement with a commission overseeing the process it would make more sense for it to be in the boards and commission section of the code said that it would be easy to change the membership in section sec from two appointees by the mayor to three appointees and changing the full membership to six members asked if they really want an equal number stated that he is okay with that stated that the president of the council sits as an member of each committee and asked if that would be the case here said that it would not said that the number of members of the same political affiliation should probably also be changed to four moved seconded by to amend section sec of proposal no as follows sec membership the commission consists of five six members the council shall appoint three members and the mayor shall appoint two three members a lobbyist not be appointed as a member of the commission not more than three four of the five six members hold the same political affiliation the motion carried by a vote of stated that the other suggested amendment to move the proposal in the code will take more work but could be offered on the council floor moved seconded by to send proposal no proposal no amends the code by adding a new sec regarding the reporting of lost or stolen firearms said that this proposal already passed out of committee but he realized he did not have the votes on the council floor to pass it out so returned it to committee for more discussion he said that he would like to take another pass at getting it said that she spoke to her husband about the proposal who is an avid hunter along with several of his friends and she asked if this prohibits individuals from selling or trading guns back and forth amongst each other said that they are or gifting and therefore the weapon would not be categorized as lost or stolen said that this kind of reporting is in direct violation of state law which says that the government cannot regulate ownership possession or registration of firearms he said that if passed this could not be legal and binding and this is the reason did not have the votes in council he urged his colleagues to oppose the proposal said that this legality issue has already been discussed and he would respectfully disagree with he said that notifying the police department that a weapon has been lost or stolen is not a registration in any way and does not violate state law because if it is lost or stolen the individual no longer owns it he said that this is a way to help law enforcement track illegal weapons and with shootings this year this is a tiny step forward in this major problem said that he understands intent and respects his feelings but he views this as a matter of personal rights cars are also stolen all the time and people are subsequently killed in cars every day he said that if he owns a gun it is his property and if it is lost or stolen it is his prerogative to report it or not the government does not need to dictate to him what to do with regard to his own said that this puts an undue burden on legal responsible gun owners because illegal gun owners are not going to report any weapons as lost or stolen anyway therefore it will not solve the problem of criminal shootings asked about the legalities said that the statute says the government not regulate ownership possession or registration the legal question is whether or not they can regulate the absence of ownership or possession said that the last poll shows that upwards of of individuals would like to see this as a part of the law and think that the police should know about lost or stolen firearms said that good responsible gun owners insure their guns which means they are registered and they call the insurance company and the police when those firearms are lost or stolen said that there is no requirement that a gun owner register their weapon with an insurance company just because an owner chooses not to do so does not make them irresponsible said that she would argue that most responsible owners do insure their guns and report them as stolen or lost office of counsel said that the state statute says that local government cannot regulate the ownership or possession of a handgun regulation is defined as the process of controlling by rule or restriction and this proposal would put an obligation on the owner by restricting their ability to own or possess a handgun by putting another rule on them as such this regulation is prohibited by state statute this law was passed in and at that time they stated that any law that was on the books of local government prior to that which was enforced would create a civil liability for that local government any post ordinance by the mere enactment would cause civil liabilities for local government as well anyone who is a legal resident of the united states can legally possess a firearm in the state of and any gun owner from another state who came to would have the ability to sue the city of the statute also allows for trouble damages of attorney fees and court costs which means that the potential liability if this passes would be a huge risk for the city lewis asked if this proposal is subject to the mayors veto responded in the affirmative asked about the cost of potential lawsuits and settlements said that at the recent national rifle association convention there were handgun owners in the city every single one of them could file suit against the city if this is passed each plaintiff would be eligible to gain three times their attorney fees as well as court costs and this could potentially bankrupt the city moved seconded by to send proposal no vote of with and casting the negative votes i respectfully move to amend section of proposal no as introduced by deleting the language that is and adding the language that is underlined to read as follows
