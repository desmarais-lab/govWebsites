represented council staff chairman asked committee members to introduce themselves and indicate which portion of the county they represent proposal no reappoints ping to the alcoholic beverage board of county chairman stated that ms ping is unable to attend this evening and as this is a reappointment he is comfortable sending this to the full council he added that this is ms pings third term she has served the council well and she has only missed one sanders said that her remarks are really directed toward all the members of this particular board and unfortunately since the council only has one appointment to the board she has to voice her comments in relation to this proposal she said that at a recent meeting there were some remarks made by board members to citizens who tried to give pubic testimony while it was not just ms ping she feels that when neighbors come to these meetings they should be given respect and for board members to act like they do not have to listen to these individuals it causes her concern she said that for this reason she will not be supporting the reappointment chairman said that ms ping is not the chair of this board and it seems that allowing public testimony is really a call for the chair sanders said that a suggestion was made by the chair and all members agreed with it and this is not what the council appointments are supposed to be about said that she had some concerns after ms ping was initially appointed when she found that she served as the vice chair of the republican county party she said that she feels this politicizes the appointment she said that she is simply trying to be consistent as during mayor administration the democrat party chairman was an appointee on the metropolitan development commission and she worked at that time to get him off that commission to avoid politicizing these types of appointments she said that she will not be supporting the reappointment for this reason asked if there is any reason the proposal cannot be postponed so that ms ping can appear chairman said that the next meeting of the alcoholic beverage board is scheduled for and this committee does not meet again until he added that ms pings term expires on asked if she continues to serve until a successor is appointed chairman said that he believes so but he likes to reappoint members before their term expiration so that no questions or issues arise moved seconded by to send proposal no to the full council with a do pass recommendation meridian neighbors helping neighbors stated that this is a paid appointment and although the compensation is not significant these board members have the obligation to listen to the neighbors who have prepared input regarding such important policy decisions for their community he said that ms ping acts very disinterested in what the public has to say and is shuffling papers and causing distractions he asked committee members to go to the video of these hearings to see for themselves he added that more important than the issues regarding ms pings demeanor is her conflict of interest he said that the newly formed public affairs group represents commercial interests and being a principal in ping government strategies the level of lobbying and ms ping is involved in is rife with problematic ethical concerns he said that regarding the recent application for alcohol sales ms ping did not recuse herself even though the law firm represents he said that he is not alleging a violation of ethical standards as this have happened prior to the merger negotiations but ms pings demeanor issues are very important said that board members need to listen to citizens who prepare supported cases or the purpose of the community giving input is pointless he said that such a demeanor has a negative effect on democracy he urged the committee to table the proposal and look at the video tape of the meeting he added that ms pings husband also was reappointed to the metropolitan development commission on which he serves as chair and this is a lot of political power for one household and should be spread out he stated that ms ping also rudely interrupted him during his presentation at the board meeting angrily yelling do not assume chairman asked which meeting is referring to said that he is referring to the meeting where only one case was heard said that it is unfortunate when appointments get politicized and this has always prompted a lively debate within the council and he expects it will again with this appointment he added however that he sees no reason why this appointment should be held up said that he will leave a copy of his prepared notes with committee members for review attached as exhibit a gray asked if ms ping has had a change of employment as the board information form provided in the packet indicates another employer chairman said that this merger was recently announced and this form not have been updated since then sanders said that she believes this form was probably from ms pings initial appointment in agreed and said that maybe the office should ask for updated information from since this information is and indicates ms ping was referred by plowman who no longer serves gray stated that he has heard nothing but good things about ms ping and her performance on this board in the past but he was not aware of her political affiliation before he said that there was a lot of criticism about politicizing appointments under mayor administration and therefore he does not see how anyone can support doing the same at this time he said that he will oppose the proposal said that he had not heard anything regarding this recent meeting or the board members behavior he said that he has known ms ping for four or five years and knows her to be a hardworking decent honest individual which is exactly the type of person needed on this board he said that he is not sure why brought up ms pings on the application as she actually voted against that application he said that if ms ping was distracted at the last meeting he does not feel one mistake on an otherwise impeccable record of service is enough to pull someone from a board where they have served so well for many years chairman stated that he watched some of those hearings and he found ms ping to be very and she did indeed vote against the application citizen stated that this is a crucial time for alcoholic beverage sales as there will be a fight at the general assembly this year to allow sales he said that anyone serving in a capacity with influence in this area or anyone with ties should be questioned he added that he thinks ms ping should appear before the committee to answer questions so that her responses are a matter of public record he said she should also be respectful enough to reapply for her position and answer questions he said that it is dangerous to dismiss these issues without having the person come and respond to them the motion to send proposal no to the full council with a do pass recommendation carried by a vote of with gray and sanders proposal no approves the mayors appointment of as the deputy mayor for

challenges citizens to get involved in their own destiny he said that the administration is trying to address the needs and concerns of citizens in order to improve the quality of life he said he is here to serve the community but also goes the extra mile personally to address these issues he said that they have worked with the population as never before and are getting information out to people to assist in this effort he said that these individuals need to learn that owes them anything but he thinks it is important that they are informed about programs like mental health and transition to jobs in order to reduce recidivism he said that crime prevention grants have also been successful with providers helping youth involved with gang violence he said that there has been a reduction in crime because communities are getting involved he added that crime prevention funding and engaging the faith community from all traditions etc has aided in that effort he said that the city has limited resources but all of these organizations have been willing to put their resources on the table to help people and elected leaders have been willing to put those resources to work for the city he said that there is still a long way to go but he feels good about the direction going forward sanders asked if before meeting could provide the committee with statistics from the program such as number of hirings and where in the city the hirings are taking place said that they do not necessarily want that information to get out so that some of these companies hiring are flooded with individuals so they need to protect some of that information sanders said that as an elected official she feels they are entitled to that information said that he will provide sanders with that information via email but cautioned that it should not get out for public consumption concerned clergy stated that he agrees with this reappointment and is a universal person and would be a faithful servant in any administration reverend cl day president of the concerned clergy said that he is proud to support he added that has been effective in his position has positively impacted the reentry program and works with youth returning to the community to help them find work said that has helped bring communities together into one big community and it would be a loss not to have him in this position working for especially moved seconded by sanders and to send proposal no to the full council with a do pass recommendation the proposal no amends the code requiring the purchasing division to

sanders casting the negative vote moved seconded by to send proposal no to the full council with a do pass as amended recommendation sanders said that she has questions about the motivation behind this proposal she said that while she realizes some of the public safety and criminal justice committee agendas have been quite lengthy she is concerned that splitting them out will have an impact on the way both operate she said that communication issues already exist today between these agencies and she is afraid this will only exacerbate the situation said that she supported and was in favor of eliminating the community affairs committee as it seems like the council has too many committees as it is she said that when she came on the council there was no economic development committee and she understood at the time that it was created so that a particular individual could have more camera time as chair which should not have been done she said that she also believes ethics committee items could be handled by the rules and public policy committee she added that she appreciates that the public safety and criminal justice committee is responsible for a large part of the budget but she has concerns about watering down future agendas such as has happened with some of the other committees she said that instead of splitting out a committee she would rather see some more consolidation such as economic development with metropolitan development and ethics with rules said that proposals for committee consolidation seem constructive and he agrees there might be some potential for miscommunication between the agencies he added however that the agencies communication problems exist on a much bigger scope and the increased oversight by splitting up the responsibilities might actually aid in this effort he said that splitting the agencies up would allow members to pay more attention to each entity with better checks and balances from the executive branch sanders said that she understands the concept but in looking at what is before the committee for action members do not know the impact this change will have she said that they do not even have the assignment of agencies between the two committees in front of them as is detailed for the other standing committees she said that the information received is insufficient to vet this kind of change and she sees no reason to rush this chairman said that they do not have a list of agencies assigned for each standing committee sanders said that the agencies assigned to each committee are identified in the code general counsel stated that this information is not included in the code and the assignment of proposals to standing committees is the responsibility of the president of the council he said that while there be some outdated list somewhere the only statutory provision is that the council have a committee for each department of the city but there are no other code requirements chairman said that he did look at the ordinance language and realized that the only detail given on standing committees in the code is simply a listing of the committee names gray moved seconded by sanders to postpone proposal no until the motion failed by a vote of with and casting the negative votes the previous motion to send proposal no to the full council with a do pass as amended recommendation carried by a
