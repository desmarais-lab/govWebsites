asked to serve on the in addition they have also reached out and pulled in more people for a advisory council lewis said that the has a multitude of projects that are currently underway he said that the utility coordination project includes citizens energy water power and light company and all working together to examine utility planning and design coordination processes with the hope that it would minimize project change order reworks and asset damage he said that they are in the midst of this chairwoman said that she would like to have someone from the come and give updates lewis said that he will look forward to doing so asked what the process is in deciding which projects to take on lewis said that first a liaison of local government establishes a relationship with the people in that department to bring them around the table to brainstorm over the issues and challenges that they are dealing with on a basis he said that another source of information has been issues that are top priority in the mac lewis said that once this issue or challenge is identified the team begins to work by applying the methods of asked if all the schools within county were contacted in regards

the superintendent of the township school corporations who acted as the for the rest of the superintendents to participate on the will mayors office said that the spirit of and civic involvement that

the folks that are volunteering their time do not view themselves as being associated with one party or the other they view themselves as independent but if they had to pick a party they would pick one he said that he does not think that a political preference should be criteria he said that the candidates should be able to bring their expertise to the table for everyone to benefit he said that it is the responsibility to ensure that a political agenda is not present in the said that the language in section that reads no more than six of whom shall be of the same political party should be stricken from this ordinance said that it has not been the topic of conversation but it only gives notice to the public of how bipartisan the should be lewis said that the residency issue is a bigger issue that the political party issue sanders said that the whole idea is to make sure the there is no political agenda and to display a bipartisan team to the public chairwoman said that striking this language would broaden the possibility that there will be people from additional parties other than the two major parties moved seconded by to amend proposal no to strike the language in section as stated by the motion carried by a vote of with and sanders casting the negative votes said that he wants to thank all the volunteers that participate in helping local government with creating a better process moved seconded by day to send proposal no to the full council with a do pass as amended recommendation the motion carried by a vote of with sanders casting the negative vote proposal no amends the employee residence requirements related to employment of persons possessing specialized skills and training for which there are no qualified or employable applicants who are also county residents stated that the council passed an ordinance on to require that anyone employed by the city or county must reside in the county or move into the county within six months of employment unless they have special skills that cannot be found within the county he said that with the growth of the county and its diversity of population he has a hard time believing there are many positions where they cannot find a qualified resident who resides within the county to fill the position he said that currently county government employs people who do not live within county this number does not include police and fire sworn officers who are on the city side of government and are exempt under the state statute these positions are in addition to those sworn officer positions filled by county residents he said that he cannot see how of all county employees would fit into the exception to the rule where no qualified individuals can be found for those positions within the county he said that instead of it being the exception to the rule it seems as though hiring outside of the county is becoming the norm he said that this requirement was passed years ago with the support of two of the longest standing members of the council and both voting in favor of the action proving that it should be a bipartisan objective he said that in the last few years this council has made some difficult decisions including raising the county option income tax to help fund public safety one of the largest areas where residents are being hired is the public safety environment he said that those tax dollars should be kept in the county he said that this requirement is plainly listed on applications yet is often ignored he said that hiring outside of the county takes place within city government too but it is not as large a percentage he said that the residency requirement is listed in the hiring manuals of both the city and county and is very clear he said that if the argument is that those jobs require special skills that cannot be found in the county then he would have to point out that there are different job descriptions and titles being filled by residents and many of those jobs do not require any specialized or rare skills as some of them are data entry positions with the county unemployment rate as high as it is it makes it hard for him to explain to residents that there are no government jobs available because they are being filled by individuals who live outside of the county he said that this trend is depriving families within county of possible employment insurance and benefits he said that he would be open to postponing the issue to garner more discussion but he wants to bring this issue to the forefront to make the council aware of how the regulations are being ignored day asked if it is intent that current employees must move inside of county or find themselves without a job said that he does not think it is fair to take away peoples jobs at this time but going forward he would like to see this ordinance strictly enforced so that this practice does not continue stated that in light of that intent section should probably be amended from that date to the new effective date agreed and said that it is not his intent to vote on this proposal this evening but to start discussion about an issue which he feels is very important asked if it is intent then to grandfather in anyone with an existing job responded in the affirmative and said that he would be in favor of that amendment he said that it is not his intent to disrupt anyones employment but simply to protect members of this community who are struggling right now asked how the ordinance would be enforced she asked if employees would be asked to take an annual oath declaring that they continue to live within county said that it would be enforced as the ordinance calls for currently which requires that a new hire move into the county within six months of their employment he said that he knows there will still be people who try to go around the system and the city does not have the manpower or finances available to discover all such circumvention he said that he is open to suggestions on this matter as well asked if currently works for the human resources division responded in the affirmative referred to section and asked why is requesting that any hiring of people with specialized skills be reviewed by the council instead of human resources said that the current process is not being adhered to and therefore he feels something more needs to be done he said that he is not set on the council being the body that reviews the hiring but he is set on making sure that hiring practices comply with the residency requirements asked since is an employee of human resources why the requirements are not being enforced said that most of the exceptions are being allowed by county elected officials asked if these officials the human resources division said that some have their own human resources or they make use of waivers to override that requirement asked in estimation what percentage of these positions would actually qualify for the specialized skills exemption stated that at most probably of these employees would qualify asked what process human resources should use to determine what is and what is not a specialized skill said that personally he is not convinced there are any that qualify considering the size and diversity of this population being the th largest city in the united states he said that he would like to see proof that the position was advertised and applicants were sought within the county before resorting to hiring individuals outside the county asked if considers a professional degree such as in law or accounting to be a specialized skill responded in the negative and said that there are many lawyers and accountants within the city with much experience who could easily fill these positions asked about a practicing medical doctor said that if the position was for someone with some special expertise and they have had trouble finding a qualified applicant after an exhaustive search it might then be considered a specialized skill he said that most average positions within the city and county would not fall under the special skills exemption in his opinion asked if feels that human resources or elected officials do not have the capacity to determine whether or not a position requires a specialized skill and that is why he is suggesting that the council oversee it said that it is currently not being enforced and therefore he feels more oversight is needed he said that many of these positions such as data entry clerk surveyor helpers paralegals technical supervisors deputy coroners and victims assistance are grade i positions and do not require specialized or uncommon skills asked if the council can just point out to human resources and the elected officials that their enforcement of the residency requirement is lackluster and does not meet ordinance standards instead of removing that authority from them to make those kinds of decisions he said that this seems to put the council in the position of micromanaging the employment process said that ultimately it falls to the council to determine that tax money is spent wisely since they are responsible for passing the budget said that the council does not tell a police officer how to enforce the law even though they fund their salary said that this is not what he is intending day asked if the county officials go through human resources to hire employees said that they do day asked why the enforcement cannot then be handled by human resources said that human resources can make recommendations but they do not have the authority to tell an elected official who they can or cannot hire day asked if they can write language into the proposal and pass it that gives human resources the authority and makes them responsible for making sure the residency requirement is enforced city controller said that there is a waiver process in the ordinance and department heads or elected officials can submit a waiver to human resources to waive that residency requirement on the city side the mayor has said that there will be no waivers and therefore on the city side this is not occurring on the county side however there is a varying degree of adherence to the residency requirement human resources does not have the authority to deny a waiver presented by an elected official day asked if the waiver accompanies the application responded in the affirmative he said that he agrees with regarding who should be given that authority but at this time human resources does not have the authority to step in and say to an elected official that the policy does not allow such a hiring practice he said that as oversight for human resources he would be happy to have that responsibility of enforcing the requirement if authority were given to human resources to do so so that the council would not have to micromanage that process stated that he is not adamant about the council having the responsibility but is adamant that the practice needs to stop day asked who is responsible for designing a list that indicates which positions constitute a special skill said that this is why he suggested the council be responsible because then there could be a discussion on what constitutes a special skill his main objective however is to make sure that the requirement that is already in the ordinance be enforced chairwoman said that have a lot of skills but she does not know anyone on the council who has special human resources skills other than and therefore it gives her pause to think that the council would be responsible for those types of decisions said that it seems with some of those job descriptions noted it could be indicated within the job description itself that this position does not require any specialized skills and therefore no waiver will be granted she said that she would suggest they strike all the language pertaining to a waiver altogether chairwoman said that she thinks that is the reason they are having this discussion this evening is to ensure that they have the right solution in place before moving forward said that human resources is the most capable in her opinion of making the assessment regarding skill levels or special training that would necessitate them looking outside of the county said that he is curious to see whether human resources take into account prior work experience he said that having a law degree does not necessarily mean that a person is qualified for a legal position he said if there is an individual with a law degree with years of experience in zoning matters for the city of and they move into and are seeking a position with the county they should be considered as a highly skilled individual for a zoning prosecutor position he said that the question then becomes whether the city suffers because of the residency requirement because they cannot take advantage of this individuals expertise said that the job description should be written requiring years of experience prosecuting zoning matters and then this would be such a rare circumstance that an exception would be appropriate he added however that the average attorney position with one or two years of experience could easily be covered by many qualified attorneys living within the county said that he is not saying that the job description be changed to require years of experience however if the county advertises a city prosecutor position and a recently graduated law student who just passed the bar applies along with an individual with advanced skills and experience who happens to live on the other side of raceway road the city would suffer and end up paying more by the inefficiency cost of educating and training while not gaining any institutional knowledge in the process he asked if experience level should be considered when determining specialized skills said that he believes experience level should be included when considering specialized skills chairwoman said that the discussion is bringing out a lot of gray areas and she would like to make sure the agency heads have been contacted and had a chance to weigh in on this matter before moving forward county assessor said that as a county official sometimes they receive applicants for positions that are the most qualified and are aware of the residency requirement the position does not require any specialized skills and therefore they do not see the need to use the waiver but then there have been some over the last couple of years who were not able to make that residency requirement happen and his office had to let those people go said that there are a lot of issues with this residency requirement one being that state law has made it impossible for the city and county to apply these same requirements to police and fire protection positions she said that if the city is really interested in community policing it would probably be better that those employees also come from this community she said that the immediate issue seems to be that human resources has no authority to enforce this requirement and while she has no desire to take on this responsibility and micromanage the hiring process as a council body there needs to be some effort made to ensure that the requirement is being enforced moved to postpone proposal no to allow more time to work with and others to find a workable solution to this issue she said that she is not sure postponing to the next meeting would be sufficient time and therefore moved seconded by day to postpone the proposal until the commercial office space at avenue for use by the county assessor said that their driving goal behind this action is for them to find the best way to get to good assessment practices at the lowest cost to the taxpayers he said that since election day in they have been very busy trying to restructure the whole process they have looked at how they decide who is going to do what service and where they are going to be housed he said that they want to have most of the employees in a central office and have a presence in the community so that people will not have to drive into downtown to get an assessment question answered this will also make it easier for the assessors to get to the properties said that they have been trying to negotiate good office space at a competitive cost he said that the location listed in the ordinance is centrally located and easily accessible said that the biggest comparison between the current lease and the proposed lease is the cost the existing lease is each year and the proposed lease will be each year he said that the problem is that there is still a legal obligation to cover months on the current least chairwoman said that this proposal is not clear at this time said that if the council were to vote yes to this ordinance the county assessor is not obligated to follow through and execute the new lease the council just gives permission to the county assessor to look for a place outside of the existing lease asked if this proposal stated that the county assessor must relocate at this specific address said that the statute only states that the council has to approve the need to find space but does not give authority of the council to find space he said that it has been a long practice of this council to approve the leasing decision because of the other ramifications that will follow such as appropriations to pay the rent and the bills for the space he said that this ordinance states that the property to be leased is the commercial office space at avenue said that there is a tough decision to be made and there is also an opportunity to save they are not sure how to negotiate this lease because they can not define an end date he said that if they pay for months of the current lease there will still be a savings generated chairwoman asked if and will be willing to work together to come up with the best solution for this ordinance answered in the affirmative day asked if the assessor still has a month lease obligation if they have to honor that lease agreement until the end of the lease said that at some point the new lease is cheaper than staying in the existing lease for the rest of the period he said that even though there is a month period left on the lease state law requires the landlord to make an effort to find a new tenant if the current tenant leaves chairwoman said that it if also possible for the current landlord to renegotiate the current contract asked if the council would be precluded in drafting the ordinance that is based on a condition of a showing of savings said answered in the negative asked if structuring the ordinance will allow the county assessor to pursue the current lease option and seek some greater savings said that he does not mind having a limitation that says they should not break the lease until there is a certain kind of benefit he said the problem is how to reach that benefit chairwoman said that she does not see a resolution tonight on this proposal said that this ordinance merit the skill of a licensed real estate broker said that the approval process is the thing that slows down the process moved seconded by day to postpone proposal no
