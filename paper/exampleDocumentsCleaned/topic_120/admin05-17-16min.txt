proposal no amends chapter of the code regarding compensation to add article regarding travel expenses information services agency information services fund into character to pay for higher than anticipated wiring costs associated with network upgrades funded by projected cost savings from character proposal no requires audits of the results of the implementation of proposal no general ordinance no do pass failed chair called the meeting to order at pm with the following members present colleen fanning la lewis ray and jack general counsel and chief financial officer brown represented council staff chair asked committee members to introduce themselves and indicate which proposal no amends chapter of the code regarding compensation to add article regarding travel expenses deputy controller office of finance and management said that at the last meeting they reviewed this proposal and an amendment was requested so the proposal was postponed until this meeting he said that there was a question about removing language to exclude elected officials he said that an amendment has therefore been prepared lewis moved seconded by to amend proposal no in sec definitions to amend the definition for traveler to read as traveler means a person whether an employee of the consolidated city of county or of county an elected official or member of any council commission or board thereof who is in travel status a employee commission or board member a person under contract with the and all others previously approved who is in travel status asked why they are deleting this language and if there is a separate travel policy for elected officials he asked if the council does not set the policy how it gets set for elected officials he said that they appropriate money in these budgets for travel and therefore need to make sure travel policies are adhered to general counsel said that it is a question of the separation of powers he said that he does not know if there is a written travel policy for the council right now but the thought behind this amendment is that it should be the council deciding their own travel policy not the city controller he said that elected officials includes judges and other constitutional office holders he said that they are not saying there is anything wrong with the substance of this policy but it is a question of who gets to determine that policy just as congress approves their own governing policies said that he understands the point but in the corporate community if a corporation has a travel policy that policy applies to the chief executive officer and janitor equally and there is no different standard he said that he is not sure that he buys into a discussion on the separation of powers regarding this issue he said that he would like to see a travel policy put into place that includes everyone and if an elected official has a complaint then they should come and make a valid argument as to why they should be excluded said that she echoes concerns she said that the public gets frustrated when the congress exempts themselves from all the laws they impose on others she said that elected officials should also be accountable and their spending should be transparent the public should be able to see who is and the cost to taxpayers lewis said that the separation of powers issue is very important if the mayor came to the council and said that he wanted them to do something but the council did not agree with the action separation of powers allows them some recourse she said that she does not understand a member of the council not supporting separation of powers this amendment cleans up the role of elected officials versus the role of the executive branch she said that they could easily look at a separate travel policy for the council if that is concern said that he recognizes the need for separation of powers but if department directors the chief of police and other officials have to operate within the confines of a travel policy then elected officials should show the same regard he said that the council appropriates each agency and departments travel funds and he does not understand why these agencies then cannot join in agreement to follow a reasonable policy the taxpayers look to the council to guard their tax dollars and spend them wisely and this does not seem unreasonable lewis said that she is not saying this policy is unreasonable but that she feels a separate legislative body should be able to set their own policy she said that ignoring that separation of powers in any instance creates a slippery slope and she cannot support that chair asked if the council could look at formulating their own travel policy said that they could even adopt the identical policy but it is a question of who gets to decide chair said that he would be happy to cosponsor such a proposal with he asked if they could include the judges and other elected officials said that he could not speak for what they would want in their travel policy chair asked to draft a proposal for the councils own travel policy the motion to amend proposal no carried by a vote of with and casting the negative votes citizen said that is a waste of money and there is no autonomy since the mayor has all the control lewis moved seconded by to send proposal no carried by a vote of with casting the negative vote information services agency information services fund into character to pay for higher than anticipated wiring costs associated with network upgrades funded by projected cost savings from character chief information officer information services agency said that this is a transfer to cover wiring expenses he said that they came before the committee the last quarter of last year to give a status report on the network upgrades since that time they found that in many of the locations such as parks buildings sheriffs stations and metropolitan police department district offices the wiring was in much worse shape than they expected he said that this ended up being a cost and they first thought they could take the funds from character but were told it needed to come out of character where they did not have adequate funds the savings in character which is being transferred to cover this cost is due to a technology officer position that they have not filled and the chief operating officer coo position not being filled until just recently and therefore not having to pay a full year salary for that position chair asked if they are planning to hire someone to eventually fill the other open position said that the newly hired coo has many of the skills needed by a chief technology officer position they cannot compete with the private sector in offering a comparable salary for a true technology officer but fortunately the new coo has the experience needed in this area and can fill both roles asked if it is possible to take advantage of new technology to enhance the wiring project said that this is pretty much the reason for the project they are replacing old technology and the connections currently in these locations were copper they are moving to fiber connections which will provide far greater speeds as well as last much longer asked if this amount will cover all the cost said that it will asked if they have considered taking advantage of some internships to help with staffing said that they actually just posted for interns today and have reached out to all colleges within county as well as university and university he said that they had a group of interns last year that worked out well and they are reaching out to tap into those resources again said that they just spent million for information networks but with proposal no they created three new special taxing districts that will make what is doing now because they will come in and do the work all over again and they will not have to come before the council for approval moved seconded by to send proposal no proposal no requires audits of the results of the implementation of proposal no general ordinance no made the following motion i move to amend proposal no including the digest by deleting the language that is and adding the underlined language in the highlighted portion to read as follows digest requires audits operating reports of the results of the implementation of proposal no general ordinance no proposal for a general ordinance requiring audits operating reports of the results of the implementation of proposal no section title i chapter of the revised code of the consolidated city and county is hereby amended by the addition of a new sec to read as follows sec audits operating reports of the results of proposal no the mayor shall provide for an independent evaluation and performance audit prepare annual operating reports due before of the year following the adoption of proposal no and also for the following year to determine the amount of any cost savings operational efficiencies or improved service levels that result from proposal no include a a description of operational changes resulting from proposal no an organizational chart for the office of public health and safety with employee names and titles a detailed analysis of actual revenues and expenditures compared to budgeted revenues and expenditures and an evaluation of the extent to which actual operational changes comply with proposal no the independent evaluations and performance audits annual operating reports must be provided to the council in an electronic format and must also be posted to the citizen information portal chair asked if he could second the motion responded in the affirmative chair seconded the motion said that he does not understand taking out the language for an independent evaluation and performance audit to be replaced with simply requiring the mayor to prepare an annual report he said that an operating report would not have to follow any set of rules and it does not require an independent third party and he therefore opposes the amendment said that they wanted to give the mayor an opportunity to provide this information without putting him on the spot she said that she agrees there is a difference but the information required is actually listed out in the amendment she said that they wanted to see language added to the original proposal no approving the reorganization requiring the administration to present qualifying documents to gauge the effectiveness of the action but it was left out of the final passed version she said that they simply would like to see enough information to show that they are on track with efficiencies and cost savings that were projected she said that this report could actually even provide some additional information they might not get in an audit like the organizational chart with the names of actual employees she said that since the mayor is new to his position they wanted to give him an opportunity to provide this information without the formality of an audit in order to still provide the taxpayer with some accountability she said that this is the reason for offering this lewis said that she appreciates the desire for transparency but she believes what they are trying to do with this proposal and the amendment is something the council already has the authority to request chair said that constituents saw proposal no as a major change in the way the city does business he said that this city has had two mergers and the public continues to ask about the results of those mergers and no one can really answer that question as to if a merger really saved money or did what it was supposed to accomplish he said that the whole purpose of this proposal is to make sure it really worked and show taxpayers the results he said that the amendment provides for annual reporting that is available to the public with analysis regarding the reconfiguration instead of pinning down the mayor or with a formal audit he said that there is a trust factor involved that the administration will give them what they need and if there are questions the council can ask them he said that if constituents ask how it worked out they can send them to the website to see for themselves lewis said that the council already has the authority to ask for an annual report and does not need a proposal to do that as the chairman of this committee can request an accounting at any time she said that she believes the original proposal also included some language about an audit chair said that they requested this language be added but it was not put in the final version agreed and said that if that language had been put in like they had asked this would not be an issue she said that this is not an accusation but for sake they did ask for it to be included and it was not she said that some members were very clear that they wanted to see an audit report if the reorganization was approved brown council chief financial officer stated that as with any financial reporting departments and agencies have to come every year during the budget process before the council and the council can require as much detail as they want in that analysis most departments also give a history of expenditures and while this next budget will be the first one for the new department and they will not see much history they will still have to present a budget of how they intend to spend money for the new department those other divisions that were moved to other departments will also still have to have their budgets approved brown said that any committee can call for an audit at the councils expense or he can actually do the audit although he is not a certified public accountant and the audit would be considered unqualified he does have the ability to perform an audit he said that they can also provide a wage control report he said that there are tools already in place to accomplish what this amendment seeks to enact chair said that because they have the authority to ask for it that is why they are doing so he said that this is not about distrust but proposal no is the administrations idea and solution and they are simply asking them to show the council and the public how that idea is working he said that he does not really want to mix up this process with that of the normal budget process with questions about and calculations which could become quite confusing said that she understands what they are driving at and she is in support of that information being made available however they are already going to be spending three months hearing the budgets for these departments and divisions and that seems an ideal time to ask questions the public also can watch videos of those meetings and access minutes online at any time she said that the chair could then invite them back next with a progress report instead of making this into a law she would rather see them accomplish the same objective under the rules they currently have in place chair said that he works in this arena every day and when there is a major change there should be some accountability for it he said that it seem simple but he wants some accountability and he feels budget details are a different matter he would like to see the review isolated because this was a major change and it could get very confusing trying to find all the different areas of the budget that were affected by this change fanning said that she appreciates the effort to increase transparency and she does believe that they need the ability to evaluate every proposal they enact on the back end in order to have confidence that the decisions they are making are constituents however her concern is in singling out specific proposals to undergo a greater evaluation process when maybe they need to reevaluate the processes for everything she said that she would suppose that this is not going to be the only significant change this mayor makes in the next four to eight years and they would be having this conversation over and over again with a proposal for every single action she said she would prefer they maybe look at the process and create something that would avoid having to draft an ordinance for every major action chair said that they tried to add this language in the proposal but it was taken out and the only mechanism available at that point was to come back with a separate ordinance he said that proposal no is a lot of money when considering all the different divisions involved brown said that the proposal involved a million shift in dollars which is a lot of money and they will have to take a hard look at the budget to see how it is all distributed said that while he recognizes joining this review with the budget process might add some complexity when there is a change of this magnitude the budget process provides the perfect opportunity to have that dialogue he said that he believes this proposal was good intentioned but it is duplicative because they have the ability to do all that this proposes now they simply have to be thorough in their review and diligent in getting answers asked how they can define the questions needed to arrive at some of this said that if the questions they want answered are those included in this offered amendment they simply have to ask those questions asked what recourse they have if these questions are not answered in the budget process said that the council then has the authority not to approve the budgets if they do not get the answers they seek said that this makes them like congress who has to shut down because they cannot approve a budget she said that they cannot afford for this city to be shut down and for services to come to a halt she said they will be taking budget time on an item that could have already been worked out said that he believes this administration will provide them with the information they ask for as he has seen no indication thus far that they will not stated that has not yet been through a budget cycle and it can get very convoluted she said that the way this amendment is written this would provide a report for taxpayers when the original proposal was passed they said that they would ask the mayor for this information they would not be here with this new proposal today if this language had been included in proposal no as asked said that as the amendment is drafted he would expect to see all these things in the mayors annual report to the community if there are specific issues regarding the reorganization efficiency the council has the ability to ask for an independent review he said that the office of audit and performance does an excellent job and as a member of the audit committee he has seen some of their work and it is very thorough he said that he believes a report from the mayor will already be provided and if it is not sufficient they are within their rights to ask for more chair said that is performing an audit of specifically as they go into budget to find efficiencies and use every penny where it is most needed he said that the chief is thankful for the audit as well to help them identify better ways to spend the taxpayers money said that this is like letting the fox guard the he said that eliminating the audit shows the mayor he can do whatever he wants he said that all of the failing cities right now like and are run by black democrats and this city is following suit with all black democrat chairs he said that they are abdicating their authority and responsibility and taking all their oversight away and giving the mayor the power to do whatever he wants stated that comments are out of order chair agreed and asked to wrap up and keep his comments respectful he added that public comment is still important and it is a part of due process just as reports like this one are important to keep the public the motion to amend proposal no failed by a vote of with fanning lewis ray and casting the negative votes moved seconded by to send proposal no to the full council with a do pass recommendation the motion failed by a vote of with fanning lewis ray and casting the
