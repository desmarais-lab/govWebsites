the fire department re lease agreement for fire apparatus corporate council fire department special purchase of apparatus the city of is in dire need of fire apparatus for the fire department the current fleet is close to twenty years old and parts require to maintain the fleet in proper working order are no longer in existence are too expensive to replicate or replace in particular three pumpers and two aerial quints and two aerial quints are needed by the fire department due to the financial crisis of the city of and the need for a solution as soon as possible purchasing new apparatus via a bid process was not feasible state law allows the city to make a special purchase when there exists a unique opportunity to obtain supplies or services at a substantial savings to the city the city took a creative approach and began to look at used and or demo apparatus the city also decided to embark upon a lease to own financing mechanism through the bank using a substantial amount of the money given to the city from the railroad rather than purchasing the apparatus outright the monies were going to expire at the end of thus the purchase of the required apparatus under another purchasing method would seriously impair the functioning of the city due to the need to be innovative in light of the circumstances it was not practicable or advantageous to purchase the specified apparatus by competitive sealed bidding or request for proposals pursuant to code the city make a purchase without soliciting bids or proposals due to the unique nature of the purchase and because time was of the essence for public health welfare and safety reasons there was no public bid process instead the fire department contacted four apparatus providers that had used and or demo apparatus for sale the companies that were contacted were pierce and the city will also make a special purchase in this instance because the compatibility of apparatus is a substantial consideration in the purchase and very few sources meet the reasonable requirements for used and or demo apparatus each company provided specifications for three pumpers and two aerial based on the availability at their respective companies discussions were conducted with each company to determine if they had the apparatus needed by the department and the best offer to obtain such apparatus this special purchase is being made with competition as is practicable under the circumstances after reviewing the information the fire department compiled the attached spreadsheet and selected to provide pumpers and to provide the aerial quints because their proposals were the most advantageous to the city taking into consideration price and the other evaluation factors such as time of delivery each company was accorded fair and equal treatment with respect to any opportunity for discussion and revisions of proposals in conducting discussions with the companies information derived from proposals submitted was used in discussion only if the identity of the company providing the information was not disclosed to others the city provided equivalent information to all companies with which the city chose to have discussions madame vice president i move that we approve the contract with for pumpers in the amount of one million one hundred fourteen thousand seven hundred three dollars green second are there any questions i do have a question the other company which was do we have their proposal we do not have their contract yet so that would have to come to the board at another the two aerial quints this is only for the three pumpers green all in favor and i also have to give you i see on this copy i know if it is on your copy the attachment on here so ill make sure you get it there is an
