basically went to the school corporation to acquire to have the property transferred from the school to the airport the school actually transferred the property to the city so instead of transferring it to the airport so now we have to go back and make the transfer to the airport so it originally the property it was the school corporation and they gave it to the city and now we are giving it to

additional liability that the county or the state would be gracious to care for but i do have one question in section four it says that the city agrees to remain responsible for the maintenance operation and repair of a bridge well not sure we have to look at that agreement to see whats in that agreement between the city state and county i would rather that we defer this agreement cause i
