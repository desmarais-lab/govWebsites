until through unless both parties mutually agree to its termination madame president i move that we approve the between calumet township and the fire any questions all in favor say aye correspondence from the fire department re special apparatus purchase from fire chief request to expend funds to lease purchase a ft ladder truck and three emergency response vehicles date the fire department was approved to fire apparatus and emergency response vehicles by the common council we were authorized to make the emergency to address our urgent need for apparatus and to utilize a procedure to allow the city take advantage of a major cost savings by purchasing demo fire apparatus the three emergency response vehicles will be purchased under the state of quantity purchase agreement this agreement allows us to purchase vehicles at a state negotiated price bids are not required under this agreement the purchase must come from advantage ford box in the ft ladder truck will be purchased from at a cost of was selected after reviewing similar apparatus from the following vendors base model comparable to plus pierce the visited vendors with available demo units that closely met our specifications in our effort to purchase ladder trucks we considered vendors with similar models primary factors that were considered were warranty year of make distance to repair facility customer service availability of parts cost and training support services as a result we opted to make our from the cost of the apparatus and emergency response vehicles will be taken from department from corporation counsel special purchase of apparatus date the city of is in dire need of fire apparatus for the fire department the current fleet is close to years old and parts required to maintain the fleet in proper working order are no longer in existence and or are too expensive to replicate or replace in particular one foot ladder truck is needed by the fire department due to the financial crisis of the city of and the need for a solution as soon as possible purchasing new apparatus via a bid process is not feasible state law allows the city to make a special purchase when there exists a unique opportunity to obtain supplies or services at a substantial savings to the city the city took a creative approach and began to look at used and or demo apparatus the city also decided to embark upon a lease to own financing mechanism through the bank using a substantial amount of the money donated to the city from railroad rather than purchasing the apparatus outright due to the need to be innovative in light of the circumstances it was not practical or advantageous to purchase the specified apparatus by competitive bidding or requests for proposals pursuant to the city make a purchase without soliciting bids or proposals it is my understanding from the fire department that the process to order and purchase new equipment is very expensive and takes on average months to complete due to the unique nature of the purchase and because time was of the essence for public health welfare and safety reasons there was no public bid process instead the fire department contacted several apparatus providers that had used and or demo apparatus for sale the companies that were contacted were pierce and the city also make a special purchase in this instance because the compatibility of apparatus is a substantial consideration in the purchase and very few sources meet the reasonable requirements for used and or demo apparatus each company provided specifications for a foot ladder truck based on the availability at their respective companies discussions were conducted with each company to determine if they had the apparatus needed by the department and the best offer to obtain such apparatus this special purchase is being made with competition as is practicable under the circumstances after reviewing the information the fire department compiled the attached spreadsheet and selected to provide the foot ladder truck because their proposal was most advantageous to the city taking into consideration price and other evaluation factors such as time of delivery each company was afforded fair and equal treatment with respect to any opportunity for discussion and revisions of proposals in conducting discussions with the companies information derived from proposals submitted was used in discussion only if the identity of the company providing the information was not disclosed to others the city provided equivalent information to all companies with which the city
