at and the letter addressed to you dated states both ways this needs to be clarified by maxwell and the final design drawings stamped by a structural we would like to have a written statement from maxwell outlining their slab is poured but the weather keeps them from pushing it in place and contingency plan or if the slab is not able to be pushed into place for whatever reason the concept of a
