library drainage improvement project the bid submitted is higher than the initial prior engineer estimate that was provided by project work however there are a to the start of the win boulevard this estimate was completed before engineering work began the project and was best guess at what the office the estimate airport roan north office street ash th aver tn moved forward there performed approximately inflation has elevated the price that this work over that amount of time require as the project elements added to the scope that have significantly affected the price of the work but made this a better end product for the city of rising surf office years ago and would expect to pay for to the project scope was in the proposed asphalt estimate assumed only cutting and biggest change in the initial patching asphalt areas directly affected by the installation of the line the final engineering plans call for milling and replacement of all of the asphalt on both second and streets in areas that are affected by the storm line installation it became apparent to as the project went along that the city would have a much nicer end product if the affected streets were essentially re paved rather than simply patched with a line of asphalt in affected areas with that said has prepared an engineers cost estimate based on the final project drawings we feel the bid from contractor inc is very high compared to what we would expect for this copy of that estimate feels that the best course of action at this time would be to bid the reject the bid and re project we have found the bidding climate to be very favorable for our clients recently and it is our opinion that much better bids could be work attached is attained if the docs letter if you have any or concerns
