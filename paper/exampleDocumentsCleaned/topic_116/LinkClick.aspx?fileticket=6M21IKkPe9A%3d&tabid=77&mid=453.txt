the region tourism is literally dollars arriving from foreign ports every industry day even if those as close as northern tourism dollars and export variety of local businesses from hotels restaurants attractions historic sites parks and shops that benefit from direct visitor activity to the enterprises that supply and serve tourism businesses and thereby benefit indirectly from tourism spending

of tourism has nothing to do with money it tangible pride of place residents take as their community becomes more vibrant aesthetically appealing a place other people want to visit we invite the residents of rising and county to share our vision of what we can comes found explanation of tourism product a tourism infrastructure or product consists of two principal categories attractions and attractions lure visitors to a destination the places they can amenities do things they can see attractions are the things that visit a destination assets and make it unique capitalize tourism support businesses or amenities usually consist of accommodations restaurants shopping and transportation there are several levels of tourism support there are businesses and organizations that have direct contact with visitors accommodations being the best example and then there are the organizations which have little or no contact with the visitor but supply and service the businesses that do food vendors retail wholesalers accountants contractors and office supply are example of secondary tourism businesses a case can be made that virtually every business in a tourism destination is a tourism business they are all impacted by visitors except in rare instances particular restaurant no one travel visits destination to stay at a particular hotel or eat in attractions in usually made with the destination mind however when it comes to generating economic benefits from tourism attractions spending in the represent only a small fraction of the total impact most of the visitor local economy comes recommendations hotel restaurant and retail spending made during visit goals work in conjunction with historic downtown redevelopment economic development city county and chamber of commerce to
