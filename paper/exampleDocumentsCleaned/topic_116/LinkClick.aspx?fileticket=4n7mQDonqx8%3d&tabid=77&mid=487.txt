departments issued by a number of governmental agencies supposed related liability issues somewhat dubious and unclear and therefore has chosen not to award grants in the future this purpose to any of the volunteer fire departments in its region further believes that your insurer should be sensitive and knowledgeable as to what is necessary even if you are unable to technically meet certain recommended standards prefers these mandated requirements be resolved out gear internally by each volunteer fire department example as to turn purchasing of a few sets each year as ongoing program of replacement regular budget is encouraged permitted by the department decision with it should also be noted in this letter that grants out gear does not turn relate to other volunteer fire especially
