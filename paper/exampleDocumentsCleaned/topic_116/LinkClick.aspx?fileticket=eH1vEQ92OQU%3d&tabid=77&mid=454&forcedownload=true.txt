band director and car show coordinator city council members here tonight on behalf of the school board to inform you of a proposed project and to ask for your support as you know the board authorized a committee to review the long range needs of the school corporation the result was a committee of individuals representing various boards and throughout the city and county councilman councilwoman and mayor represented the city on this committee the four spent reviewing the needs and the facilities to develop a recommendation for the school board at the board meeting the long range needs committee presented its findings to the board in an oral and written following the presentation at the board meeting the school board further reviewed the report individually and also had a retreat to review the recommendations at the retreat they also gathered more information about recommended project the committee members reviewed each of the three buildings in order to develop their recommendations their recommendations were comprehensive with the students best interests in mind as the board reviewed the recommendations both individually and as a group the school board agreed with the two major themes safety of students and a complete upgrade of the system at the while are other items that the needs middle elementary identified these two issues drove many of the recommendations if the project becomes reality these two issues will also consume most of the needed exhibit one is a listing of the items identified by the needs committee while this list should not be taken as a complete list of items it does show the general outline of the proposed project some of the items are very obvious as to how they fit into the two categories mentioned in the above paragraph and some are not so obvious item a deals mainly with the middle school mechanical and elementary electrical system which is a very specific item mentioned by the committee with some of the security items it as obvious to the observer the needs committee noted how easily it is to enter our buildings without being seen by any adult this is mainly due to the placement and general construction of the office areas in both buildings there are safety hazards such as the industrial arts area the weights on the stage and the bleachers that everyone sits on at high school basketball games these are just a few examples why representing the school board at this meeting we are asking for your support as mayor councilman and councilwoman noted on the committee this is a community project as such we hope that the city council will help in spreading the good news the second way that council can help is with funding this is not with new funding the endowment the city and the county these agreements presently separate agreements money for only paying the present debt and for student the present time the endowment has approximately million in scholarships reserves this amount will allow the school to pay off the present loan probably at the end of however the financial experts are questioning whether this is the best of the money the proposed project with combined hard and soft costs is while an estimated bond approximately million the present loan is at issue would be at the financial consultants are questioning whether it is in the best interest of taxpayers to pay off a loan with a lower interest rate and borrow higher interest rate the thought at this time with city council blessing keep the present loan and apply the million towards the million proposed project by using the money in this manner the school corporation will be borrowing million at the higher rate it will also allow money to be available immediately which will be used to pay initial costs for items such as architectural fees etc attached are two examples that show leaving the present debt on the books and using the funds on hand to limit the borrowing is is to in the best interest of taxpayers in the first comparison the assumption is that the endowment will continue to receive approximately a combined yeas from the city and county the endowment received about last year page one assumes that the present debt remains on the books and approximately million is used to fund the proposed project column notes the present payment column represents continued payment from the endowment column represents the payment for bond issue column represents the combined debt payments column represents the new tax rate page two makes the same assumption about income but pays the present loan in full in the year you should note that the payment in column and the tax rate in column are higher when the debt is paid off early pages and are comparisons using the that there will assumption the scenario page pays the present loan off in you should note that the payment in column and the tax rate in column on page are greater in order to be the best stewards of funds and am asking the city council to behalf of the school board i redesign present agreement with the endowment the new agreement would allow the endowment to gift the present funds to the school corporation for the proposed project any future funds that are received can then be used to reduce the annual debt and tax rate this would allow the school corporation to borrow less money and to keep any tax rate at the lowest level possible thank you for your time and consideration county community schools partial addition and renovation to include new administrative library addition kindergarten and art
