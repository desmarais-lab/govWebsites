researched steel prices are also on the rise so it would be a good time to start working on the project again chairman of the wastewater planning committee stated the committee did meet on at the meeting ed updated the committee on the results of the pilot study that was commissioned with and associates at the end of last year the wastewater treatment plant operates under a permit and this gives the city months until to comply with a new monthly average effluent phosphorus limit of milligram per liter to accomplish this phosphorus removal goal the city completed pilot testing of several chemicals to determine the best chemical to be used for chemical phosphorus removal the removal of phosphorus from wastewater can be achieved through the normal biological process of the and through chemical precipitation three chemicals were chosen for testing the main goal of this study is to determine which chemical will consistently meet permit limits while minimizing chemical costs and additional solids production hyper ion achieved the lowest concentration of phosphorus for the least cost and increased solids production by therefore it was the recommended chemical for phosphorus removal at the city of jasper in order to implement future phosphorus removal chemical storage and feed facilities will need to be constructed at the under option the city plans to use the existing secondary control building for the required equipment the estimated cost for option including design engineering and construction engineering services is approximately a second option option for chemical storage and feed facilities is to have one gallon storage tank located outside of the secondary control building and install the pump skid inside the building this would eliminate the need for concrete floor and ceiling improvements as well as the fire alarm system the estimated project cost for option including design engineering and construction engineering services is approximately since the project cost of this option is over cheaper than option it is recommended to install the chemical storage tank outside the building if an acceptable location for the tank is found in addition to chemical testing also examined costs to modify the for biological phosphorus removal since does not allow a wastewater treatment plant to implement without the installation of chemical feed facilities as backup phosphorus removal method the capital cost for would be in addition to the costs listed above for chemical removal for option it is established the combined and chemical facilities capital projects cost is approximately which is substantially more expensive than for the chemical facilities only capital project cost of while the estimated operations and maintenance cost for only is approximately versus for feeding it would take over years of reduced operational costs to make up for the difference in capital cost over the chemical only option therefore biological phosphorus removal is not recommended at this time at the meeting the committee also reviewed the wastewater departments capital expenditure plan after much discussion and evaluation the committee

narrow the scope down and come to some agreements which in turn reduce the cost of the study attorney stated that the board of public works already authorized the use of from funds because there is no contract in hand the city would not be able to encumber those dollars into the city council would have to those dollars in stated that if a meeting between the and city council is scheduled it would

negative impact on the overall scope of work and that no one would benefit from the study chairman stated that he was in favor of funding the study stated there seemed to be a couple of options for the board the first option is that the board would fund the study the second option is that the board likes some of the proposal ideas but would like to consider doing some of the scope of work which
