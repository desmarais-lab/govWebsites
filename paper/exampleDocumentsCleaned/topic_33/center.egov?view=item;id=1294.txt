the length of time it would take the bidder to complete the demolition the bid amounts any alternatives and any previous reference projects from the bidders said there was good participation the low bidder group had very good references all of whom were happy with groups work although they were the low bidder expected the costs to be a wash or that the city would make some money instead the city would have to pay if we accepted one of these bids one reason the costs were high is that the steel prices are extremely low at this time felt the reason groups bid was so much lower than the others was because they were looking hard at their salvage opportunities and the other bidders not have stated that he was afraid there be additional costs in most of the bids received due to the language that was included in the scope of work in the bids said he reviewed all the bids in detail some of the bids left open the possibility of more expense recommended rejecting all of the bids at this time agreed said we will no longer be firing up the power plant we do not have the manpower and it would take months to get the plant prepared to fire up he feels that we could eliminate the boiler and machinery insurance if we will no longer be firing up currently we are exercising all of the equipment monthly to keep it in good shape and that is why the boiler and machinery insurance was retained does not believe the boiler would have value anymore due to it being a boiler the only value remaining is the scrap value recommends proceeding with the environmental cleanup first and then try to sell some of the equipment or components after there be the possibility of selling or the building shell if the power plant employee position is eliminated and the boiler and machinery insurance is dropped the monthly loss for the electric generation department fall to to monthly it was also mentioned that there are some grant options to help with the environmental cleanup that need to be

investigate options for the power plant and associated structures seconded the motion bud stated that a clarification needed to be made to the electric committee meeting minutes regarding reducing the monthly costs of the power plant the minutes state that the monthly cost for the power plant would drop to to a month if the employee position is eliminated and the boiler and machinery insurance is dropped this was a generalization stated that more is involved in these costs including of taxes payments maintenance costs and utilities etc if these costs are eliminated reduced or reallocated to other utility departments the monthly cost would be close to to it is more complicated than was stated at the committee meeting chairman said it can be somewhat misleading when reviewing the financial statements as there are the items such as depreciation expense and those expenses that are allocated partially to all utility departments such as administrative expenses in lieu of taxes payments etc the administrative costs will need to be reallocated at some point and can be done at a different meeting informed the public that the electric department has not received a capacity payment from for
