service in the trinity crossings subdivision read the minutes from the gas planning committee meeting aloud gave a brief recap of his request that jasper municipal utilities install gas service for free in the trinity crossing subdivision he said it would not make sense for him to pay to have install gas service when he could get it for free from utilities he stated that he was made to believe that would start offering to install gas service for free at some point also brought an agreement that they signed with like the escrow that was presented at the last utility service board meeting for attorney to review he said that the city would not be out any money up front the city could then rebate as the lots were sold bud and mayor explained how utilities started offering and extending their gas service inside the city of jasper in the there was an oil embargo and the gas sales were capped and the department of energy said the city could not add more customers did not have the cap on their gas sales so they could expand their services into the city of jasper this essentially created a boundary between where the city of gas and city of jasper gas were now after all these years jasper would need to expand their gas service further than would have to which results in higher costs to the city of jasper the mayor kept stressing that the city needs to service jasper residents and that it adds more value to a lot with jasper utilities than with utilities gas rates are approximately higher than jaspers gas rates disagrees and care about the longterm payback to the customers he is only interested in the immediate asked why can extend the service for free stated that they charge the cost back through their gas rates and that is why their rates are higher rick said the board is concerned about the risk to our ratepayers the return on investment the city would receive and being consistent in our approach to all requests such as this the approach needs be fair to all roger said he like the fact that ratepayers will be subsidizing the developer he stated a cannot be computed with no gain also asked if we have the capacity to take on more customers stated that he needs additional employees and all this type of work would be done which would stretch his workforce further said that anything the city pays for incrementally gets incrementally shared with the whole customer base even though this project is a minimal cost and the city see a slight savings in fixed costs they would most likely be negated by the additional costs if the city must add additional staff to handle the increased capacity mayor stated that we have an obligation to get utility service to the citizens where there is competition with another provider gas or water attorney was tasked with researching ways the city could charge these extension costs back to the customers in these subdivisions said that considerations need to be made for overhead costs to manage these types of special arrangements it was mentioned that it could also be a lost opportunity for economic development if the city does not offer free extensions to large commercial customers asked why the city cannot markup rates a little to cover development costs of extending gas service the mayor suggested that we research adding an expansion rate or fund that would be built into the rate structure for future expansion the mayor said this discussion is critical and the civil city and utilities need to work together as one and not separately asked if would be willing to split the cost of the extension with the city said he was agreeable to discussions on this topic said he needs an answer from the city by the end of roger suggested pay to extend the gas service up front and then apply for a rebate from the city to reimburse him as the lots in the subdivision are sold however the rebate would not necessarily be a full rebate of gas installation charges said that the city could possibly charge each subdivision a different gas installation fee when the customer runs the service line to the home this fee would not be deducted off the gas installation invoice bud suggested charging a development fee to the property owner when they come in to transfer the utilities to their name from the developer attorney will also research this concept what to charge and when to charge a fee like this would also need to be discussed as well as tracking these fees administratively the committee agreed to have another meeting to continue discussing this issue on th at am in the room will send the meeting notice to the media and committee members it was also discussed that the new comfort inn which will be built near the holiday inn express requested jasper gas at this location the city
