regular meeting as corrected roger seconded the motion motion approved chairman of the electric planning committee stated the committee did not project informed the board that the certificate of substantial completion for the project came in the mail this week and needs to be accepted and signed by the board made a motion to accept the certificate of substantial completion for the project seconded the motion motion approved bud general manager stated that the committee did not meet during the past month chairman of the water planning committee stated the committee did meet on th at the meeting chairman gave a recap on what had transpired with the beaver spillway project since the last utility service board meeting the utility service board decided at the meeting not to fund the modifications of the spillway project but would keep the bids open until their expiration and at the next meeting hear information from the stakeholders regarding alternative financing for the project since that time many meetings have been held with stakeholders to work together for a solution the city was expecting to hear a proposal for funding at the park board meeting on th which would then be brought to the but were met instead with allegations that during the initial spillway modification a mistake was made by someone that lowered the lake by inches and that the city did not acknowledge the mistake stated that he takes offense to these allegations and that proper due diligence was taken by the city in regards to the lower lake level stated that the city forwarded the video of brad presentation at the park board meeting to land surveying engineering and and associates and asked them to address the allegations made by attorney reminded everyone that the vendors are under no obligation to address this all of their contracts with the city are complete much discussion followed about the surveys that were done over the life of beaver lake and the allegations made by explained why the initial modifications had to be done to the spillway and dam and the different options the city considered to achieve compliance with the unfunded mandate it was asked if there were any litigation possibilities did not feel there were any possibilities as the contractors agreements were written to meet standards for the and were not based on the prior lake level reminded everyone about the strict to put a solution into place the bids will be closed on th and many resolutions ordinances and meetings are needed to get this project awarded by lumber expressed that they will not extend the bid past days time is running out and the city has yet to hear a plan about alternative financing from the stakeholders said there is nothing for the water committee to further discuss until the stakeholders bring their plan for financing to the city he said the cannot force any more liability on to the ratepayers and the mayor said no tax dollars will be spent on this project after having to reduce all city departments budgets by for next year the mayor said the lake management plan was proposed to take care of all beaver lake issues with the water level to be the first issue addressed he said no feedback or direction from the lot owners and renters have been received on the proposed plan chairman and said there was no information received for them to make a recommendation from the water committee to the full stressed that we must continue to negotiate while we are waiting for the vendors to address the allegations it was agreed to table the issue until the meeting on night then gave the floor to chairman chairman read a prepared statement aloud with the boards indulgence i would like to briefly provide an update of our activities to date relative to the beaver lake spillway upgrade as you are aware i have had the opportunity to meet on numerous occasions as your representative with the various stakeholders involving the upgrade these meetings included mayor city attorney park board chairman park and recreation officials buck and general manager of utilities and lake representatives and resultant to those meetings you have a copy of a memo dated that outlines the project cost financing options and an itemized breakdown of financing cost attributable to the water utility park department and various beaver lake renters including any monies raised through their recent funding appeal the accuracy of this exhibit is dependent on their report this evening relative to the monies raised and participation level of either the property relative to the annual assessment proposed it is also dependent on approval of the additional funding requests from the utility service board and park and recreations board in addition our city council will have to approve the various portions applicable to their legislative body included as part of our discussion this evening additional to funding request will be a request for us to loan monies net of monies donated to date to fulfill the cost of the bid and related items additionally due to the complex nature and involvement of multiple boards and private entities several contingencies will likely need to be included in our actions this evening allowing the necessary time for the other boards to take their action this week an additional item of interest and our subsequent action deals with the recent assertion that mistakes were made relative to the initial project concerning the survey and design phase resultant to these concerns we immediately contacted and sent the video listing the various data items of concern and asked for a full report to be available to the board this evening specifically a request was made to land surveying engineering and and associates as you recall from our meeting we as a board decided not to fund the project this decision was based on the significant exposure to our ratepayers based on upcoming projects the costly prior mandates the value of the additional water as back up water supply relative to the cost of the project the diminished reserves in our water utility fund and in consideration of the recent very large rate increase now this evening we have been asked to reconsider a funding request at a much lower cost to our water utility it would seem prudent to utilize the aforementioned criteria and any additional per board member discretion in our decision making process additionally i believe it is worthy to consider the idea mentioned previously relative to the water value as an additional insurance policy against the prospects of a future occurrence that could impact our city ratepayers in a negative fashion finally i would like to point out that our consideration this evening with minimized ratepayer exposure and without property tax funds from the civil city involves the possibility of forging a true partnership to achieve the desired goal of the spillway elevation upgrade attorney stated that when the video of the park board meeting was sent out to engineering and associates and land surveying the city did not ask them to perform another new full evaluation the city only asked them to review the video and to provide any information that they thought was relevant for this meeting tonight with engineering addressed the board regarding the beaver lake spillway project stated that last week allegations were made that there was some fault made by or other professionals involved in the beaver lake dam project that was completed in stated that a lot of data was reviewed over the past week regarding the spillway project but none of the data was new data one main report that was cited last week during the spillway discussion was the and associates report that was completed in after allegations were made that the lake levels in beaver lake were different from before the project was completed this report was an independent report and found that there was no single entity responsible for the discrepancy in the lake pool elevations stated that there were some errors and typos in the document but the analysis and the conclusions made by the report were not affected by the typographical errors the second document that was cited last week was from the corps of engineers which was called the phase ii report this report was completed in to evaluate safety efficiencies on dams across the country stated that was very familiar with this report and reviewed it during inspections leading up to the spillway design this report was cited by in the preliminary engineering report completed prior to the design phase stated the design for the new spillway was based on a topographic survey that was completed by land surveying in the survey included spot elevations on the crest of the concrete shoot as well in the approach channel upstream of the shoot the elevation on the approach channel was according to north vertical datum of this is the same elevation that based the spillway crest elevation on for the proposed spillway relied on this data because it was a detailed ground survey done for the design and construction of the new spillway improvements the only other information available to was the report which was almost thirty years old did not witness a control point that was higher than the concrete seal as described in the phase ii report concluded that the spillway had eroded over the thirty years and the difference of elevations that was cited in the phase ii report was a result of the erosion that occurred in the approach channel felt that the land surveying results were more reliable and therefore used their results for the spillway design verses results from thirty years ago stated that at this point he realizes that there is an apparent discrepancy with the lake levels now and the levels prior to the spillway modifications he believes that there are other explanations for the lower levels which include debris and hydraulic inefficiency within the channel stated that when deciding which spillway elevation to use main purpose was to improve the overall safety of the dam in order to meet safety requirements stated that stands by the spillway design and believes that no errors were made is willing and ready to assist the city in any way necessary to resolve the ongoing discussion involving the lower lake levels brad with land surveying addressed the board regarding the beaver lake spillway project stated that the data that was reflected in their survey was from the from at the time of the survey they did not have the dam inspection reports from phase i or phase ii available their data was very similar to older reports stated that the one foot discrepancy within the reports from past surveys taken at different crests is not a factor stated that work was provided as instructed and he feels no errors were made in the survey which in turn was utilized by to build the new spillway feels all work was performed in accordance to safety standards bud presented a memo from and associates to the board regarding the beaver lake spillway modifications stated that lee with and associates reviewed the video from the park board meeting mentioned that some typos were made on the report submitted regarding data in one part of the report that match the data in another part of the report but none of the typos affected the results of the study the memo states that and associates stands behind the report that they originally presented chairman stated that after the concerns were made at nights park board meeting board and city officials met and contacted all three firms involved to address the allegations all three firms have reported that no errors were made stated that the and associates report was used as a forensic analysis checking the work of the other two firms feels very strongly that the board has done their job to address the situation by contacting all the firms involved roger stated that he feels proper protocols were taken by the board brad addressed the board regarding the beaver lake spillway modifications clarified that noted discrepancies in his preliminary engineering report that there was a difference between the and elevations to current elevations then stated that in the preliminary engineering report it was noted that a discrepancy was found between what was observed in the survey as a controlled elevation of the lake and between the elevation of the lake stated that the cause was unknown at that point it could have been erosion of the channel or a combination of erosion and a discrepancy of the benchmarks used did not state that this would cause a decreased elevation in the current lake levels informed the board that the friends of beaver lake met and raised in hand with money still coming in which will total approximately reminded that the deadline for all contributions is th stated that they are ready to move on and work with the city of jasper asked the board to consider contributing to the fund to raise the water levels at beaver lake stated that the city will have to have a binding contract with several stakeholders in order to move forward with considering loaning the remainder of the funds from the electric department to the stakeholders for the project attorney contacted the state board of accounts regarding the loaning of the additional funds they stated that they would not red flag anything in an audit as long as there were contract terms penalty terms and collection terms set up and being pursued if needed also contacted the general counsel for the association of cities and towns they also assured that no red flags would be noticed with this agreement addressed the discrepancies made by which were noted in their preliminary engineering report to the city said that the report stated that discrepancies were found but the city know how much because the amount was not given stated that until the lake levels came back up no one had any idea how much the levels would be off once the lake came back up got calls saying the lake levels varied from inches lower to feet lower around the lake at that time the city starting looking into what was causing the differences in levels to vary so much stated that based on the land surveying report the lake levels would return to their normal level after construction of the new spillway the city believed the lake levels would return to normal based on the information from the report stated that we are now at a point that we need to fix the current situation at the lake stated he feels the extra water in the lake would be a valuable resource for the city of jasper he feels the lake is an asset for the city not just for the water but also for recreational purposes applauded the making of the partnership for beaver lake reminded the board that when the water rate increase was implemented of the increase was dedicated to the beaver lake project or capital improvements suggested dedicating one year of the increase to the beaver lake project stated that the figure should be approximately to the utility controller will have to confirm the correct figures said the contract was written to call for approximately inches but it noted that the inches needs to be verified stated that lake levels will be verified through various field surveys around the lake and confirmation with lot there is also the ability to modify the inches if needed brad stated that this will be a challenge to find the exact levels with the wide varieties of existing levels around the lake questioned regarding the outcome of the effects downstream if the spillway is raised another inches stated that the outcome will make very little difference in the outflow downstream stated that if the spillway is raised inches the will have the authority to release the water from the lake during an emergency if needed asked what the recreational benefits will be if the spillway is raised inches said that renters and owners will be able to use their boat docks again right now some renters and owners cant even get their boats on the lifts it will reduce safety issues for skiers too the city owned lots will also benefit because right now they have water up to most of their docks it will also help control the algae and seaweed and prolong the dredging of the lake would like to see the lake marked with and be more visible to city residents this is a public lake and residents need to know that they can utilize the lake agreed with and said once the lake management plan is started these are things he would like to see happen that will positively affect the community stated that a permit has been applied for and approved by the regarding the possible inch spillway modification the board discussed in detail the consideration of the funding and how much to contribute for this project once again suggested a contribution from the utility service board suggested a contribution due to a lot of ratepayers not using the lake roger agreed that to was acceptable asked if they receive more than the in stakeholder donations what would that money go towards stated if there is extra money contributed it will apply to lowering the potential loan from the city chairman stated that several contingencies will be needed to be included in the boards actions this evening made a motion to approve financing the beaver lake spillway elevation upgrade project in the amount of contingent on board loan approval via subsequent motion contingent on donations receipt by contingent on contract with property owners or other providing appropriate security for the loan subject to regulatory guidelines and contingent on appropriation approval by the park and
