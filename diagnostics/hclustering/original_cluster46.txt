intended to recover all or a significant portion of their costs Unlike governmental
type activities use the accrual basis of accounting This means
activities business
that revenues and expenses are shown in the fund financial statements when they
are incurred regardless of when actually paid
Fund Financial Statements A fund is a grouping of related accounts that is used
to maintain control and reporting of resources that are segregated for a specific
purpose or activity with defined objectives Rising Sun is required to use fund
related legal
accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance with finance
requirements All of the funds of Rising Sun are divided into three categories
governmental funds proprietary funds and fiduciary funds

delayed and or erroneous distributions of property taxes during previous years
With the implementation of dockside gaming operations by the casino
located within the City admission tax Is calculated based on a per entry basis
versus a per excursion basis as was the calculation prior to July 1 2002 This results
in a significant drop in admission tax However HEA 1001 gyarantees that the City

higher amounts which show a quicker rate in receiving wagering tax The City
cannot receive a distribution In excess of the Base Year Revenue for wagering
taxes Any amount the City would have received that exceeds the Base Year
Revenue in any state fiscal year is paid into the property tax replacement fund of

Independent Auditors' Report

The Honorable Gregory A. Ballard
Mayor, City of Indianapolis,
and the City-County Audit Committee
Marion County, Indiana:
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the governmental activities, the business-type activities, each
major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of Marion County, Indiana (a component unit of the Consolidated
City of Indianapolis – Marion County) (County) as of and for the year ended December 31, 2007, which collectively
comprise the County’s basic financial statements as listed in the accompanying table of contents. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the County’s management. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements
based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the
standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of
the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the County’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.
As more fully described in Note 1 to the basic financial statements, the County prepared its financial statements on the
modified cash basis, which is a comprehensive basis of accounting other than U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the respective financial
position–modified cash basis of the governmental activities, the business-type activities, each major fund, and the aggregate
remaining fund information of Marion County, Indiana as of December 31, 2007, and the respective changes in financial
position–modified cash basis thereof for the year then ended, in conformity with the basis of accounting described in Note 1,
except for Note 6 – Additional Pension Disclosures, on which we express no opinion.
The County has not presented Management’s Discussion and Analysis as required supplementary information that U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles have determined is necessary to supplement, although not required to be part of, the
basic financial statements.
In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated May 21, 2010 on our consideration
of the County’s internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws,
regulations, contracts and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is to describe the scope of our
testing of internal control over financial reporting or compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion
on the internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in
accordance with Government Auditing Standards and should be considered in assessing the results of our audit.
The budgetary comparison information on page 28; the schedules of funding progress and employer contributions on pages
29 and 30; and the notes to required supplementary information on pages 31 and 32 are not a required part of the basic
financial statements but are supplementary information required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We have
applied certain limited procedures, which consisted principally of inquiries of management regarding the methods of
measurement and presentation of the required supplementary information. However, we did not audit the information and
express no opinion on it.

KPMG LLP, a U.S. limited liability partnership, is the U.S.
member firm of KPMG International, a Swiss cooperative.

Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that collectively comprise the
County’s basic financial statements. The combining and individual fund financial statements and schedules – other
supplementary information on pages 36 through 49, are presented for purposes of additional analysis, and are not a required
part of the basic financial statements. Such information, except the schedules of revenues and expenditures–budget and
actual, on pages 38 through 45 which are unaudited, have been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of
the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, are fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the basic financial
statements taken as a whole on the basis of accounting described in Note 1.
The information presented in the introductory section on pages 1 through 3, is presented for purposes of additional analysis
and is not a required part of the basic financial statements. Such information has not been subjected to the auditing
procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements, and accordingly, we express no opinion on it.

MARION COUNTY, INDIANA
(COMPONENT UNIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS–MARION COUNTY)
NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2007
NOTE 1—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
A. Financial Reporting Entity
Marion County (County) is a unit of local government created by the State of Indiana, governed by the following officials,
each of whom is granted certain independent executive authority under the State Constitution:
County Auditor
County Treas urer
County Co ro ner

County Prosecuto r
County Record er
County Sheriff

County Surveyor
Clerk of the Circuit Court
J udge of the Circuit Court

The legislature of the State of Indiana has provided for certain additional elected officials who are not mentioned in the
Constitution to exercise certain independent executive authority. These are the county assessor, township assessors, and
superior court judges.
In accordance with Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement No. 14, The Financial Reporting Entity,
the County is considered a component unit of the Consolidated City of Indianapolis-Marion County. The County and the
Consolidated City share a common executive and legislative body. Otherwise, the County is considered a separate legal
entity, with its elected officials directly and separately (from City officials) responsible for financial independence,
operations, and accountability for fiscal matters.
Based on the criteria established in GASB Statement No. 14, the County has no component units under the current financial
reporting requirements.
The County has an investment in the Indianapolis-Marion County Building Authority (Building Authority); a joint venture
with the City of Indianapolis (City). Because the County shares joint control equally with the City, the County and City retain
an ongoing financial responsibility, information concerning this joint venture is included in note 9.
B. Government-wide and Fund Financial Statements
The government-wide financial statement (i.e., statement of activities and net assets - modified cash basis) reports
information on all of the nonfiduciary activities of the County. For the most part, the effect of interfund activity has been
removed from these statements. Governmental activities, which normally are supported by taxes and intergovernmental
revenues, are reported separately from business-type activities, which rely to a significant extent on fees and charges for
support.
The statement of activities and net assets - modified cash basis demonstrates the degree to which the direct disbursements of
a given function are offset by program receipts. Direct disbursements are those that are clearly identifiable with a specific
function. Program receipts include (1) charges to customers or applicants who purchase, use, or directly benefit from goods,
services, or privileges provided by a given function and (2) grants and contributions that are restricted to meeting the
operational or capital requirements of a particular function. Internally dedicated resources are reported as general receipts
rather than as program receipts. Likewise, general receipts include all taxes and other items not properly included among
program receipts.
Following the government-wide financial statement are separate financial statements for governmental funds, proprietary
funds, and fiduciary funds, even though the latter are excluded from the government-wide financial statement. Major
individual governmental funds and major individual enterprise funds are reported as separate columns in the fund financial
statements. The County has determined that the General and Welfare Sinking funds are major governmental funds. All other
governmental funds are reported in one column labeled “Nonmajor Governmental Funds.” The County has one enterprise
fund (business-type activities), the Drug Testing Laboratory fund. This enterprise fund is not considered a major fund within
the fund financial statements. Additionally, the County has one internal service fund (governmental activities) that accounts
for the operations of the Information Services Agency. The County also has two fiduciary fund types: pension trust funds and
agency funds.

(COMPONENT UNIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS–MARION COUNTY)
NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2007
C. Basis of Accounting and Financial Statement Presentation
The government-wide, governmental fund, propriety fund, and fiduciary fund financial statements are presented using a
modified cash basis of accounting, which is a comprehensive basis of accounting other than U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. Receipts are recorded when received and disbursements are recorded when paid. Investments are
recorded at historical cost. The modified cash basis is referred to as the cash and investment basis throughout the footnotes.
The cash and investment basis of accounting differs from U.S. generally accepted accounting principles in that receipts are
recognized when received in cash rather than when earned and disbursements are recognized when paid rather than when the
liability is incurred.
If the County utilized the basis of accounting recognized as generally accepted, the fund financial statements for
governmental funds would use the modified accrual basis of accounting, while the fund financial statements for proprietary
and fiduciary fund types would use the accrual basis of accounting. The government-wide financial statement would be
presented on the accrual basis of accounting.
The fund financial statements of the County are organized on the basis of funds, each of which is considered a separate
accounting entity with self-balancing accounts that comprise its’ cash and investment basis assets, fund balances/net assets,
receipts, and disbursements. Governmental resources are allocated to and accounted for in individual funds based upon the
purposes for which they are to be spent and the means by which spending activities are controlled. The various funds are
summarized by type in the basic financial statements. The following fund types are used by the County:
Governmental Fund Types
Governmental funds are those through which most governmental functions are financed. The acquisition, uses, and
balances of the County’s expendable financial resources on the cash and investment basis are accounted for through
governmental funds.
The following are the County’s major governmental funds:
The General Fund is used to account for all receipts and disbursements applicable to the general operations of
governmental agencies of the County, except those required to be accounted for in another fund. All operating
receipts that are not restricted as to use by sources external to the County are recorded in the General Fund.
The Welfare Sinking Fund, a debt service fund, is used to account for the resources devoted to the payment of
interest and principal on short-term notes payable outstanding for child services.
The other governmental funds of the County are considered nonmajor. They are special revenue funds, which
account for the proceeds of specific receipts that are restricted to disbursements for specific purposes; debt service
funds, which account for the accumulation of resources for, and repayment of, general obligation long-term debt
principal, interest, and related costs; and capital projects funds, which account for resources designated to construct
or acquire major capital facilities.
Proprietary Fund Types
Proprietary funds are used to account for activities that are similar to those found in the private sector.
The following are the County’s proprietary fund types:
Enterprise – Enterprise funds are used to account for operations that are financed and operated in a manner
similar to private sector business enterprises – where the intent of the governing body is that the costs of
operations are financed primarily through user charges. An enterprise fund has been established for the Drug
Testing Laboratory fund. The Drug Testing Laboratory fund is used to account for fees collected by the Marion
Superior Court drug testing laboratory.

(Continued)

MARION COUNTY, INDIANA
(COMPONENT UNIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS–MARION COUNTY)
NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2007
Internal Service – Internal service funds are used to account for the financing of goods or services provided by
one department or agency to other departments or agencies of a government, or to other governments, on a cost
reimbursement basis. An internal service fund has been established for the County’s Information Services
Agency, which provides information technology services to other agencies of the County, or to other
governmental units on a cost-reimbursement basis.
Proprietary funds distinguish operating receipts and disbursements from nonoperating items. Operating receipts and
disbursements generally result from providing services and producing and delivering goods in connection with a
proprietary fund’s principal ongoing operation. All disbursements in the enterprise fund are reported as operating
disbursements as they reflect the cost of services and administration. Operating disbursements for the internal
service fund primarily include the cost of services and charges, and administrative disbursements. All receipts and
disbursements not meeting this definition are reported as nonoperating receipts and disbursements.
Fiduciary Fund Types
Fiduciary – Fiduciary funds are used to account for assets held by the County in a trustee capacity or as an agent for
individuals, private organizations, or other governmental units. These include pension trust funds and agency funds.
Pension trust funds are accounted for and reported similar to proprietary funds. The pension trust funds account for
the Marion County Law Enforcement Personnel Retirement Plan and the Marion County Law Enforcement
Personnel Dependents and Disability Benefits Plan. Agency funds are custodial in nature and do not present results
of operations. These funds account for the collection, distribution, and escrow of various tax types, fees, and set aside
funding.
When both restricted and unrestricted resources are available for use, it is the County’s policy to use restricted resources first,
then unrestricted resources as they are needed.
D. Cash, Investments, and Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents
Investments are stated at cost. Any changes in fair value of investments are reported as realized gains or losses in the year of
the sale of investment as investment earnings.
Cash and cash equivalents are defined as all highly liquid investments including certificates of deposit with an original
maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase.
Proceeds from the Information Service Agency fund’s capital lease with JUSTIS.Net, amounting to $386,804 at
December 31, 2007, are classified as restricted cash and cash equivalents on the statement of activities and net assets modified cash basis, as these funds are restricted for the purchase of software or hardware equipment relating to JUSTIS.Net,
the Marion County Court’s case management IT system.
E. Property Taxes
Property taxes levied for all governmental entities located within Marion County are collected by the Treasurer of Marion
County, Indiana (Treasurer). These taxes are then distributed by the Auditor of Marion County, Indiana (Auditor) to the City
and the other governmental entities at June 30 and December 31 of each year. The City and the other governmental entities
can request advances of their portion of the collected taxes from the Treasurer once the levy and tax rates are certified by the
Indiana Department of Local Government Finance. The Indiana Department of Local Government Finance typically certifies
the levy on or before February 15 of the year following the property tax assessment.
The County’s 2007 property taxes were levied based on assessed valuations determined by the Auditor as of the March 1,
2006 assessed valuations, which were adjusted for estimated appeals, tax credits and deductions. The lien date for the 2007
property taxes was March 1, 2006 (assessment date); the amount of property tax to be collected cannot be measured until the
levy and tax rates are certified in the subsequent year. Taxable property is assessed at 100% of the true tax value. In 2007,
taxes were due and payable to the Marion County Treasurer in two installments on May 10, 2007 and November 10,
2007. However, the 2006 assessment involved a new procedure for assessing properties which resulted in homeowner
assessments being increased excessively while business assessments stayed nearly stagnant. The spring bills were sent out
and a public outcry led the Governor of Indiana to require Marion County to review and reperform new assessments and the
Governor instructed the public to pay an amount for the 2007 spring billing equal to only one-half of their 2006 tax bill. It
was determined that the new assessments could not be completed until the spring of 2008 and therefore, the taxpayers were

NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2007
asked to again pay only one-half of the 2006 bill for the fall billing for 2007 property taxes. Most of the property taxes
collected in 2007 were distributed to the units of government by December 31, 2007. In June 2008 the final reconciliation
bill was sent out based on the final assessments. The final distribution of taxes for 2007 occurred in August 2008.
F. Capital Assets
Capital assets arising from cash transactions acquired for use in governmental, proprietary fund, or government-wide
operations are accounted for as capital outlay disbursements of the fund upon payment.
G. Debt
Long-term debt
Long-term debt arising from cash transactions are not reported as liabilities in the basic financial statements. The debt
proceeds are reported as other financing sources or general receipts and payments of principal and interest are reported as
disbursements.
County Option Income Tax
In 2007, Marion County received $9,600,000 in proceeds from the City of Indianapolis from the City’s issuance of
$36,000,000 of County Option Income Tax Anticipation Notes during the year. These notes matured on January 12, 2009,
and the County repaid the City its portion of proceeds at this time. As of December 31, 2007, the County has pledged future
County Option Income Tax receipts to repay this debt and related interest.
Notes payable
On April 16, 2007, the County’s Indiana Limited Recourse Notes, Series 2007 A were issued in the amount of $7,150,000
with a maturity date of March 1, 2008. The County used the proceeds to refinance the Indiana Limited Recourse Notes,
Series 2006, which were outstanding in the amount of $7,150,000. Interest is payable at maturity at a rate of 4.54% per
annum.
Tax anticipation warrants
During 2007, tax anticipation warrants were issued on the taxes levied in 2006 and collected in 2007. The City-County
Council authorizes the temporary borrowing pending the receipt of taxes levied and repayment of loans on June 30 and
December 31 of the year borrowed. This procedure assures the County of sufficient funds for operating disbursements
between the property tax distribution dates.

(COMPONENT UNIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS–MARION COUNTY)
NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2007
H. Interfund Transactions
In the process of aggregating the financial information for the government-wide statement of activities and net assets –
modified cash basis, some amounts reported as interfund activity and balances in the fund financial statements have been
eliminated or reclassified.
Transfers
Legally authorized transfers are reported as transfers in by the recipient fund and as transfers out by the disbursing
fund.
Interfund Services Provided/Used
Charges or collections for services rendered by one fund for another are recognized as receipts (interfund services
provided) of the recipient fund and disbursements (interfund services used) of the disbursing fund. These transactions
are recorded as interfund services because they would be treated as receipts and disbursements if they involved
organizations external to the County.
Certain internal payments are treated as program receipts, such as internal services provided and used. Certain internal
payments are treated as a reduction of disbursements, such as reimbursements.
Elimination of interfund activity has been made for governmental activities in the government-wide financial statement.
I. Receipts and Disbursements
Program Receipts
In the government-wide financial statement, amounts reported as program receipts include (1) collection of cash from
customers or applicants for goods, services, or privileges provided, and (2) operating grants and contributions. Internally
dedicated resources are reported as general cash receipts rather than program cash receipts. Likewise, general cash receipts
include all taxes.
Operating Receipts and Disbursements
Operating receipts and disbursements for proprietary funds result from providing services.
J. Fund Balance / Net Assets
Government-wide Financial Statement
Equity is classified as net assets and displayed in two components:
Restricted net assets consist of net assets with constraints placed on the use either by (1) external groups such as creditors,
grantors, contributors, or laws and regulations of other governments or (2) law through constitutional provisions or enabling
legislation. Restricted net assets are classified as restricted for capital projects, grantor purposes, and statutory purposes on
the government-wide statement.
Unrestricted net assets - All other net assets that do not meet the definition of “restricted.”
Fund Financial Statements
Governmental fund equity is classified as fund balance. Proprietary fund equity is classified the same as in the
government-wide statement.
K. Pensions
The County has separate defined benefit pension plans that cover substantially all employees. The Indiana Public Employees’
Retirement Fund (PERF), administered by the State of Indiana, applies to County employees. The Marion County Law
Enforcement Personnel Retirement Plan (Retirement Plan) and the Marion County Law Enforcement Personnel Dependents
14

(COMPONENT UNIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS–MARION COUNTY)
NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2007
and Disability Benefits Plan (Disability Plan) cover employees of the Sheriff’s Department. The policy of the County is to
fund accrued pension costs for the plans.
The Retirement and Disability Plans are accounted for under the cash and investment basis of accounting as pension trust
funds of the County. Employee and employer contributions are recognized as receipts in the period received, pursuant to final
commitments, as well as statutory or contractual requirements; and disbursements, including benefits paid and refunds, are
recorded when the corresponding payments are made. Investments are recorded at cost.
NOTE 2—STEWARDSHIP, COMPLIANCE, AND ACCOUNTABILITY
Annual budgets are adopted on a budgetary basis. All annual appropriations lapse at the end of the calendar year, except for
capital project funds, which are budgeted on a project basis.
Prior to the first required publication, the Mayor submits to the City-County Council a proposed operating budget for the year
commencing the following January 1st. Prior to adoption, the budget is advertised and public hearings are conducted by the
City-County Council to obtain taxpayer comments. In September of each year, the City-County Council, through the passage
of a resolution/ordinance, approves the budget for the next year. The budget becomes legally certified after approval from the
State of Indiana Department of Local Government Finance.
Revisions to transfer appropriations between agencies or character of expenditure require approval of the City-County
Council. Revisions to increase the appropriations for tax supported funds require approval of the City-County Council and
the State of Indiana Department of Local Government Finance.
NOTE 3—CASH AND INVESTMENTS
A summary of all cash and investments at December 31, 2007 is as follows:

Cash and cash equivalents and certificates of deposit
Cash with fiscal agents

Investment Policy - Primary Government (excluding Sheriff’s Department Personnel Retirement and Disability Benefit
Plans)
Investments are recorded at cost. It is the policy of the County to invest public funds in a manner that will provide the highest
investment return with the maximum security while meeting the daily cash flow demands of the County and conforming to
all state/local statutes governing the investment of public funds.
The primary objectives, in priority order, of the County’s investment activities are:
Safety: Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments of the County shall be
undertaken in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the overall portfolio. To attain this objective,
diversification is required in order that potential losses on individual securities do not exceed the income generated from the
remainder of the portfolio.
Liquidity: The County’s investment portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable the County to meet all operating
requirements that might be reasonably anticipated.

Return on Investments: The County’s investment portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a rate of return
throughout budgetary and economic cycles, commensurate with the County’s investment risk constraints and the cash flow
characteristics of the portfolio.
State statutes authorize the County to invest in certificates of deposit, obligations of the U.S. government and U.S.
government agencies, and repurchase agreements. The statutes further require that repurchase agreements must be
collateralized at 100% of market value on the day of trade by U.S. government or U.S. government agency obligations. These
investments are required by statute to have a stated final maturity of not more than two years.
Investment Policy - Sheriff’s Department Personnel Retirement and Disability Benefit Plans
The primary objectives for the Sheriff’s Retirement and Disability Benefit Plans’ investment activities shall be:
Time Horizon: Investment guidelines are based upon an investment horizon of greater than five years.
Risk Tolerances: To achieve the plans’ long-term objectives, the following factors were considered when establishing the
risk tolerance.
1. The Plans’ financial condition.
2. Liquidity reserves are established, and any remaining assets are fully invested at all times.
3. The Marion County Sheriff’s Pension Board (Board) has set a shortfall constraint that current plans’ assets must be equal
to 90% of the annual benefit obligation.
Performance Expectations: The desired investment objective is a long-term rate of return on assets that is at least 8.00%.
Additionally, it is expected the return will be at least 4.75% greater than the anticipated rate of inflation as measured by the
Consumer Price Index.
Asset Allocation Constraints: The Board has reviewed the long-term performance characteristics of various asset classes,
focusing on balancing risks and rewards and has selected the following asset classes for allowable investments:
1.

Domestic large capitalization equities

2.

Domestic small capitalization equities

3.

International equities

4.

Domestic fixed income

5.

Cash equivalents

Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of investments will be adversely affected by a change in interest rates. The
County’s investment policy provides that the County seeks to minimize the risk that the fair value of securities in its portfolio
will decrease due to changes in general interest rates by structuring the investment portfolio so that securities mature to meet
cash requirements for ongoing operations, thereby avoiding the need to sell securities on the open market prior to maturity.

Credit Risk
Credit risk is the risk that an issuer or other counterparty to an investment will not fulfill its obligations. Credit risk is
measured using credit quality ratings of investments in debt securities as described by nationally recognized rating agencies
such as Moody’s Investor Services. The County uses the highest integrity when choosing an instrument of investment. The
County keeps its credit risk as it pertains to investments at a low rate by requiring all investments of the County, which are
rated, to be rated in the three highest ratings categories by Moody’s Investor Service, Standard & Poor’s Corporation, or
Fitch’s Ratings Service. Investments were rated as follows by Moody’s Investors Service, Standard & Poor’s Corporation, or

NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2007

NOTE 5—PENSIONS
The County maintains two benefit plans for law enforcement personnel, which are reported as pension trust funds.
Additionally, the County contributes to the statewide Indiana Public Employees Retirement Fund (PERF).
A. Plan Description
Marion County Law Enforcement Personnel Retirement Plan
The Retirement Plan is a single-employer contributory defined benefit retirement plan covering certain employees of the
Marion County Sheriff’s Department other than those deputies that are employed by the Civil Sheriff. The Retirement Plan is
administered in accordance with state statutes, which require the County to make minimum contributions necessary to keep
the plan sound on an actuarial basis according to state law. The Retirement Plan provides that each employee contributes
4.25% of their earnings to the plan, which is maintained in a reserve for member contributions and accumulates at a rate of
3.00% compounded annually. Contributions required of the employee may cease, at the election of the employee, following
the completion of 20 years or more of credited service and prior to termination of employment.
Retirement Plan benefits begin to vest after 10 years of service. As of December 31, 2007, there are 99 fully vested
employees (over 20 years of service), 78 partially vested (between 10 and 20 years of services), and 188 nonvested
employees. Law enforcement employees who retire at or after age 55 with 10 years of credited services are entitled to an
annual retirement benefit, payable monthly for life, in an amount equal to 2.50% of the highest monthly average of
consecutive five-year salary per year of service up to a maximum of 20 years; plus 2.00% of such salary per year of service in
excess of 20 years, if any, up to an additional 12 years; plus $1 for each year of service up to a maximum of $20. Full
benefits do not commence before attainment of age 50; however, employees with 20 years of service can elect earlier benefits
at a reduced rate. As of December 31, 2007, there are 293 retirees and beneficiaries receiving benefits, 8 terminated members
entitled to benefits but not yet receiving benefits, and 365 current active members.
Although it has not expressed any intent to do so, the County has the right to discontinue its contributions to the Retirement
Plan at any time. Doing so in three consecutive years terminates the plan. In the event of plan termination, participants are
entitled to their amount of contributions and a proportionate amount of any excess after certain benefits and expenses.
The County does not issue a separate financial report for this plan, which is included as a pension trust fund in this report.
Marion County Law Enforcement Personnel Dependents and Disability Benefits Plan
The Disability Plan is a single-employer defined benefit plan covering all participants in the Retirement Plan. The Disability
Plan provides benefits to the beneficiaries of disabled employees and payments of pensions to dependent parents, surviving
spouses, and dependent children under age 18 for deceased employees. This plan is accounted for in a single fund in
accordance with state statutes, which require the County to make minimum contributions necessary to keep the Disability
Plan sound on an actuarial basis. At December 31, 2007, there are 79 benefit recipients and no vested employees.
During 1997, the County conducted a cost of living actuarial study. As a result of this study, the Council adopted general
ordinance number 162-97, which amended the plan to include cost of living adjustments. Effective January 1, 1998, and each
year thereafter, all participants in payment status (both current and future) are eligible for a cost of living increase. Benefit
increases are not available to terminated vested participants or the beneficiaries of participants. Applicable increases, if any,
may be payable on the July 1 following the later of retirement date or attaining of age 55. The amount of the annual increase,
if any, will depend on the change in the Consumer Price Index and will never exceed 2.00%.
The County does not issue a separate financial report for this plan, which is included as a pension trust fund in this report.
PERF
PERF is an agent multiple-employer public employee retirement system that acts as a common investment and administrative
agent for state employees and employees of participating political subdivisions of the State of Indiana, in accordance with
Indiana Codes 5-10.2 and 5-10.3.
PERF provides a contributory defined benefit plan. Substantially all County employees are covered by the plan except those
covered by the Retirement and Disability Plans. The County pays the employee contribution portion, 3.00% of annual salary,

which is mandated by state statute, in addition to the employer contribution amount, which is actuarially determined and is
currently 5.00% of annual covered payroll.
PERF retirement benefits vest after 10 years of service. Under the defined benefit component, County employees who retire
at or after age 65 with 10 or more years of creditable service; age 60 with 15 or more years creditable service; or if the sum of
age and creditable service is greater than or equal to 85 (but not earlier than age 55) are entitled to an annual retirement
benefit, payable monthly for life with 60 months guaranteed. Employees who have reached 50 years of age and have 15 years
of credited service will qualify for early retirement with reduced benefits. PERF also provides death and disability benefits.
These benefit provisions and all other requirements are established by state statute and county ordinance.
PERF issues a publicly available financial report that includes financial statements and required supplementary information.
That report may be obtained by writing PERF, Harrison Building, Suite 800, 143 West Market Street, Indianapolis, IN
46204.
B. Funding Policy
The County is obligated by state law to make all required contributions to the Retirement and Disability Plans based upon an
annual actuarial valuation. The required contributions are actuarially determined. The costs of administering the plan are
financed through plan assets. There are no long-term contracts for contributions to the plan. For PERF, the County pays the
employee contribution portion, 3.00% of annual salary, which is mandated by state statute, in addition to the employer
contribution amount, which is actuarially determined and is currently 5.00%.
The annual required contribution and actual contribution made for each plan is as follows for the year ending December 31,

NOTE 8—DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN
Employees of Marion County are eligible to participate in a deferred compensation plan adopted under the provisions of
Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 457 (Deferred Compensation Plans with Respect to Service for State and Local
Governments). The deferred compensation plan is available to all employees of the County. Under this plan, employees may
elect to defer a portion of their salaries and avoid paying taxes on the deferred portion until the withdrawal date. The deferred
compensation amount is not available for withdrawal by employees until termination, retirement, death, or unforeseeable
emergency. During 1997, the deferred compensation plan was amended to comply with the amendments to Section 457 of the
IRC. Plan provisions were amended so that plan assets are held in trust by an independent trustee for the exclusive benefit of
participants and their beneficiaries and are not included within the accompanying financial statements.
NOTE 9—JOINT VENTURE
The Building Authority is a joint venture of the County and the City. The Building Authority finances, acquires, constructs,
improves, renovates, equips, operates, maintains, and manages lands, governmental buildings, and communication systems
for governmental entities in Marion County. The Building Authority has no stockholders nor equity holders, and all bond and
note loan proceeds, rentals, and other revenues must be disbursed for specific purposes in accordance with provisions of
Indiana Code 36-9-13 et seq. and several trust indentures and loan agreements executed for the security of the holders of the
bonds and notes.
The buildings are financed through the Building Authority’s general obligation debt, which is repaid from rent received under
long-term lease agreements with the County and City. All of the leases contain lease renewals and purchase options. If these
options are not exercised, the leases provide for transfer, upon expiration of the lease, of ownership of the properties to the
lessees free and clear of all obligations of the lease. The governing Indiana statute with respect to each of the Building
Authority’s leases provides that the government lessee(s) shall be obligated to levy annually a tax sufficient to produce each
year the necessary funds to pay the lease rentals to the Building Authority. These leases provide for sufficient rent to service
the debt and provide for operating costs.
The County’s share of the joint venture consists primarily of an allocation determined by the amount of space utilized by
County agencies in the City-County Building and nearby parking lot determined by floor space, 100% of the Marion County
Jail and Jail II, the Marion County Juvenile Detention Center, and the Marion County Sheriff’s Roll Call Site. The
City-County Building is an office building that houses the majority of the operations of the County and City. The City’s share
of the joint venture consists primarily of an allocation determined by the amount of space utilized by City departments in the
City-County Building and parking lot, 100% of the Municipal Garage, Belmont Garage, the Public Safety Training Academy,
and Public Safety Properties. The Environment Control Services Building is leased to other units of government and private
parties. Public Safety Communications System operating costs are paid by the County agency Metropolitan Emergency
Communication Agency.
The Building Authority has five members on the Board of Trustees, two of whom are appointed by the City-County Council
of the Consolidated City of Indianapolis-Marion County, one by the Mayor of the City in his capacity as the municipal
executive of Indianapolis, one by the Mayor of the City in his capacity as the county executive of the County, and one by the
Marion County Board of Commissioners. The Trustees appoint the five members of the Board of Directors, which is the
governing body of the Building Authority. The Building Authority is subject to the budgetary authority of the City-County
Council, which equally represents the County and the City.
The Building Authority has various long-term debt obligations, which are secured by the rent payments received from the
County and City. During 2007, the County paid $3,595,000 and $6,234,201 in rent and maintenance, respectively. A copy of
the separately issued financial statements of the Building Authority, which is prepared on a basis other than U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles, is available upon request.
NOTE 10—RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS
The legislative body of the County is the same in several respects as that of the City, and the position of County Executive is
held by the Mayor of the City. The County provides certain information technology and telephone services to the City.
Receipts from these services were $15,719,870 in 2007. In 2007, the County received $280,581 of 911 dispatch fees from the

The City and County purchase certain insurance policies that cover risks of both entities. The City and County pay premiums
associated with their own respective portions of the coverage. The City provides certain administrative services to the
County, including purchasing, legal, and other general administration. The City funds such services through a countywide tax
levy. The County does not compensate the City for these services, except for legal services. Conversely, the County provides,
at no compensation, criminal, civil, juvenile, and probate court services to all municipalities and unincorporated areas in
Marion County, administers the property tax administration and collection system for the same jurisdictions, and operates the
County jail and lockup.
The County acted as either a subrecipient or a pass-through agent for various state and federal grant programs with the City
during 2007.
In 2007, Marion County entered into various contracts with Health and Hospital Corporation of Marion County (HHC).
HHC is a separate municipal corporation and is considered to be a component unit of the Consolidated City of IndianapolisMarion County. HHC has its own governing board separate from the County’s legislative body. HHC has within it the
division of public health and the division of public hospitals. HHC provides medical care to the inmates of the Marion
County Jail through its division of public hospitals via a contract with the Marion County Sheriff’s Department. In 2007, the
cost of medical care provided to inmates for Marion County was $4,388,411. Additionally, in 2007, the County made
$1,426,233 in mental health distributions to HHC as allowed by law.
NOTE 11—COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
In 2007, Indiana law limits the liability of municipalities to $500,000 per person and $5,000,000 per occurrence. In 2008, the
per person limit was increased to $700,000.
The County participates in a number of federal and state financial assistance programs. These programs are subject to
financial and compliance audits by federal agencies. The amount, if any, of disbursements that may be disallowed by the
granting agencies cannot be determined at this time, although the County expects such amounts, if any, to be immaterial.
NOTE 12—DEFICIT FUND BALANCES/NET ASSETS
At December 31, 2007, the following nonmajor governmental and enterprise funds had a deficit fund balance/net assets:
Nonmajor Capital Projects Fund
Public Safety Capital Projects

$

12,244

The County intends to reduce the deficit in the MC Sheriff’s Civil Division Fees, Supplemental Public Defender Fee and Drug
Testing Laboratory funds by increasing charges for services accounted for in those funds. The deficit in the Public Safety Capital
Projects and Community Corrections Home Detention funds will be funded by a transfer from the General Fund.
NOTE 13—SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
A. Property Tax Assessment
The 2006 property tax assessment involved a new procedure for assessing properties, which resulted in homeowner
assessments being increased while business assessments stayed nearly stagnant. The spring bills for 2007 were sent out based
on the 2006 assessments and a public outcry led the Governor of Indiana to require the County to review and reperform new
assessments and the Governor instructed the public to pay an amount for the spring billing for 2007 equal to only one-half of
25

NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2007
the 2006 tax bill. It was determined that the new assessments could not be completed until the spring of 2008, and therefore,
the taxpayers were asked to again pay only one-half of the 2006 tax bill for the fall billing for 2007 property taxes. Most of
the property taxes collected in 2007 were distributed to the units of government by December 31, 2007. In June 2008, the
final reconciliation bill was sent out based on the final assessments. The final distribution of taxes for 2007 occurred in
August 2008. These property tax delays caused the County to collect less receipts than budgeted and the County utilized
short-term borrowing using tax anticipation warrants to supplement the lower than expected receipts. These tax warrants were
not fully repaid by the end of 2007 or 2008 (see note 13.B below).
B. Issuance of Tax Anticipation Warrants
The County issued tax anticipation warrants in advance of property tax collections in each of the years 2007 through 2010.
Due to the property tax reassessment issues discussed in note 13.A above, the County did not repay all of the tax anticipation
warrants at the end of 2007, 2008, or 2009. Amounts borrowed and repaid by year by fund as well as the outstanding balance
at the financial statement issuance date are as follows:

C. Credit Market Conditions
Recent market conditions have resulted in an unusually high degree of volatility and increased the risk associated with certain
investments held by the County, which could impact the value of investments after the date of these financial statements.
D. Child Welfare Juvenile Incarceration Takeover by State
As a result of 2008 legislative changes to Indiana statute, beginning January 1, 2009, the state took over the costs of the child
welfare program and juveniles incarcerated in state facilities. These costs were previously part of the local property tax levy
within Marion County, but with the change, the levy also transferred to the state. In 2007, the activity related to the child
welfare program was accounted for in the Family and Children Services Agency Fund and the activity of the juvenile
incarceration program was accounted for in the General Fund.

*Information required for only most recent actuarial valuation and the two preceding valuations.
Analysis of the dollar amounts of net assets available for benefits, actuarial accrued liability, and excess of actuarial accrued
liability (assets in excess of actuarial accrued liability) in isolation can be misleading. Expressing the net assets available for
benefits as a percentage of the actuarial accrued liability provides one indication of the County's funding status on a
going-concern basis. Analysis of this percentage over time indicates whether the plan is becoming financially stronger or
weaker. Generally, the greater this percentage, the stronger the plan. Trends in funding status and annual covered payroll are
both affected by inflation. Expressing the funding status as a percentage of annual covered payroll approximately adjusts for
the effects of inflation and aids analysis of the County's progress made in accumulating sufficient assets to pay benefits when
due. Generally, the higher this percentage, the stronger the plan.
In accordance with GASB No. 25, a schedule of funding progress is not required to be disclosed for the disability plan as
supplementary information since the aggregate actuarial cost method used by the disability plan does not identify or
separately amortize unfunded actuarial liabilities. Under this method, the excess of the Actuarial Present Value of Projected
Benefits of the group over Actuarial Value of Assets is allocated on a level basis over the earnings of the group.

intended to recover all or a significant portion of their costs Unlike governmental
activities business
type activities use the accrual basis of accounting This means
that revenues and expenses are shown in the fund financial statements when they
are incurred regardless of when actually paid
Fund Financial statements A fund Is a grouping of related accounts that is used
to maintain control and reporting of resources that are segregated for a specific
purpose or activity with defined objectives Rising Sun is required to use fund
related legal
accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance with finance
requirements All of the funds of Rising Sun are divided into three categories
governmental funds proprietary funds and fiduciary funds

Rising Sun adopts an annual appropriated budget for its funds A budgetary
comparison statement has been provided for the major funds to demonstrate
compliance with the budgets
Governmental Funds
Governmental funds are used to account for
essentially the same functions reported as governmental activities in the
wide financial statements However unlike the government
government
wide financial statements governmental fund financial statements focus
on near

ECONOMIC FACTORS AND GENERAL OUTLOOK
According to the Indiana Department of workforce Development the
population of Rising Sun has remained relatively stagnant since the 2000
census
with a growth rate of 5 from 2000 to 2002 The
may 2004 unemployment rate
for Ohio County was 4
6 which is below the
of

regional average

State average of 5
0

4 and the
5

The year 2004 is anticipated to be steady as tax rates and
assessed value
have stabilized after the last general
property reassessment Assessed values are
now based on market value instead of the
traditional replacement cost

formulas

declared uincobstitutional in 1998 Due to this change many counties
experienced difficulties in the implementation of the new methods resulting in
delayed and or erroneous
distributions of property taxes during 2003

which

were

In addition gaming revenues in 2003 exceeded the
annual amounts of 2001
and 2002 There are actually two causes or reasons for this
increase one Is just a
reflection of timing and the second pertains to Indiana
Legislation specifically HEA
1001 With the implementation of dockside
gaming operations by the casino
located within the City admission tax is calculated based on a
per entry basis versus
a per excursion basis as was the calculation
prior to July 1 2002 This results In a
significant drop In admission tax However HEA 1001 guarantees that the

City will

in future years receive the same amount of admission tax
Base Year Amount that
was received by the City In Fiscal Year
2002 July 1 2001 through June 30 2002
This results In a Special Distribution
following the close of the State Fiscal Year
prior to September 15th which creates a lag or slower rate of admission tax
revenues by the City
In

relation to wagering tax pursuant to HEA 1001
graduated taxes are
casino located in the City The first 33 Million of wagering
tax collected is shared with each
county that does not have a riverboat casino
Twenty Five percent of the remaining wagering tax revenues are disbursed to the
City These revenues are now capped or limited by Base Year Revenue that was
received by the City in Fiscal Year 2002 July 1 2001
through June 30 2002 These
revenues with the concept of Dockside
Gaming should and have come in at
higher amounts which show a quicker rate in receiving wagering tax The

cannot receive a distribution in excess of the Base Year Revenue for wagering
taxes Any amount the City would have received that exceeds the Base Year
Revenue In any state fiscal year is paid into the property tax replacement fund

briefly recoup pursuant to HEA 1001 admission taxes lag but are
supplemented by a special distribution Which is a guarantee of no less admission
tax dollars than was received FY 2002 Wagering taxes are received at a higher rate
on a monthly basis but are capped by the Base Year Revenue with the City
reaching the capped amount early in the calendar year Gaming taxes are the City
s
largest revenue source and appear to be stable going forward and sufficient to
provide operational support for services as well as fund needed capital
improvements for the betterment of the citizens of Rising Sun

Independent Auditors’ Report

The Honorable Gregory A. Ballard
Mayor, City of Indianapolis,
and the City-County Audit Committee
Marion County, Indiana:
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the governmental activities, the business-type activities, each
major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of Marion County, Indiana (a component unit of the Consolidated
City of Indianapolis – Marion County) (County) as of and for the year ended December 31, 2009, which collectively
comprise the County’s basic financial statements as listed in the accompanying table of contents. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the County’s management. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements
based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the
standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of
the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the County’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.
As more fully described in Note 1 to the basic financial statements, the County prepared its financial statements on the
modified cash basis, which is a comprehensive basis of accounting other than U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the respective financial
position–modified cash basis of the governmental activities, the business-type activities, each major fund, and the aggregate
remaining fund information of Marion County, Indiana as of December 31, 2009, and the respective changes in financial
position–modified cash basis thereof for the year then ended, in conformity with the basis of accounting described in Note 1,
except for Note 6 – Additional Pension Disclosures, on which we express no opinion.
The County has not presented Management’s Discussion and Analysis as required supplementary information that U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles have determined is necessary to supplement, although not required to be part of, the
basic financial statements.
In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated October 29, 2010 on our
consideration of the County’s internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain
provisions of laws, regulations, contracts and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is to describe
the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting or compliance and the results of that testing, and not to
provide an opinion on the internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an
audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards and should be considered in assessing the results of our
audit.
The budgetary comparison information on pages 28 and 29; the schedules of funding progress and employer contributions on
pages 30 and 31; and the notes to required supplementary information on pages 32 and 33 are not a required part of the basic
financial statements but are supplementary information required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We have
applied certain limited procedures, which consisted principally of inquiries of management regarding the methods of
measurement and presentation of the required supplementary information. However, we did not audit the information and
express no opinion on it.

KPMG LLP is a Delaware limited liability partnership,
the U.S. member firm of KPMG International Cooperative
(“KPMG International”), a Swiss entity.

Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that collectively comprise the
County’s basic financial statements. The combining and individual fund financial statements and schedules – other
supplementary information on pages 37 through 47, are presented for purposes of additional analysis, and are not a required
part of the basic financial statements. Such information, except the schedules of revenues and expenditures–budget and
actual, on pages 39 through 43 which are unaudited, have been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of
the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, are fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the basic financial
statements taken as a whole on the basis of accounting described in Note 1.
The information presented in the introductory section on pages 1 through 3, is presented for purposes of additional analysis
and is not a required part of the basic financial statements. Such information has not been subjected to the auditing
procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements, and accordingly, we express no opinion on it.

MARION COUNTY, INDIANA
(COMPONENT UNIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS–MARION COUNTY)
NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2009
NOTE 1—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
A. Financial Reporting Entity
Marion County (County) is a unit of local government created by the State of Indiana, governed by the following officials,
each of whom is granted certain independent executive authority under the State Constitution:
County Auditor
County Treas urer
County Co ro ner

County Prosecuto r
County Record er
County Sheriff

County Surveyor
Clerk of the Circuit Court
J udge of the Circuit Court

The legislature of the State of Indiana has provided for certain additional elected officials who are not mentioned in the
Constitution to exercise certain independent executive authority. These are the county assessor and superior court judges.
In accordance with Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement No. 14, The Financial Reporting Entity,
the County is considered a component unit of the Consolidated City of Indianapolis-Marion County. The County and the
Consolidated City share a common executive and legislative body. Otherwise, the County is considered a separate legal
entity, with its elected officials directly and separately (from City officials) responsible for financial independence,
operations, and accountability for fiscal matters.
Based on the criteria established in GASB Statement No. 14, the County has no component units under the current financial
reporting requirements.
The County has an investment in the Indianapolis-Marion County Building Authority (Building Authority); a joint venture
with the City of Indianapolis (City). Because the County shares joint control equally with the City, the County and City retain
an ongoing financial responsibility, information concerning this joint venture is included in Note 9.
B. Government-wide and Fund Financial Statements
The government-wide financial statement (i.e., statement of activities and net assets - modified cash basis) reports
information on all of the nonfiduciary activities of the County. The effect of significant interfund activity has been removed
from these statements. Governmental activities, which normally are supported by taxes and intergovernmental revenues, are
reported separately from business-type activities, which rely to a significant extent on fees and charges for support.
The statement of activities and net assets - modified cash basis demonstrates the degree to which the direct disbursements of
a given function are offset by program receipts. Direct disbursements are those that are clearly identifiable with a specific
function. Program receipts include (1) charges to customers or applicants who purchase, use, or directly benefit from goods,
services, or privileges provided by a given function and (2) grants and contributions that are restricted to meeting the
operational or capital requirements of a particular function. Internally dedicated resources are reported as general receipts
rather than as program receipts. Likewise, general receipts include all taxes and other items not properly included among
program receipts.
Following the government-wide financial statement are separate financial statements for governmental funds, proprietary
funds, and fiduciary funds, even though the latter are excluded from the government-wide financial statement. Major
individual governmental funds and major individual enterprise funds are reported as separate columns in the fund financial
statements. The County has determined that the General and Public Safety Income Tax funds are major governmental funds.
All other governmental funds are reported in one column labeled “Nonmajor Governmental Funds.” The County has one
enterprise fund (business-type activities), the Drug Testing Laboratory fund. This enterprise fund is not considered a major
fund within the fund financial statements. Additionally, the County has one internal service fund (governmental activities)
that accounts for the operations of the Information Services Agency. The County also has two fiduciary fund types: pension
trust funds and agency funds.

(COMPONENT UNIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS–MARION COUNTY)
NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2009
C. Basis of Accounting and Financial Statement Presentation
The government-wide, governmental fund, proprietary fund, and fiduciary fund financial statements are presented using a
modified cash basis of accounting, which is a comprehensive basis of accounting other than U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. Receipts are recorded when received and disbursements are recorded when paid. Investments are
recorded at historical cost. The modified cash basis is referred to as the cash and investment basis throughout the footnotes.
The cash and investment basis of accounting differs from U.S. generally accepted accounting principles in that receipts are
recognized when received in cash rather than when earned and disbursements are recognized when paid rather than when the
liability is incurred.
If the County utilized the basis of accounting recognized as generally accepted, the fund financial statements for
governmental funds would use the modified accrual basis of accounting, while the fund financial statements for proprietary
and fiduciary fund types would use the accrual basis of accounting. The government-wide financial statement would be
presented on the accrual basis of accounting.
The fund financial statements of the County are organized on the basis of funds, each of which is considered a separate
accounting entity with self-balancing accounts that comprise its cash and investment basis assets, fund balances/net assets,
receipts, and disbursements. Governmental resources are allocated to and accounted for in individual funds based upon the
purposes for which they are to be spent and the means by which spending activities are controlled. The various funds are
summarized by type in the basic financial statements. The following fund types are used by the County:
Governmental Fund Types
Governmental funds are those through which most governmental functions are financed. The acquisition, uses, and
balances of the County’s expendable financial resources on the cash and investment basis are accounted for through
governmental funds.
The following are the County’s major governmental funds:
The General Fund is used to account for all receipts and disbursements applicable to the general operations of
governmental agencies of the County, except those required to be accounted for in another fund. All operating
receipts that are not restricted as to use by sources external to the County are recorded in the General Fund.
The Public Safety Income Tax Fund, a special revenue fund, was established to account for public safety
income tax receipts and to be appropriated to and used by public safety related agencies.
The other governmental funds of the County are considered nonmajor. They are special revenue funds, which
account for the proceeds of specific receipts that are restricted to disbursements for specific purposes; debt service
funds, which account for the accumulation of resources for and repayment of general obligation long-term debt
principal, interest, and related costs; and capital projects funds, which account for resources designated to construct
or acquire major capital facilities.
Proprietary Fund Types
Proprietary funds are used to account for activities that are similar to those found in the private sector.
The following are the County’s proprietary fund types:
Enterprise – Enterprise funds are used to account for operations that are financed and operated in a manner
similar to private sector business enterprises – where the intent of the governing body is that the costs of
operations are financed primarily through user charges. An enterprise fund has been established for the Drug
Testing Laboratory fund. The Drug Testing Laboratory fund is used to account for fees collected by the Marion
Superior Court drug testing laboratory.

(Continued)

MARION COUNTY, INDIANA
(COMPONENT UNIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS–MARION COUNTY)
NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2009
Internal Service – Internal service funds are used to account for the financing of goods or services provided by
one department or agency to other departments or agencies of a government or to other governments, on a cost
reimbursement basis. An internal service fund has been established for the County’s Information Services
Agency, which provides information technology services to other agencies of the County and to other
governmental units on a cost reimbursement basis.
Proprietary funds distinguish operating receipts and disbursements from nonoperating items. Operating receipts and
disbursements generally result from providing services and producing and delivering goods in connection with a
proprietary fund’s principal ongoing operation. All disbursements in the enterprise fund are reported as operating
disbursements as they reflect the cost of services and administration. Operating disbursements for the internal
service fund primarily include the cost of services and charges, and administrative disbursements. All receipts and
disbursements not meeting this definition are reported as nonoperating receipts and disbursements.
Fiduciary Fund Types
Fiduciary – Fiduciary funds are used to account for assets held by the County in a trustee capacity or as an agent for
individuals, private organizations or other governmental units. These include pension trust funds and agency funds.
Pension trust funds are accounted for and reported similar to proprietary funds. The pension trust funds account for
the Marion County Law Enforcement Personnel Retirement Plan and the Marion County Law Enforcement
Personnel Dependents and Disability Benefits Plan. Agency funds are custodial in nature and do not present results
of operations. These funds account for the collection, distribution, and escrow of various tax types, fees, and set aside
funding.
When both restricted and unrestricted resources are available for use, it is the County’s policy to use restricted resources first,
then unrestricted resources as they are needed.
D. Cash, Investments, and Cash Equivalents
Investments are stated at cost. Any changes in fair value of investments are reported as realized gains or losses in the year of
the sale of investment as investment earnings or losses.
Cash and cash equivalents are defined as all highly liquid investments including certificates of deposit with an original
maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase.
E. Property Taxes
Property taxes levied for all governmental entities located within Marion County are collected by the Treasurer of Marion
County, Indiana (Treasurer). These taxes are then distributed by the Auditor of Marion County, Indiana (Auditor) to the City
and the other governmental entities at June 30 and December 31 of each year. The City and the other governmental entities
can request advances of their portion of the collected taxes from the Treasurer once the levy and tax rates are certified by the
Indiana Department of Local Government Finance (DLGF). The DLGF typically certifies the levy on or before February 15
of the year following the property tax assessment.
The County’s 2009 property taxes were levied based on assessed valuations determined by the Auditor as of the March 1,
2008 assessed valuations, which were adjusted for estimated appeals, tax credits and deductions. The lien date for the 2009
property taxes was March 1, 2008 (assessment date); the amount of property tax to be collected cannot be measured until the
levy and tax rates are certified in the subsequent year. Taxable property is assessed at 100% of the true tax value. However,
due to continuing issues with assessed valuations, tax bills were delayed in 2008 as well as 2009. In 2009, the first half of the
year 2009 taxes were due and payable to the Treasurer in November 2009. Second half of the year 2009 tax bills were sent to
taxpayers in November 2009 with a due date of February 2010. The 2010 property taxes will return to the normal collection
cycle with first half taxes due May 2010 and second half taxes due November 2010.

F. Capital Assets
Capital assets arising from cash transactions acquired for use in governmental, proprietary fund, or government-wide
operations are accounted for as capital outlay disbursements of the fund upon payment.
G. Debt
Long-term debt
Long-term debt arising from cash transactions are not reported as liabilities in the basic financial statements. The debt
proceeds are reported as other financing sources or general receipts and payments of principal and interest are reported as
disbursements.
County Option Income Tax
The County repaid $9,677,690 of principal and $411,434 of interest for the County Option Income Tax Anticipation Notes
during the year. There are no notes outstanding as of the end of the year.
Welfare Notes payable
The County repaid $16,922,267 of principal and $1,900,223 of interest during the year. There are no notes outstanding as of
the end of 2009.
Tax anticipation warrants
During 2009, tax anticipation warrants were issued on the taxes levied in 2008 and collected in 2009. The City-County
Council authorizes the temporary borrowing pending the receipt of taxes levied and repayment of loans on June 30 and
December 31 of the year borrowed. This procedure assures the County of sufficient funds for operating disbursements
between the property tax distribution dates.

H. Interfund Transactions
In the process of aggregating the financial information for the government-wide statement of activities and net assets –
modified cash basis, some amounts reported as interfund activity and balances in the fund financial statements have been
eliminated or reclassified.
Transfers
Legally authorized transfers are reported as transfers in by the recipient fund and as transfers out by the disbursing
fund.
Interfund Services Provided/Used
Charges or collections for services rendered by one fund for another are recognized as receipts (interfund services
provided) of the recipient fund and disbursements (interfund services used) of the disbursing fund. These transactions
are recorded as interfund services because they would be treated as receipts and disbursements if they involved
organizations external to the County.
Certain internal payments are treated as program receipts, such as internal services provided and used.
Elimination of interfund activity has been made for governmental activities in the government-wide financial statement.
I. Receipts and Disbursements
Program Receipts
In the government-wide financial statement, amounts reported as program receipts include (1) collection of cash from
customers or applicants for goods, services, or privileges provided, and (2) operating grants and contributions. Internally
dedicated resources are reported as general cash receipts rather than program cash receipts. Likewise, general cash receipts
include all taxes.
Operating Receipts and Disbursements
Operating receipts and disbursements for proprietary funds result from providing services.
J. Fund Balance / Net Assets
Government-wide Financial Statement
Equity is classified as net assets and displayed in two components:
Restricted net assets consist of net assets with constraints placed on the use either by (1) external groups such as creditors,
grantors, contributors, or laws and regulations of other governments or (2) law through constitutional provisions or enabling
legislation. Restricted net assets are classified as restricted for capital projects, grantor purposes, and statutory purposes on
the government-wide statement.
Unrestricted net assets - All other net assets that do not meet the definition of “restricted.”
Fund Financial Statements
Governmental fund equity is classified as fund balance. Proprietary fund equity is classified the same as in the
government-wide statement.

(COMPONENT UNIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS–MARION COUNTY)
NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2009
K. Pensions
The County has separate defined benefit pension plans that cover substantially all employees. The Indiana Public Employees’
Retirement Fund (PERF), administered by the State of Indiana, applies to County employees. The Marion County Law
Enforcement Personnel Retirement Plan (Retirement Plan) and the Marion County Law Enforcement Personnel Dependents
and Disability Benefits Plan (Disability Plan) cover employees of the Sheriff’s Department. The policy of the County is to
fund accrued pension costs for the plans.
The Retirement and Disability Plans are accounted for under the cash and investment basis of accounting as pension trust
funds of the County. Employee and employer contributions are recognized as receipts in the period received, pursuant to final
commitments, as well as statutory or contractual requirements; and disbursements, including benefits paid and refunds, are
recorded when the corresponding payments are made. Investments are recorded at cost.
NOTE 2—STEWARDSHIP, COMPLIANCE, AND ACCOUNTABILITY
Annual budgets are adopted on a budgetary basis. All annual appropriations lapse at the end of the calendar year, except for
capital project funds, which are budgeted on a project basis.
Prior to the first required publication, the Mayor submits to the City-County Council a proposed operating budget for the year
commencing the following January 1st. Prior to adoption, the budget is advertised and public hearings are conducted by the
City-County Council to obtain taxpayer comments. In September of each year, the City-County Council, through the passage
of a resolution/ordinance, approves the budget for the next year. The budget becomes legally certified after approval from the
DLGF.
Revisions to transfer appropriations between agencies or character of expenditure require approval of the City-County
Council. Revisions to increase the appropriations for tax supported funds require approval of the City-County Council and
the DLGF.
NOTE 3—CASH AND INVESTMENTS
A summary of all cash and investments on the financial statements at December 31, 2009 is as follows:

Investment Policy - Primary Government (excluding Sheriff’s Department Personnel Retirement and Disability Benefit
Plans)
Investments are recorded at cost. It is the policy of the County to invest public funds in a manner that will provide the highest
investment return with the maximum security while meeting the daily cash flow demands of the County and conforming to
all state/local statutes governing the investment of public funds.
The primary objectives, in priority order, of the County’s investment activities are:
Safety: Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments of the County shall be
undertaken in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the overall portfolio. To attain this objective,
diversification is required in order that potential losses on individual securities do not exceed the income generated from the
remainder of the portfolio.
Liquidity: The County’s investment portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable the County to meet all operating
requirements that might be reasonably anticipated.

MARION COUNTY, INDIANA
(COMPONENT UNIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS–MARION COUNTY)
NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2009
Return on Investments: The County’s investment portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a rate of return
throughout budgetary and economic cycles, commensurate with the County’s investment risk constraints and the cash flow
characteristics of the portfolio.
State statutes authorize the County to invest in certificates of deposit, obligations of the U.S. government and U.S.
government agencies, and repurchase agreements. The statutes further require that repurchase agreements must be
collateralized at 100% of market value on the day of trade by U.S. government or U.S. government agency obligations. These
investments are required by statute to have a stated final maturity of no more than two years.
Investment Policy - Sheriff’s Department Personnel Retirement and Disability Benefit Plans
The primary objectives for the Sheriff’s Retirement and Disability Benefit Plans’ investment activities shall be:
Time Horizon: Investment guidelines are based upon an investment horizon of greater than five years.
Risk Tolerances: To achieve the plans’ long-term objectives, the following factors were considered when establishing the
risk tolerance.
1. The plans’ financial condition.
2. Liquidity reserves are established, and any remaining assets are fully invested at all times.
3. The Marion County Sheriff’s Pension Board (Board) has set a shortfall constraint that current plans’ assets must be equal
to 90% of the annual benefit obligation.
Performance Expectations: The desired investment objective is a long-term rate of return on assets that is at least 8.00%.
Additionally, it is expected the return will be at least 4.75% greater than the anticipated rate of inflation as measured by the
Consumer Price Index.
Asset Allocation Constraints: The Board has reviewed the long-term performance characteristics of various asset classes,
focusing on balancing risks and rewards and has selected the following asset classes for allowable investments:
1.

Domestic large capitalization equities

2.

Domestic small capitalization equities

3.

International equities

4.

Domestic fixed income

5.

Cash equivalents

Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of investments will be adversely affected by a change in interest rates. The
County’s investment policy provides that the County seeks to minimize the risk that the fair value of securities in its portfolio
will decrease due to changes in general interest rates by structuring the investment portfolio so that securities mature to meet
cash requirements for ongoing operations, thereby avoiding the need to sell securities on the open market prior to maturity.

Credit Risk
Credit risk is the risk that an issuer or other counterparty to an investment will not fulfill its obligations. Credit risk is
measured using credit quality ratings of investments in debt securities as described by nationally recognized rating agencies
such as Moody’s Investor Services. The County uses the highest integrity when choosing an instrument of investment. The
County keeps its credit risk as it pertains to investments at a low rate by requiring all investments of the County, which are
rated, to be rated in the three highest ratings categories by Moody’s Investor Service, Standard & Poor’s Corporation, or
Fitch’s Ratings Service. Investments were rated as follows by Moody’s Investors Service, Standard & Poor’s Corporation, or

certificates of deposit exceed treasury bills of comparable maturity duration. The County has investments of certificates of
deposits at December 31, 2009 in the amount of $3,000,000, which represents approximately 0.9% of total cash and
investments and is included in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2009.

NOTE 5—PENSIONS
The County maintains two benefit plans for law enforcement personnel, which are reported as pension trust funds.
Additionally, the County contributes to the statewide Indiana Public Employees Retirement Fund (PERF).
A. Plan Description
Marion County Law Enforcement Personnel Retirement Plan
The Retirement Plan is a single-employer contributory defined benefit retirement plan covering certain employees of the
Marion County Sheriff’s Department other than those deputies that are employed by the Civil Sheriff. The Retirement Plan is
administered in accordance with state statutes, which instructs the County to make minimum contributions necessary to keep
the plan sound on an actuarial basis according to state law. The Retirement Plan provides that each employee contributes
4.25% of their earnings to the plan, which is maintained in a reserve for member contributions and accumulates at a rate of
3.00% compounded annually. Contributions required of the employee may cease, at the election of the employee, following
the completion of 20 years or more of credited service and prior to termination of employment.
Retirement Plan benefits begin to vest after 10 years of service. As of December 31, 2009, there are 90 fully vested
employees (over 20 years of service), 105 partially vested (between 10 and 20 years of services), and 132 nonvested
employees. Law enforcement employees who retire at or after age 55 with 10 years of credited services are entitled to an
annual retirement benefit, payable monthly for life, in an amount equal to 2.50% of the highest monthly average of
consecutive five-year salary per year of service up to a maximum of 20 years; plus 2.00% of such salary per year of service in
excess of 20 years, if any, up to an additional 12 years; plus $1 for each year of service up to a maximum of $20. Full
benefits do not commence before attainment of age 50; however, employees with 20 years of service can elect earlier benefits
at a reduced rate. As of December 31, 2009, there are 320 retirees and beneficiaries receiving benefits, 5 terminated members
entitled to benefits but not yet receiving benefits, and 327 current active members.
Although it has not expressed any intent to do so, the County has the right to discontinue its contributions to the Retirement
Plan at any time. Doing so in three consecutive years terminates the plan. In the event of plan termination, participants are
entitled to their amount of contributions and a proportionate amount of any excess after certain benefits and expenses.
The County does not issue a separate financial report for this plan, which is included as a pension trust fund in this report.
Marion County Law Enforcement Personnel Dependents and Disability Benefits Plan
The Disability Plan is a single-employer defined benefit plan covering all participants in the Retirement Plan. The Disability
Plan provides benefits to the beneficiaries of disabled employees and payments of pensions to dependent parents, surviving
spouses, and dependent children under age 18 for deceased employees. This plan is accounted for in a single fund in
accordance with state statutes, which require the County to make minimum contributions necessary to keep the Disability
Plan sound on an actuarial basis. At December 31, 2009, there are 83 benefit recipients and no vested employees.
During 1997, the County conducted a cost of living actuarial study. As a result of this study, the Council adopted general
ordinance number 162-97, which amended the plan to include cost of living adjustments. Effective January 1, 1998, and each
year thereafter, all participants in payment status (both current and future) are eligible for a cost of living increase. Benefit
increases are not available to terminated vested participants or the beneficiaries of participants. Applicable increases, if any,
may be payable on the July 1 following the later of retirement date or attaining of age 55. The amount of the annual increase,
if any, will depend on the change in the Consumer Price Index and will never exceed 2.00%.
The County does not issue a separate financial report for this plan, which is included as a pension trust fund in this report.
PERF
PERF is an agent multiple-employer public employee retirement system that acts as a common investment and administrative
agent for state employees and employees of participating political subdivisions of the State of Indiana, in accordance with
Indiana Codes 5-10.2 and 5-10.3.
PERF provides a contributory defined benefit plan. Substantially all County employees are covered by the plan except those
covered by the Retirement and Disability Plans. The County pays the employee contribution portion, 3.00% of annual salary,

which is mandated by state statute, in addition to the employer contribution amount, which is actuarially determined and is
currently 5.75% of annual covered payroll.
PERF retirement benefits vest after 10 years of service. Under the defined benefit component, County employees who retire
at or after age 65 with 10 or more years of creditable service; age 60 with 15 or more years creditable service; or if the sum of
age and creditable service is greater than or equal to 85 (but not earlier than age 55) are entitled to an annual retirement
benefit, payable monthly for life with 60 months guaranteed. Employees who have reached 50 years of age and have 15 years
of credited service will qualify for early retirement with reduced benefits. PERF also provides death and disability benefits.
These benefit provisions and all other requirements are established by state statute and county ordinance.
PERF issues a publicly available financial report that includes financial statements and required supplementary information.
That report may be obtained by writing to PERF, Harrison Building, Suite 800, 143 West Market Street, Indianapolis, IN
46204.
B. Funding Policy
The County is obligated by state law to make all required contributions to the Retirement and Disability Plans based upon an
annual actuarial valuation. The required contributions are actuarially determined. The costs of administering the plan are
financed through plan assets. There are no long-term contracts for contributions to the plan. For PERF, the County pays the
employee contribution portion, 3.00% of annual salary, which is mandated by state statute, in addition to the employer
contribution amount, which is actuarially determined and is 5.75% as of January 1, 2009.
The annual required contribution and actual contribution made for each plan is as follows for the year ended December 31,

*Funded status for the Disability Plan was calculated using the aggregate actuarial cost method.

The projection of future benefit payments for an ongoing plan involves estimates of the value of reported amounts and
assumptions about the probability of occurrence of events far into the future. Examples include assumptions about future
employment, mortality, and the healthcare cost trend. Amounts determined regarding the funded status of the plan and the
annual required contributions of the employer are subject to continual revision as actual results are compared with past
expectations and new estimates are made about the future. The schedule of funding progress, presented as required
supplementary information following the notes to the financial statements, presents multi-year trend information.
NOTE 7—RISK MANAGEMENT
The County is exposed to various risks of loss related to torts; theft of, damage to, and destruction of assets; errors and
omissions; injuries to employees; and natural disasters. The County is self-insured for vehicle, workers’ compensation, and
general liability. Additionally, the County purchases commercial insurance for claims for all other risks of loss. Settled
claims have not exceeded the insurance coverage in any of the past four years. Due to the cash and investment basis of
accounting, unpaid claims are not recorded within the accompanying financial statements.
NOTE 8—DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN
Employees of Marion County are eligible to participate in a deferred compensation plan adopted under the provisions of
Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 457 (Deferred Compensation Plans with Respect to Service for State and Local
Governments). The deferred compensation plan is available to all employees of the County. Under this plan, employees may
elect to defer a portion of their salaries and avoid paying taxes on the deferred portion until the withdrawal date. The deferred
compensation amount is not available for withdrawal by employees until termination, retirement, death, or unforeseeable
emergency. During 1997, the deferred compensation plan was amended to comply with the amendments to Section 457 of the
IRC. Plan provisions were amended so that plan assets are held in trust by an independent trustee for the exclusive benefit of
participants and their beneficiaries and are not included within the accompanying financial statements.

NOTE 9—JOINT VENTURE
The Building Authority is a joint venture of the County and the City. The Building Authority finances, acquires, constructs,
improves, renovates, equips, operates, maintains, and manages lands, governmental buildings, and communication systems
for governmental entities in Marion County. The Building Authority has no stockholders nor equity holders, and all bond and
note loan proceeds, rentals, and other revenues must be disbursed for specific purposes in accordance with provisions of
Indiana Code 36-9-13 et seq. and several trust indentures and loan agreements executed for the security of the holders of the
bonds and notes.
The buildings are financed through the Building Authority’s general obligation debt, which is repaid from rent received under
long-term lease agreements with the County and City. All of the leases contain lease renewals and purchase options. If these
options are not exercised, the leases provide for transfer, upon expiration of the lease, of ownership of the properties to the
lessees free and clear of all obligations of the lease. The governing Indiana statute with respect to each of the Building
Authority’s leases provides that the government lessee(s) shall be obligated to levy annually a tax sufficient to produce each
year the necessary funds to pay the lease rentals to the Building Authority. These leases provide for sufficient rent to service
the debt and provide for operating costs.
The County’s share of the joint venture consists primarily of an allocation determined by the amount of space utilized by
County agencies in the City-County Building and nearby parking lot determined by floor space, 100% of the Marion County
Jail and Jail II, the Marion County Juvenile Detention Center, and the Marion County Sheriff’s Roll Call Site. The
City-County Building is an office building that houses the majority of the operations of the County and City. The City’s share
of the joint venture consists primarily of an allocation determined by the amount of space utilized by City departments in the
City-County Building and parking lot, 100% of the Municipal Garage, Belmont Garage, the Public Safety Training Academy,
and Public Safety Properties. The Environment Control Services Building is leased to other units of government and private
parties. Public Safety Communications System operating costs are paid by the County agency Metropolitan Emergency
Communication Agency.
The Building Authority has five members on the Board of Trustees, two of whom are appointed by the City-County Council
of the Consolidated City of Indianapolis-Marion County, one by the Mayor of the City in his capacity as the municipal
executive of Indianapolis, one by the Mayor of the City in his capacity as the chief executive of the County, and one by the
Marion County Board of Commissioners. The Trustees appoint the five members of the Board of Directors, which is the
governing body of the Building Authority. The Building Authority is subject to the budgetary authority of the City-County
Council, which equally represents the County and the City.
The Building Authority has various long-term debt obligations, which are secured by the rent payments received from the
County and City. During 2009, the County paid $3,581,000 and $6,748,483 in rent and maintenance, respectively. A copy of
the separately issued financial statements of the Building Authority, which is prepared on a basis other than U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles, is available upon request.
NOTE 10—RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS
The legislative body of the County is the same in several respects as that of the City, and the position of chief executive is
held by the Mayor of the City. The County provides certain information technology and telephone services to the City.
Receipts from these services were $16,548,889 in 2009. In 2009, the County received $326,551 of 911 dispatch fees from the
City.
The City and County purchase certain insurance policies that cover risks of both entities. The City and County pay premiums
associated with their own respective portions of the coverage. The City provides certain administrative services to the
County, including purchasing, legal, and other general administration. The City funds such services through a countywide tax
levy. The County does not compensate the City for these services, except for legal services. Conversely, the County provides,
at no compensation, criminal, civil, juvenile, and probate court services to all municipalities and unincorporated areas in
Marion County, administers the property tax administration and collection system for the same jurisdictions, and operates the
County jail and lockup.
The County acted as either a subrecipient or a pass-through agent for various state and federal grant programs with the City
during 2009.

NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2009
In 2006, Marion County entered into various contracts with Health and Hospital Corporation of Marion County (HHC).
HHC is a separate municipal corporation and is considered to be a component unit of the Consolidated City of IndianapolisMarion County. HHC has its own governing board separate from the County’s legislative body. HHC has within it the
division of public health and the division of public hospitals. HHC provides medical care to the inmates of the Marion
County Jail through its division of public hospitals via a contract with the Marion County Sheriff’s Department. In 2009, the
cost of medical care provided to inmates for Marion County was $2,319,237. Additionally, in 2009, the County made
$1,550,364 in mental health distributions to HHC as allowed by law.
NOTE 11—COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
In 2009, Indiana law limits the liability of municipalities to $700,000 per person and $5,000,000 per occurrence.
The County participates in a number of federal and state financial assistance programs. These programs are subject to
financial and compliance audits by federal agencies. The amount, if any, of disbursements that may be disallowed by the
granting agencies cannot be determined at this time, although the County expects such amounts, if any, to be immaterial.
NOTE 12—DEFICIT FUND BALANCES
At December 31, 2009, the following nonmajor governmental and enterprise funds had a deficit fund balance/net assets:
Nonmajor Capital Projects Funds
Public Safety Capital Projects

$

(74,526)

Nonmajor Special Revenue Fund
Supplemental Public Defender Fee
Federal Stimulus

(211,650)

Enterprise

$

(63,518)

The County intends to reduce the deficit in the Drug Testing Laboratory fund by increasing charges for services accounted for in
the fund. The deficit in the Public Safety Capital Projects and Supplemental Public Defender Fee will be covered by the fees
collected from the General Fund. The deficit for the Federal Stimulus fund will be covered by future grant reimbursements.
NOTE 13—SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
A. Property Tax Assessment
In 2007, the Governor ordered a state-wide reassessment. Due to this reassessment the 2008 billing was delayed which then
delayed the 2009 billing. The first half 2009 taxes were due and payable to the Treasurer in November 2009. Second half
2009 tax bills were sent to taxpayers in November 2009 with a due date of February 2010. These property tax delays caused
the County to collect less receipts than budgeted and the County utilized short-term borrowing using tax anticipation warrants
to supplement the lower than expected receipts. These tax warrants were fully repaid by the financial statement issuance date
(see Note 13.B below).

*Information required for only most recent actuarial valuation and the two preceding valuations.
**Funded status for the Disability Plan was calculated using the aggregate actuarial cost method.
Analysis of the dollar amounts of net assets available for benefits, actuarial accrued liability, and excess of actuarial accrued
liability (assets in excess of actuarial accrued liability) in isolation can be misleading. Expressing the net assets available for
benefits as a percentage of the actuarial accrued liability provides one indication of the County's funding status on a
going-concern basis. Analysis of this percentage over time indicates whether the plan is becoming financially stronger or
weaker. Generally, the greater this percentage, the stronger the plan. Trends in funding status and annual covered payroll are
both affected by inflation. Expressing the funding status as a percentage of annual covered payroll approximately adjusts for
the effects of inflation and aids analysis of the County's progress made in accumulating sufficient assets to pay benefits when
due. Generally, the higher this percentage, the stronger the plan.

Budgets, detailed to the agency (i.e., department) and character level, are adopted for all governmental funds except Clerk’s
Title IV-D Incentive (Special Revenue Fund), Sheriff Commissary (Special Revenue Fund), Prosecutor’s Title IV-D
Incentive (Special Revenue Fund), which are not legally required to do so. Campaign Finance Fines (Special Revenue Fund),
Section 102 HAVA Reimbursement (Special Revenue Fund), County Sinking (Debt Service Fund), Capital Improvement
Sinking (Debt Service Fund), Public Safety Interest Escrow (Capital Projects Fund), Drug Treatment Diversion (Special
Revenue Fund), and Public Safety Capital Projects (Capital Projects Fund) were not budgeted during 2009 due to no

and approved at the five object levels of expenditure (personal services, supplies, other services and charges, capital outlay,
and internal charges).
A separate budgetary report has been prepared, which is detailed to the agency and character level and is available upon
request. The budgetary basis of accounting is essentially the cash basis with the exception of revenues received in the current
year but budgeted for in a prior year and that encumbrances and certain accounts payable are treated as expenditures.
The timetable for the budgetary process is as follows:
June 1
July 1
August
August
September
December
January 1

Office of Finance and Management provides guidelines to County agencies
County officials submit budgets
County Chief Executive recommends budget to City-County Council
Council committees review/amend budgets based on public testimony
Council approves budget by last meeting of September
State of Indiana, Department of Local Government Finance
reviews/adjusts and gives final approval to budget
Budget becomes effective

Revisions to transfer appropriations between agencies or character of expenditure require approval of the City-County
Council. Revisions to increase the appropriations require approval of the City-County Council and if the increased
appropriation occurs in a fund that has a tax rate, then the DLGF also must approve the increase.

Independent Auditors’ Report

The Honorable Gregory A. Ballard
Mayor, City of Indianapolis and
The City – County Audit Committee
Marion County, Indiana:
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the governmental activities, the business-type activities, each
major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of Marion County, Indiana (a component unit of the Consolidated
City of Indianapolis – Marion County) (County) as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010, which collectively
comprise the County’s basic financial statements as listed in the accompanying table of contents. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the County’s management. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements
based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the
standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of
the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the County’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An
audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.
As more fully described in note 1 to the basic financial statements, the County prepared its financial statements on the
modified cash basis, which is a comprehensive basis of accounting other than U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the respective financial
position–modified cash basis of the governmental activities, the business-type activities, each major fund, and the aggregate
remaining fund information of Marion County, Indiana as of December 31, 2010, and the respective changes in financial
position–modified cash basis thereof for the year then ended, in conformity with the basis of accounting described in note 1,
except for note 6 – Additional Pension Disclosures, on which we express no opinion.
The County has not presented Management’s Discussion and Analysis as required supplementary information that U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles have determined is necessary to supplement, although not required to be part of, the
basic financial statements.
In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated October 20, 2011 on our
consideration of the County’s internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain
provisions of laws, regulations, contracts and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is to describe the
scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting or compliance and the results of that testing, and not to
provide an opinion on the internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit
performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards and should be considered in assessing the results of our audit.
The budgetary comparison information on page 28; the schedules of funding progress and employer contributions on
pages 29 and 30; and the notes to required supplementary information on pages 31 and 32 are not a required part of the basic
financial statements but are supplementary information required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We have
applied certain limited procedures, which consisted principally of inquiries of management regarding the methods of
measurement and presentation of the required supplementary information. However, we did not audit the information and
express no opinion on it.

KPMG LLP is a Delaware limited liability partnership,
the U.S. member firm of KPMG International Cooperative
(“KPMG International”), a Swiss entity.

Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that collectively comprise the
County’s basic financial statements. The combining and individual fund financial statements and schedules – other
supplementary information on pages 36 through 49, are presented for purposes of additional analysis, and are not a required
part of the basic financial statements. Such information, except the schedules of receipts and disbursements – budget and
actual, on pages 38 through 42 and 45, which are unaudited, have been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the
audit of the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, are fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole on the basis of accounting described in Note 1.
The information presented in the introductory section on pages 1 through 3, is presented for purposes of additional analysis
and is not a required part of the basic financial statements. Such information has not been subjected to the auditing
procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements, and accordingly, we express no opinion on it.

Consolidated City share a common executive and legislative body. Otherwise, the County is considered a separate legal
entity, with its elected officials directly and separately (from City officials) responsible for financial independence,
operations, and accountability for fiscal matters.
Based on the criteria established in GASB Statement No. 14, the County has no component units under the current financial
reporting requirements.
The County has an investment in the Indianapolis - Marion County Building Authority (Building Authority); a joint venture
with the City of Indianapolis (City). Because the County shares joint control equally with the City, the County and City retain
an ongoing financial responsibility, information concerning this joint venture is included in note 9.
B. Government-wide and Fund Financial Statements
The government-wide financial statement (i.e., statement of activities and net assets - modified cash basis) reports
information on all of the nonfiduciary activities of the County. The effect of significant interfund activity has been removed
from these statements. Governmental activities, which normally are supported by taxes and intergovernmental revenues, are
reported separately from business-type activities, which rely to a significant extent on fees and charges for support.
The statement of activities and net assets - modified cash basis demonstrates the degree to which the direct disbursements of
a given function are offset by program receipts. Direct disbursements are those that are clearly identifiable with a specific
function. Program receipts include (1) charges to customers or applicants who purchase, use, or directly benefit from goods,
services, or privileges provided by a given function and (2) grants and contributions that are restricted to meeting the
operational or capital requirements of a particular function. Internally dedicated resources are reported as general receipts
rather than as program receipts. Likewise, general receipts include all taxes and other items not properly included among
program receipts.
Following the government-wide financial statement are separate financial statements for governmental funds, proprietary
funds, and fiduciary funds, even though the latter are excluded from the government-wide financial statement. Major
individual governmental funds and major individual enterprise funds are reported as separate columns in the fund financial
statements. The County has determined that the General Fund is a major governmental fund. All other governmental funds
are reported in one column labeled “Nonmajor Governmental Funds.” The County has one enterprise fund (business-type
activities), the Drug Testing Laboratory Fund. This enterprise fund is not considered a major fund within the fund financial
statements. Additionally, the County has one internal service fund (governmental activities) that accounts for the operations
of the Information Services Agency. The County also has two fiduciary fund types: pension trust funds and agency funds.

C. Basis of Accounting and Financial Statement Presentation
The government-wide, governmental fund, proprietary fund, and fiduciary fund financial statements are presented using a
modified cash basis of accounting, which is a comprehensive basis of accounting other than U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. Receipts are recorded when received and disbursements are recorded when paid. Investments are
recorded at historical cost.
The cash and investment basis of accounting differs from U.S. generally accepted accounting principles in that receipts are
recognized when received in cash rather than when earned and disbursements are recognized when paid rather than when the
liability is incurred.
If the County utilized the basis of accounting recognized as generally accepted, the fund financial statements for
governmental funds would use the modified accrual basis of accounting, while the fund financial statements for proprietary
and fiduciary fund types would use the accrual basis of accounting. The government-wide financial statement would be
presented on the accrual basis of accounting.
The fund financial statements of the County are organized on the basis of funds, each of which is considered a separate
accounting entity with self-balancing accounts that comprise its cash and investment basis assets, fund balances/net assets,
receipts, and disbursements. Governmental resources are allocated to and accounted for in individual funds based upon the
purposes for which they are to be spent and the means by which spending activities are controlled. The various funds are
summarized by type in the basic financial statements. The following fund types are used by the County:
Governmental Fund Types
Governmental funds are those through which most governmental functions are financed. The acquisition, uses, and
balances of the County’s expendable financial resources on the cash and investment basis are accounted for through
governmental funds.
The following are the County’s major governmental funds:
The General Fund is used to account for all receipts and disbursements applicable to the general operations of
governmental agencies of the County, except those required to be accounted for in another fund. All operating
receipts that are not restricted as to use by sources external to the County are recorded in the General Fund.
The other governmental funds of the County are considered nonmajor. They are special revenue funds, which
account for the proceeds of specific receipts that are restricted to disbursements for specific purposes; debt service
funds, which account for the accumulation of resources for and repayment of, general obligation long-term debt
principal, interest, and related costs; and capital projects funds, which account for resources designated to construct
or acquire major capital facilities.
Proprietary Fund Types
Proprietary funds are used to account for activities that are similar to those found in the private sector.
The following are the County’s proprietary fund types:
Enterprise – Enterprise funds are used to account for operations that are financed and operated in a manner
similar to private sector business enterprises – where the intent of the governing body is that the costs of
operations are financed primarily through user charges. An enterprise fund has been established for the Drug
Testing Laboratory Fund. The Drug Testing Laboratory Fund is used to account for fees collected by the
Marion Superior Court drug testing laboratory.

NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2010

Internal Service – Internal service funds are used to account for the financing of goods or services provided by
one department or agency to other departments or agencies of a government, or to other governments, on a cost
reimbursement basis. An internal service fund has been established for the County’s Information Services
Agency, which provides information technology services to other agencies of the County, or to other
governmental units on a cost reimbursement basis.
Proprietary funds distinguish operating receipts and disbursements from nonoperating items. Operating receipts and
disbursements generally result from providing services and producing and delivering goods in connection with a
proprietary fund’s principal ongoing operation. All disbursements in the enterprise fund are reported as operating
disbursements as they reflect the cost of services and administration. Operating disbursements for the internal
service fund primarily include the cost of services and charges and administrative disbursements. All receipts and
disbursements not meeting this definition are reported as nonoperating receipts and disbursements.
Fiduciary Fund Types
Fiduciary – Fiduciary funds are used to account for assets held by the County in a trustee capacity or as an agent for
individuals, private organizations, or other governmental units. These include pension trust funds and agency funds.
Pension trust funds are accounted for and reported similar to proprietary funds. The pension trust funds account for
the Marion County Law Enforcement Personnel Retirement Plan and the Marion County Law Enforcement
Personnel Dependents and Disability Benefits Plan. Agency funds are custodial in nature and do not present results
of operations. These funds account for the collection, distribution, and escrow of various tax types, fees, and set aside
funding.
When both restricted and unrestricted resources are available for use, it is the County’s policy to use restricted resources first,
then unrestricted resources as they are needed.
D. Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments
Investments are stated at cost. Any changes in the fair value of investments are reported as realized gains or losses in the year
of the sale of the investment as investment earnings or losses.
Cash and cash equivalents are defined as all highly liquid investments including certificates of deposit with an original
maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase.
E. Property Taxes
Property taxes levied for all governmental entities located within Marion County are collected by the Treasurer of Marion
County, Indiana (Treasurer). These taxes are then distributed by the Auditor of Marion County, Indiana (Auditor) to the City
and the other governmental entities at June 30 and December 31 of each year. The City and the other governmental entities
can request advances of their portion of the collected taxes from the Treasurer once the levy and tax rates are certified by the
Indiana Department of Local Government Finance. The Indiana Department of Local Government Finance typically certifies
the levy on or before February 15 of the year following the property tax assessment.
The County’s 2010 property taxes were levied based on assessed valuations determined by the Auditor as of the March 1,
2009 assessed valuations, which were adjusted for estimated appeals, tax credits, and deductions. The lien date for the 2010
property taxes was March 1, 2009 (assessment date); the amount of property tax to be collected cannot be measured until the
levy and tax rates are certified in the subsequent year. Taxable property is assessed at 100% of the true tax value. In 2010,
first half of the year 2010 taxes were due and payable to the Treasurer in May 2010. Second half of the year 2010 taxes were
due and payable to the Treasurer in November 2010.

F. Capital Assets
Capital assets arising from cash transactions acquired for use in governmental, proprietary fund, or government-wide
operations are accounted for as capital outlay disbursements of the fund upon payment.
G. Debt
Tax Anticipation Warrants
During 2009, tax anticipation warrants were issued on the taxes levied in 2008 and collected in 2009. The City-County
Council authorizes the temporary borrowing pending the receipt of taxes levied and repayment of loans on June 30 and
December 31 of the year borrowed. This procedure assures the County of sufficient funds for operating disbursements
between the property tax distribution dates. No such tax anticipation warrants were issued in 2010.

H. Interfund Transactions
In the process of aggregating the financial information for the government-wide statement of activities and net assets –
modified cash basis, some amounts reported as interfund activity and balances in the fund financial statements have been
eliminated or reclassified.
Transfers
Legally authorized transfers are reported as transfers in by the recipient fund and as transfers out by the disbursing
fund.
Interfund Services Provided/Used
Charges or collections for services rendered by one fund for another are recognized as receipts (interfund services
provided) of the recipient fund and disbursements (interfund services used) of the disbursing fund. These transactions
are recorded as interfund services because they would be treated as receipts and disbursements if they involved
organizations external to the County.
Certain internal payments are treated as program receipts, such as internal services provided and used.
Elimination of interfund activity has been made for governmental activities in the government-wide financial statement.
I. Receipts and Disbursements
Program Receipts
In the government-wide financial statement, amounts reported as program receipts include (1) collection of cash from
customers or applicants for goods, services, or privileges provided and (2) operating grants and contributions. Internally
dedicated resources are reported as general cash receipts rather than program cash receipts. Likewise, general cash receipts
include all taxes.

Operating Receipts and Disbursements
Operating receipts and disbursements for proprietary funds result from providing services.
J. Fund Balance / Net Assets
Government-wide Financial Statement
Equity is classified as net assets and displayed in two components:
Restricted net assets consist of net assets with constraints placed on the use either by (1) external groups such as creditors,
grantors, contributors, or laws and regulations of other governments or (2) law through constitutional provisions or enabling
legislation. Restricted net assets are classified as restricted for capital projects, grantor purposes, debt service, and statutory
purposes on the government-wide financial statement.
Unrestricted net assets - All other net assets that do not meet the definition of “restricted.”
Fund Financial Statements
Governmental fund equity is classified as fund balance. Proprietary fund equity is classified the same as in the
government-wide financial statement.
K. Pensions
The County has separate defined benefit pension plans that cover substantially all employees. The Indiana Public Employees’
Retirement Fund (PERF), administered by the State of Indiana, applies to County employees. The Marion County Law
Enforcement Personnel Retirement Plan (Retirement Plan) and the Marion County Law Enforcement Personnel Dependents
and Disability Benefits Plan (Disability Plan) cover employees of the Sheriff’s Department. The policy of the County is to
fund accrued pension costs for the plans.
The Retirement and Disability Plans are accounted for under the cash and investment basis of accounting as pension trust
funds of the County. Employee and employer contributions are recognized as receipts in the period received, pursuant to final
commitments, as well as statutory or contractual requirements; and disbursements, including benefits paid and refunds, are
recorded when the corresponding payments are made. Investments are recorded at cost.

NOTE 2—STEWARDSHIP, COMPLIANCE, AND ACCOUNTABILITY
Annual budgets are adopted on a budgetary basis. All annual appropriations lapse at the end of the calendar year, except for
capital project funds, which are budgeted on a project basis.
Prior to the first required publication, the Mayor submits to the City-County Council a proposed operating budget for the year
commencing the following January 1. Prior to adoption, the budget is advertised and public hearings are conducted by the
City-County Council to obtain taxpayer comments. In September of each year, the City-County Council, through the passage
of a resolution/ordinance, approves the budget for the next year. The budget becomes legally certified after approval from the
State of Indiana Department of Local Government Finance.
Revisions to transfer appropriations between agencies or character of expenditure require approval of the City-County
Council. Revisions to increase the appropriations for tax-supported funds require approval of the City-County Council and
the State of Indiana Department of Local Government Finance.

Investment Policy - Primary Government (excluding Sheriff’s Department Personnel Retirement and Disability Benefit
Plans)
Investments are recorded at cost. It is the policy of the County to invest public funds in a manner that will provide the highest
investment return with the maximum security while meeting the daily cash flow demands of the County and conforming to
all state/local statutes governing the investment of public funds.
The primary objectives, in priority order, of the County’s investment activities are as follows:
Safety: Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments of the County shall be
undertaken in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the overall portfolio. To attain this objective,
diversification is required in order that potential losses on individual securities do not exceed the income generated from the
remainder of the portfolio.
Liquidity: The County’s investment portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable the County to meet all operating
requirements that might be reasonably anticipated.
Return on Investments: The County’s investment portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a rate of return
throughout budgetary and economic cycles, commensurate with the County’s investment risk constraints and the cash flow
characteristics of the portfolio.
State statutes authorize the County to invest in certificates of deposit, obligations of the U.S. government and U.S.
government agencies, and repurchase agreements. The statutes further require that repurchase agreements must be

collateralized at 100% of market value on the day of trade by U.S. government or U.S. government agency obligations. These
investments are required by statute to have a stated final maturity of no more than two years.
Investment Policy - Sheriff’s Department Personnel Retirement and Disability Benefit Plans
The primary objectives for the Sheriff’s Department Retirement and Disability Benefit Plans’ investment activities shall be
the following:
Time Horizon: Investment guidelines are based upon an investment horizon of greater than five years.
Risk Tolerances: To achieve the plans’ long-term objectives, the following factors were considered when establishing the
risk tolerance.
1. The Plans’ financial condition.
2. Liquidity reserves are established, and any remaining assets are fully invested at all times.
3. The Marion County Sheriff’s Pension Board (Board) has set a shortfall constraint that current plans’ assets must be equal
to 90% of the annual benefit obligation.
Performance Expectations: The desired investment objective is a long-term rate of return on assets that is at least 8.00%.
Additionally, it is expected the return will be at least 4.75% greater than the anticipated rate of inflation as measured by the
Consumer Price Index.
Asset Allocation Constraints: The Board has reviewed the long-term performance characteristics of various asset classes,
focusing on balancing risks and rewards and has selected the following asset classes for allowable investments:
1.

Domestic large-capitalization equities

2.

Domestic small-capitalization equities

3.

International equities

4.

Domestic fixed income

5.

Cash equivalents

Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of investments will be adversely affected by a change in interest rates. The
County’s investment policy provides that the County seeks to minimize the risk that the fair value of securities in its portfolio
will decrease due to changes in general interest rates by structuring the investment portfolio so that securities mature to meet
cash requirements for ongoing operations, thereby avoiding the need to sell securities on the open market prior to maturity.

NOTE 5—PENSIONS
The County maintains two benefit plans for law enforcement personnel, which are reported as pension trust funds.
Additionally, the County contributes to the statewide Indiana Public Employees Retirement Fund (PERF).
A. Plan Description
Marion County Law Enforcement Personnel Retirement Plan
The Retirement Plan is a single-employer contributory defined benefit retirement plan covering certain employees of the
Marion County Sheriff’s Department other than those deputies that are employed by the Civil Sheriff. The Retirement Plan is
administered in accordance with state statutes, which require the County to make minimum contributions necessary to keep
the plan sound on an actuarial basis according to state law. The Retirement Plan provides that each employee contributes
4.25% of their earnings to the plan, which is maintained in a reserve for member contributions and accumulates at a rate of
3.00% compounded annually. Contributions required of the employee may cease, at the election of the employee, following
the completion of 20 years or more of credited service and prior to termination of employment.
Retirement Plan benefits begin to vest after 10 years of service. As of December 31, 2010, there are 85 fully vested
employees (over 20 years of service), 129 partially vested (between 10 and 20 years of services), and 102 nonvested
employees. Law enforcement employees who retire at or after age 55 with 10 years of credited services are entitled to an
annual retirement benefit, payable monthly for life, in an amount equal to 2.50% of the highest monthly average of
consecutive five-year salary per year of service up to a maximum of 20 years; plus 2.00% of such salary per year of service in
excess of 20 years, if any, up to an additional 12 years; plus $1 for each year of service up to a maximum of $20. Full
benefits do not commence before attainment of age 50; however, employees with 20 years of service can elect earlier benefits
at a reduced rate. As of December 31, 2010, there are 333 retirees and beneficiaries receiving benefits, 5 terminated members
entitled to benefits but not yet receiving benefits, and 316 current active members.
Although it has not expressed any intent to do so, the County has the right to discontinue its contributions to the Retirement
Plan at any time. Doing so in three consecutive years terminates the plan. In the event of plan termination, participants are
entitled to their amount of contributions and a proportionate amount of any excess after certain benefits and expenses.
The County does not issue a separate financial report for this plan, which is included as a pension trust fund in this report.

Marion County Law Enforcement Personnel Dependents and Disability Benefits Plan
The Disability Plan is a single-employer defined benefit plan covering all participants in the Retirement Plan. The Disability
Plan provides benefits to the beneficiaries of disabled employees and payments of pensions to dependent parents, surviving
spouses, and dependent children under age 18 for deceased employees. This plan is accounted for in a single fund in
accordance with state statutes, which require the County to make minimum contributions necessary to keep the Disability
Plan sound on an actuarial basis. At December 31, 2010, there are 85 benefit recipients and no vested employees.
During 1997, the County conducted a cost-of-living actuarial study. As a result of this study, the City-County Council
adopted general ordinance number 162-97, which amended the plan to include cost-of-living adjustments. Effective
January 1, 1998, and each year thereafter, all participants in payment status (both current and future) are eligible for a
cost-of-living increase. Benefit increases are not available to terminated vested participants or the beneficiaries of
participants. Applicable increases, if any, may be payable on the July 1 following the later of retirement date or attaining of
age 55. The amount of the annual increase, if any, will depend on the change in the Consumer Price Index and will never
exceed 2.00%.
The County does not issue a separate financial report for this plan, which is included as a pension trust fund in this report.
PERF
PERF is an agent multiple-employer public employee retirement system that acts as a common investment and administrative
agent for state employees and employees of participating political subdivisions of the State of Indiana, in accordance with
Indiana Codes 5-10.2 and 5-10.3.
PERF provides a contributory defined benefit plan. Substantially all County employees are covered by the plan except those
covered by the Retirement and Disability Plans. The County pays the employee contribution portion, 3.00% of annual salary,
which is mandated by state statute, in addition to the employer contribution amount, which is actuarially determined and is
currently 6.25% of annual covered payroll.
PERF retirement benefits vest after 10 years of service. Under the defined benefit component, County employees who retire
at or after age 65 with 10 or more years of creditable service; age 60 with 15 or more years creditable service; or if the sum of
age and creditable service is greater than or equal to 85 (but not earlier than age 55) are entitled to an annual retirement
benefit, payable monthly for life with 60 months guaranteed. Employees who have reached 50 years of age and have 15 years
of credited service will qualify for early retirement with reduced benefits. PERF also provides death and disability benefits.
These benefit provisions and all other requirements are established by state statute and county ordinance.
PERF issues a publicly available financial report that includes financial statements and required supplementary information.
That report may be obtained by writing PERF, 1 North Capitol, Suite 001, Indianapolis, Indiana 46204.
B. Funding Policy
The County is obligated by state law to make all required contributions to the Retirement and Disability Plans based upon an
annual actuarial valuation. The required contributions are actuarially determined. The costs of administering the plan are
financed through plan assets. There are no long-term contracts for contributions to the plan. For PERF, the County pays the
employee contribution portion, 3.00% of annual salary, which is mandated by state statute, in addition to the employer
contribution amount, which is actuarially determined and is 6.25% as of July 1, 2010.

Marion County Law Enforcement Personnel Retirement Plan
For the plan year 2010, the County’s annual pension cost of $6,539,997 for the Retirement Plan was more than the required
annual contribution of $6,244,452 and less than the actual County contribution of $6,622,597. The required contribution was
determined as part of the January 1, 2010 valuation using frozen entry age actuarial cost method. Under the accrual basis of
accounting, the calculation of the annual pension cost and the net pension asset (NPA) is as follows for the Retirement Plan:

*Funded status for the Disability Plan was calculated using the entry age actuarial cost method.

The projection of future benefit payments for an ongoing plan involves estimates of the value of reported amounts and
assumptions about the probability of occurrence of events far into the future. Examples include assumptions about future
employment, mortality, and the healthcare cost trend. Amounts determined regarding the funded status of the plan and the
annual required contributions of the employer are subject to continual revision as actual results are compared with past
expectations and new estimates are made about the future. The schedule of funding progress, presented as required
supplementary information following the notes to the financial statements, presents multiyear trend information about
whether the actuarial value of plan assets is increasing or decreasing over time relative to the actuarial accrued liabilities for
benefits.
NOTE 7—RISK MANAGEMENT
The County is exposed to various risks of loss related to torts; theft of, damage to, and destruction of assets; errors and
omissions; injuries to employees; and natural disasters. The County is self-insured for vehicle, workers’ compensation,
general liability, and high-deductible health insurance. Additionally, the County purchases commercial insurance for claims
for all other risks of loss. Settled claims have not exceeded the insurance coverage in any of the past three years.
Additionally, the County participates in the City’s self-insurance fund for high-deductible health insurance plan that is
offered to current and eligible retired employees. Due to the modified cash basis of accounting, unpaid claims are not
recorded within the accompanying financial statements. In 2010, the County paid $2,980,884 relating to these self-insured
risks.
NOTE 8—DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN
Employees of Marion County are eligible to participate in a deferred compensation plan adopted under the provisions of
Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 457 (Deferred Compensation Plans with Respect to Service for State and Local
Governments). The deferred compensation plan is available to all employees of the County. Under this plan, employees may
elect to defer a portion of their salaries and avoid paying taxes on the deferred portion until the withdrawal date. The deferred
compensation amount is not available for withdrawal by employees until termination, retirement, death, or unforeseeable
emergency. During 1997, the deferred compensation plan was amended to comply with the amendments to Section 457 of the

IRC. Plan provisions were amended so that plan assets are held in trust by an independent trustee for the exclusive benefit of
participants and their beneficiaries and are not included within the accompanying financial statements.
NOTE 9—JOINT VENTURE
The Building Authority is a joint venture of the County and the City. The Building Authority finances, acquires, constructs,
improves, renovates, equips, operates, maintains, and manages lands, governmental buildings, and communication systems
for governmental entities in Marion County. The Building Authority has no stockholders nor equity holders, and all bond and
note loan proceeds, rentals, and other revenues must be disbursed for specific purposes in accordance with provisions of
Indiana Code 36-9-13 et seq. and several trust indentures and loan agreements executed for the security of the holders of the
bonds and notes.
The buildings are financed through the Building Authority’s general obligation debt, which is repaid from rent received under
long-term lease agreements with the County and City. All of the leases contain lease renewals and purchase options. If these
options are not exercised, the leases provide for transfer, upon expiration of the lease, of ownership of the properties to the
lessees free and clear of all obligations of the lease. The governing Indiana statute with respect to each of the Building
Authority’s leases provides that the government lessee(s) shall be obligated to levy annually a tax sufficient to produce each
year the necessary funds to pay the lease rentals to the Building Authority. These leases provide for sufficient rent to service
the debt and provide for operating costs.
The County’s share of the joint venture consists primarily of an allocation determined by the amount of space utilized by
County agencies in the City-County Building and nearby parking lot determined by floor space, 100% of the Marion County
Jail and Jail II, the Marion County Juvenile Detention Center, and the Marion County Sheriff’s Roll Call Site. The
City-County Building is an office building that houses the majority of the operations of the County and City. The City’s share
of the joint venture consists primarily of an allocation determined by the amount of space utilized by City departments in the
City-County Building and parking lot, 100% of the Municipal Garage, Belmont Garage, the Public Safety Training Academy,
and Public Safety Properties. The Environment Control Services Building is leased to other units of government and private
parties. Public Safety Communications System operating costs are paid by the County agency Metropolitan Emergency
Communication Agency.
The Building Authority has five members on the Board of Trustees, two of whom are appointed by the City-County Council
of the Consolidated City of Indianapolis - Marion County, one by the Mayor of the City in his capacity as the municipal
executive of Indianapolis, one by the Mayor of the City in his capacity as the chief executive of the County, and one by the
Marion County Board of Commissioners. The Trustees appoint the five members of the Board of Directors, which is the
governing body of the Building Authority. The Building Authority is subject to the budgetary authority of the City-County
Council, which equally represents the County and the City.
The Building Authority has various long-term debt obligations, which are secured by the rent payments received from the
County and City. During 2010, the County paid $3,873,880 and $6,170,260 in rent and maintenance, respectively. A copy of
the separately issued financial statements of the Building Authority, which is prepared on a basis other than U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles, is available upon request by contacting the Office of Finance and Management at 200 East
Washington Street, Suite 2222, Indianapolis, IN 46204.
NOTE 10—RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS
The legislative body of the County is the same in several respects as that of the City, and the position of chief executive is
held by the Mayor of the City. The County provides certain information technology and telephone services to the City.
Receipts from these services were $14,534,146 in 2010. The County also received $11,413,000 from the City to support the
cost and implementation of an Enterprise Resource Planning system, which will be used to support the operations of both the
City and County. In 2010, the County received $437,851 of 911 dispatch fees from the City.

NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2010

The City and County purchase certain insurance policies that cover risks of both entities. The City and County pay premiums
associated with their own respective portions of the coverage. The City provides certain administrative services to the
County, including purchasing, legal, and other general administration. The City funds such services through a countywide tax
levy. The County does not compensate the City for these services, except for legal services. Conversely, the County provides,
at no compensation, criminal, civil, juvenile, and probate court services to all municipalities and unincorporated areas in
Marion County, administers the property tax administration and collection system for the same jurisdictions, and operates the
County jail and lockup.
The County acted as either a subrecipient or a pass-through agent for various state and federal grant programs with the City
during 2010.
In 2006, Marion County entered into various contracts with Health and Hospital Corporation of Marion County (HHC).
HHC is a separate municipal corporation and is considered to be a component unit of the Consolidated City of Indianapolis –
Marion County. HHC has its own governing board separate from the County’s legislative body. HHC has within it the
division of public health and the division of public hospitals. In 2010, the County made $1,662,821 in mental health
distributions to HHC as allowed by law.
NOTE 11—COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
In 2010, Indiana law limits the liability of municipalities to $700,000 per person and $5,000,000 per occurrence.
The County participates in a number of federal and state financial assistance programs. These programs are subject to
financial and compliance audits by federal agencies. The amount, if any, of disbursements that may be disallowed by the
granting agencies cannot be determined at this time, although the County expects such amounts, if any, to be immaterial.
NOTE 12—DEFICIT FUND BALANCES
At December 31, 2010, the following nonmajor governmental and enterprise funds had a deficit fund balance/net assets:

Information required for only most recent actuarial valuation and the two preceding valuations.

** Funded status for the Disability Plan was calculated using the aggregate actuarial cost method for the 1/1/09 valuation
and the entry age actuarial cost method for the 1/1/10 and 1/1/11 valuations.
Analysis of the dollar amounts of net assets available for benefits, actuarial accrued liability, and excess of actuarial accrued
liability (assets in excess of actuarial accrued liability) in isolation can be misleading. Expressing the net assets available for
benefits as a percentage of the actuarial accrued liability provides one indication of the County's funding status on a
going-concern basis. Analysis of this percentage over time indicates whether the plan is becoming financially stronger or
weaker. Generally, the greater this percentage, the stronger the plan. Trends in funding status and annual covered payroll are
both affected by inflation. Expressing the funding status as a percentage of annual covered payroll approximately adjusts for
the effects of inflation and aids analysis of the County’s progress made in accumulating sufficient assets to pay benefits when
due. Generally, the higher this percentage, the stronger the plan.

Independent Auditors' Report

The Honorable Gregory A. Ballard
Mayor, City of Indianapolis,
and the City-County Audit Committee
Marion County, Indiana:
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the governmental activities, the business-type activities, each
major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of Marion County, Indiana (a component unit of the Consolidated
City of Indianapolis – Marion County) (County) as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006, which collectively
comprise the County’s basic financial statements as listed in the accompanying table of contents. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the County’s management. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements
based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the
standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of
the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the County’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.
The County’s financial statements for 2005 were previously prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. As more fully described in Note 1 to the financial statements, the County elected, at the beginning of 2006, to
change its method of preparing its financial statements to the modified cash basis, which is a comprehensive basis of
accounting other than U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the respective financial
position–modified cash basis of the governmental activities, the business-type activities, each major fund, and the aggregate
remaining fund information of Marion County, Indiana as of December 31, 2006, and the respective changes in financial
position–modified cash basis thereof for the year then ended, in conformity with the basis of accounting described in Note 1,
except for Note 6 – Additional Pension Disclosures, on which we express no opinion.
The County has not presented Management’s Discussion and Analysis as required supplementary information that U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles have determined is necessary to supplement, although not required to be part of, the
basic financial statements.
In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated January 19, 2010 on our
consideration of the County’s internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain
provisions of laws, regulations, contracts and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is to describe
the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting or compliance and the results of that testing, and not to
provide an opinion on the internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an
audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards and should be considered in assessing the results of our
audit.
The budgetary comparison information on page 28; the schedules of funding progress and employer contributions on pages
29 and 30; and the notes to required supplementary information on pages 31 and 32 are not a required part of the basic
financial statements but are supplementary information required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We have
applied certain limited procedures, which consisted principally of inquiries of management regarding the methods of
measurement and presentation of the required supplementary information. However, we did not audit the information and
express no opinion on it.

KPMG LLP, a U.S. limited liability partnership, is the U.S.
member firm of KPMG International, a Swiss cooperative.

Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that collectively comprise the
County’s basic financial statements. The combining and individual fund financial statements and schedules – other
supplementary information on pages 36 through 47, are presented for purposes of additional analysis, and are not a required
part of the basic financial statements. Such information, except the schedules of revenues and expenditures–budget and
actual, on pages 38 through 43 which are unaudited, have been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of
the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, are fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the basic financial
statements taken as a whole on the basis of accounting described in Note 1.
The information presented in the introductory section on pages 1 through 3, is presented for purposes of additional analysis
and is not a required part of the basic financial statements. Such information has not been subjected to the auditing
procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements, and accordingly, we express no opinion on it.

MARION COUNTY, INDIANA
(COMPONENT UNIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS–MARION COUNTY)
NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2006
NOTE 1—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
A. Financial Reporting Entity
Marion County (County) is a unit of local government created by the State of Indiana, governed by the following officials,
each of whom is granted certain independent executive authority under the State Constitution:
County Auditor
County Treas urer
County Co ro ner

County Prosecuto r
County Record er
County Sheriff

County Surveyor
Clerk of the Circuit Court
J udge of the Circuit Court

The legislature of the State of Indiana has provided for certain additional elected officials who are not mentioned in the
Constitution to exercise certain independent executive authority. These are the county assessor, township assessors, and
superior court judges.
In accordance with Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement No. 14, The Financial Reporting Entity,
the County is considered a component unit of the Consolidated City of Indianapolis-Marion County. The County and the
Consolidated City share a common executive and legislative body. Otherwise, the County is considered a separate legal
entity, with its elected officials directly and separately (from City officials) responsible for financial independence,
operations, and accountability for fiscal matters.
Based on the criteria established in GASB Statement No. 14, the County has no component units under the current financial
reporting requirements.
The County has an investment in the Indianapolis-Marion County Building Authority (Building Authority); a joint venture
with the City of Indianapolis (City). Because the County shares joint control equally with the City, and the County and City
retain an ongoing financial responsibility, information concerning this joint venture is included in note 9.
B. Government-wide and Fund Financial Statements
The government-wide financial statements (i.e., statement of activities and net assets - modified cash basis) report
information on all of the nonfiduciary activities of the County. For the most part, the effect of interfund activity has been
removed from these statements. Governmental activities, which normally are supported by taxes and intergovernmental
revenues, are reported separately from business-type activities, which rely to a significant extent on fees and charges for
support.
The statement of activities and net assets - modified cash basis demonstrates the degree to which the direct disbursements of
a given function are offset by program receipts. Direct disbursements are those that are clearly identifiable with a specific
function. Program receipts include (1) charges to customers or applicants who purchase, use, or directly benefit from goods,
services, or privileges provided by a given function and (2) grants and contributions that are restricted to meeting the
operational or capital requirements of a particular function. Internally dedicated resources are reported as general receipts
rather than as program receipts. Likewise, general receipts include all taxes and other items not properly included among
program receipts.
Following the government-wide financial statement are separate financial statements for governmental funds, proprietary
funds, and fiduciary funds, even though the latter are excluded from the government-wide financial statement. Major
individual governmental funds and major individual enterprise funds are reported as separate columns in the fund financial
statements. The County has determined that the General and Welfare Sinking funds are major governmental funds. All other
governmental funds are reported in one column labeled “Nonmajor Governmental Funds.” The County has one enterprise
fund (business-type activities), the Drug Testing Laboratory fund. This enterprise fund is not considered a major fund within
the fund financial statements. Additionally, the County has one internal service fund (governmental activities) that accounts
for the operations of the Information Services Agency. All internal service fund activity is combined into a single column on
the proprietary fund statement, since major fund reporting requirements do not apply to internal service funds. The County
also has two fiduciary fund types: pension trust funds and agency funds.

MARION COUNTY, INDIANA
(COMPONENT UNIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS–MARION COUNTY)
NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2006
C. Basis of Accounting and Financial Statement Presentation
The government-wide, governmental fund, propriety fund, and fiduciary fund financial statements are presented using a
modified cash basis of accounting, which is a comprehensive basis of accounting other than U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. Receipts are recorded when received and disbursements are recorded when paid. Investments are
recorded at historical cost. The modified cash basis is referred to as the cash and investment basis throughout the footnotes.
Prior to 2006, the County’s financial statements were prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.
The cash and investment basis of accounting differs from U.S. generally accepted accounting principles in that receipts are
recognized when received in cash rather than when earned and disbursements are recognized when paid rather than when the
liability is incurred.
If the County utilized the basis of accounting recognized as generally accepted, the fund financial statements for
governmental funds would use the modified accrual basis of accounting, while the fund financial statements for proprietary
and fiduciary fund types would use the accrual basis of accounting. The government-wide financial statement would be
presented on the accrual basis of accounting.
The fund financial statements of the County are organized on the basis of funds, each of which is considered a separate
accounting entity with self-balancing accounts that comprise its cash and investment basis assets, fund balances/net assets,
receipts, and disbursements. Governmental resources are allocated to and accounted for in individual funds based upon the
purposes for which they are to be spent and the means by which spending activities are controlled. The various funds are
summarized by type in the basic financial statements. The following fund types are used by the County:

Governmental funds are those through which most governmental functions are financed. The acquisition, uses, and
balances of the County’s expendable financial resources on the cash and investment basis are accounted for through
governmental funds.
The following are the County’s major governmental funds:
The General Fund is used to account for all receipts and disbursements applicable to the general operations of
governmental agencies of the County, except those required to be accounted for in another fund. All operating
receipts that are not restricted as to use by sources external to the County are recorded in the General Fund.
The Welfare Sinking Fund, a debt service fund, is used to account for the resources devoted to the payment of
interest and principal on short-term notes payable outstanding for child services.
The other governmental funds of the County are considered nonmajor. They are special revenue funds, which
account for the proceeds of specific receipts that are restricted to disbursements for specific purposes; debt service
funds, which account for the accumulation of resources for, and repayment of, general obligation long-term debt
principal, interest, and related costs; and capital projects funds, which account for resources designated to construct
or acquire major capital facilities.
Proprietary Fund Types
Proprietary funds are used to account for activities that are similar to those found in the private sector.
The following are the County’s proprietary fund types:
Enterprise – Enterprise funds are used to account for operations that are financed and operated in a manner
similar to private sector business enterprises – where the intent of the governing body is that the costs of
operations are financed primarily through user charges. An enterprise fund has been established for the Drug
Testing Laboratory fund. The Drug Testing Laboratory fund is used to account for fees collected by the Marion
Superior Court drug testing laboratory.

NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2006
Internal Service – Internal service funds are used to account for the financing of goods or services provided by
one department or agency to other departments or agencies of a government, or to other governments, on a cost
reimbursement basis. An internal service fund has been established for the County’s Information Services
Agency, which provides information technology services to other agencies of the County, or to other
governmental units on a cost-reimbursement basis.
Proprietary funds distinguish operating receipts and disbursements from nonoperating items. Operating receipts and
disbursements generally result from providing services and producing and delivering goods in connection with a
proprietary fund’s principal ongoing operation. All disbursements in the enterprise fund are reported as operating
disbursements as they reflect the cost of services and administration. Operating disbursements for the internal
service fund primarily include the cost of services and charges, and administrative disbursements. All receipts and
disbursements not meeting this definition are reported as nonoperating receipts and disbursements.
Fiduciary Fund Types
Fiduciary – Fiduciary funds are used to account for assets held by the County in a trustee capacity or as an agent for
individuals, private organizations, or other governmental units. These include pension trust funds and agency funds.
Pension trust funds are accounted for and reported similar to proprietary funds. The pension trust funds account for
the Marion County Law Enforcement Personnel Retirement Plan and the Marion County Law Enforcement
Personnel Dependents and Disability Benefits Plan. Agency funds are custodial in nature and do not present results
of operations. These funds account for the collection, distribution, and escrow of various tax types, fees, and set aside
funding.
When both restricted and unrestricted resources are available for use, it is the County’s policy to use restricted resources first,
then unrestricted resources as they are needed.
D. Cash, Investments, and Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents
Investments are stated at cost. Any changes in fair value of investments are reported as realized gains or losses in the year of
the sale of investment as investment earnings.
Cash and cash equivalents are defined as all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the
date of purchase.
Proceeds from the Information Service Agency fund’s capital lease with Justice.Net, amounting to $529,204 at
December 31, 2006, are classified as restricted cash and cash equivalents on the statement of activities and net assets modified cash basis.
E. Property Taxes
Property taxes levied for all governmental entities located within Marion County are collected by the Treasurer of Marion
County, Indiana (Treasurer). These taxes are then distributed by the Auditor of Marion County, Indiana (Auditor) to the
County and the other governmental entities at June 30 and December 31 of each year. The County and the other
governmental entities can request advances of their portion of the collected taxes from the Auditor once the levy and tax rates
are certified by the State of Indiana, Department of Local Government Finance. The Department of Local Government
Finance typically certifies the levy on or before February 15 of the year following the property tax assessment.
The County’s 2006 property taxes were levied based on assessed valuations determined by the Auditor as of the March 1,
2005 assessed valuations, which were adjusted for estimated appeals and tax credits and deductions. The lien date for the
2006 property taxes was March 1, 2005 (assessment date). In 2006, taxes were due and payable to the Treasurer in two
installments on May 10, 2006 and November 10, 2006. The Auditor distributed all property taxes collected by November 10,
2006 to each applicable governmental entity based upon their levy amounts prior to December 31, 2006.
F. Capital Assets
Capital assets arising from cash transactions acquired for use in governmental, propriety fund, or government-wide
operations are accounted for as capital outlay disbursements of the fund upon payment.

G. Long-Term Debt
Long-term debt arising from cash transactions are not reported as liabilities in the basic financial statements. The debt
proceeds are reported as other financing sources or general receipts and payments of principal and interest are reported as
disbursements.
During 2006, tax anticipation warrants were issued on the taxes levied in 2005 and collected in 2006. The City-County
Council authorizes the temporary borrowing pending the receipt of taxes levied and repayment of loans on June 30 and
December 31 of the year borrowed. This procedure assures the County of sufficient funds for operating expenses between the
property tax distribution dates.

H. Interfund Transactions
In the process of aggregating the financial information for the government-wide statement of activities and net assets –
modified cash basis, some amounts reported as interfund activity and balances in the fund financial statements have been
eliminated or reclassified.
Transfers
Legally authorized transfers are reported as transfers in by the recipient fund and as transfers out by the disbursing
fund.
Interfund Services Provided/Used
Charges or collections for services rendered by one fund for another are recognized as receipts (interfund services
provided) of the recipient fund and disbursements (interfund services used) of the disbursing fund. These transactions
are recorded as interfund services because they would be treated as receipts and disbursements if they involved
organizations external to the County.
Certain internal payments are treated as program receipts, such as internal services provided and used. Certain internal
payments are treated as a reduction of disbursements, such as reimbursements.
Elimination of interfund activity has been made for governmental activities in the government-wide financial statement.
I. Receipts and Disbursements
Program Receipts
In the government-wide financial statement, amounts reported as program receipts include (1) collection of cash from
customers or applicants for goods, services, or privileges provided, and (2) operating grants and contributions. Internally
dedicated resources are reported as general receipts rather than program receipts. Likewise, general receipts include all taxes.
Operating Receipts and Disbursements
Operating receipts and disbursements for proprietary funds result from providing services.

J. Fund Balance / Net Assets
Government-wide Financial Statement
Equity is classified as net assets and displayed in two components:
Restricted net assets consist of net assets with constraints placed on the use either by (1) external groups such as creditors,
grantors, contributors, or laws and regulations of other governments or (2) law through constitutional provisions or enabling
legislation. Restricted net assets are classified as restricted for capital projects, grantor purposes, debt service, and statutory
purposes on the government-wide statement.
Unrestricted net assets - All other net assets that do not meet the definition of “restricted.”
Fund Financial Statements
Governmental fund equity is classified as fund balance. Proprietary fund equity is classified the same as in the
government-wide statement.
K. Pensions
The County has separate defined benefit pension plans that cover substantially all employees. The Indiana Public Employees’
Retirement Fund (PERF), administered by the State of Indiana, applies to County employees. The Marion County Law
Enforcement Personnel Retirement Plan (Retirement Plan) and the Marion County Law Enforcement Personnel Dependents
and Disability Benefits Plan (Disability Plan) cover employees of the Sheriff’s Department. The policy of the County is to
fund accrued pension costs for the plans.
The Retirement and Disability Plans are accounted for under the cash and investment basis of accounting as pension trust
funds of the County. Employee and employer contributions are recognized as receipts in the period received, pursuant to final
commitments, as well as statutory or contractual requirements; and disbursements, including benefits paid and refunds, are
recorded when the corresponding payments are made. Investments are recorded at cost.
NOTE 2—STEWARDSHIP, COMPLIANCE, AND ACCOUNTABILITY
Annual budgets are adopted on a budgetary basis. All annual appropriations lapse at the end of the calendar year, except for
capital project funds, which are budgeted on a project basis.
Prior to the first required publication, the Mayor submits to the City-County Council a proposed operating budget for the year
commencing the following January 1st. Prior to adoption, the budget is advertised and public hearings are conducted by the
City-County Council to obtain taxpayer comments. In September of each year, the City-County Council, through the passage
of a resolution/ordinance, approves the budget for the next year. The budget becomes legally certified after approval from the
State of Indiana Department of Local Government Finance.
Revisions to transfer appropriations between agencies or character of expenditure require approval of the City-County
Council. Revisions to increase the appropriations require approval of the City-County Council and the State of Indiana
Department of Local Government Finance.

Investment Policy - Primary Government
Investments are recorded at cost. It is the policy of the County to invest public funds in a manner that will provide the highest
investment return with the maximum security while meeting the daily cash flow demands of the County and conforming to
all state/local statutes governing the investment of public funds.
The primary objectives, in priority order, of the County’s investment activities are:
Safety: Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments of the County shall be
undertaken in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the overall portfolio. To attain this objective,
diversification is required in order that potential losses on individual securities do not exceed the income generated from the
remainder of the portfolio.
Liquidity: The County’s investment portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable the County to meet all operating
requirements that might be reasonably anticipated.
Return on Investments: The County’s investment portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a rate of return
throughout budgetary and economic cycles, commensurate with the County’s investment risk constraints and the cash flow
characteristics of the portfolio.
State statutes authorize the County to invest in certificates of deposit, obligations of the U.S. government and U.S.
government agencies, and repurchase agreements. The statutes further require that repurchase agreements must be
collateralized at 100% of market value on the day of trade by U.S. government or U.S. government agency obligations. These
investments are required by statute to have a stated final maturity of not more than two years.
Investment Policy - Sheriff’s Department Personnel Retirement and Disability Benefit Plans
The primary objectives for the Sheriff’s Retirement and Disability Benefit Plans’ investment activities shall be:
Time Horizon: Investment guidelines are based upon an investment horizon of greater than five years.
Risk Tolerances: To achieve the plans’ long-term objectives, the following factors were considered when establishing the
risk tolerance.
1. The Plans’ financial condition.
2. Liquidity reserves are established, and any remaining assets are fully invested at all times.
3. The Marion County Sheriff’s Pension Board (Board) has set a shortfall constraint that current plans’ assets must be equal
to 90% of the annual benefit obligation.

NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2006
Performance Expectations: The desired investment objective is a long-term rate of return on assets that is at least 8.00%.
Additionally, it is expected the return will be at least 4.75% greater than the anticipated rate of inflation as measured by the
Consumer Price Index.
Asset Allocation Constraints: The Board has reviewed the long-term performance characteristics of various asset classes,
focusing on balancing risks and rewards and has selected the following asset classes for allowable investments:
1.

Domestic large capitalization equities

2.

Domestic small capitalization equities

3.

International equities

4.

Domestic fixed income

5.

Cash equivalents

Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of investments will be adversely affected by a change in interest rates. The
County’s investment policy provides that the County seeks to minimize the risk that the market value of securities in its
portfolio will decrease due to changes in general interest rates by structuring the investment portfolio so that securities mature
to meet cash requirements for ongoing operations, thereby avoiding the need to sell securities on the open market prior to
maturity.
As of December 31, 2006, the County’s investments consisted of the following:

Credit Risk
Credit risk is the risk that an issuer or other counterparty to an investment will not fulfill its obligations. Credit risk is
measured using credit quality ratings of investments in debt securities as described by nationally recognized rating agencies
such as Moody’s Investor Services. The County uses the highest integrity when choosing an instrument of investment. The
County keeps its credit risk as it pertains to investments at a low rate by requiring all investments of the County be rated in
the three highest ratings categories by Moody’s Investor Service, Standard & Poor’s Corporation, or Fitch’s Ratings Service.
Investments were rated as follows by Moody’s Investors Service, Standard & Poor’s Corporation, or Fitch’s Rating Service

NOTE 5—PENSIONS
The County maintains two benefit plans for law enforcement personnel, which are reported as pension trust funds.
Additionally, the County contributes to the statewide Indiana Public Employees Retirement Fund (PERF).
A. Plan Description
Marion County Law Enforcement Personnel Retirement Plan
The Retirement Plan is a single-employer contributory defined benefit retirement plan covering certain employees of the
Marion County Sheriff’s Department other than those deputies that are employed by the Civil Sheriff. The Retirement Plan is
administered in accordance with state statutes, which require the County to make minimum contributions necessary to keep
the plan sound on an actuarial basis according to state law. The Retirement Plan provides that each employee contributes
4.25% of their earnings to the plan, which is maintained in a reserve for member contributions and accumulates at a rate of
3.00% compounded annually. Contributions required of the employee may cease, at the election of the employee, following
the completion of 20 years or more of credited service and prior to termination of employment.
Retirement Plan benefits begin to vest after 10 years of service. As of December 31, 2006, there are 106 fully vested
employees (over 20 years of service), 80 partially vested (between 10 and 20 years of services), and 199 nonvested
employees. Law enforcement employees who retire at or after age 55 with 10 years of credited services are entitled to an
annual retirement benefit, payable monthly for life, in an amount equal to 2.50% of the highest monthly average of
consecutive five-year salary per year of service up to a maximum of 20 years; plus 2.00% of such salary per year of service in
excess of 20 years, if any, up to an additional 12 years; plus $1 for each year of service up to a maximum of $20. Full
benefits do not commence before attainment of age 50; however, employees with 20 years of service can elect earlier benefits
at a reduced rate. As of December 31, 2006, there are 282 retirees and beneficiaries receiving benefits, 5 terminated members
entitled to benefits but not yet receiving benefits, and 385 current active members.
Although it has not expressed any intent to do so, the County has the right to discontinue its contributions to the Retirement
Plan at any time. Doing so in three consecutive years terminates the plan. In the event of plan termination, participants are
entitled to their amount of contributions and a proportionate amount of any excess after certain benefits and expenses.
The County does not issue a separate financial report for this plan, which is included as a pension trust fund in this report.
Marion County Law Enforcement Personnel Dependents and Disability Benefits Plan
The Disability Plan is a single-employer defined benefit plan covering all participants in the Retirement Plan. The Disability
Plan provides benefits to the beneficiaries of disabled employees and payments of pensions to dependent parents, surviving
spouses, and dependent children under age 18 for deceased employees. This plan is accounted for in a single fund in
accordance with state statutes, which require the County to make minimum contributions necessary to keep the Disability
Plan sound on an actuarial basis. At December 31, 2006, there are 76 benefit recipients and no vested employees.
During 1997, the County conducted a cost of living actuarial study. As a result of this study, the Council adopted general
ordinance number 162-97, which amended the plan to include cost of living adjustments. Effective January 1, 1998, and each
year thereafter, all participants in payment status (both current and future) are eligible for a cost of living increase. Benefit
increases are not available to terminated vested participants or the beneficiaries of participants. Applicable increases, if any,
may be payable on the July 1 following the later of retirement date or attaining of age 55. The amount of the annual increase,
if any, will depend on the change in the Consumer Price Index and will never exceed 2.00%.
The County does not issue a separate financial report for this plan, which is included as a pension trust fund in this report.
PERF
PERF is an agent multiple-employer public employee retirement system that acts as a common investment and administrative
agent for state employees and employees of participating political subdivisions of the State of Indiana, in accordance with
Indiana Codes 5-10.2 and 5-10.3.
PERF provides a contributory defined benefit plan. Substantially all County employees are covered by the plan except those
covered by the Retirement and Disability Plans. The County pays the employee contribution portion, 3.00% of annual salary,

which is mandated by state statute, in addition to the employer contribution amount, which is actuarially determined and is
currently 4.50% of annual covered payroll.
PERF retirement benefits vest after 10 years of service. Under the defined benefit component, County employees who retire
at or after age 65 with 10 or more years of creditable service; age 60 with 15 or more years creditable service; or if the sum of
age and creditable service is greater than or equal to 85 (but not earlier than age 55) are entitled to an annual retirement
benefit, payable monthly for life with 60 months guaranteed. Employees who have reached 50 years of age and have 15 years
of credited service will qualify for early retirement with reduced benefits. PERF also provides death and disability benefits.
These benefit provisions and all other requirements are established by state statute and county ordinance.
PERF issues a publicly available financial report that includes financial statements and required supplementary information.
That report may be obtained by writing PERF, Harrison Building, Suite 800, 143 West Market Street, Indianapolis, IN
46204.
B. Funding Policy
The County is obligated by state law to make all required contributions to the Retirement and Disability Plans based upon an
annual actuarial valuation. The required contributions are actuarially determined. The costs of administering the plan are
financed through plan assets. There are no long-term contracts for contributions to the plan. For PERF, the County pays the
employee contribution portion, 3.00% of annual salary, which is mandated by state statute, in addition to the employer
contribution amount, which is actuarially determined and is currently 4.50%.
The annual required contribution and actual contribution made for each plan is as follows for the year ending December 31,

Marion County Law Enforcement Personnel Retirement Plan
For the plan year 2006, the County’s annual pension cost of $4,857,256 for the Retirement Plan was more than the required
annual contribution of $4,672,018 but less than the actual County contribution of $5,106,115. The required contribution was
determined as part of the January 1, 2006 valuation using frozen entry age actuarial cost method. Under the accrual basis of
accounting, the calculation of the annual pension cost and the net pension asset (NPA) is as follows for the Retirement Plan:

NOTE 7—RISK MANAGEMENT
The County is exposed to various risks of loss related to torts; theft of, damage to, and destruction of assets; errors and
omissions; injuries to employees; and natural disasters. The County is self-insured for vehicle, workers’ compensation, and
general liability. Additionally, the County purchases commercial insurance for claims for all other risks of loss. Settled
claims have not exceeded the insurance coverage in any of the past three years. Due to the cash and investment basis of

NOTE 8—DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN
Employees of Marion County are eligible to participate in a deferred compensation plan adopted under the provisions of
Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 457 (Deferred Compensation Plans with Respect to Service for State and Local
Governments). The deferred compensation plan is available to all employees of the County. Under this plan, employees may
elect to defer a portion of their salaries and avoid paying taxes on the deferred portion until the withdrawal date. The deferred
compensation amount is not available for withdrawal by employees until termination, retirement, death, or unforeseeable
emergency. During 1997, the deferred compensation plan was amended to comply with the amendments to Section 457 of the
IRC. Plan provisions were amended so that plan assets are held in trust by an independent trustee for the exclusive benefit of
participants and their beneficiaries and are not included within the accompanying financial statements.
NOTE 9—JOINT VENTURE
The Building Authority is a joint venture of the County and the City. The Building Authority finances, acquires, constructs,
improves, renovates, equips, operates, maintains, and manages lands, governmental buildings, and communication systems
for governmental entities in Marion County. The Building Authority has no stockholders nor equity holders, and all bond and
note loan proceeds, rentals, and other revenues must be disbursed for specific purposes in accordance with provisions of
Indiana Code 36-9-13 et seq. and several trust indentures and loan agreements executed for the security of the holders of the
bonds and notes.
The buildings are financed through the Building Authority’s general obligation debt, which is repaid from rent received under
long-term lease agreements with the County and City. All of the leases contain lease renewals and purchase options. If these
options are not exercised, the leases provide for transfer, upon expiration of the lease, of ownership of the properties to the
lessees free and clear of all obligations of the lease. The governing Indiana statute with respect to each of the Building
Authority’s leases provides that the government lessee(s) shall be obligated to levy annually a tax sufficient to produce each
year the necessary funds to pay the lease rentals to the Building Authority. These leases provide for sufficient rent to service
the debt and provide for operating costs.
The County’s share of the joint venture consists primarily of an allocation determined by the amount of space utilized by
County agencies in the City-County Building and nearby parking lot determined by floor space, 100% of the Marion County
Jail and Jail II, the Marion County Juvenile Detention Center, and the Marion County Sheriff’s Roll Call Site. The
City-County Building is an office building that houses the majority of the operations of the County and City. The City’s share
of the joint venture consists primarily of an allocation determined by the amount of space utilized by City departments in the
City-County Building and parking lot, 100% of the Municipal Garage, Belmont Garage, the Public Safety Training Academy,
and Public Safety Properties. The Environment Control Services Building is leased to other units of government and private
parties. Public Safety Communications System operating costs are paid by the County agency Metropolitan Emergency
Communication Agency.
The Building Authority has five members on the Board of Trustees, two of whom are appointed by the City-County Council
of the Consolidated City of Indianapolis-Marion County, one by the Mayor of the City in his capacity as the municipal
executive of Indianapolis, one by the Mayor of the City in his capacity as the county executive of the County, and one by the
Marion County Board of Commissioners. The Trustees appoint the five members of the Board of Directors, which is the
governing body of the Building Authority. The Building Authority is subject to the budgetary authority of the City-County
Council, which equally represents the County and the City.
The Building Authority has various long-term debt obligations, which are secured by the rent payments received from the
County and City. During 2006, the County paid $8,401,391 and $1,290,178 in rent and maintenance, respectively. A copy of
the separately issued financial statements of the Building Authority, which is prepared on a basis other than U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles, is available upon request.
NOTE 10—RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS
The legislative body of the County is the same in several respects as that of the City, and the position of County Executive is
held by the Mayor of the City. The County provides certain information technology and telephone services to the City.
Receipts from these services were $16,384,547 in 2006. In 2006, the County received $325,773 of 911 dispatch fees from the
City.

(COMPONENT UNIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS–MARION COUNTY)
NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2006
The City and County purchase certain insurance policies that cover risks of both entities. The City and County pay premiums
associated with their own respective portions of the coverage. The City provides certain administrative services to the
County, including purchasing, legal, and other general administration. The City funds such services through a countywide tax
levy. The County does not compensate the City for these services, except for legal services. Conversely, the County provides,
at no compensation, criminal, civil, juvenile, and probate court services to all municipalities and unincorporated areas in
Marion County, administers the property tax administration and collection system for the same jurisdictions, and operates the
County jail and lockup.
The County acted as either a subrecipient or a pass-through agent for various state and federal grant programs with the City
during 2006.
In 2006, Marion County entered into various contracts with Health and Hospital Corporation of Marion County (HHC).
HHC is a separate municipal corporation and is considered to be a component unit of the Consolidated City of IndianapolisMarion County. HHC has its own governing board separate from the County’s legislative body. HHC has within it the
division of public health and the division of public hospitals. HHC provides medical care to the inmates of the Marion
County jail through its division of public hospitals via a contract with the Marion County Sheriff’s Department. In 2006, the
cost of medical care provided to inmates for Marion County was $3,614,000. Additionally, in 2006, the County made
$1,197,000 in mental health distributions to HHC as allowed by law.
NOTE 11—COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
In 2006, Indiana law limits the liability of municipalities to $500,000 per person and $5,000,000 per occurrence. In 2008, the
per person limit was increased to $700,000.
The County participates in a number of federal and state financial assistance programs. These programs are subject to
financial and compliance audits by federal agencies. The amount, if any, of disbursements that may be disallowed by the
granting agencies cannot be determined at this time, although the County expects such amounts, if any, to be immaterial.
NOTE 12—DEFICIT FUND BALANCES
At December 31, 2006, the following nonmajor governmental funds had a deficit fund balance:
MC Sheriff's Civil Division Fees
Public Safety Capital Projects

$ 134,900
12,244

The County intends to reduce the deficit in the MC Sheriff’s Civil Division Fees Fund by increasing charges for services
accounted for in that fund. The deficit in the Public Safety Capital Projects fund will be funded by a transfer from the General
Fund.
NOTE 13—SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
A. Property Tax Assessment
The 2006 property tax assessment involved a new procedure for assessing properties, which resulted in homeowner
assessments being increased while business assessments stayed nearly stagnant. The spring bills for 2007 were sent out based
on the 2006 assessments and a public outcry led the Governor of Indiana to require the County to review and reperform new
assessments and the Governor instructed the public to pay an amount for the spring billing for 2007 equal to only one-half of
the 2006 tax bill. It was determined that the new assessments could not be completed until the spring of 2008, and therefore,
the taxpayers were asked to again pay only one-half of the 2006 tax bill for the fall billing for 2007 property taxes. Most of
the property taxes collected in 2007 were distributed to the units of government by December 31, 2007. In June 2008, the
final reconciliation bill was sent out based on the final assessments. The final distribution of taxes for 2007 occurred in
August 2008. These property tax delays caused the County to collect less receipts than budgeted and the County utilized
short-term borrowing using tax anticipation warrants to supplement the lower than expected receipts. These tax warrants were
not fully repaid by the end of 2007 or 2008 (see note 13.D below).

B. County Sheriff and Indianapolis Police Department Merger
In 2005, the City-County Council approved the merger of the Indianapolis Police Department and the Marion County
Sheriff’s Department. The purpose of the merger is to improve the coordination of police operations in Indianapolis and
improve efficiencies. The merger went into effect on January 1, 2007 and transferred all law enforcement services to the City.
C. Refinancing of General Obligation Notes
On April 26, 2007, the County refinanced the Indiana Limited Recourse Notes, Series 2006. The County’s Indiana Limited
Recourse Notes, Series 2007A was issued in the amount of $7,150,000 with a maturity date of March 1, 2008. Interest was
payable at maturity at a rate of 4.54% per annum.
D. Issuance of Tax Anticipation Warrants
The County issued tax anticipation warrants in advance of property tax collections in each of the years 2007 through 2009.
Due to the property tax reassessment issues discussed in note 13.A above, the County did not repay all of the tax anticipation
warrants at the end of 2007, 2008, or 2009. Amounts borrowed and repaid by year by fund as well as the outstanding balance

E. Lease Agreement
On August 1, 2007, the County entered into an agreement to lease approximately 50,000 square feet of space for use by the
Public Defender Agency. The lease was subsequently amended in 2008 to add additional space for a total leased space of
approximately 52,000 square feet. Total yearly lease amounts range from $300,340 to $901,393 with the lease terminating on
July 31, 2017.
F. Credit Market Conditions
Recent market conditions have resulted in an unusually high degree of volatility and increased the risk associated with certain
investments held by the County, which could impact the value of investments after the date of these financial statements.

G. Child Welfare Juvenile Incarceration Takeover by State
As a result of 2008 legislative changes to Indiana statute, beginning January 1, 2009, the state took over the costs of the child
welfare program and juveniles incarcerated in state facilities. These costs were previously part of the local property tax levy
within Marion County, but with the change, the levy also transferred to the state. In 2006, the activity related to the child
welfare program was accounted for in the Family and Children Services Agency Fund and the activity of the juvenile
incarceration program was accounted for in the General Fund.
H Closure of Children’s Guardian Home
As of June 1, 2009, no additional juveniles were placed in the Children’s Guardian Home. A reuse committee has been
established and the committee members are working on a plan to utilize the building.

*Information required for only most recent actuarial valuation and the two preceding valuations.
Analysis of the dollar amounts of net assets available for benefits, actuarial accrued liability, and excess of actuarial accrued
liability (assets in excess of actuarial accrued liability) in isolation can be misleading. Expressing the net assets available for
benefits as a percentage of the actuarial accrued liability provides one indication of the County's funding status on a
going-concern basis. Analysis of this percentage over time indicates whether the plan is becoming financially stronger or
weaker. Generally, the greater this percentage, the stronger the plan. Trends in funding status and annual covered payroll are
both affected by inflation. Expressing the funding status as a percentage of annual covered payroll approximately adjusts for
the effects of inflation and aids analysis of the County's progress made in accumulating sufficient assets to pay benefits when
due. Generally, the higher this percentage, the stronger the plan.
In accordance with GASB No. 25, a schedule of funding progress is not required to be disclosed for the disability plan as
supplementary information since the aggregate actuarial cost method used by the disability plan does not identify or
separately amortize unfunded actuarial liabilities. Under this method, the excess of the Actuarial Present Value of Projected
Benefits of the group over Actuarial Value of Assets is allocated on a level basis over the earnings of the group.

Introductory Section

August 5, 2005
Honorable Bart Peterson
Mayor
City of Indianapolis, Indiana
I submit to you the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) of the City of Indianapolis (City) for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2004. The City is a component unit of the Consolidated City of Indianapolis – Marion County Reporting Entity. This
report was prepared by the Office of Finance and Management. Responsibility for both the accuracy of the data presented and the
completeness and fairness of the presentation, including all disclosures, rests with the Controller of the City of Indianapolis. The data,
as presented, is accurate in all material respects. It is presented in a manner designed to set forth the financial position and results of
operations of the City. Disclosures necessary to enable the reader to gain the maximum understanding of the City's financial affairs are
included.
The CAFR conforms to the standards for financial reporting of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) and the
Government Finance Officers Association of the United States and Canada (GFOA). There are three main sections to this report. The
Introductory Section includes this letter, the Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting, a description of the
government and related taxing districts, a list of elected officials, and the City’s organizational charts. The Financial Section includes
the independent auditors’ report, management’s discussion and analysis (MD&A), the basic financial statements for the City, and
supplementary information. The Statistical Section includes selected financial and demographic information presented on a multi-year
basis. The MD&A can be found beginning on page 3.
The City is required to undergo an annual single audit in conformity with the provisions of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget
Circular A-133, Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations. Information related to this single audit, including
the schedule of federal financial assistance, findings and recommendations, and auditors’ reports on the internal control structure and
compliance with applicable laws and regulations, are included in a separate report.
VII

This report contains all funds of the City. The City operates under an elected Mayor and City-County Council (29 members) form of
government. The City provides services in public safety, public works, health and welfare, cultural and recreation, urban
redevelopment, housing, and economic development. The City operates public housing facilities and a waterworks facility.
ECONOMIC CONDITION AND OUTLOOK
The City of Indianapolis is one of the nation’s premier destinations to live and grow a business. Developmental progress over the
past year, along with a widely positive reputation and generous accolades, will ensure the City advances toward a prosperous
future. The economic improvements and city expansion have earned Indianapolis great recognition. Expansion Management
Magazine ranked Indianapolis in the top five cities nationally to expand or relocate a business, and Indianapolis was named an “up
and coming city” with a population over one million by Money Magazine.
Indianapolis is a very affordable place to live. Indiana is a low tax state (12th according to a recent report), and the National
Association of Homebuilders named Indianapolis the most affordable city with a population over one million people (2004). Not
only is Indianapolis a great place to live, but it is also a great place to work.
The City is growing in size at a very rapid rate. That growth continues economically with the expansion of downtown and several
businesses. The merger of Anthem and WellPoint, the nation’s leading health insurance company, has brought new jobs to the City.
The construction of the Conrad Hotel, Indianapolis’ first five-star hotel, will bring nearly $100 million to the City’s economy and
create numerous new jobs. The Indianapolis-based Simon Corporation has begun construction of a new $55 million headquarters
downtown, ensuring Simon’s role in the future of Indianapolis. On the cultural side, the Indianapolis Museum of Art just completed
a multi-million dollar renovation that is sure to attract art enthusiasts from across the region. Public and private investment in the
City of Indianapolis will stimulate the local economy for years to come.
Indianapolis is quickly becoming a leader in the field of Biotechnology. The Certified Technology Park is certain to attract life
science–based companies to downtown Indianapolis. Indiana University recently began construction on a new Medical Information
Sciences Building worth over $42 million, and Clarian Health Partners has begun construction on a $65 million laboratory that will
process tests from nearly every hospital in Marion County.
Sports attractions also play a large part in the economic success of Indianapolis. Each year, the City hosts four professional sports
teams, and three major motorsport races at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, which attribute to a great deal of this City’s success.
Most recently, the first steps toward the construction of a new Indianapolis Colts’ stadium and the expansion of the already popular
Indiana Convention Center are underway. The project is set for completion by the 2008 NFL season. The NCAA now calls
Indianapolis home. Their headquarters can be found here, as well as the new NCAA Hall of Champions. The NCAA, in partnership
with the Indianapolis Sports Corporation, will bring numerous men’s and women’s events over the next several years to
Indianapolis, including basketball Final Fours and the NCAA Convention. Indianapolis’s relationship with sports has earned it the
title of the No. 2 sports city in North America by ESPN.com Magazine. The City will continue its dedication to the success of all of
these athletic economic opportunities.

VIII

Internal Control Structure
Management of the City is responsible to establish and maintain an internal control structure that ensures the assets of the government
are protected from loss, theft, or misuse and ensures that adequate accounting data are compiled to allow for the preparation of
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The internal control
structure is designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that these objectives are met. The concept of reasonable
assurance recognizes that: (1) the cost of a control should not exceed the benefits likely to be derived; and (2) the valuation of costs
and benefits requires estimates and judgments by management.
Budgetary Control
Budgetary control is maintained for certain funds at the object level of expenditure by the encumbrance of purchase orders against
available appropriations. The City uses the Governmental Accounting Standards Board expenditure terminology (object) for financial
reporting purposes and State of Indiana expenditure terminology (character) for internal accounting purposes. Capital projects
reimbursable by grant revenues are encumbered for the total amount of the estimated project cost. Outstanding encumbrances to be
financed from future revenues, other than approved grant revenues and certain Consolidated County budgetary account
reimbursements, are recorded in their entirety as a reservation of fund balance.
Cash Management
Due to the fluctuating market conditions, excess cash during the year was invested in certificates of deposit and U.S. Treasury Bills
and Notes and Repurchase Agreements, which were generally for periods of two years or less. It is City policy to invest certificates
of deposit with local, federally insured banks that have a principal office within the county and have been approved by the Marion
County Board of Finance.
Risk Management
The City is self-insured for losses arising from worker’s compensation, automobile liability, and public liability claims. This
program is maintained by the Department of Administration and its Risk Manager. Internal Service funds are used to record the
premiums charged to the operating departments and the claims expense.

OTHER INFORMATION
Audit Committee
The City's Audit Committee was formalized by City-County Council ordinance to provide an independent review body for the audit
activities of the City. At December 31, 2004, the Audit Committee members were:

Mr. George A. Farley

Certificate of Achievement
The Government Finance Officers’ Association of the United States and Canada (GFOA) awarded a Certificate of Achievement for
Excellence in Financial Reporting to the City of Indianapolis for its Comprehensive Annual Financial Report for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2003. In order to be awarded a Certificate of Achievement, a governmental unit must publish an easily
readable and efficiently organized Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, whose contents conform to program standards. Such
reports must satisfy both accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and applicable legal
requirements.
A Certificate of Achievement is valid for a period of one year. We believe our current report continues to conform to the Certificate
of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting Program requirements, and we are submitting it to the GFOA to determine
its eligibility for another certificate.

Acknowledgment
This report is the combined effort of many people: Office of Finance and Management accountants, internal auditors and
departmental chief fiscal officers, and others. I appreciate their diligent and conscientious work, as well as the efforts of our
independent auditors, KPMG LLP.
Mayor Peterson, I also appreciate your continued guidance, interest, and support of excellence in accounting and reporting.
Respectfully submitted,

Robert J. Clifford
Controller

CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS
ORGANIZATION OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND TAXING DISTRICTS
Introduction
The City of Indianapolis (City) was originally incorporated in 1832. It is the largest city in the State of Indiana and the twelfth largest city in the
nation, with a population of 860,000 and a metropolitan area population of approximately 1.6 million people. The City encompasses a land area
of 402 square miles, making it the eighth largest city in the nation in terms of land area. The City, located at the geographic center of the state,
is the state capital and also serves as the physical, economic, and cultural capital. Indianapolis has a stable and diversified economy with
employment rates and income levels consistently above the national averages.

Form of Government
On January 1, 1970, the governments of the City and that of Marion County were unified and their form of service delivery consolidated,
thereby extending the City’s boundaries to generally coincide with those of the County. Four municipalities (Beech Grove, Lawrence,
Speedway and Southport) located within the County boundaries were specifically excluded from most functions of the consolidated City by the
consolidating act. The consolidated government provides for a Mayor and a twenty-nine member legislative council. The Council consists of
twenty-five councilors elected from single-member districts and four councilors elected at large. Because the Mayor's powers extend to the
entire county, residents of the Town of Speedway and the Cities of Beech Grove, Lawrence, and Southport, the municipalities not affected by
the reorganization, vote for the Mayor as Chief County Executive as well as for the councillors at-large.
Since adoption of the consolidated form of government for the City, governmental services within the area of Unigov are provided by 46
different units of local government, including the consolidated City, Marion County, 5 independent municipal corporations, 11 school
corporations, 9 townships, 12 towns, the 4 municipalities excluded from the consolidated City of Indianapolis, 2 library boards and one
conservancy district. Within the consolidated City, special taxing districts were created to coincide with user benefit district boundaries then
existing or as extended by the consolidating act. Boundaries of the various districts are such that a resident may be a member of one district and
not another. Therefore, the resident's geographic location within the County determines the governmental unit and taxing district rates to be
combined in calculating the specific tax rate. As a result of the varying areas in which services are provided by the 46 different governmental
units, Marion County is broken down into 61 different geographical areas for purposes of tax rate determination.
The maps on pages XV and XVI illustrate the relationship of the described taxing units.

The following taxing units are within the consolidated City, and all, except the Consolidated County and the special service districts, can issue
bonds:

Council and three by the minority leader of the City-County Council. The seventh member, who is nominated by the Mayor to be the
Secretary/Treasurer, must be unanimously approved by the remaining members.
The Board of Directors entered into a twenty-year agreement with Veolia Water (formerly US Filter Operating Services) for the day to day
management of the waterworks. The operator is responsible for all routine operations of the utility and the Department of Waterworks assumes

Report of Independent Auditors
Mr. Robert Clifford, Controller and the Audit Committee
City of Indianapolis, Indiana:
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the governmental activities, the business-type activities, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining
fund information of the City of Indianapolis, Indiana (City), a component unit of the Consolidated City of Indianapolis-Marion County, as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2004, which collectively comprise the City’s basic financial statements as listed in the table of contents. We also have audited the aggregate
nonmajor governmental funds, the internal service fund type, and each fiduciary fund type of the City, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2004, as
displayed in the City’s basic financial statements. These financial statements are the responsibility of the City’s management. Our responsibility is to express
opinions on these financial statements based on our audit. We did not audit the financial statements of the Indianapolis Housing Agency, which represent 100
percent of the Housing Agency enterprise fund. Those financial statements were audited by other auditors whose report thereon has been furnished to us, and our
opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for the Indianapolis Housing Agency, is based on the report of the other auditors.
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits
contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes consideration of internal control over
financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the City’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit, and the report of the other auditors,
provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
In our opinion, based on our audit and the report of other auditors, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the respective
financial position of the governmental activities, the business-type activities, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information, as well as of the
aggregate nonmajor governmental funds, the internal service fund type, and each fiduciary fund type of the City of Indianapolis, Indiana, as of
December 31, 2004, and the respective changes in financial position and cash flows, where applicable, thereof for the year then ended in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued a report dated August 5, 2005 on our consideration of the City’s internal control over
financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose
1

of that report is to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide
an opinion on the internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government
Auditing Standards and should be read in conjunction with this report in considering the results of our audit.
The management’s discussion and analysis on pages 3 through 14, the budgetary comparison information and notes to required supplementary information on
pages 77, 78, and 81 through 83, and the schedules of funding progress and employer contributions on pages 79 and 80 are not a required part of the basic
financial statements but are supplementary information required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have applied
certain limited procedures, which consisted principally of inquiries of management regarding the methods of measurement and presentation of the required
supplementary information. However, we did not audit the information and express no opinion on it.
Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that collectively comprise the City’s basic financial statements. The
combining and individual fund financial statements and schedules ─ other supplementary information on pages 85 through 133 are presented for purposes of
additional analysis and are not a required part of the basic financial statements. Such information, except for the budgetary basis financial statements and
schedules which are unaudited, have been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, are fairly
stated in all material respects in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.
The information presented in the Introductory and the Statistical Sections is presented for purposes of additional analysis and is not a required part of the basic
financial statements. Such information has not been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and accordingly,
we express no opinion on it.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Year ended December 31, 2004
This section of the City of Indianapolis’s (City) Comprehensive Annual Financial Report presents an analysis of the City’s financial activities for the year ended
December 31, 2004 based on currently known facts, decisions, and conditions. For a comprehensive understanding of the financial statements, please review the
transmittal letter at the front of this report, along with the City’s financial statements, including the footnotes that follow the basic financial statements.
FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
•

On a government-wide basis, the City’s assets exceeded its liabilities at December 31, 2004 by $900.3 million. Included in this net asset amount is a
$288.9 million unrestricted deficit due mainly to an unfunded net pension obligation.

•

Governmental activities had net assets of $849.9 million and business-type activities had net assets of $50.4 million.

•

On a government-wide basis, for 2004, the City’s total expenses were $845.2 million, or $73.6 million more than the $771.6 million generated in charges
for services, grants, taxes, and other revenues.

•

As of December 31, 2004, the City’s governmental funds reported combined ending fund balances of $336.1 million. Of this amount, $201.8 million was
unreserved and available for spending at the City’s discretion.

•

The unreserved fund balance for the general fund was $152.5 million or 36% of total general fund expenditures.

•

The general fund revenues were $7.3 million lower than original budget estimates.

•

In 2004, the City issued $201.2 million in debt to finance projects and refund debt, including $143.3 million governmental activities bonds, $7.9 million
governmental activities notes and $50.0 million Waterworks business-type activity bonds. Outstanding governmental activities bond debt of $33.6 million
was refunded. There was a net increase of $75.2 million, or 9%, in bond debt for governmental activities during 2004.

OVERVIEW OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
This discussion and analysis is intended to serve as an introduction to the City’s basic financial statements. The City’s basic financial statements include three
components: (1) government-wide financial statements, (2) fund financial statements, and (3) notes to the basic financial statements.
Government-wide Financial Statements
The first set of financial statements are the government-wide statements, which report information about the City as a whole using accounting methods similar
to those used by private-sector companies. The two government-wide statements, Statement of Net Assets and Statement of Activities, report the City’s net
assets and how they have changed. In the government-wide statements, a distinction is made between governmental activities and business-type activities.
Governmental activities are those normally associated with the operation of a government, such as public safety, parks, and streets. Business-type activities are
those activities of the government that are designed to be self-supporting.
The Statement of Net Assets presents information on all of the City’s assets and liabilities, with the difference between the two reported as net assets. Increases
and decreases in net assets may serve as a useful indicator of whether or not the financial position of the City is improving or deteriorating. The statement of net
assets also provides information on unrestricted and restricted net assets and net assets invested in capital assets, net of related debt.

3

CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Year ended December 31, 2004
The Statement of Activities presents information showing how the City’s net assets changed during the year. All current year’s revenues and expenses are
accounted for in the statement of activities regardless of the timing of related cash flows. The statement of activities presents the various functions of the City
and the extent to which they are supported by charges for services, grants and contributions, taxes, and investment income. The governmental activities of the
City include: general government, public safety, public works, health and welfare, culture and recreation, urban redevelopment and housing, and economic
development and assistance. The business-type activities of the City include waterworks and housing agency.
Fund Financial Statements
The second set of financial statements is fund financial statements, which provide information about groupings of related accounts which are used to maintain
control over resources for specific activities or objectives. The City uses fund accounting to demonstrate compliance with finance-related legal requirements.
The fund financial statements provide more detailed information about the City’s most significant funds – not the City as a whole. The funds of the City can be
divided into the following three categories: governmental funds, proprietary funds, and fiduciary funds.
1. Governmental Funds. Governmental funds tell how general government services were financed in the short term as well as what financial resources
remain available for future spending to finance City programs.
The City maintains several individual governmental funds according to their type (general, special revenue, debt service, capital projects, and
permanent). Information is presented separately in the governmental fund balance sheet and in the governmental fund statement of revenues,
expenditures, and changes in fund balances for the general fund, federal grants fund, revenue debt service fund, and sanitary district capital projects
fund, which are considered to be major funds. Individual fund data for each of the nonmajor governmental funds are provided in the form of combining
statements as supplementary information.
2. Proprietary Funds. Proprietary funds offer short-term and long-term financial information about services for which the City charges customers, both
external customers and internal departments of the City. The City maintains the following two types of proprietary funds:
•

Enterprise Funds are used to report information similar to business-type activities in the government-wide financial statements. The City uses
enterprise funds to account for the operations of the Waterworks Department and the Housing Agency.

•

Internal Service Funds are used to report activities that provide services for certain City programs and activities. The City uses internal service
funds to provide for the financing of workers’ compensation, auto liability, and public liability self-insurance for all City departments, as well
as for the centralization of certain payments of awards, refunds, and indemnities.

3. Fiduciary Funds. Fiduciary funds are used to account for resources held for the benefit of individuals or units of other governments. The City is the
trustee or fiduciary responsible for assets that can be used for the trust beneficiaries per trust arrangements. The City is responsible for ensuring that the
assets reported in these funds are used for their intended purposes. All of the City’s fiduciary activities are reported in a separate statement of fiduciary
net assets and a statement of changes in fiduciary net assets. The City’s pension trust funds and agency funds are reported under the fiduciary funds.
Since the resources of these funds are not available to support the City’s own programs, they are not reflected in the government-wide financial
statements.

Required Supplementary Information
In addition to the basic financial statements and notes to the basic financial statements, this report presents required supplementary information concerning the
City’s budgetary comparisons for the general fund and federal grants fund, and required supplementary information pertaining to the City’s progress in funding
its obligation to provide pension benefits to its employees.
Additional Supplementary Information
The combining statements provide subfund-level detail for the general fund and fund-level detail for all nonmajor governmental funds, internal service funds,
pension trust funds, and agency funds. Also in this section are comparisons of actual to budget for all other annually budgeted funds.
FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF THE CITY AS A WHOLE
Net assets. The City’s combined net assets at December 31, 2004 and 2003 were $900.3 million and $973.9 million, respectively. Looking at the net assets of
governmental and business-type activities separately provides additional information.

ANALYSIS OF NET ASSETS
As noted earlier, net assets may serve as a useful indicator of a government’s financial position. For the City, assets exceeded liabilities by $900.3 million in
2004 as compared to $973.9 million for the previous year.
The largest portion of the City’s net assets reflects its investments of $1,018.0 million in capital assets (e.g., land, buildings, equipment, and infrastructure), less
related outstanding debt used to acquire those assets. The 2003 balance was $987.5 million. The City uses these capital assets to provide services to citizens;
consequently, these assets are not available for future spending. Although the City’s investment in capital assets is reported net of related debt, it should be noted
that resources needed to repay this debt must be provided from other sources, since the capital assets themselves cannot be liquidated for these liabilities.
Included in the City’s total net assets is $171.2 million versus $162.3 million in 2003, which represents resources that are subject to external restrictions on how
they may be used.
All net assets generated by governmental activities are either externally restricted or invested in capital assets. Consequently, unrestricted governmental net
assets showed a $258.9 million deficit at the end of the year as compared to a $158.0 million deficit for the prior year. This deficit does not mean the City does
not have resources available to pay its bills. Rather, it is the result of having long-term commitments that are greater than currently available resources, mainly
net pension obligation of $369.6 million for police and firefighters hired before May 1, 1977.
Unrestricted net assets of the business-type activities showed a $30.0 million deficit at the end of the year as compared to an $18.0 million deficit for the prior
year. This deficit will be recovered over time when revenues will overtake the declining debt service on the debt required to purchase the Waterworks facilities.

Year ended December 31, 2004
Changes in net assets. The City’s total revenue on a government-wide basis for 2004 was $771.6 million and $784.4 million for 2003. Taxes represent 40%
(43% in 2003) of the City’s revenue. Another 31% (29% in 2003) came from fees charged for services, and the remainder came from grants and contributions,
interest earnings, and miscellaneous revenues.
The total cost of all programs and services was $845.2 million ($907.5 million for 2003). The City’s expenses cover a range of typical city/county services. The
largest program and the program with the largest burden on general revenues was public safety.

CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Year ended December 31, 2004
Governmental activities. Governmental activities decreased the City’s net assets by $62.0 million. Key factors influencing this decrease were as follows:
•

The unfunded net pension obligation increased by $37.2 million.

•

Unusually high economic development expense due to a $24.9 million incentive to a developer to build a luxury hotel downtown and a $15.5 million
incentive to the Simon Property Group to build its headquarters downtown. See Notes to Financial Statements for more information.

Total revenues for governmental activities in 2004 were $608.3 million, a decrease of $9.5 million from the prior year.
Total expenses for governmental activities for 2004 were $670.4 million, a decrease of $74.7 million from the prior year, mainly due to decreased depreciation
in the public works activity.
See page 22 for various other items contributing to the $62.0 million decrease in net assets versus the $33.8 million decrease in fund balances.
The following charts provide the City’s governmental program revenues and expenses by function and revenues by source for 2004. As shown, public safety is
the largest function in expense. General revenues such as property tax are not shown by program, but are included in the revenues by source chart to show their
significance. Taxes are used to support program activities city-wide.

CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Year ended December 31, 2004
FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF THE CITY’S FUNDS
The focus of the City’s governmental funds is to provide information on inflows and balances of resources that are available for spending. An unreserved fund
balance may serve as a useful measure of a government’s net resources available for spending at the end of the year.
At December 31, 2004, the unreserved fund balance of the general fund was $152.5 million (as compared to $162.5 million in 2003), while the total general
fund balance was $165.9 million (as compared to $179.1 million in 2003). As a measure of the general fund’s liquidity, it may be useful to compare both
unreserved fund balance and total fund balance to total fund expenditures and transfers out. Unreserved fund balance represents 34% of total general fund
expenditures and transfers out of $446.3 million (as compared to 36% and $450.9 million for 2003), while total fund balance represents 37% (40% for 2003) of
total general fund expenditures and transfers out. The fund balance in the City’s general fund decreased by $13.2 million or 7% from the prior year fund balance.
The revenue debt service fund ended the year with a $90.1 million fund balance (as compared to $84.9 million in 2003) reserved for debt service. The sanitary
district capital projects fund ended the year with an unreserved fund balance of $15.8 million ($17.8 million in 2003) and a total fund balance of $16.7 million
($24.3 million in 2003). The federal grants fund ended the year with a negative unreserved fund balance of $1.5 million ($0.7 million negative in 2003) and a
positive total fund balance of $0.05 million ($0.3 million in 2003).
Proprietary Funds
The City’s proprietary funds provide the same type of information found in the government-wide financial statements, but in more detail.
At the end of the year, the unrestricted net assets (deficit) was $(29.1) million ($(16.8) million in 2003) for the Waterworks and $(1.0) million ($(1.2) million for
2003) for the Housing Agency. The internal service funds, which are used to account for certain risk management governmental activities, had $8.1 million in
unrestricted net assets at year-end ($14.2 million in 2003).
Fiduciary Funds
The City maintains fiduciary funds for the assets of the pension trust funds for police and firefighters hired before May 1, 1977. As of the end of 2004, the net
assets of these pension funds totaled $11.0 million, representing a decrease of $10.0 million in total net assets during the year.
The City is the custodian of certain agency funds, and the most common use of agency funds is for pass-through activity. Since, by definition, all assets of the
agency funds are held for the benefit of other entities, there are no net assets. As of the end of 2004, the combined gross assets of the agency funds totaled
$8.6 million ($6.1 million in 2003). This amount is comprised of activity from the following agency funds: Barrett Law, Sanitation 15 Year Law, UAL Personal
Property, E-911 Allocation, DPS Retiree Health Insurance, IPD Confiscated Cash, and other.
General Fund Budgetary Highlights
The final budget for the City’s general fund represents the original budget plus any additional supplemental appropriations during the year. It does not include
encumbrances carried over from the prior year. In 2004, there were $12.8 million of supplemental appropriations to the general fund. This appropriation
consisted primarily of $4.9 million for public safety, $2.2 million for economic development and assistance, and $2.9 million for capital expenditures. These
increases were funded from fund balances.

10

CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Year ended December 31, 2004
Excluding prior year encumbrances, the original general fund expenditures budget for 2004 was $370.9 million. The final general fund expenditures budget was
$383.8 million. Actual expenditures were $373.1 million. Of the total $10.7 million underspending from the final budget, $2.2 million was in public safety,
$2.8 million was in public works, and $3.3 million was in capital expenditures. General revenues and other resources were originally estimated at
$364.8 million, final estimated at $361.7 million, and the actual was $357.1 million.
CAPITAL ASSETS AND DEBT ADMINISTRATION
Capital Assets
The City had a net investment of $2.3 billion in capital assets at December 31, 2004 (net of accumulated depreciation of $2.8 billion) in a broad range of capital
assets. This amount represents a net increase for the current year (including additions and deductions) of $86.4 million.

CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Year ended December 31, 2004
In October 2004, the City issued Economic Development Revenue Bonds Series 2004 C-1 of $16.1 million to finance a portion of the incentive to the Simon
Property Group for locating its headquarters downtown and Series 2004 C-2 of $1.5 million to finance certain economic development projects in the
Consolidated Redevelopment Allocation Area.
In June 2004, the City issued Economic Development Revenue Bonds Series 2004 B of $9.9 million to provide incentive to a developer for construction of a
luxury hotel downtown.
In June 2004, the City issued Demand Economic Development Revenue Bonds of 2004 Series C of $19.6 million to provide incentive to a developer for
construction of a luxury hotel downtown.
In June 2004, the City issued Sanitary District Revenue Bonds of 2004 Series G of $8.6 million to pay down the Sanitary District Bond Anticipation Note 2003
A. The funds were borrowed through the State of Indiana Wastewater Loan Program. The City drew down $8.6 million during 2004 and $8.6 million was
outstanding at December 31, 2004.
In August 2004, the City issued Sanitary District Revenue Bonds of 2004 Series H of $25.0 million to pay down Sanitary Commercial Paper 2002 and construct
sewer improvements. The funds were borrowed through the State of Indiana Wastewater Loan Program. The City drew down $8.1 million in 2004 and
$8.1 million was outstanding at December 31, 2004.
In December 2004, the City issued Sanitary District Revenue Bonds of 2004 Series I of $70.0 million to construct sewer improvements. The funds were
borrowed through the State of Indiana Wastewater Loan Program. The City drew down $1.4 million in 2004 and $1.4 million was outstanding at
December 31, 2004.
During 2004, the City increased by $37.0 million the draws against prior years’ Sanitary District revenue bond issues under the State of Indiana Wastewater
Loan Program. For these four prior issues the balance outstanding at December 31, 2004 was $88.6 million.
During 2004, the City added $7.9 million of notes payable, mainly for the purchase of vehicles.
The increase in unfunded net pension obligation reflects that the pay-as-you-go pension plan is not funded and continues to grow each year. The increase in
compensated absences reflects increases in salaries and increases in the number of hours being carried forward.
In May 2004, the City issued Waterworks District Net Revenue Bonds of $50.0 million for capital improvements.
December 31, 2004 was $50.0 million.

The outstanding balance at

Bond ratings. Since 1998, the City’s general obligation bonds have been rated AAA by all three bond rating agencies. The City’s other debt, principally
revenue bonds and notes, have been insured to attain a rating of AAA.
Limitations on debt. The state limits the amount of general obligation debt the City can issue to varying percents of assessed value, by taxing district, as shown
in the statistical section. The City’s outstanding debt is well below the limit in each case.

The City of Fort Wayne, Indiana entity has been carefully defined pursuant to the entity definition
criteria promulgated by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) in Statement 14, "The
Financial Reporting Entity". In accordance with this criterion, the City has included various component
units in its presentation of the general-purpose financial statements. Blended component units are
included as part of the primary government’s operations even though they are legally separate entities.
The Fort Wayne Municipal Building Corporation has been presented as a blended component unit
because the financial statements would be misleading if data from this component unit was not
included.
Discretely presented component units have been presented in a separate column in the governmentwide financial statements to emphasize that they are legally separate from the City. The following
entities have been shown as discretely presented component units because the City is financially
accountable for them and can impose its will on them, or the component unit is fiscally dependent upon
the City: Neighborhood Care, Inc. (HANDS), Summit Development Corporation, Fort Wayne Urban
Enterprise Association, Inc., Fort Wayne-Allen County Convention and Tourism Authority, and Fort
Wayne Redevelopment Authority.
The following governmental units have not been included in the reporting entity because the City is not
financially accountable for them: Fort Wayne Housing Authority, Fort Wayne-Allen County Airport
Authority, Fort Wayne Community School System, and Fort Wayne Public Transportation Corporation.
The City of Fort Wayne entity also excludes several nonprofit entities that have some association with
the City, including the Community Development Corporation.
The City of Fort Wayne entity includes several governmental boards and commissions, including the
Park Board, the Redevelopment Commission, the Metro Human Relations Commission, the Board of
Public Works, the Board of Public Safety, and the Animal Control Commission.
The oversight body for the Civil City (governmental operations) is the Common Council of the City of
Fort Wayne. The Council is composed of nine elected Council members who serve four-year terms, six
of whom represent geographic councilmanic districts and three of whom are elected at-large. The
oversight body for the City Utilities of Fort Wayne is the Board of Public Works. The Board of Public
Works, as of December 31, 2005, composed of the Chairman of the Board of Public Works and two
citizen members appointed by the Mayor.
Note 1 of the basic financial statements provides a further discussion of the City as a financial reporting
entity.
Economic Condition and Outlook
With a population of 254,062, Fort Wayne remains the second largest city in Indiana. For the last
decade, the Fort Wayne area (Allen County) has consistently maintained a lower unemployment level
than the nation or the State of Indiana, until 2001 when the area’s rates began to match the State’s.
During the past decade the area has seen a decline in manufacturing jobs offset by an increase in
service jobs. Per capita income has also grown each year, primarily by the rate of inflation.
Almost two-thirds of the area’s jobs are evenly distributed between the manufacturing, service and retail
sectors. The remaining one-third comes from the construction, finance and government sectors. Job
growth has been primarily from expansion of existing businesses. In 2005, over 70 economic
development projects were announced that represent over $400 million in new investment, the
retention of over 8,700 jobs and addition of over 1,700 jobs to Fort Wayne and Allen County.

7

In early 2000, the City’s economic development objectives were refocused on gaining higher quality
jobs in the manufacturing, service and technology sectors. The City, in collaboration with Allen County
and the local Chamber of Commerce, created the Fort Wayne/Allen County Economic Development
Alliance. Over the last five years, the Alliance has been responsible for marketing the County’s assets,
which include a high quality of life, existing commercial building sites and an outstanding workforce, to
new and expanding businesses. Since its inception, the Alliance has been involved in over 100
projects that have retained nearly 9,000 jobs and created 4,100 new jobs.
The Northeast Indiana Innovation Center (NIIC), a technology incubator, dedicated its new facility in the
fall of 2005. Beginning in 2001, in former Raytheon facilities, NIIC has programs to assist the business
entrepreneur as well as emerging technology businesses through business incubation, business
counseling, and financing. One of NIIC’s newest initiatives, the Indiana Center for Orthopedic
Research, hopes to strengthen partnerships between the public and private sectors in the medical
industry that will help to create additional opportunities for research and development of future
technology.
The City is strategically located just 200 miles from most of the larger Midwest cities --- Chicago,
Detroit, Indianapolis, Columbus, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Dayton, Louisville and Toledo. This location
positions the community well for distribution businesses as well as manufacturing/service businesses
that require proximity to customers in the Midwest, northeastern United States and southern Canada.
In 2005, the City’s location was important in retaining the operations of Total Fleet Services, Gainey
Transportation Services, and NAL Worldwide. These three companies were spun-off from SIRVA
North American Van Lines located on U.S. 30 West.
Major Initiatives
Since Mayor Graham Richard took office in 2000, he has worked to make the City of Fort Wayne a
High Performance Government. Mayor Richard has implemented innovative business practices like
Lean Six Sigma to reduce expenses and improve customer service in city government. Lean Six
Sigma savings and cost avoidance currently total more than $10 million.
Mayor Richard also strives to make Fort Wayne a wired and inspired city. City residents can now
complete many transactions on-line instead of making a trip to the City-County Building. The City of
Fort Wayne has been recognized by several national organizations for being one of the most
technologically innovative governments in the nation.
Mayor Richard has championed the Fort Wayne Area Public Safety Academy, which is slated to open
in 2007. The Public Safety Academy will provide world-class training to public safety personnel from
throughout northeast Indiana. The Public Safety Academy will be located at the now thriving
Southtown Centre in southeast Fort Wayne.
The City of Fort Wayne is committed to a fiscally conservative management of citizens’ tax dollars.
The implementation of the multi-year financial projections has prepared the City of Fort Wayne for the
financial challenges that lie ahead. The City will continue to wisely invest citizens’ tax dollars.
Financial Information
Budgetary Controls
Budgetary control, for those funds where the Common Council legally adopts budgets, is maintained at
the departmental or major category level. The annual budgetary sequence of events for the City of Fort
Wayne contains several review points. Departments prepare draft budgets each June for the next fiscal

8

year incorporating a set of assumptions provided by the Division of Finance and Administration. These
budget requests are subjected to internal review and modification before a budget ordinance is
prepared for introduction to the Common Council in early September.
Generally, budget hearings are held throughout September in Common Council sessions. Beyond the
public and televised Common Council sessions, there is a legal public hearing held as part of the
budget process at which citizens may provide the administration and the Common Council with their
comments concerning the budget. By state law, the Common Council must pass the budget by the end
of September each year. The Common Council has the power to decrease any major category
proposed by the Administration, but may not increase any major category in the budget.
Subsequent to that action, the Department of Local Government Finance (DLGF) holds a final budget
hearing, review, and modification in December of each year prior to issuing a formal budget approval
order in January. Within this four-month process, there is ample opportunity for oversight and public
input. Additional appropriation or transfer requests are controlled at the major category level and must
be supported by available cash balances. The Department of Local Government Finance must approve
any additional appropriations to those funds where the Common Council adopts a legal budget.
In funds where the modified accrual basis of accounting is used, expenditures are measured against
available appropriations by encumbrance of purchase orders. For budget purposes, expenditures are
recognized in the year encumbered. Under Indiana statute, open purchase orders at the end of a fiscal
year, to the extent of available budgetary spending authority, are automatically added to the
subsequent year's budget.
In proprietary fund types such as utilities, where the full accrual basis of accounting is used,
encumbrances of purchase orders are not recorded. For financial statement and budget purposes,
expenses are recognized when incurred.
The budgetary process for City Utilities is somewhat different from that of the Civil City or governmental
operations. The oversight body for the utility operations under Indiana statute is the Board of Public
Works. On a schedule that runs about a month behind the Civil City budget process before the
Common Council, the Board of Public Works reviews and approves the utility budgets. Additional
appropriation requests and transfers are controlled at the major category level.
Internal Controls
The management of the City of Fort Wayne is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of
internal financial controls that account for and safeguard the assets of the City from loss, theft, and
misuse. The internal financial control system must allow for compilation of data in a manner in which
financial statements can be prepared efficiently in conformance with generally accepted accounting
principles.
It is important that the costs and efforts involved in internal control mechanisms not exceed the benefits
received. Accordingly, we believe that the City's internal financial controls adequately safeguard assets
and provide reasonable assurance of properly recorded financial transactions at an appropriate level of
expense and effort. The City consults with the Indiana State Board of Accounts, not only during the
audit, but also throughout the year. As a result, we believe that we have established a proactive,
positive relationship with our auditor that works to increase the quality of the City's financial reporting
and internal control system.

External Audit Function
The Indiana State Board of Accounts (SBA) conducts a financial audit of the City of Fort Wayne
annually. In addition to this, the SBA conducts a state law compliance audit. The SBA also audits the
City for compliance with the federal Office of Management and Budget Circular A-133, as empowered
in the Single Audit Act of 1984, relative to federal financial assistance received.
Beginning with the 2005 audit, the financial statements of the City Utilities operations, including the
Electric, Water, Water Pollution Control and Yard Waste Facility, enterprise funds, the Stormwater
special revenue fund were audited by the Indiana State Board of Accounts. Audits prior to 2005 for the
City Utilities operations were conducted by independent accounting firms.
Internal Audit Department
The City's Internal Audit Department was created in 1988, and is currently staffed by three accounting
professionals: the Director of Internal Audit and two Staff Auditors. The Audit Committee ordinance
requires that the Director of Internal Audit be a Certified Public Accountant licensed in the State of
Indiana or a Certified Internal Auditor. The Internal Audit Department is organized as a separate
department and has direct responsibilities to the Mayor and the Audit Committee and indirect
responsibilities to the Common Council and the City Controller.
Audit Committee
In 1990, the City of Fort Wayne established by ordinance an Audit Committee. The Audit Committee is
composed of five members of the community appointed as follows: 1) one member appointed by the
Common Council; 2) one member appointed by the Mayor; 3) one member appointed by the Board of
the Allen County Bar Association; 4) one member, approved by the State Board of Accounts, who is a
chief financial officer of another governmental unit in Allen County and is familiar with governmental
accounting in Indiana; and 5) one member appointed by the Board of the local chapter of the Institute of
Internal Auditors.
The Audit Committee has significantly increased the accountability of the City of Fort Wayne to its four
primary financial constituencies: 1) taxpayers and ratepayers; 2) citizens; 3) oversight body (Common
Council); and 4) the capital markets (where securities of the City of Fort Wayne are sold and purchased
in the primary market and traded in the secondary markets).
The duties of the Audit Committee include recommending a budget to the Mayor for the Internal Audit
Department, approving an annual audit plan for the staff of the Internal Audit Department, publicly
receiving audit reports of the State Board of Accounts, recommending the City's independent external
auditors, making sure timely and appropriate remedial actions are taken on all exceptions and
comments in audit reports and management letters, and mandating and monitoring compliance with all
applicable Indiana laws, generally accepted accounting principles, governmental accounting standards,
regulations of the Internal Revenue Service, and other federal agencies.
Pension Plans
The City of Fort Wayne maintains six pension plans for its employees. Most employees are members of
the Public Employees Retirement Fund of Indiana (PERF), the public employee retirement system for a
large percentage of all governmental employees in the State of Indiana. PERF is classified as an agent,
multiple-employer public employee retirement system, acting as a common investment and
administrative agent for governmental units in Indiana. Police and fire department personnel hired
subsequent to April 30, 1977 are members of the 1977 Police Officers and Firefighters' Pension Fund
administered by PERF. Both plans are fully funded on an actuarial basis.

10

Police personnel hired prior to May 1, 1977 are members of the Police Pension Fund established in
1925 by the State of Indiana. Fire Department personnel hired prior to May 1, 1977 are members of the
Fire Pension Fund established in 1937 by the State of Indiana. Utility personnel who retired prior to July
1, 1976 are members of the Municipal Pension Plan. Finally, Board of Health personnel who were
employed by the City of Fort Wayne before the Board of Health became a county function on April 1,
1982 are members of the Sanitary Officers' Pension Plan. There are substantially no assets available to
fund the liabilities of these four plans. They are funded on a pay-as-you-go basis, with unfunded
liabilities currently totaling more than $228 million.
Note 21 of the basic financial statements as well as the required supplementary information provide
further discussion of the City’s pension plans.
Risk Management
On July 14, 1989, the City of Fort Wayne created by ordinance a non-reverting Liability Self-Insurance
Fund. The City has chosen to retain four primary risks at this time: 1) general liability; 2) automobile
liability; 3) police professional liability; and 4) workers' compensation. The City retains an actuarial firm
to advise the Insurance Committee and monitor the progress of the program. The ordinance created
this three member Insurance Committee to assist the Risk Manager in managing the insurance and
self-insurance programs. The Committee is comprised of the Chairman of the Board of Works, the City
Attorney, and the City Controller.
Note 9 in the basic financial statements contains further detail of the City’s risk management programs.
Cash Management
All cash temporarily idle in 2005 was invested by the City in short-term investments in conformance
with Indiana statutes governing investment of public funds. Those statutes limit the investment media
that can be utilized by the City of Fort Wayne to certificates of deposit of local financial institutions, U.
S. Treasury securities, and U. S. agency securities backed by the full faith and credit of the U. S.
Government having a term to maturity of two years or less. This statutory limitation severely constrains
the return the City is able to achieve. The objective is to attain the highest possible return consistent
with the City's liquidity needs and desired level of risk. All excess funds are deposited daily and all
accounts are interest bearing.
Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting
The Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA) of the United States and Canada annually
awards the Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting to state, provincial, and
local governmental units that publish an easily readable and efficiently organized comprehensive
annual financial report whose contents conform to program standards. Such reports must satisfy both
generally accepted accounting principles and applicable legal requirements.
This comprehensive annual financial report is the seventeenth published by the City of Fort Wayne.
The 1989-2004 Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports were awarded the Certificate of Achievement
by GFOA. The award is good for only one year. We believe our report conforms to Certificate program
requirements, and we are hopeful that GFOA will confirm, through its review process, our eligibility for a
seventeenth Certificate.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
As management of the City of Fort Wayne (the City), we offer the following discussion as insight
into the financial performance of the City for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005. To gain a
fair understanding of the City’s financial position, this discussion and analysis should be read in
conjunction with our letter of transmittal, the basic financial statements, and the notes to the basic
financial statements.

Financial Highlights
•

The assets of the City exceeded its liabilities at the end of 2005 by $889.0 million. Of this
amount, $33.9 million is considered unrestricted. The unrestricted net assets of the City’s
governmental activities are $19.4 million and will be used to support the City’s day-to-day
operations. The unrestricted net assets of the City’s business-type activities are $14.6
million and will be used to support the day-to-day operations of the City’s water,
wastewater, stormwater, and other business-type activities.

•

The City’s total net assets increased $15 million in 2005. The net assets of the City’s
business-type activities increased $22.2 million (or 5.7 percent from 2004). The net
assets of the City’s governmental activities decreased $7.2 million (or 1.5 percent from
2004).

•

At the end of 2005, the City’s governmental funds reported a combined ending fund
balance of $110.8 million. The combined governmental funds’ fund balance increased by
$52.6 million from the prior year ending fund balance. Approximately $92.4 million of the
$110.8 million fund balance is considered unreserved at December 31, 2005.

•

At the end of 2005, unreserved fund balance for the general fund was $12.3 million or
18.5 percent of the 2005 general fund expenditures.

•

The City’s total debt increased by $74.9 million (or 31.3 percent) during 2005.

Overview of the Financial Statements
This discussion and analysis is an introduction to the City’s basic financial statements. The City’s
basic financial statements are comprised of three components: government-wide financial
statements, fund financial statements, and notes to the financial statements. In addition to the
basic financial statements, this Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) includes other
supplementary information along with the statistical section.
Government-wide financial statements. The government-wide financial statements present
the financial picture of the City from the economic resources measurement focus using the
accrual basis of accounting, in a manner similar to private-sector businesses. The governmentwide financial statements are composed of two statements: the statement of net assets and the
statement of activities.
The statement of net assets presents information on all of the City’s assets and liabilities, with the
difference between the two reported as net assets. Net assets are then broken down between
governmental and business-type activities. Over time, increases or decreases in net assets will
show the fluctuation in the City’s financial position.

35

The statement of activities presents information on all of the City’s revenues and expenses,
showing how the government’s general expenses less the program revenues equal net expenses
for the most recent fiscal year. General revenues are then subtracted from net expenses to get
the change in net assets. All of the current year’s revenues and expenses are taken into account
regardless of when the cash is received or paid. Thus, revenue and expenses reported in this
statement for some items will only result in cash flows in future fiscal periods (e.g., uncollected
taxes and earned, but unused vacation leave).
Both of the government-wide financial statements distinguish functions of the City that are
principally supported by taxes and intergovernmental revenues (governmental activities) from
other functions that are intended to recover all or a significant portion of their costs through user
fees and charges (business-type activities). The governmental activities of the City include
general government, public safety, highways and streets, sanitation, health and welfare,
economic opportunity, economic development, culture and recreation, urban redevelopment and
housing, capital outlay, and interest on long-term debt. The business-type activities of the City
include a water system, wastewater system, stormwater service, parking garage administration,
solid waste service, electric utility, and a yard waste system.
The government-wide financial statements include not only the City itself (primary government),
but also a few legally separate units: Neighborhood Care, Inc. (HANDS), Summit Development
Corporation (Summit), Fort Wayne Urban Enterprise Association, Inc. (UEA), Fort Wayne – Allen
County Convention and Tourism Authority (C&TA), and Fort Wayne Redevelopment Authority
(RA) for which the City is financially accountable. Financial information for these component units
are reported separately from the financial information presented for the primary government itself.
The financial statements of these component units can be found in their entirety on file in the City
Controller’s office at One Main Street, Fort Wayne, Indiana 46802. The Fort Wayne Municipal
Building Corporation is legally separate from the City, but since its nature and relationship with
the City is significant, it is an integral part of the primary government.
The government-wide financial statements can be found on pages 48-50 of this report.

Fund financial statements. A fund is a fiscal and accounting entity with a self-balancing set
of accounts recording cash and other financial resources, with its related liabilities, and
corresponding equity balances. Some funds are required to be established by State Law and by
bond covenants, while others are adopted to help control monies set aside for a specific purpose.
The City of Fort Wayne, like other state and local governments, uses fund accounting to ensure
and demonstrate compliance with finance-related legal requirements. The funds of the City can
be divided into three categories: governmental funds, proprietary funds, and fiduciary funds.
Governmental funds. Governmental funds are used to account for most of the City’s basic
services. These funds generally do not provide enough revenue to completely cover their
expenses; therefore, they need taxes, fees, interest or any other intergovernmental revenue to
help support them. These funds use the modified accrual method of accounting, which measures
cash and all other financial assets that can readily be converted to cash. Governmental fund
financial statements focus on near-term inflows and outflows of unrestricted resources, as well as
on balances of unrestricted resources available at the end of the fiscal year. Such information
may be useful in evaluating a government’s near-term financing requirements. The differences of
results in the governmental fund financial statements to those in the government-wide financial
statements are explained in a reconciliation following each governmental fund financial
statement. The basic governmental fund financial statements can be found on pages 52-58 of
this report.

36

Proprietary funds. When the City charges a fee to cover the entire cost of an operation,
whether to outside customers or to other units of the City, the services are generally classified as
a proprietary fund. There are two types of proprietary funds: enterprise funds and internal service
funds. Enterprise funds are used to report the same functions presented as business-type
activities in the government-wide financial statements. These funds are completely selfsupported by providing services to outside customers of the City. The City uses enterprise funds
to account for its water, wastewater, stormwater, solid waste, parking garages, electric, and yard
waste operations. Internal Service funds are used to report activities that provide services and
supplies for the other City departments. The City uses internal services funds to account for its
group health insurance, general auto and liability, worker’s compensation, and garage services.
The internal service funds are reported within the governmental activities section of the
government-wide financial statements. The basic proprietary fund financial statements can be
found on pages 59-61of this report.
Fiduciary funds. Fiduciary funds are funds held by a governmental unit as an agent or a trustee.
They are not reflected in the government-wide financial statements because the resources of
those funds are not available to support the City’s own programs. The City holds two types of
fiduciary funds: pension trust funds and agency funds. Pension trust funds are used to account
for pension plans held by the City on behalf of its employees. The City uses pension trust funds
to report the police pension, fire pension, and sanitary officers’ pension funds. Agency funds are
used to account for monies held by the City for an external party. The City uses agency funds to
report the allocated expense clearing, payroll, and the Barrett law regular waivered funds. The
basic fiduciary fund financial statements can be found on pages 62-63 of this report.
Notes to the financial statements. The notes are a required part of the basic financial
statements that provide necessary information for the understanding of the City’s financial report.
The notes to the financial statements can be found on pages 67-105 of this report.
Other information. The City is also required to provide more detailed information about certain
issues disclosed in required supplementary information (RSI) schedules. The City’s RSI
schedules include: Budgetary Comparison Schedule for General Fund and Major Special
Revenue Funds, the schedule of funding progress, schedule of contributions from the employer
and other contributing entities, schedule of the condition rating of the City’s street system, and
schedule of the needed-to-actual maintenance/preservation comparison. The combining financial
statements for the non-major governmental funds, non-major enterprise funds, and the internal
service funds are found immediately following the RSI schedules listed above. The RSI
schedules can be found on pages 107-111 of this report.

Government-wide Financial Analysis
The City’s (primary government) assets exceeded liabilities by $889.0 million at the close of 2005.
The largest portion of the City’s net assets (total assets less total liabilities), which amounts to
$808.2 million (or 90.9 percent), reflects its investment in capital assets (e.g., land, distribution
and collection, roads, buildings and improvements, machinery and equipment, construction in
progress, and net investment in joint venture), less any outstanding debt used to acquire these
assets. These assets are designated as invested in capital assets because they are used to
provide the everyday services the citizens of the City expect; they are not liquid and are not
available for future spending. The debt associated with these capital assets must be paid from
sources other than the capital assets themselves because, as stated before, they cannot be used
as a liquid asset.
The remainder of the City’s net assets are designated as either restricted or unrestricted. The
restricted portion, which totals $46.8 million (or 5.3 percent), are dollars that are subject to an
external restriction and cannot be spent on everyday operations. The unrestricted portion of the
net assets is $33.9 million (or 3.8 percent).
At the end of 2005, the City shows a positive net asset figure as a whole as well as in the
governmental and business-type activities sections individually. This shows that the City has
been able to make sound financial decisions over the past several years leaving them with a solid
equity base on which to build.
The City’s net assets increased by $15 million during 2005. There was an increase in the City’s
net asset figure for the business-type activities of $22.2 million and a net decrease for the
governmental activities of $7.2 million.
The City’s component units showed assets exceeding liabilities by $25.9 million at the end of
2005. Of the net assets (total assets less total liabilities), $19.2 million, reflects its investment in
capital assets less any debt used to acquire these assets that is still outstanding. These assets
are designated as invested in capital assets because they are used to provide the everyday
services to the users of the component units, these assets are not liquid and are not available for
future spending. The debt associated with these capital assets must be paid from sources other
than the capital assets themselves because, as stated before, they cannot be used as a liquid
asset. $6.7 million is designated as unrestricted net assets. These assets may be used by the
City’s component units for normal operations.

Governmental Activities. Although the City’s net assets increased overall, the governmental
activities accounted for a $7.2 million decrease in the total growth in net assets. The increases
shown in the expenses of the governmental activities were mainly attributed to the cost-of-living
raises given to City employees, the costs of annexing new areas (including additional financing
costs), and the inflationary increases standard with governments. Due to the above factors, the
net asset number decreased in 2005. The City is prepared for future deficit spending as the
additional costs of past and future annexations continue to hit the City budget, until such time that
the City begins to receive the corresponding property tax revenues.

Financial Analysis of the Government’s Funds
As noted earlier, the City uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance with
finance related legal requirements.
Governmental funds. The City’s fund financial statements use modified accrual accounting
providing information on near term inflows, outflows, and balances of available resources. This
provides the reader with useful information regarding the City’s financial position. The
unreserved fund balance of the City’s governmental funds gives good insight into its ability to
meet current obligations as well as meet the City’s ongoing service needs.
At the end of 2005, the City’s governmental funds reported combined ending fund balances of
$110.8 million, an increase of $52.6 million in comparison with the prior year. Of that total about
$92.4 million (or 83.4 percent) is unreserved fund balance. The remaining $18.4 million (or 16.6
percent) is reserved for prior commitments. The reserved amount is for encumbrances of $5.3
million), non-current loans receivable of $.8 million, and assets held for resale of $12.3 million.
The largest portion of the City’s governmental fund totals is made up of the General fund, the
City’s chief operating fund. At the end of 2005, the General fund had an unreserved fund balance
of $12.3 million and a total fund balance of $12.7 million. As a measure of the General fund’s
liquidity, you can compare the total fund balance and unreserved fund balance to the total fund
expenditures. The General fund expenditures for fiscal year ended 2005 were $66.5 million. The
total fund balance represents 19.1 percent of General fund expenditures, while the unreserved
fund balance is 18.5 percent of that same amount.
The fund balance of the City’s general fund increased by $2.1 million during fiscal year ended
2005, due mainly to a decrease in the unearned revenues (a liability).
The City has five other funds that meet the major fund criteria: the Highways and Streets, CEDIT,
Parks, Fire, and Redevelopment. The combined fund balance at the end of 2005 for the other
five major funds is $88.6 million (Highways and Streets $4.6 million, CEDIT $25.0 million, Parks
$13.6 million, Fire $2.8 million, and Redevelopment $42.6 million) with the non-major
governmental funds having a combined fund balance of $9.5 million. The fund balances of the
City’s other five major funds increased by $49.0 million during fiscal year ended 2005. The major
reasons for this increase are:

•

•

•

The CEDIT fund increased $16.6 million due to the issuance of a $25 million bond in
April, 2005. The proceeds are being used to provide funding for the construction and
installation of infrastructure and lighting improvements within the City.
The Parks fund increased $9.4 million due to the issuance of a $10 million bond in
October, 2005. The proceeds will finance renovations and improvements to the City’s
parks and aquatic and recreation centers. Spending on these projects will increase
beginning in mid 2006.
The Redevelopment fund increased $21.1 million due to the issuance of two $10 million
bonds (in April and May, 2005). The proceeds are being used to provide funding for the
construction and installation of infrastructure and lighting improvements within the City.

The fund balances in the non-major funds increased by $1.5 million.
Proprietary funds. The City’s proprietary funds use full accrual accounting to report information
in their fund financial statements similar to the way things are reported in the government-wide
financial statements.

42

Net assets of the City’s proprietary funds at the end of 2005 were $411.1 million. Of that total,
they had restricted net assets of $46.8 million, invested in capital assets of $349.7 million, and
unrestricted net assets of $14.6 million. This is a total increase of about $22.2 million, and was
almost entirely reinvested in additional capital assets. In 2005, Waterworks Revenue Bonds,
totaling $16.7 million, were issued for the purpose of funding certain improvements to the
waterworks system of the City. Other details are also covered in the business-type activities
section of the government-wide financial statement section of this MD&A.
General Fund Budgetary Highlights
The differences between the original adopted budget and the final amended budget were
immaterial; the original budget was increased $242 thousand (or 0.4 percent). The difference is
summarized as follows:

-

$45 thousand increase in general government’s appropriation
$163 thousand increase in public safety’s appropriation
$46 thousand increase in highways and street’s appropriation
$12 thousand decrease in health and welfare’s appropriation
$1 thousand increase in economic opportunity’s appropriation
$1 thousand decrease in economic development’s appropriation

The actual expenditures were $2.723 million lower than budgeted, while the revenues of the
general fund were $4.291 million higher than budgeted. For the year, the general fund balance
increased by $2.139 million.
The 2005 final approved budget was $69.204 million; actual expenditures amounted to $66.481
million, leaving a $2.723 million positive variance. The variance is summarized as follows:

-

$997 thousand for General government
$1,231 thousand for Public safety
$277 thousand for Highways and streets
$90 thousand for Health and welfare
$60 thousand for Economic opportunity
$68 thousand for Economic development

The City is prepared for future deficit spending while the costs of past and future annexations
continue to hit the City budget and until it begins to receive the additional tax revenues associated
with the annexations. The City departments are meeting the challenge of monitoring and
controlling expenses while, at the same time, looking for new ways to increase revenues so as to
minimize future tax increases.
Capital Asset and Debt Administration
Capital assets. The City’s Primary Government’s capital assets as of December 31, 2005, are
equal to $1,010.1 million (net of accumulated depreciation). Capital assets include land,
distribution and collection, roads, buildings and improvements, machinery and equipment,
construction in progress, and net investment in joint venture. The total increase in the City’s
capital assets for the current fiscal year was $32.6 million or 3.3 percent (a .4 percent increase for
governmental activities and a 7.3 percent increase for business-type activities).
Governmental activities. Capital assets for the governmental activities total $631 million with an
accumulated depreciation figure of $64 million for a net book value of $567 million. The amount
includes $6.7 million in construction in progress reflecting capital projects in various stages of
completion. The City chose to report its roads using the modified approach accepted under the
new reporting model. This allows the City to make additions and deletions to the overall asset
figure without actually depreciating. The conditions of the City’s road pavement are measured
using a pavement condition index (PCI). The City has adopted the following condition categories.
“Very Good” (100-80), “Good” (79-60), “Fair” (59-40), “Poor” (39-20), and “Very Poor” (19-0).
43

It is the policy of the City to maintain a pavement condition index of good (79-60). In 2004, the
City had a pavement condition index rating of “Good” (74). The City has maintained a “Good”
(76) rating in 2005. The City maintains there are no material variances between the needed
expenditures and the actual expenditures for the maintenance of infrastructure for 2005.
More information regarding the modified approach can be found on pages 109 and 112-113 in the
Required Supplementary Information (RSI) section of this report.
Business-type activities. Capital assets for the business-type activities total $648 million with
an accumulated depreciation figure of $205 million for a net book value of $443 million. The
amount also includes $40 million in construction in progress reflecting capital projects in various
stages of completion.
Major projects include: replacement of the preliminary wastewater treatment facilities, upgrading
the secondary facilities at the Water Pollution Control Plant, begin implementing projects to
reduce the number of Combined Sewer Overflows (CSO’s) and the volume of discharges directly
to the rivers, Combined Sewer Capacity improvements to reduce the risk of basement backups,
replacement of six miles of water mains per year, increasing finished water storage capacity, and
replacement of water meters with updated technology (completed in 2005). During 2005,
approximately $33 million was spent on capital projects.

Long-term debt. At the end of the current fiscal year, the City’s Primary Government had total
bonded debt outstanding of $168.7 million. Of this amount $93.7 million is considered to be
general obligation bonds, special obligation bonds, or first mortgage bonds. The City is
responsible to pay for this debt with general revenues. The remaining $75.0 million is revenue
bonds that are paid for from the revenues earned by the business-type fund that is responsible for
the debt.

The City’s total debt increased by $74.9 million during the current fiscal year, including additions of
$99.8 million and reductions of $24.9 million. The majority of this increase was due to the issuance of
a $16.7 million revenue bond by the City’s Water Utility, and $55 million in Special Obligation Bonds
issued by Community Development ($45 million) and the Parks Department ($10 million).
The City of Fort Wayne currently maintains an AA- rating from Standard & Poor’s and an Aa2
rating from Moody’s for its general obligation debt. The City’s Water Utility maintains an A rating
from Standard & Poor’s and a Aa3 from Moody’s for its revenue bonds. The City’s Wastewater
Utility has a A- rating from Standard & Poor’s and a Aa3 rating from Moody’s for its revenue
bonds.
Additional information on the City’s long-term debt can be found in Note 5 on pages 81-89 of this
report.
Economic Factors and Next Year’s Budgets and Rates
The unemployment rate for the City is currently 5.2 percent, which is down from a rate of 5.8
percent a year ago. This is above both the state average unemployment rate of 4.9 percent and
the national average of 4.7 percent.
The City’s population has increased due to annexation; therefore, the City will be entitled to a
larger percentage of the COIT and CEDIT tax dollars distributed to the county in 2006.

45

Due to passage of Senate Bill 1 in 2003, the City’s ability to raise property taxes is limited. The
City does anticipate a property tax rate increase of .0335 (from 1.046 to 1.0795 per $100 of
valuation) for 2006.
Utilities management was granted a 36% stormwater rate increase by the Fort Wayne City
Council that went into effect on January 1, 2006, and a 25% water rate increase that must be
approved by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC). The IURC is scheduled to meet
on July 25, 2006.
These factors along with others were considered when preparing the City’s budget for the 2006
fiscal year.
The City is prepared for deficit spending over the next couple of years as the expenditures for the
Aboite annexation begin to hit the City budget without benefit of the corresponding property tax
income. This will decrease the City’s unreserved fund balance until the revenues for the Aboite
annexation become available in 2007.
Request for Information

concerning any of the information provided in this report or requests for additional information

Reconciliation of the Balance Sheet to the Statement of Net Assets
Governmental Funds
December 31, 2005

Total fund balances for governmental funds

$

110,849,063

Amounts reported for governmental activities in the statement of net assets are different because:
Capital assets used in governmental activities (excluding internal service fund capital assets) are not financial
resources and therefore, are not reported in the funds.
Those assets consist of:
Land
Roads accounted for using the modified approach
Construction in progress
Buildings, net of $20,583,543 accumulated depreciation
Improvements other than buildings, net of $13,632,884 accumulated depreciation
Machinery and equipment, net of $28,178,210 accumulated depreciation
Net investment in joint venture, net of $792,398 accumulated depreciation
Total capital assets

6,657,124
36,717,130
60,823,825
19,060,439
2,852,311
566,097,931

Bond issuance costs associated with new debt issued by the City in 2005 were reported as expenditures in
the governmental funds when the debt was issued, whereas bond issuance costs are deferred in the statement
of net assets. Deferred bond issuance costs are amortized, over the life of the debt issued, as an adjustment
to interest expense in the statement of activities.

1,701,896

Some assets are not available to pay for current-period expenditures and therefore, are deferred in the funds.

1,124,147

Net pension asset from the PERF Pension Plan is considered an asset of the general government.

1,142,200

Internal services funds are used by the City to account for the financing of goods or services provided by one
department or agency to other City departments or agencies, generally on a cost reimbursement basis. The
assets and liabilities of the internal service funds are included in governmental activities in the statement of net
assets. Internal service fund net assets are:

1,298,107

City tax collections related to 2005 will be collected beyond the 60 day period used to record revenue in the
fund statements. Revenue and a corresponding receivable for this amount are included in the government-wide
statements.

4,735,732

State shared revenue appropriated during the State of Indiana's fiscal year ended June 30, 2005 will be collected
by the City in calender year 2006. Revenue and a corresponding receivable for the amount appropriated but not
received by December 31, 2005 are included in the government-wide statements.

352,592

Some of the City's revenues will be collected after year-end, but are not available soon enough to pay for the
current period's expenditures and therefore, are deferred in the funds.
Long-term liabilities applicable to the City's governmental activities are not due and payable in the current period
and therefore, are not reported in the funds. Interest on long-term debt is not accrued in governmental funds, but
rather is recognized as an expenditure when due. All liabilities, both current and long-term, are reported in the
statement of net assets. Also, during the year the City issued new debt. The discount or premium received was
reported in the governmental funds when the debt was issued, whereas these amounts are deferred and amortized,
over the remaining life of the new debt, as an adjustment to interest expense in the statement of activities.
Balances at December 31, 2005 are:
Bonds payable
Bond interest payable
Unamortized loss on refunding
Unamortized discount
Unamortized premium
Leases payable
Lease interest payable
Loans payable
Loan interest payable

City of Fort Wayne, Indiana
Reconciliation of the Statement of Revenues, Expenditures, and Changes in Fund Balances to the Statement of Activities
Governmental Funds
For the Year Ended December 31, 2005

Net change in fund balances - total governmental funds

$ 52,615,518

Amounts reported for governmental activities in the statement of activities are different because:
Governmental funds report capital outlays as expenditures. However, in the statement of activities the cost of
those assets, which meet capitalization requirements, is capitalized. The cost of the depreciable assets is
allocated over the estimated useful lives and reported as depreciation expense (functionalized).
Land
Roads accounted for using the modified approach
Construction in progress
Buildings, net of $1,518,616 depreciation expense
Improvements other than buildings, net of $1,951,151 depreciation expense
Machinery and equipment, net of $1,698,220 depreciation expense
Net investment in joint venture, net of $83,066 depreciation expense
Net changes in capital assets
The issuance of long-term debt provides current financial resources to governmental funds, but increases the
long-term liabilities on the statement of net assets. Repayment of principal for long-term debt consumes the
current financial resources of governmental funds, but reduces long-term liabilities in the statement of net assets.
This is the amount by which repayments exceed issuance proceeds.

611,628
45,458
1,219,576
1,792,083
(1,249,217)
85,819
(83,066)
2,422,281

(52,177,562)

Governmental funds report the effect of bond issue costs, deferred loss on refunding, discounts and premiums
when debt is first issued, whereas these amounts are deferred and amortized in the statement of activities.

761,676

Some expenses were deferred as assets in the statement of net assets and therefore were not reported in the
statement of activities, but were reported as expenditures in the governmental funds.

(166,853)

Net pension obligations, including the 1925 Police Officers' Pension Plan, the 1937 Firefighters' Pension Plan
and the Sanitary Officers' Pension Plan are considered long-term obligations of the general government, but are
not current expenditures.
Net pension asset from the PERF Pension Plan is considered an asset of the general government, but is not
current revenues.
Revenues in the statements of activities that do not provide current financial resources are not reported as
revenues in the governmental funds.

(9,073,216)

1,142,200

(2,376,033)

Some expenses reported in the statement of activities do not require the use of current financial resources and
therefore, are not reported as expenditures in the governmental funds.

(155,748)

Internal service funds are used by the City to account for the financing of goods and services provided by one
department or agency to other City departments or agencies, generally on a cost reimbursement basis. The net
revenue (expense) of the internal service funds is reported with governmental activities.

Independent Auditors' Report

The Honorable Gregory A. Ballard
Mayor, City of Indianapolis,
and the City-County Audit Committee
Marion County, Indiana:
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the governmental activities, the business-type activities, each
major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of Marion County, Indiana (a component unit of the Consolidated
City of Indianapolis – Marion County) (County) as of and for the year ended December 31, 2008, which collectively
comprise the County’s basic financial statements as listed in the accompanying table of contents. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the County’s management. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements
based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the
standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of
the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the County’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.
As more fully described in Note 1 to the basic financial statements, the County prepared its financial statements on the
modified cash basis, which is a comprehensive basis of accounting other than U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the respective financial
position–modified cash basis of the governmental activities, the business-type activities, each major fund, and the aggregate
remaining fund information of Marion County, Indiana as of December 31, 2008, and the respective changes in financial
position–modified cash basis thereof for the year then ended, in conformity with the basis of accounting described in Note 1,
except for Note 6 – Additional Pension Disclosures, on which we express no opinion.
The County has not presented Management’s Discussion and Analysis as required supplementary information that U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles have determined is necessary to supplement, although not required to be part of, the
basic financial statements.
In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated September 3, 2010 on our
consideration of the County’s internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain
provisions of laws, regulations, contracts and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is to describe
the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting or compliance and the results of that testing, and not to
provide an opinion on the internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an
audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards and should be considered in assessing the results of our
audit.
The budgetary comparison information on page 28; the schedules of funding progress and employer contributions on pages
29 and 30; and the notes to required supplementary information on pages 31 and 32 are not a required part of the basic
financial statements but are supplementary information required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We have
applied certain limited procedures, which consisted principally of inquiries of management regarding the methods of
measurement and presentation of the required supplementary information. However, we did not audit the information and
express no opinion on it.

KPMG LLP is a Delaware limited liability partnership,
the U.S. member firm of KPMG International Cooperative
(“KPMG International”), a Swiss entity.

Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that collectively comprise the
County’s basic financial statements. The combining and individual fund financial statements and schedules – other
supplementary information on pages 36 through 49, are presented for purposes of additional analysis, and are not a required
part of the basic financial statements. Such information, except the schedules of revenues and expenditures–budget and
actual, on pages 38 through 45 which are unaudited, have been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of
the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, are fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the basic financial
statements taken as a whole on the basis of accounting described in Note 1.
The information presented in the introductory section on pages 1 through 3, is presented for purposes of additional analysis
and is not a required part of the basic financial statements. Such information has not been subjected to the auditing
procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements, and accordingly, we express no opinion on it.

MARION COUNTY, INDIANA
(COMPONENT UNIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS–MARION COUNTY)
NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2008
NOTE 1—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
A. Financial Reporting Entity
Marion County (County) is a unit of local government created by the State of Indiana, governed by the following officials,
each of whom is granted certain independent executive authority under the State Constitution:
County Auditor
County Treas urer
County Co ro ner

County Prosecuto r
County Record er
County Sheriff

County Surveyor
Clerk of the Circuit Court
J udge of the Circuit Court

The legislature of the State of Indiana has provided for certain additional elected officials who are not mentioned in the
Constitution to exercise certain independent executive authority. These are the county assessor, township assessors, and
superior court judges.
In accordance with Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement No. 14, The Financial Reporting Entity,
the County is considered a component unit of the Consolidated City of Indianapolis-Marion County. The County and the
Consolidated City share a common executive and legislative body. Otherwise, the County is considered a separate legal
entity, with its elected officials directly and separately (from City officials) responsible for financial independence,
operations, and accountability for fiscal matters.
Based on the criteria established in GASB Statement No. 14, the County has no component units under the current financial
reporting requirements.
The County has an investment in the Indianapolis-Marion County Building Authority (Building Authority); a joint venture
with the City of Indianapolis (City). Because the County shares joint control equally with the City, the County and City retain
an ongoing financial responsibility, information concerning this joint venture is included in note 9.
B. Government-wide and Fund Financial Statements
The government-wide financial statement (i.e., statement of activities and net assets - modified cash basis) reports
information on all of the nonfiduciary activities of the County. The effect of significant interfund activity has been removed
from these statements. Governmental activities, which normally are supported by taxes and intergovernmental revenues, are
reported separately from business-type activities, which rely to a significant extent on fees and charges for support.
The statement of activities and net assets - modified cash basis demonstrates the degree to which the direct disbursements of
a given function are offset by program receipts. Direct disbursements are those that are clearly identifiable with a specific
function. Program receipts include (1) charges to customers or applicants who purchase, use, or directly benefit from goods,
services, or privileges provided by a given function and (2) grants and contributions that are restricted to meeting the
operational or capital requirements of a particular function. Internally dedicated resources are reported as general receipts
rather than as program receipts. Likewise, general receipts include all taxes and other items not properly included among
program receipts.
Following the government-wide financial statement are separate financial statements for governmental funds, proprietary
funds, and fiduciary funds, even though the latter are excluded from the government-wide financial statement. Major
individual governmental funds and major individual enterprise funds are reported as separate columns in the fund financial
statements. The County has determined that the General and Welfare Sinking funds are major governmental funds. All other
governmental funds are reported in one column labeled “Nonmajor Governmental Funds.” The County has one enterprise
fund (business-type activities), the Drug Testing Laboratory fund. This enterprise fund is not considered a major fund within
the fund financial statements. Additionally, the County has one internal service fund (governmental activities) that accounts
for the operations of the Information Services Agency. The County also has two fiduciary fund types: pension trust funds and
agency funds.

MARION COUNTY, INDIANA
(COMPONENT UNIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS–MARION COUNTY)
NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2008
C. Basis of Accounting and Financial Statement Presentation
The government-wide, governmental fund, propriety fund, and fiduciary fund financial statements are presented using a
modified cash basis of accounting, which is a comprehensive basis of accounting other than U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. Receipts are recorded when received and disbursements are recorded when paid. Investments are
recorded at historical cost. The modified cash basis is referred to as the cash and investment basis throughout the footnotes.
The cash and investment basis of accounting differs from U.S. generally accepted accounting principles in that receipts are
recognized when received in cash rather than when earned and disbursements are recognized when paid rather than when the
liability is incurred.
If the County utilized the basis of accounting recognized as generally accepted, the fund financial statements for
governmental funds would use the modified accrual basis of accounting, while the fund financial statements for proprietary
and fiduciary fund types would use the accrual basis of accounting. The government-wide financial statement would be
presented on the accrual basis of accounting.
The fund financial statements of the County are organized on the basis of funds, each of which is considered a separate
accounting entity with self-balancing accounts that comprise its’ cash and investment basis assets, fund balances/net assets,
receipts, and disbursements. Governmental resources are allocated to and accounted for in individual funds based upon the
purposes for which they are to be spent and the means by which spending activities are controlled. The various funds are
summarized by type in the basic financial statements. The following fund types are used by the County:
Governmental Fund Types
Governmental funds are those through which most governmental functions are financed. The acquisition, uses, and
balances of the County’s expendable financial resources on the cash and investment basis are accounted for through
governmental funds.
The following are the County’s major governmental funds:
The General Fund is used to account for all receipts and disbursements applicable to the general operations of
governmental agencies of the County, except those required to be accounted for in another fund. All operating
receipts that are not restricted as to use by sources external to the County are recorded in the General Fund.
The Welfare Sinking Fund, a debt service fund, is used to account for the resources devoted to the payment of
interest and principal on short-term notes payable outstanding for child services.
The other governmental funds of the County are considered nonmajor. They are special revenue funds, which
account for the proceeds of specific receipts that are restricted to disbursements for specific purposes; debt service
funds, which account for the accumulation of resources for, and repayment of, general obligation long-term debt
principal, interest, and related costs; and capital projects funds, which account for resources designated to construct
or acquire major capital facilities.
Proprietary Fund Types
Proprietary funds are used to account for activities that are similar to those found in the private sector.
The following are the County’s proprietary fund types:
Enterprise – Enterprise funds are used to account for operations that are financed and operated in a manner
similar to private sector business enterprises – where the intent of the governing body is that the costs of
operations are financed primarily through user charges. An enterprise fund has been established for the Drug
Testing Laboratory fund. The Drug Testing Laboratory fund is used to account for fees collected by the Marion
Superior Court drug testing laboratory.

NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2008
Internal Service – Internal service funds are used to account for the financing of goods or services provided by
one department or agency to other departments or agencies of a government, or to other governments, on a cost
reimbursement basis. An internal service fund has been established for the County’s Information Services
Agency, which provides information technology services to other agencies of the County, or to other
governmental units on a cost-reimbursement basis.
Proprietary funds distinguish operating receipts and disbursements from nonoperating items. Operating receipts and
disbursements generally result from providing services and producing and delivering goods in connection with a
proprietary fund’s principal ongoing operation. All disbursements in the enterprise fund are reported as operating
disbursements as they reflect the cost of services and administration. Operating disbursements for the internal
service fund primarily include the cost of services and charges, and administrative disbursements. All receipts and
disbursements not meeting this definition are reported as nonoperating receipts and disbursements.
Fiduciary Fund Types
Fiduciary – Fiduciary funds are used to account for assets held by the County in a trustee capacity or as an agent for
individuals, private organizations, or other governmental units. These include pension trust funds and agency funds.
Pension trust funds are accounted for and reported similar to proprietary funds. The pension trust funds account for
the Marion County Law Enforcement Personnel Retirement Plan and the Marion County Law Enforcement
Personnel Dependents and Disability Benefits Plan. Agency funds are custodial in nature and do not present results
of operations. These funds account for the collection, distribution, and escrow of various tax types, fees, and set aside
funding.
When both restricted and unrestricted resources are available for use, it is the County’s policy to use restricted resources first,
then unrestricted resources as they are needed.
D. Cash, Investments, and Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents
Investments are stated at cost. Any changes in fair value of investments are reported as realized gains or losses in the year of
the sale of investment as investment earnings or losses.
Cash and cash equivalents are defined as all highly liquid investments including certificates of deposit with an original
maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase.
Proceeds from the Information Service Agency fund’s capital lease with JUSTIS.Net, amounting to $377,367 at
December 31, 2008, are classified as restricted cash and cash equivalents on the statement of activities and net assets modified cash basis, as these funds are restricted for the purchase of software or hardware equipment relating to JUSTIS.Net,
the Marion County Court’s case management IT system.
E. Property Taxes
Property taxes levied for all governmental entities located within Marion County are collected by the Treasurer of Marion
County, Indiana (Treasurer). These taxes are then distributed by the Auditor of Marion County, Indiana (Auditor) to the City
and the other governmental entities at June 30 and December 31 of each year. The City and the other governmental entities
can request advances of their portion of the collected taxes from the Treasurer once the levy and tax rates are certified by the
Indiana Department of Local Government Finance. The Indiana Department of Local Government Finance typically certifies
the levy on or before February 15 of the year following the property tax assessment.
The County’s 2008 property taxes were levied based on assessed valuations determined by the Auditor as of the March 1,
2007 assessed valuations, which were adjusted for estimated appeals, tax credits and deductions. The lien date for the 2008
property taxes was March 1, 2007 (assessment date); the amount of property tax to be collected cannot be measured until the
levy and tax rates are certified in the subsequent year. Taxable property is assessed at 100% of the true tax value. However,
due to continuing issues with assessed valuations, tax bills were delayed in 2007 as well as 2008. In 2008, first half of the
year 2008 taxes were due and payable to the Treasurer in December 2008. Second half of the year 2008 tax bills were sent to
taxpayers in June 2009 with a due date of July 9, 2009.

F. Capital Assets
Capital assets arising from cash transactions acquired for use in governmental, proprietary fund, or government-wide
operations are accounted for as capital outlay disbursements of the fund upon payment.
G. Debt
Long-term debt
Long-term debt arising from cash transactions are not reported as liabilities in the basic financial statements. The debt
proceeds are reported as other financing sources or general receipts and payments of principal and interest are reported as
disbursements.
County Option Income Tax
In 2007, Marion County received $9,600,000 in proceeds from the City of Indianapolis from the City’s issuance of
$36,000,000 of County Option Income Tax Anticipation Notes during the year. These notes matured on January 12, 2009,
and the County repaid the City its portion of the proceeds at this time. As of December 31, 2008, the County has pledged
future County Option Income Tax receipts to repay this debt and related interest.
Notes payable
The County repaid $7,428,394 in principal and interest during the year. There are no notes outstanding as of the end of the
year.
Tax anticipation warrants
During 2008, tax anticipation warrants were issued on the taxes levied in 2007 and collected in 2008. The City-County
Council authorizes the temporary borrowing pending the receipt of taxes levied and repayment of loans on June 30 and
December 31 of the year borrowed. This procedure assures the County of sufficient funds for operating disbursements
between the property tax distribution dates.

H. Interfund Transactions
In the process of aggregating the financial information for the government-wide statement of activities and net assets –
modified cash basis, some amounts reported as interfund activity and balances in the fund financial statements have been
eliminated or reclassified.
Transfers
Legally authorized transfers are reported as transfers in by the recipient fund and as transfers out by the disbursing
fund.
Interfund Services Provided/Used
Charges or collections for services rendered by one fund for another are recognized as receipts (interfund services
provided) of the recipient fund and disbursements (interfund services used) of the disbursing fund. These transactions
are recorded as interfund services because they would be treated as receipts and disbursements if they involved
organizations external to the County.
Certain internal payments are treated as program receipts, such as internal services provided and used.
Elimination of interfund activity has been made for governmental activities in the government-wide financial statement.
I. Receipts and Disbursements
Program Receipts
In the government-wide financial statement, amounts reported as program receipts include (1) collection of cash from
customers or applicants for goods, services, or privileges provided, and (2) operating grants and contributions. Internally
dedicated resources are reported as general cash receipts rather than program cash receipts. Likewise, general cash receipts
include all taxes.
Operating Receipts and Disbursements
Operating receipts and disbursements for proprietary funds result from providing services.
J. Fund Balance / Net Assets
Government-wide Financial Statement
Equity is classified as net assets and displayed in two components:
Restricted net assets consist of net assets with constraints placed on the use either by (1) external groups such as creditors,
grantors, contributors, or laws and regulations of other governments or (2) law through constitutional provisions or enabling
legislation. Restricted net assets are classified as restricted for capital projects, grantor purposes, debt service, and statutory
purposes on the government-wide statement.
Unrestricted net assets - All other net assets that do not meet the definition of “restricted.”
Fund Financial Statements
Governmental fund equity is classified as fund balance. Proprietary fund equity is classified the same as in the
government-wide statement.
K. Pensions
The County has separate defined benefit pension plans that cover substantially all employees. The Indiana Public Employees’
Retirement Fund (PERF), administered by the State of Indiana, applies to County employees. The Marion County Law
Enforcement Personnel Retirement Plan (Retirement Plan) and the Marion County Law Enforcement Personnel Dependents

and Disability Benefits Plan (Disability Plan) cover employees of the Sheriff’s Department. The policy of the County is to
fund accrued pension costs for the plans.
The Retirement and Disability Plans are accounted for under the cash and investment basis of accounting as pension trust
funds of the County. Employee and employer contributions are recognized as receipts in the period received, pursuant to final
commitments, as well as statutory or contractual requirements; and disbursements, including benefits paid and refunds, are
recorded when the corresponding payments are made. Investments are recorded at cost.
NOTE 2—STEWARDSHIP, COMPLIANCE, AND ACCOUNTABILITY
Annual budgets are adopted on a budgetary basis. All annual appropriations lapse at the end of the calendar year, except for
capital project funds, which are budgeted on a project basis.
Prior to the first required publication, the Mayor submits to the City-County Council a proposed operating budget for the year
commencing the following January 1st. Prior to adoption, the budget is advertised and public hearings are conducted by the
City-County Council to obtain taxpayer comments. In September of each year, the City-County Council, through the passage
of a resolution/ordinance, approves the budget for the next year. The budget becomes legally certified after approval from the
State of Indiana Department of Local Government Finance.
Revisions to transfer appropriations between agencies or character of expenditure require approval of the City-County
Council. Revisions to increase the appropriations for tax supported funds require approval of the City-County Council and
the State of Indiana Department of Local Government Finance.

Investment Policy - Primary Government (excluding Sheriff’s Department Personnel Retirement and Disability Benefit
Plans)
Investments are recorded at cost. It is the policy of the County to invest public funds in a manner that will provide the highest
investment return with the maximum security while meeting the daily cash flow demands of the County and conforming to
all state/local statutes governing the investment of public funds.
The primary objectives, in priority order, of the County’s investment activities are:
Safety: Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments of the County shall be
undertaken in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the overall portfolio. To attain this objective,
diversification is required in order that potential losses on individual securities do not exceed the income generated from the
remainder of the portfolio.
Liquidity: The County’s investment portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable the County to meet all operating
requirements that might be reasonably anticipated.

NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2008
Return on Investments: The County’s investment portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a rate of return
throughout budgetary and economic cycles, commensurate with the County’s investment risk constraints and the cash flow
characteristics of the portfolio.
State statutes authorize the County to invest in certificates of deposit, obligations of the U.S. government and U.S.
government agencies, and repurchase agreements. The statutes further require that repurchase agreements must be
collateralized at 100% of market value on the day of trade by U.S. government or U.S. government agency obligations. These
investments are required by statute to have a stated final maturity of not more than two years.
Investment Policy - Sheriff’s Department Personnel Retirement and Disability Benefit Plans
The primary objectives for the Sheriff’s Retirement and Disability Benefit Plans’ investment activities shall be:
Time Horizon: Investment guidelines are based upon an investment horizon of greater than five years.
Risk Tolerances: To achieve the plans’ long-term objectives, the following factors were considered when establishing the
risk tolerance.
1. The Plans’ financial condition.
2. Liquidity reserves are established, and any remaining assets are fully invested at all times.
3. The Marion County Sheriff’s Pension Board (Board) has set a shortfall constraint that current plans’ assets must be equal
to 90% of the annual benefit obligation.
Performance Expectations: The desired investment objective is a long-term rate of return on assets that is at least 8.00%.
Additionally, it is expected the return will be at least 4.75% greater than the anticipated rate of inflation as measured by the
Consumer Price Index.
Asset Allocation Constraints: The Board has reviewed the long-term performance characteristics of various asset classes,
focusing on balancing risks and rewards and has selected the following asset classes for allowable investments:
1.

Domestic large capitalization equities

2.

Domestic small capitalization equities

3.

International equities

4.

Domestic fixed income

5.

Cash equivalents

Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of investments will be adversely affected by a change in interest rates. The
County’s investment policy provides that the County seeks to minimize the risk that the fair value of securities in its portfolio
will decrease due to changes in general interest rates by structuring the investment portfolio so that securities mature to meet
cash requirements for ongoing operations, thereby avoiding the need to sell securities on the open market prior to maturity.

measured using credit quality ratings of investments in debt securities as described by nationally recognized rating agencies
such as Moody’s Investor Services. The County uses the highest integrity when choosing an instrument of investment. The
County keeps its credit risk as it pertains to investments at a low rate by requiring all investments of the County, which are
rated, to be rated in the three highest ratings categories by Moody’s Investor Service, Standard & Poor’s Corporation, or
Fitch’s Ratings Service. Investments were rated as follows by Moody’s Investors Service, Standard & Poor’s Corporation, or

NOTE 5—PENSIONS
The County maintains two benefit plans for law enforcement personnel, which are reported as pension trust funds.
Additionally, the County contributes to the statewide Indiana Public Employees Retirement Fund (PERF).
A. Plan Description
Marion County Law Enforcement Personnel Retirement Plan
The Retirement Plan is a single-employer contributory defined benefit retirement plan covering certain employees of the
Marion County Sheriff’s Department other than those deputies that are employed by the Civil Sheriff. The Retirement Plan is
administered in accordance with state statutes, which require the County to make minimum contributions necessary to keep
the plan sound on an actuarial basis according to state law. The Retirement Plan provides that each employee contributes
4.25% of their earnings to the plan, which is maintained in a reserve for member contributions and accumulates at a rate of
3.00% compounded annually. Contributions required of the employee may cease, at the election of the employee, following
the completion of 20 years or more of credited service and prior to termination of employment.
Retirement Plan benefits begin to vest after 10 years of service. As of December 31, 2008, there are 91 fully vested
employees (over 20 years of service), 91 partially vested (between 10 and 20 years of services), and 158 nonvested
employees. Law enforcement employees who retire at or after age 55 with 10 years of credited services are entitled to an
annual retirement benefit, payable monthly for life, in an amount equal to 2.50% of the highest monthly average of
consecutive five-year salary per year of service up to a maximum of 20 years; plus 2.00% of such salary per year of service in
excess of 20 years, if any, up to an additional 12 years; plus $1 for each year of service up to a maximum of $20. Full
benefits do not commence before attainment of age 50; however, employees with 20 years of service can elect earlier benefits
at a reduced rate. As of December 31, 2008, there are 308 retirees and beneficiaries receiving benefits, 7 terminated members
entitled to benefits but not yet receiving benefits, and 340 current active members.
Although it has not expressed any intent to do so, the County has the right to discontinue its contributions to the Retirement
Plan at any time. Doing so in three consecutive years terminates the plan. In the event of plan termination, participants are
entitled to their amount of contributions and a proportionate amount of any excess after certain benefits and expenses.
The County does not issue a separate financial report for this plan, which is included as a pension trust fund in this report.
Marion County Law Enforcement Personnel Dependents and Disability Benefits Plan
The Disability Plan is a single-employer defined benefit plan covering all participants in the Retirement Plan. The Disability
Plan provides benefits to the beneficiaries of disabled employees and payments of pensions to dependent parents, surviving
spouses, and dependent children under age 18 for deceased employees. This plan is accounted for in a single fund in
accordance with state statutes, which require the County to make minimum contributions necessary to keep the Disability
Plan sound on an actuarial basis. At December 31, 2008, there are 83 benefit recipients and no vested employees.
During 1997, the County conducted a cost of living actuarial study. As a result of this study, the Council adopted general
ordinance number 162-97, which amended the plan to include cost of living adjustments. Effective January 1, 1998, and each
year thereafter, all participants in payment status (both current and future) are eligible for a cost of living increase. Benefit
increases are not available to terminated vested participants or the beneficiaries of participants. Applicable increases, if any,
may be payable on the July 1 following the later of retirement date or attaining of age 55. The amount of the annual increase,
if any, will depend on the change in the Consumer Price Index and will never exceed 2.00%.
The County does not issue a separate financial report for this plan, which is included as a pension trust fund in this report.
PERF
PERF is an agent multiple-employer public employee retirement system that acts as a common investment and administrative
agent for state employees and employees of participating political subdivisions of the State of Indiana, in accordance with
Indiana Codes 5-10.2 and 5-10.3.
PERF provides a contributory defined benefit plan. Substantially all County employees are covered by the plan except those
covered by the Retirement and Disability Plans. The County pays the employee contribution portion, 3.00% of annual salary,

which is mandated by state statute, in addition to the employer contribution amount, which is actuarially determined and is
currently 5.50% of annual covered payroll.
PERF retirement benefits vest after 10 years of service. Under the defined benefit component, County employees who retire
at or after age 65 with 10 or more years of creditable service; age 60 with 15 or more years creditable service; or if the sum of
age and creditable service is greater than or equal to 85 (but not earlier than age 55) are entitled to an annual retirement
benefit, payable monthly for life with 60 months guaranteed. Employees who have reached 50 years of age and have 15 years
of credited service will qualify for early retirement with reduced benefits. PERF also provides death and disability benefits.
These benefit provisions and all other requirements are established by state statute and county ordinance.
PERF issues a publicly available financial report that includes financial statements and required supplementary information.
That report may be obtained by writing PERF, Harrison Building, Suite 800, 143 West Market Street, Indianapolis, IN
46204.
B. Funding Policy
The County is obligated by state law to make all required contributions to the Retirement and Disability Plans based upon an
annual actuarial valuation. The required contributions are actuarially determined. The costs of administering the plan are
financed through plan assets. There are no long-term contracts for contributions to the plan. For PERF, the County pays the
employee contribution portion, 3.00% of annual salary, which is mandated by state statute, in addition to the employer
contribution amount, which is actuarially determined and is 5.50% as of July 1, 2008.
The annual required contribution and actual contribution made for each plan is as follows for the year ended December 31,

*Funded status for the Disability Plan was calculated using the aggregate actuarial cost method.

The projection of future benefit payments for an ongoing plan involve estimates of the value of reported amounts and
assumptions about the probability of occurrence of events far into the future. Examples include assumptions about future
employment, mortality, and the healthcare cost trend. Amounts determined regarding the funded status of the plan and the
annual required contributions of the employer are subject to continual revision as actual results are compared with past
expectations and new estimates are made about the future. The schedule of funding progress, presented as required
supplementary information following the notes to the financial statements, presents multiyear trend information.
NOTE 7—RISK MANAGEMENT
The County is exposed to various risks of loss related to torts; theft of, damage to, and destruction of assets; errors and
omissions; injuries to employees; and natural disasters. The County is self-insured for vehicle, workers’ compensation, and
general liability. Additionally, the County purchases commercial insurance for claims for all other risks of loss. Settled
claims have not exceeded the insurance coverage in any of the past four years. Due to the cash and investment basis of
accounting, unpaid claims are not recorded within the accompanying financial statements.
NOTE 8—DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN
Employees of Marion County are eligible to participate in a deferred compensation plan adopted under the provisions of
Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 457 (Deferred Compensation Plans with Respect to Service for State and Local
Governments). The deferred compensation plan is available to all employees of the County. Under this plan, employees may
elect to defer a portion of their salaries and avoid paying taxes on the deferred portion until the withdrawal date. The deferred
compensation amount is not available for withdrawal by employees until termination, retirement, death, or unforeseeable
emergency. During 1997, the deferred compensation plan was amended to comply with the amendments to Section 457 of the
IRC. Plan provisions were amended so that plan assets are held in trust by an independent trustee for the exclusive benefit of
participants and their beneficiaries and are not included within the accompanying financial statements.

NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 9—JOINT VENTURE
The Building Authority is a joint venture of the County and the City. The Building Authority finances, acquires, constructs,
improves, renovates, equips, operates, maintains, and manages lands, governmental buildings, and communication systems
for governmental entities in Marion County. The Building Authority has no stockholders nor equity holders, and all bond and
note loan proceeds, rentals, and other revenues must be disbursed for specific purposes in accordance with provisions of
Indiana Code 36-9-13 et seq. and several trust indentures and loan agreements executed for the security of the holders of the
bonds and notes.
The buildings are financed through the Building Authority’s general obligation debt, which is repaid from rent received under
long-term lease agreements with the County and City. All of the leases contain lease renewals and purchase options. If these
options are not exercised, the leases provide for transfer, upon expiration of the lease, of ownership of the properties to the
lessees free and clear of all obligations of the lease. The governing Indiana statute with respect to each of the Building
Authority’s leases provides that the government lessee(s) shall be obligated to levy annually a tax sufficient to produce each
year the necessary funds to pay the lease rentals to the Building Authority. These leases provide for sufficient rent to service
the debt and provide for operating costs.
The County’s share of the joint venture consists primarily of an allocation determined by the amount of space utilized by
County agencies in the City-County Building and nearby parking lot determined by floor space, 100% of the Marion County
Jail and Jail II, the Marion County Juvenile Detention Center, and the Marion County Sheriff’s Roll Call Site. The
City-County Building is an office building that houses the majority of the operations of the County and City. The City’s share
of the joint venture consists primarily of an allocation determined by the amount of space utilized by City departments in the
City-County Building and parking lot, 100% of the Municipal Garage, Belmont Garage, the Public Safety Training Academy,
and Public Safety Properties. The Environment Control Services Building is leased to other units of government and private
parties. Public Safety Communications System operating costs are paid by the County agency Metropolitan Emergency
Communication Agency.
The Building Authority has five members on the Board of Trustees, two of whom are appointed by the City-County Council
of the Consolidated City of Indianapolis-Marion County, one by the Mayor of the City in his capacity as the municipal
executive of Indianapolis, one by the Mayor of the City in his capacity as the chief executive of the County, and one by the
Marion County Board of Commissioners. The Trustees appoint the five members of the Board of Directors, which is the
governing body of the Building Authority. The Building Authority is subject to the budgetary authority of the City-County
Council, which equally represents the County and the City.
The Building Authority has various long-term debt obligations, which are secured by the rent payments received from the
County and City. During 2008, the County paid $3,595,000 and $6,768,443 in rent and maintenance, respectively. A copy of
the separately issued financial statements of the Building Authority, which is prepared on a basis other than U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles, is available upon request.
NOTE 10—RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS
The legislative body of the County is the same in several respects as that of the City, and the position of chief executive is
held by the Mayor of the City. The County provides certain information technology and telephone services to the City.
Receipts from these services were $14,210,794 in 2008. In 2008, the County received $257,121 of 911 dispatch fees from the
City.
The City and County purchase certain insurance policies that cover risks of both entities. The City and County pay premiums
associated with their own respective portions of the coverage. The City provides certain administrative services to the
County, including purchasing, legal, and other general administration. The City funds such services through a countywide tax
levy. The County does not compensate the City for these services, except for legal services. Conversely, the County provides,
at no compensation, criminal, civil, juvenile, and probate court services to all municipalities and unincorporated areas in
Marion County, administers the property tax administration and collection system for the same jurisdictions, and operates the
County jail and lockup.
The County acted as either a subrecipient or a pass-through agent for various state and federal grant programs with the City
during 2008.

(COMPONENT UNIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS–MARION COUNTY)
NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2008
In 2006, Marion County entered into various contracts with Health and Hospital Corporation of Marion County (HHC).
HHC is a separate municipal corporation and is considered to be a component unit of the Consolidated City of IndianapolisMarion County. HHC has its own governing board separate from the County’s legislative body. HHC has within it the
division of public health and the division of public hospitals. HHC provides medical care to the inmates of the Marion
County Jail through its division of public hospitals via a contract with the Marion County Sheriff’s Department. In 2008, the
cost of medical care provided to inmates for Marion County was $4,645,534. Additionally, in 2008, the County made
$1,455,962 in mental health distributions to HHC as allowed by law.
Individual township assessor offices were consolidated with the County Assessor with the November 2008 General Election,
with an effective date of January 1, 2009.
NOTE 11—COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
In 2008, Indiana law limits the liability of municipalities to $700,000 per person and $5,000,000 per occurrence.
The County participates in a number of federal and state financial assistance programs. These programs are subject to
financial and compliance audits by federal agencies. The amount, if any, of disbursements that may be disallowed by the
granting agencies cannot be determined at this time, although the County expects such amounts, if any, to be immaterial.
NOTE 12—DEFICIT FUND BALANCES
At December 31, 2008, the following nonmajor governmental and enterprise funds had a deficit fund balance/net assets:
Nonmajor Capital Projects Funds
Public Safety Capital Projects

$

Capital Improvement Lease

(12,244)
(1,351,155)

Nonmajor Special Revenue Fund
Community Corrections Home Detention

$

Property Reassessment

(105,711)
(609,709)

Enterprise
Drug Testing Laboratory

$

(112,779)

The County intends to reduce the deficit in the Drug Testing Laboratory funds by increasing charges for services accounted for in
the fund. The Property Reassessment fund deficit will be covered by future property tax collections. The deficit in the Public
Safety Capital Projects, Capital Improvement Lease, and Community Corrections Home Detention funds will be funded by a
transfer from the General Fund.
NOTE 13—SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
A. Property Tax Assessment
In 2007 the Governor ordered a state-wide reassessment. Due to this reassessment the 2007 billing was delayed which then
delayed the 2008 billing. The first half 2008 taxes were due and payable to the Treasurer in December 2008. Second half
2008 tax bills were sent to taxpayers in June 2009 with a due date of July 2009. These property tax delays caused the County
to collect less receipts than budgeted and the County utilized short-term borrowing using tax anticipation warrants to
supplement the lower than expected receipts. These tax warrants were not fully repaid by the end of 2009 (see note 13.B
below).

Due to the property tax reassessment issues discussed in note 13.A above, the County did not repay all of the tax anticipation

C. Credit Market Conditions
Recent market conditions have resulted in an unusually high degree of volatility and increased the risk associated with certain
investments held by the County, which could impact the value of investments after the date of these financial statements.
D. Child Welfare Juvenile Incarceration Takeover by State
As a result of 2008 legislative changes to Indiana statute, beginning January 1, 2009, the state took over the costs of the child
welfare program and juveniles incarcerated in state facilities. These costs were previously part of the local property tax levy
within Marion County, but with the change, the levy also transferred to the state. In 2006, the activity related to the child
welfare program was accounted for in the Family and Children Services Agency Fund and the activity of the juvenile
incarceration program was accounted for in the General Fund.
E. Closure of Children’s Guardian Home
As of June 1, 2009, no additional juveniles were placed in the Children’s Guardian Home. As such, the Children’s Guardian
Home was closed in July 2009. In May 2010 Irvington Preparatory Academy signed a fifteen year lease with Marion County
to utilize the former Guardian Home starting for their 2010-2011 school year which began on August 9, 2010.
F. Township Assessor Consolidation
Effective July 1, 2008, the Decatur Township Assessor’s Office was consolidated with the Marion County Assessor’s Office,
as it did not contain the minimum number of land parcels to remain a local township office. Effective January 1, 2009, the
remaining eight Township Assessor Offices were consolidated into the Marion County Assessor’s Office by vote of the
citizens of Marion County via a referendum on the ballot of the November 2008 general election.

*Information required for only most recent actuarial valuation and the two preceding valuations.
**Funded status for the Disability Plan was calculated using the aggregate actuarial cost method.
Analysis of the dollar amounts of net assets available for benefits, actuarial accrued liability, and excess of actuarial accrued
liability (assets in excess of actuarial accrued liability) in isolation can be misleading. Expressing the net assets available for
benefits as a percentage of the actuarial accrued liability provides one indication of the County's funding status on a
going-concern basis. Analysis of this percentage over time indicates whether the plan is becoming financially stronger or
weaker. Generally, the greater this percentage, the stronger the plan. Trends in funding status and annual covered payroll are
both affected by inflation. Expressing the funding status as a percentage of annual covered payroll approximately adjusts for
the effects of inflation and aids analysis of the County's progress made in accumulating sufficient assets to pay benefits when
due. Generally, the higher this percentage, the stronger the plan.

July 1
August
August
