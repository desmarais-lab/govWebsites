Information

****** Carbon_Monoxide_Information ******
***** [CO-house] *****
***** What you should know to protect your family from Carbon Monoxide *****
This educational information is part of a community service effort intended to
provide information to consumers about the hazards of Carbon Monoxide poisoning
and suggestions for prevention.
**** What are the sources of Carbon Monoxide? ****
    * Clogged Chimney
    * Tobacco Smoke or Incense
    * Wood Burning Fireplace, Gas Log Burner, or any unvented space heater
    * Cooking Appliance
    * Garage Ceiling Heater
    * Auto Exhaust In attached garage
    * Workshop, Hot Tub, Pool or Sauna Heater
    * Water Heater and Oil, Wood, Gas, or Coal Furnace
    * Gas Clothes Dryer
    * Lawnmower Exhaust
    * BBQ Grill
Remember there are many more possible sources and causes of Carbon Monoxide:
    * Appliances in cabins or campers
    * Recreational vehicles, Tents
    * Lack of adequate ventilation
    * Space Heaters, Boats
    * Bathroom and clothes dryer exhausts vented to outside in an airtight home
      can interfere with other vented appliances and create CO
Common household appliances should not normally produce Carbon Monoxide, but CO
production is possible if they are malfunctioning or not vented properly. Have
all combustion appliances tested yearly.
**** Carbon Monoxide Safety ****
Carbon Monoxide is dangerous!
&#8220;CO poisoning from the use of fuel burning appliances kills at least 200
people each year and sends more than 5,000 to hospital emergency rooms for
treatment. Others die from CO produced while burning charcoal inside a home,
garage, vehicle or tent. Still others die from CO produced¬ by cars
unintentionally left running in attached garages.&#8221; *CPSC 1997
What is Carbon Monoxide?
Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless and colorless gas which could be created
whenever a fuel (such as wood, gasoline, coal, natural gas, kerosene, etc.) is
burning.
You may be exposed to Carbon Monoxide when:
    * You leave your car, truck, or van running
    * You burn charcoal, alcohol, or gasoline in an enclosed tent, camper, or
      room
    * You smoke a cigar, cigarette, or pipe
    * Your home contains an incorrectly vented or malfunctioning hot water
      heater, furnace, space heater, fireplace, or stove
How does Carbon Monoxide harm you?
Quite simply, carbon monoxide prevents oxygen from being used by your body.
Carbon monoxide is poisonous and can harm your central nervous system.
Who is at risk?
Everyone is at risk of being poisoned by carbon monoxide. However, individuals
with existing health problems such as heart and lung disease and the elderly
are especially vulnerable. Infants, children and pregnant women are also at
risk.
How much is too much?
These levels should be referenced to the effects on healthy people. Health
effects can vary significantly based on age, sex, weight, and overall state of
health.
12,000 PPM- Death within 1 &#8211; 3 minutes
1600 PPM- Nausea within 20 minutes, death within 1 hour
800 PPM- Nausea and convulsions &#8211; death within 2 hours
400 PPM- Frontal headaches 1-2 hours &#8211; life threatening within 3 hours
50 PPM- Maximum level for continuous exposure in an 8 hour workday. Health
alert for vulnerable populations.
10-35 PPM- Marginal &#8211; Small children, elderly, and those suffering
respiratory or heart problems cautioned. Prolonged exposure may cause
drowsiness.
9 PPM- The concentration often found on busy city streets
1 &#8211; 9 PPM- Any Increase of CO from outside warrants further investigation
though may not be
-PPM = parts per mdl/on molecules of air.
Take These Precautions
Make a list of combustion systems you may have in your home. building,
recreational dwelling or device (even boats with gasoline engines). This list
would include auto influences where garages, car ports and other building
components are in use. Be aware that CO may be a greater risk in these
settings.
How much CO is inside your car when you are in it? Have a certified technician
with calibrated test instrumentation document the performance of your furnace,
water heater. fireplace. barbeque and whatever else may be inside or close to
inside buildings.
Utilize a CO alarming device with a sensor capable of protecting people to the
maximum technology. It is not recommended to use marginally accurate CO alarms.
What are the symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning?
Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning mimics many common illnesses, such as the flu
and food poisoning.
Common symptoms associated with carbon monoxide poisoning:
    * headaches
    * loss of hearing
    * dizziness
    * blurry vision
    * weakness
    * vomiting
    * nausea
    * disorientation
    * rapid heartbeat
    * seizures
    * loss of consciousness
    * coma
    * cardiac arrest
    * respiratory failure
This list is not meant to serve as a diagnosis of carbon monoxide poisoning,
but it is meant to provide information on carbon monoxide poisoning symptoms.
Always check with your doctor.
Long term exposure
Health effects are related to the level of CO concentration and length of
exposure. New studies indicate that chronic. low level exposure can have
serious health consequences.
What can I do to protect myself and my family?
    * Use non-electrical space heaters only in well ventilated areas.
    * Don&#8217;t start or leave running cars, trucks or other vehicles in an
      enclosed area.
    * Every home, building, recreational device should have at least one carbon
      monoxide detector accurate enough to protect all.
    * Have your furnace and other fuel burning appliances cleaned and inspected
      by a qualified professional once a year or before each heating season.
    * Make sure your service professionals tests each appliance using a testing
      instrument that can detect carbon monoxide.
    * Don&#8217;t wait until symptoms occur! BE SAFE!
CO detectors &amp; properly maintained combustion appliances can save lives!
Carbon monoxide (CO) detectors can help alert you to increased levels of carbon
monoxide in your home, but they are not foolproof! CALL A PROFESSIONAL!
What to do if you suspect Carbon Monoxide is present in your home:
    * Call
If your detector alarm sounds and you are experiencing symptoms of carbon
monoxide poisoning, leave your home immediately and call your local¬ emergency
services number or 911 if it is available in your area.
    * Check
If your detector alarm sounds and no one has symptoms of carbon monoxide
poisoning:
First check the detector, push the reset button or the &#8220;Peak&#8221;
reading button. Get fresh air to the building, and check for sources of carbon
monoxide. Tum off any suspicious or obviously malfunctioning appliances or
other sources of combustion. Levels of CO higher than those measured¬ outside
warrants further investigation, though may not be an immediate health risk.
Contact a certified service or repair company who can¬ test for CO with proper
test instruments.
    * Always
If you think you have symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning and you do not have
a detector, leave your home, and call your emergency services number or 911
immediately!
BE SAFE! IF YOU DON&#8217;T TEST, YOU DON&#8217;T KNOW.

					Enterprise Zone LIC Instructions
Indiana Code (IC) 6-3.1-7-2 provides that a taxpayer who is
in good standing with the Indiana Economic Development
Corporation is entitled to a state income tax credit of 5% of
the interest income received from qualified loans made during
the year. To qualify, the loan proceeds must be for purposes
directly related to businesses located in an enterprise zone
or for improvements increasing the assessed value of real
property located in an enterprise zone.* A ‚Äúqualified loan‚Äù also
means a loan made to an individual or business that uses the
loan proceeds toward the rehabilitation, repair, or improvement
of a residence within an enterprise zone.
*An enterprise zone created under IC 5-28-15 or an airport development zone (code # 802) designated under
IC 8-22-3.5-14.
Maps of enterprise zones and addresses can be found on the
Web at www.in.gov/dor/3619.htm.
Who May File for This Credit?
For the purposes of eligibility, for the Loan Interest Credit, a
taxpayer in good standing is defined as an entity conducting
business operations within an enterprise zone that
1) Receives interest on a qualified loan made during the
		
tax year;
2) Pays the registration fee charged to zone businesses
		
under IC 5-28-15-5;
3) Provides the assistance to urban enterprise 		
		 associations required from zone businesses under
		 IC 5-28-15-5(b); and
4) Complies with any requirements adopted by the
		 board of the Indiana Economic Development
		 Corporation for taxpayers claiming the Enterprise
		 Zone Loan Interest Credit.
Note: If the taxpayer is located outside an enterprise zone,
the taxpayer is not required to reinvest its incentives within the
enterprise zone, other than complying with (2) and (3) above.
How Often Can I Claim a Credit?
A claim for credit is filed annually for each qualified loan or in
combination with all qualified loans made during the taxable
year.
Section A ‚Äì Taxpayer Information
1)
2)
3)
4)

Type or print lender‚Äôs name and address.
Enter lender‚Äôs Social Security or federal ID number.
Enter Indiana county or O.O.S. (out-of-state).
Enter telephone number.

Section B ‚Äì Qualified Loan Information
Enter the following information for each qualified loan, or
provide a combined listing of borrowers within every enterprise
zone. Attach additional sheets as necessary (type or print):
1) Enter the borrower‚Äôs name and location address 		
		
within the enterprise zone.
2) Enter the borrower‚Äôs Social Security or federal 		
identification number.
3) Enter the borrower‚Äôs telephone number.
4) Indicate the purpose of the loan (business or
		
personal home improvement) and the date of loan 		
		 origination.
5) Enter the name of the borrower‚Äôs enterprise zone 		
		 location.
Section C ‚Äì Report of Qualified Loans to Businesses
by Enterprise Zone Locations
Summarize the number of qualified loans made during the
taxable year according to the enterprise zone in which the
loan proceeds are used by the business borrower(s) (listed
in Section B).
Enter the total amount of interest income received from qualified
loans to businesses during the taxable year attributed to the
enterprise zone location of the borrower(s), columns (a) and (c).
For purposes of the loan interest credit, interest includes
service charges, time-price differentials, and all other charges
for the use of money. Interest received from loans and lines of
credit existing at the time an enterprise zone was designated
qualify for the credit if the proceeds are used for a qualified
purpose. Interest from mortgage loans to acquire property
does not qualify unless the property is used for business
purposes (including renting or leasing). If the proceeds of a
loan are used to both acquire and improve real property and
the acquisition is not for a business purpose, only that portion
of the interest attributable to the improvement of the property
would qualify for the loan interest credit. If the loan proceeds
are used to acquire business property which is subsequently
removed from an enterprise zone, only the interest received
while the property was used for a business purpose within
the enterprise zone would qualify for the credit.
Section D ‚Äì Credit for Qualified Loans for
the Taxable Year
Line 1. Enter the grand total of all qualified loans to businesses
listed in Section C, columns (a) and (c).
Line 2. Enter the amount of loan interest income received
from businesses during the taxable year from qualified loans
listed in Section C, columns (b) and (d).

Enterprise Zone LIC Instructions, continued
Line 3. Enter the total other loan interest income received from
nonbusiness loans made for the purposes of rehabilitation,
repair, or improvement of a residence or for improvements
that increase the assessed value of real property located in
any enterprise zone.
Line 4. Add the amount of business and nonbusiness interest
income and multiply the result by 5%.
Line 5. Indicate the state tax liability you wish to offset by
checking the appropriate tax type box and by entering the
net amount of your state tax liability. Note: The net amount of
tax entered on line 5 must be reduced by all other applicable
tax liability credits and may not be greater than the amount
on line 4. Carry the net amount of credit to be used to your
tax type return.
Line 6. Subtract line 5 from line 4. The result may not be less
than zero. If it's greater than zero, carry the excess unused
amount of credit to Section E.
Section E ‚Äì Enterprise Zone Loan Interest Carryover
Complete this section whenever there is a carryover of unused
loan interest credit. The amount of credit carryover from a
taxable year shall be reduced to the extent that the carryover
is used by the taxpayer to obtain credit against allowable state
tax liabilities for any subsequent taxable year. Carryover is
allowed up to 10 years following the date on which a qualified
loan credit is claimed but not beyond the phase-out period
that terminates the enterprise zone from which a qualified
loan had originated.
Enter in each column the applicable date or amounts for every
succeeding taxable year in which a credit carryover is used.
Section F ‚Äì Signature
The taxpayer or an authorized agent must sign this
schedule.
Where Can I Claim This Credit?
The Loan Interest Credit can be applied as a credit against the
taxpayer‚Äôs adjusted gross income tax (IC 6-3-1 through 6-3-7),
insurance premium tax (IC 27-1-18-2), and financial institution
tax (IC 6-5.5). A copy of Schedule LIC must be enclosed
with the return; otherwise, the credit will be disallowed. The
credit amount calculated on the LIC is to be taken as a credit
against your tax liability on the return in the order listed above
after first applying other credits allowed under IC 6-3.1-1-2.
Refer to Income Tax Information Bulletin #66 for additional
information. Please see the instructions for your tax return to
determine where the credit should be entered on the various
tax forms.

What if I Do Not Use All of My Credit?
Any unused credit may be carried over to the next eligible tax
return to be filed up to 10 years from the date of the loan until
all credit has been used or the enterprise zone terminates.
Note: A taxpayer is not entitled to a carryback or refund of any
unused credit. The statute does allow the taxpayer to carry
forward any unused credit.
What if I Am an Entity Exempt from
Adjusted Gross Income Tax?
Entities exempt from adjusted gross income tax under
IC 6-3-2-2.8(2) may ‚Äúpass through‚Äù the credit to shareholders,
partners, beneficiaries, or members of the pass-through entity.
A pass-through entity is an S corporation, a partnership, a trust,
a limited liability company, or a limited liability partnership. Each
member‚Äôs tax credit is calculated by multiplying the total credit
available by the percentage of the entity‚Äôs distributive income
to which the shareholder, partner, beneficiary, or member is
entitled. The pro rata share of the calculated credit is reported
by the entity on each unit-holder‚Äôs Schedule IN K-1. A copy
of Schedule LIC or IN K-1 must be enclosed with the return
to claim your share of the credit.

editor: solutions to drug problem

****** McBarnes_letter_to_the_editor:_solutions_to_drug_problem ******
    * Published on September 19, 2016
    * under Mayor_Updates, News

Dear Editor:
Communities have issues of all types at all times. Some (we hope most) are
positive issues demonstrating progress. Some, unfortunately, are negative and
ongoing with Frankfort‚Äôs drug problem falling into this category.
First and foremost, as city leaders we are acutely aware of the drug epidemic
in our city and our officers work diligently every day to combat the problem.
That said, the answer to the drug epidemic is not found in government, not in
any politician. In 1971, President Nixon declared war on drugs. How far have we
really advanced in the past 45 years? In my personal estimation the drug
problem has only worsened.
Yes, we want to lock up the bad guys. Yes, we will catch them. Our officers are
disrupting drug crime in our city at a consistent rate and at high levels.
Statistics prove this fact. When compared to this time last year, there has
been a 21% increase in adult drug violation arrests. In 2016, drug arrests have
made up 30% of the Police Department‚Äôs overall adult arrests. When compared
to this same time last year, there has been a 45% increase in DUI adult arrests
Every officer, firefighter and EMT in our community is equipped with and
trained to use Nalaxone, an opioid reversing agent which has saved countless
lives over the past few months in Frankfort.
We always will work to become better at disrupting drug rings in our city.
Believe me, I wouldn‚Äôt want to be a drug dealer in Frankfort right now. I
know our officers. I know how much they care and how good they are at their
jobs. They can detect the slightest sign of drugs during routine traffic stops
which often lead to major drug busts.
Locally and nationally, we point to police officers in our society and say,
‚Äúfix the drug problem, fix the mental health issues, fix race relations.‚Äù I
suppose law enforcement officials are easy targets. We point to government as
well. Government plays a crucial role in society, but it‚Äôs not the cure for
everything. It rarely is the cure for anything.
The reality: it‚Äôs impossible to police and legislate our way out of this drug
epidemic.
We all need to take ownership of our drug problem. We all need to be
ministering and showing love to others. We all need to diligently pray for
healing. We all must continue to fight to erase the stigma mental illness and
addiction bring with it. We all have a part to play.
We have the greatest rehab clinic known to man right here in our community:
church. The Body of Christ. Let‚Äôs motivate our churches. Let‚Äôs inspire
others to go out and make a meaningful difference in someone‚Äôs life. That one
positive contact full of love and hope could save that life.
I stand ready to do all I can to help the people of my hometown. We ALL must
lead with the love of Jesus every single day if we want to truly make an impact
in the war against drugs.
I understand as mayor I‚Äôm an easy target to demand solutions from, to direct
anger at and that‚Äôs okay because that‚Äôs what I signed up for when I took
this office. But let‚Äôs be clear, government is not the answer. It can play a
role in the progress of curbing this evil, but for our community to overcome
this monumental obstacle of drugs, we need to ask ourselves how we can better
serve our neighbors. I have complete faith in my hometown and in each of you
that together, we will do just that.
Mayor Chris McBarnes

HUD Update: HUD CHARGES FIFTH THIRD
BANK, MORTGAGE BROKER WITH
DISCRIMINATING AGAINST COUPLE WITH
DISABILITIES
Bank allegedly required medical documentation of disabilities
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced that it
is charging, Fifth Third Bank, Fifth Third Mortgage Company and Cranbrook
Mortgage Corporation with discriminating against a couple with disabilities who
were attempting to refinance their home mortgage. HUD‚Äôs charge alleges that
the Cincinnati, Ohio-based mortgage lender and the Clinton Township,
Michigan-based mortgage broker required unnecessary medical documentation in
order to qualify the couple for a Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loan.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to deny or discriminate in the terms and
conditions of a mortgage or loan modification based on disability, race, color,
religion, national origin, sex, or family status, including imposing different
application or qualification criteria.
The case came to HUD‚Äôs attention after a married couple that receives Social
Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits filed a complaint claiming that their
application for an FHA-insured home refinance loan was unfairly
denied. According to HUD‚Äôs charge, the lender and mortgage broker made
statements and employed written policies requiring the couple to provide
physician statements to establish continuance of SSDI income. The charge alleges
that at the time of the couple‚Äôs loan, Fifth Third‚Äôs underwriting policy explicitly
specified a physician‚Äôs statement as appropriate evidence for establishing
continuance of disability income.
While lenders may verify an applicant‚Äôs income amount and source, they may not
place higher qualification standards on applicants who receive disability
income. The couple did not provide the requested physician statements, and
Cranbrook and Fifth Third denied the loan application.

A Note from Chairperson Penny Hughes
Serving as a Commissioner on the Human Rights Commission over the years has been
a real eye opener for me. We receive complaints every day from people who
believe they have experienced discrimination of one kind or another. When cases
deal with their race, color or national origin, persons who bring a charge of
discrimination presume they were fired because of racial attitudes that exist in the
minds of their bosses. When they were denied housing or an accommodation, when
they were followed throughout a grocery or department store or when they were treated poorly at a
restaurant it is easy to presume discrimination.
Movies like The Help and The Butler help us to see how prejudice can lead to discrimination. More recent
events remind us, like the shooting of young Trayvon Martin when walking home in his own neighborhood
and was presumed to be a thief. We saw how Oprah had enough when she was told by a sales clerk she
couldn‚Äôt afford an expensive purse. It is no wonder people presume discrimination when they have
experienced such attitudes all their lives and had to deal with them.
We are currently asking Mishawaka and St. Joseph County to allow us to handle investigations in cases that
come to us from outside South Bend. We must tell these citizens we have no jurisdiction to investigate
their claims. The County‚Äôs and Mishawaka‚Äôs anti-discrimination ordinances will have to match South
Bend‚Äôs, but this could save thousands of dollars in them hiring a director and training investigators, staff and
commissioners, not to mention saving in attorney fees. Our Executive Director, Lonnie Douglas, and staff
do an excellent job in anti-discrimination training for corporations which hopefully will lead to fewer
complaints in the future.
Penny Hughes, Chairperson, Human Rights Commission
