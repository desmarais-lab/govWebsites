definitively whether anyone   risk instead    screening tool  help identify places  industrial pollution might pose problems question  tried  find  school   database    answer today collected data   us department  education   least two dozen states   attempt  account   many public parochial  private schools  possible   cases states might   submitted   recent addresses   new schools   cases schools  moved  closed since  data  reported today used  best data  government made available   know   school    included   database please email us  question    mean   school ranks low compared   schools answer experts say  low ranking means  school  probably exposed  fewer chemicals  industrial sources  thats      clean bill  health  model includes  emissions  large industrial  government facilities    account  toxic chemicals released  smaller businesses  automobiles question  see  chemicals  industries associated   school   answer  happens   model indicates  low pollution levels around  school   cases  levels reported   facility   low   meaningful  mean  model indicates  chemicals   air  means  estimated   extremely low levels heard environmental  school officials   state say  information  offer  full picture  whats really happening near  school   true answer today used   current version   model  contains data    sense  represents  snapshot  time   pollution might   like   locations   companies say curbed emissions since   news release  department  environmental protection said analysis fails  take  account mobile sources  can greatly elevate health risks thats correct experts tell us    identified   tip   pollution iceberg    pointed   sources   cars  smaller polluters might contribute  much  five  six times  level  pollution   model  used shows question       information answer  first step   see whether  company   government model indicates  responsible  still operating   reported  emissions correctly although  model   governments  gauge  industrial pollution  emissions reports  uses come   means    companies might  gone   business  cut production one way  check   see whether  company reported emissions last year also contact  local school district  ask officials   know    able  direct   local environmental authorities  can tell  whether   monitored  air nearby  can also contact environmental advocacy groups  might help  find relatively inexpensive ways  determine whats   air groups   global community monitor work  local groups  develop ways  check air quality   communities question   know  sure   pull  kids  school  put  house

first scientists certain  specific chemicals affect children kids  particularly vulnerable  still growing   breathe  air  adults  safety standards  based largely   chemicals affect adults   workplace second   companies   responsible   pollution sometimes  spills  accidents   much larger amounts  toxic chemicals  released  model   account   third thousands   smaller businesses obligated  report  emissions   government  means monitoring  air might    way  account    release fourth   push  answers  one else might laws   states require school  environmental authorities  examine toxic chemicals   air outside schools question    air inside  school answer  model deals   air outside  building  experts say air quality outside affects air quality inside  probably   lot  pollutants collecting   inside says executive director   nonprofit group healthy schools network   need   close monitoring  find  whats actually going   need  look indoors  well question   two schools near     different rankings answer  measure industrial pollution across  country  model divides   thousands  squares  measuring one kilometer  one kilometer   estimates  potential impact  industrial pollution     areas  schools within   square     ranking sometimes however two schools near      different squares  rankings   different sometimes especially  chemicals  likely  travel  far   air  differences
