Mr. Michael Huber
Office of Enterprise Development
City of Indianapolis
200 E. Washington St., RM2501
Indianapolis, IN 46204
Dear Mr. Huber:
SMG is pleased to offer to the City of Indianapolis our response to your Request for
Information and Qualifications for management of the Indiana Convention Center and Lucas
Oil Stadium. Through this process, as well as any subsequent Request for Proposals, we hope
to share with you our 32-year track record of professionalism, dedication and growth in areas
directly tied to your goals. We are confident that our track record of managing major market
stadiums and convention centers and, more importantly, multiple venues in many markets
will provide the best assurance of a successful relationship between the City, the Capital
Improvement Board and SMG.
We are very proud of similar relationships we have with many other municipalities, teams and
local hospitality communities. In addition to the real assets in our care, you will also find a track
record of smooth transitions, providing employees with new tools and career opportunities
that quickly overshadow any trepidation they may have before transition. Equally important,
is the comfort level you will find from your current facility clients, many of whom already work
with our team in other markets around the country. Simple conversations with other cities,
employees, tenants and clients will bear this out.
We are quite familiar with your facilities and the challenges you face, much like many other
facility owners around the country. More importantly, we are confident in the benefits we
can provide to all of the constituent groups involved with your facilities. As the first private
company to even venture into the field of managing publicly owned facilities, the pages that
follow provide not just a history of our company, but a history of the industry itself. In fact, it
was a NFL stadium and convention/special event facility that was our first account in 1977, and
one we proudly manage for the State of Louisiana today.
When reviewing different management options, the question typically asked is… why choose
one company instead of another? We believe SMG’s proven ability to generate business,
implement world class customer service initiatives, while operating the facility at maximum
efficiency, separates us from other options.
SMG’s venue management team provides services to more than 100 municipalities, including
7 stadiums with more than 60,000 seats each, and 9 convention centers with more than
300,000 square feet of prime exhibit space each. We have worked with more Super Bowls,
Olympic events and Global Events than any other team.
We can only hope to help host and deliver more important events to the ICC and Lucas Oil
Stadium.
Sincerely,
Wes Westley
President & CEO / SMG

The SMG Management Advantage
Depth of corporate resources, personnel and experience
In addition to our on-site staff, SMG employs 60 full time management and executive staff
in its executive offices, dedicated to supporting the daily needs of our Clients. This includes
corporate expertise in all operational disciplines, including finance and accounting, risk
management, operations, human resources and sales & marketing.
Well capitalized
Though an affiliate of American Capital, all of SMG’s qualifications – financial and otherwise
– are its own, and not that of any parent, predecessor or subsidiary firm. As such, SMG is a
standalone firm, with a strong financial history and sound current position.
Broad network of facilities
SMG manages an expansive and varied list of facilities, including a number of contracts that
are measured in decades, not years. More importantly, our core strengths are unparalleled
in your key assets: convention centers and stadiums. With 67 and 9, respectively, in our
portfolio we offer not only an established set of best practices, but transferable knowledge and
resources that can only enhance all aspects of your facilities, from financial performance to
customer service and operations.
Strong Brand Recognition & Industry Partnerships
Though we hope to be recognized locally, SMG is certainly not a consumer brand. As a
“business to business” brand, we are well known to the key clients, partners and affiliate
groups that are most important to the ICCC and LOS. We offer key relationships with important
sport bodies like the National Football League as well convention and trade show planners at
Advanstar, Experient and MarketPlace Events. These are all organizations that will have an
immediate recognition of who we are, and take comfort in a seamless transition to their own
benefit, as well as yours.
Experienced Operators
Between our dedicated corporate staff and national team of facility managers, we literally offer
thousands of years of combined experience. In us, you will find a group of highly educated and
dedicated professionals. The benefits to a new venue joining our network are clear. No matter
the issue, challenge or question at hand, we can readily find the right person or people to help
enhance the operation.
Proven Management Systems
As a generic industry sector, “management companies” can run the gamut from international
conglomerates to boutique firms run from a remote office. As you get to know us better, you
will find a range of specific systems and practices built during the past 32 years since our
founding. We offer a full suite of proprietary management tools including robust accounting
and reporting, facility operations and maintenance to web based booking and marketing
programs that connect all of our venues and our corporate offices. We look forward to sharing
these systems with you at the appropriate time.

Municipal Client Experience

Public Sector/Government Experience
SMG works closely with facility owners to ensure that goals are being addressed and met.
Eighty (80%) of the facilities managed by SMG are government-owned, whether by a City,
State, County or Government Authority. SMG enjoys strong working relationships with all our
Clients, as evidenced by our impressive renewal rate.
Although each of our management contracts is unique to the individual account, they all
contain requirements for reporting and the delivery of operational, marketing and capital
improvement plans, which are subject to approval by the Client. These plans utilize information
derived from our facilities worldwide, as well as from our dedicated corporate support, all
designed to develop plans that exceed the goals and objectives of our Clients.
Structure of Relationship
While there are exceptions, SMG is typically contracted to represent the facility owner as an
agent and as such, we work at the direction of our clients and under the restrictions of a clientapproved budget. SMG assigns a General Manager – and certain Senior staff – to operate the
facility and execute the management plan in accordance with the objectives set forth by the
Client. SMG, through its local General Manager, will report directly to the Client in a manner
established by the Client. An SMG Senior Executive is designated to oversee and supervise the
account to ensure proper contractual compliance, delivery of services, communication and
support from the Corporate office.
Client Accountability
SMG accepts the highest level of fiduciary responsibility and accountability to the Clients we
serve. Our ability to meet that standard is unique in the industry.
·· Our Corporate Finance Department provides supervision and support in all fiscal areas
including internal controls, risk management, data processing, audit and cash management.
A comprehensive accounting manual created by our financial professionals offers the staff
at our facilities a complete set of procedures and policies to be followed.
·· When a facility joins our network, its monthly financial statement is formatted to comply
with both the Client’s requirements and our standards. This ensures that the revenues are
properly recognized, and events are recorded as individual profit centers which enables us to
identify weak areas and evaluate the changes that must take place to improve performance.
·· Internal audit reviews are conducted periodically, often unannounced, and address all
areas that affect the bottom line, with particular focus on areas with greatest exposure to
fraud and irregularity: box office, concessionaire operations, cash management, payroll,
purchasing, etc. These audits examine the facility’s operation for opportunities to improve.
·· Our management team, with input from our Client and key corporate administrators, prepare
yearly statements of facility performance objectives, which are then incorporated into fiscal
yearly plans encompassing issues such as cash flow management, short-term investment
strategies, tax planning and payroll administration.
·· Annual budgets, including capital improvement requests, are submitted to our Clients for
review and approval. They contain a condensed income statement, an event analysis, and a
management fee calculation, along with key facts, assumptions, and trend analysis on which
the budget was based.
Communications
Our facility owner Clients receive constant and concise communication via monthly reports,
e-zines and regular meetings with our staff.

We are able to bring in Event Managers who have worked with rotational convention,
corporate, or tradeshow events in our other venues, providing a level of confidence and
comfort for our users that cannot be matched in the industry. SMG has the ability to provide
the highest level of service to any and all.

SMG Proprietary Programs and Systems
SMG Maintenance
SMG understands that the facilities we are entrusted with have
assets that need to be preserved and maintained properly
in a cost-effective manner. SMG has developed a proprietary
software program, SMG Maintenance, which is implemented at
all SMG-managed venues. This program has been customized
to the industry and allows our venue managers to completely organize and automate their
preventive maintenance program. This in-depth database of product information, operational
procedures and standards, as well as, troubleshooting tools ensure all SMG-managed facilities’
“back-of-house” operations receive proper attention.
K’NEKT SALES TRAINING PROGRAM
K’nekt is an extensive and ongoing program dedicated to training,
developing, and observing our employees to ensure that our customers
and their patrons will enjoy the best experience possible. The program
was developed and customized by SMG, and its components cover
every step in creating a successful event.
Making the connection - it begins with the first sales call. Hosting,
attending, promoting an event at any facility is more than just a casual occurrence. People are
booking an event for business reasons or to commemorate special events. The salesperson
needs to “k’nekt” with the client, sharing their enthusiasm for the event and their commitment
to making it right. The response to the program has been fantastic and is proven in the
customer satisfaction survey results received from our facilities.
SMGBOOKING.COM
SMGBooking.com is a proprietary web-based system that gives
real time online access to our booking calendar and customer
relationship management database for all of our convention
center and stadium staff. This allows us to quickly disseminate
and review new booking opportunities from our corporate
convention and entertainment booking offices through each
property on the system.
It also allows entertainment agents, promoters and tour managers like CAA and William
Morris Endeavor an “unprecedented level of access” to real-time booking availability for all
entertainment venues managed by the company, adding to the ease of routing new tours to
SMG venues before any others are even considered.
SMGBooking.com is a great opportunity to leverage our position as a market leader and use
the latest technology to provide added benefits and services to all of our Clients. The tool
allows SMG venue managers across the country to share information on-line in real time.
SMG FACILITY OPERATIONS INTRANET SITE
SMG maintains a web-based intranet site for its facility network. This program allows
venue managers and their operations personnel to access the latest in venue technology,
engineering, maintenance, cleaning techniques, capital asset management as well as many
other aspects of facility operations. General Managers and their Operations personnel can
‘chat’ on line, post information about successful programs that they have experienced, or
get information from their colleagues about the specific performance of certain types of
equipment, product or service. The goal: to improve the efficiency and performance of our
managers by expanding their knowledge base.

Case Studies

Large Scale Multi-Venue Complexes
BACKGROUND
Several of the NFL Stadiums, major Arenas and large Convention Centers operated by SMG
are part of multi-venue complexes owned by a single municipal client. Four (4) SMG operated
multi-venue complexes have been highlighted in this section as ‘case studies’ due to their
parallel with the facilities in Indianapolis. We have found that common management of venues
located within a close geographical proximity of one another can lead to cost efficiencies and
operational savings for owners. Efficiencies are maximized by operating these multi-venue
properties as a single business unit accountable to the owner. Areas such as, shared personnel,
equipment, scheduling and third-party vendor management combine to create savings and
value. We believe this operational concept can be applied to the city-owned Indianapolis
Convention Center and Lucas Oil Stadium, and will result in improved performance as well as
cost savings.
These ‘case studies’ provide insight as to the similarity between the facilities, diversity of
events, the range and scope of SMG services provided and how efficiencies are achieved.
COMMON CHARACTERISTICS
Each of the four SMG operated multi-venue complexes in the case studies share common traits
and characteristics with the Indianapolis facilities, which makes them a relevant comparison.
These characteristics create a correlative data points for purposes of reference.
Major Sports Tenants: Each complex has one or more major Sports teams as tenants. These
Sports tenants have long-term leases that entitle them to certain facility-related revenue
streams
Large-Scale Events: Each complex has hosted numerous high-profile events with national or
international audiences. SMG has a seasoned team of experienced event personnel at each
major venue that can be called upon for event support
Diverse Event Mix: Each facility has a diverse array of annual events creating non-sports team
revenue. There are well-managed operations personnel to handle event day activity, complete
conversions and manage production.
Common Municipal Ownership: Facilities owned by a single municipal owner enables several
facilities to be combined as one single business unit within the complex. It also allows
for shared services, shared equipment use and a better allocation of resources. Common
ownership also contributes to a more streamlined management reporting function and
organizational structure.
Scope of Services: In multi-venue facility operations SMG typically provides a wide range of
management services to accommodate every facet of the Client needs. This approach leads to
a consolidated scope of services, which in turn leads to improved performance accountability
to the owner.

Case Studies

MANAGEMENT and Operating EFFiCIENCIES
In a multi-venue setting, operating efficiency is achieved when there is consolidation of
services into one business unit. Facility utilization can be maximized and operating cost can be
reduced. The following are specific examples of how these efficiencies can be achieved:
Scheduling and Booking: A centralized booking and scheduling system maximizes date
utilization and helps avoid date conflicts within the complex. A single point of contact for
booking and scheduling events at each venue in the complex is convenient and easy for users.
Use of the smg.booking.com software system allows the venue to connect within the SMG
facility network for information and date availability for touring acts. In addition, SMG has
experience working with a number of nationally recognized booking systems.
Personnel: Full-time and part-time personnel can be crossed trained and shared among
facilities within the complex. There is an elimination of certain overhead and staffing
requirements and there is a single management reporting structure within the complex.
Information such as event work orders can be easily transmitted and shared by employees
throughout the complex.
Supplies and Equipment: Shared supplies and equipment eliminates duplication reduces the
initial capital investment, as well as on-going replacement cost. Less equipment inventory also
reduces annual maintenance costs
Shared Infrastructure (i.e., parking, plant facilities): Consolidated supervision over parking
prices, hours of operation and parking personnel, plus the ability to enhance daily contract
parking revenues through a coordinated approach to operating hours. There is also improved
coordination of scheduling between facilities to avoid date conflicts
Common Operating Systems: Consolidated management systems lead to enhanced
accountability and performance. Consistency is created with in-house Event Work Orders,
which eliminates errors and mistakes.
Capital Asset Management: Capital Asset repair and replacement procedures are enhanced
as a result of a common supervision. This allows the owner to improve planning for major
capital replacement.
Vendor and Sub-contractor Relationships: Combined operation of facilities leads to
increased buying power and leverage with suppliers due to increased volume.
Financial Management and Accounting (Integrated): Multi-venue operations allow for
an integrated accounting and financial reporting system. This is important when allocating
overhead and labor between facilities, and helps lower indirect costs.

SMG Approach To Stadium Operations
SMG-managed venues house more than 70 professional and collegiate tenants, 19 of
which are NCAA teams. Our depth of experience and quality control sets us apart from our
competition and allows us to meet the needs of our sports tenants, as well as other users.
SMG understands the importance of meeting the variety of needs such as, scheduling, event
services, space requirements, staffing, security, housekeeping, conversions, premium seating,
food service and guest services.
There are a number of attributes that distinguish SMG from the competition when it comes to
Stadium and Arena Operation, many of which are highlighted below:
Quality Operating Standards: SMG takes pride in delivering the highest quality operating
standards in its Stadiums and Arenas. We utilize ‘best practices’ procedures in all of our
buildings and constantly monitor performance of our in-house staff, third party vendors and
sub-contractors. SMG provides extensive training for all of its event-day personnel in order
to deliver the best customer experience possible. We work closely with our professional
sports leagues and tenants to assure compliance with established rules relating to game day
presentation.
Event Management Expertise: Our event personnel offer professional expertise and
experience unmatched in the industry. Many of our Stadium and Arena professionals have
worked some of the largest events in the world including NFL Super Bowls, NCAA Final Fours,
NBA All-Star games and many others. Well established operating procedures allow these
professionals to provide a safe and secure game day experience for the fan. We have been
innovative in developing game day operating techniques, crowd management and incident
response systems.
Broad Network of Facilities: SMG has a very broad network of Stadiums, Arenas, Theatres
and other entertainment venues. This network allows us to share a wealth of information
between our facility operators in a manner that is unparalleled in the industry. Our team works
hard to share leads or relevant data with one another. This often allows us to generate greater
programming within our managed facilities.
Major and Minor League Tenants: SMG manages numerous facilities in the U.S. that have both
major and minor league tenants. Our sport tenant relationships are critical to the operational
and financial components of our municipal clients and the vitality of the community. We work
closely with the Sports tenants on issues such as scheduling, game day services, staffing and
guest services to ensure their success.
Sports Governing Bodies: SMG has built relationships
with a number of Sports Governing Bodies and
Major Professional Sports Leagues over the years.
Our facilities have hosted events ranging from the
NCAA Final Four to the NFL Super Bowl. These
long-standing relationships have been established
through a track record of success and are built upon
professionalism and deliverable results.

Quality live entertainment provides enjoyment
for the public in our various markets,
while providing improvement to the
bottom-line.

Major Market Convention Center Experience
Background
While the stadium aspect is clearly a focal point for the community at large, the convention
center focus is equally important from an economic development standpoint. The success or
failure of the center to work both within the hospitality community and the client community
that primarily exists outside the local market can be critical in achieving the development
goals on which the center is founded.
More than 15 years ago, SMG created a separate Convention Center Division to better serve
the unique needs of the Convention and Hospitality industry. Today, with almost 70 major
convention facilities, SMG is not just recognized as the preeminent management firm for
convention centers, we are sought after as leaders in the industry. The Division’s business plan
is based on three basic premises:
·· Hire, train and retain the best professionals, providing them with the tools for success
·· Maintain the most efficient and customer friendly systems and processes
·· Increase the opportunities for new events and enhanced revenues
This ensures that the municipalities we serve receive the highest return for their investment in
the Convention product.
Common Characteristics
Just like our stadium examples earlier, SMG’s network of major market convention centers
share many common traits with the ICC that will compliment the facility and the destination.
National Clients & Rotational events: Our initial database scan shows that in the past five
years, the ICC has hosted 23 events that are past or current clients of other SMG managed
facilities. Our research will also show how many more of our current clients could be prospects
for the ICC and ICVA to pursue.
Major events of economic or political importance: SMG managed convention centers have
had the opportunity to host some of the most significant events held in the United States;
among them the 2009 Pittsburgh Summit (G-20 Economic Summit), NCAA Championships and
facilities for the 2002 Olympic Games in Salt Lake City, UT, international meetings such as the
Microsoft’s Global Business Review, American College of Physicians, and the American Dental
Association, and the 2008 Democratic National Convention. These experiences bring a wealth
of knowledge to both the booking process and hosting of high exposure events.
Operational Demands & Green Initiatives: SMG has extensive experience with the
management, operation and maintenance of major convention centers is invaluable in
our ability to ensure the utmost care and preservation of the community’s asset. We
recognize that a Center of the size and complexity of the ICC requires the best in class asset
management systems and our experience with similar centers allows us to apply these
standards. In addition, SMG has been the leader in sustainable facility operations with
signature programs such as Moscone Center’s recycling program, the Atlantic City Convention
Center’s status as the largest solar installation in the industry, and Pittsburgh’s David L.
Lawrence Convention Center’s recognition as the largest LEED Gold Certified Convention
Center in the United States.

Case Studies

SMG Approach to Convention Center Operations
The Convention Center holds a vital place in the economic infrastructure of any community.
Our experience in almost 70 convention destinations allows us to understand completely that
the community’s return on its investment from the convention industry is predicated on the
superior service provided by the municipality’s largest investment.
It is the understanding of the role that the Convention Center must play that has led us to
develop a number of business strategies that will distinguish SMG managed Centers from the
others.
Relationships with Clients/Facility Users
While it is important to maintain the CVB partnerships above, it is vital to maintain
relationships with regional and national clients – the decision-makers who are either current
or prospective users of the complex. We are the only company to hold national contracts and
preferred relationships with some of the major producers of multiple meetings in the industry.
This offers SMG facilities preferred placement with the decision makers from these firms, a
streamlined contracting process and a recognition among the planners that they can expect
and will receive the highest level of service at an SMG managed facility.
In addition to these relationships with event organizers, SMG maintains close partnerships
with the major trade associations and publications. The effect of these partnerships offers
SMG managed convention centers, and their CVB partners, the opportunity to participate in a
wide range of trade show and advertising programs at a significantly reduced rate with greater
exposure.
Partnership with the Convention & Visitors Association
There is no firm in the country that works with as many destination marketing organizations
(convention and visitors bureaus) as we do. This is a prized relationship and provides unique
perspective and opportunities as we seek the same relationship with the ICVA.
We have no preconceived concepts for how a Center and CVA must work together. In fact we
work under a variety of different models, each developed in good faith with our local partners
based on what is best for the destination and the venue. We have helped create entirely new
models that have revolutionized the ‘three-legged stool’ approach (including the Center/SMG,
the convention bureau and the municipality) that supports the hospitality community. Like
the team in Indianapolis, we have found many parallels with the path and partnership we have
taken in Denver. Given some market parallels with Indianapolis, our “Denver Alliance” might be
an interesting model to explore with the ICVA and municipal teams.

Case Studies

Regional sales support network
SMG’s national and regional sales teams
maintain ongoing contact with key decisionmakers. Our booking hotline is often the first
call for clients looking to scan the landscape for
new SMG-managed facilities. They know that we
can turn around information on “rates, dates and space”
on as many as fifty or sixty facilities within our network.
Our Sales professionals also have a regional network that
works cooperatively to generate new sales leads and event
opportunities for their partner SMG Centers. This regional
supervision ensures that our filed sales team is performing at
the peak of their ability to produce new event opportunities for
the Center and the community it serves.
Partnership with the community
SMG believes that each Convention Center holds a valuable place in the fabric of the
community it serves and, while we will bring all of the systems and resources we have as a
company, we still maintain the flexibility to blend these with local culture and community.
Whether it’s the aloha spirit of Hawai’i or the southern hospitality of Charleston or Savannah,
we are keenly aware that out of town guests (and locals) should leave the facilities with the
experience that is uniquely local.
Furthermore, we always encourage our staff – at all levels – to maintain our corporate and
social responsibility in areas that excite or interest them. Whether the general manager is a
Rotarian or the sales assistant works at a local food bank, the facility staff should serve as
model citizens as we represent this centerpiece venue.
Finally, each center hosts events that hold a vital place in the social, educational, cultural and/
or business community. SMG has extensive experience working with the organizers of these
events to ensure that they are able to achieve their goals and exceed their expectations.
SMG firmly believes that this focus is an equally important aspect of their mission in the
communities we serve.
Focus on people
SMG has long recognized that each and every team member is an ambassador for the
community in which they work and that the experience that the user or visitor enjoys will be
the reason they will want to return again and again. SMG’s proprietary training programs,
entitled k’nekt, are designed to empower each team member with the responsibility (and
the excitement) of providing first class service. The program’s customer service program,
customized for the culture of the community we serve, reminds the team that their connection
to the customer is the key ingredient to the experience. The k’nekt sales program is the only
program designed specifically for the convention industry and focuses on that first contact
with the customer and making sure that it sets the stage for a successful relationship.

Case Studies

Care for the community’s asset
SMG recognizes the investment that the community has in the Center and takes seriously its
responsibility to care for that asset. The presentation that the Center makes on the visitor is
integral to the perception of the community by that visitor. SMG also understands to absolute
need to maximize the lifespan of the asset and its systems and ensure that they are operating
at peak efficiency. To that end, SMG has a proprietary building management system, SMG
Maintenance that tracks each system’s preventative maintenance schedule and performance.
This system allows the SMG corporate team to observe and monitor these schedules and
to recommend changes that may be necessary to ensure top performance. SMG has also
launched an Operations web-site focused on the transmission of key information to the field
teams. Included on this site are SMG’s Best Practices where the best in class standards are
provided for the field teams to follow.

Transition Plan
Through the experience of transitioning many facilities,
new openings or expansion start-ups, SMG has developed a
comprehensive “Facility Transition Manual” detailing more
than 400 specific tasks. We strive to anticipate every aspect
of this complex evolutionary process. We will work closely
with the Client to implement a detailed plan for a seamless
transition to private management.

Section 1: Scope, Approach and Methodology


Facilities operations management strategies, including a description of any similar capital
improvement or facility Respondent has been managing and/or operating in the past five (5) years and
with a specific emphasis on engagements lasting ten (10) years or longer. This item should fully
demonstrate Respondent’s depth and experience with strategies utilized in the management and
operation of capital improvements and facilities;

UGL Unicco®’s Facilities Operations Management Strategies are formal written processes and procedures
that take an operation from initial start-up and transition to steady state operations. These processes were
initially developed in the early 1990’s as a specific process for starting up new accounts. They have since
evolved from transitioning client portfolios to transforming facilities operations organizations utilizing
best-in-class practices. This transition and transformation process is implemented by a group of seasoned
specialists from UGL Unicco’s Facilities Management Solutions (FMS) Group. The process starts with a
formal or, in some cases, informal award of a new assignment. The transition team will, based on the RFP
requirements, build a year one bottoms-up budget for the expense side of the account. The outcome will
be aligned with the clients’ accounting system to insure comparative data can be captured from previous
years for cost evaluation. Once the baseline budget is developed, a review of the past 1-, 3- and 5-year
maintenance data, if available, is conducted. The review looks at current preventative maintenance
schedules, corrective work order history and age of equipment. Using client historical data, along with
UGL Unicco’s benchmark data, areas are identified that may require enhanced maintenance schedules,
recommendations for equipment replacements and/or upgrades. Once client approves suggested changes
the yearly budget is adjusted accordingly.
Similar to the expense management of a client assignment, the same team manages capital plans by first
conducting a facility condition assessment or FCA. The ultimate goal of the FCA is to develop a capital
plan for a client portfolio that balances available funds with immediate needs and sets a strategy for longterm management of a client portfolio to insure best use of funds and reliability of the facility and its
infrastructure. To accomplish this, UGL Unicco utilizes a standardized FCA methodology that is
customized to the output, tracking and reporting needs of the client. Some examples of finding
classifications are as follows; requirements are categorized using:

Priorities:
 Priority One: Immediate Concerns
 Priority Two: Short-Term Concerns (1-2 years)
 Priority Three: Long-Term Concerns (3-5 years)
 Priority Four: Improvements
 Priority Five: New Code Requirements

Deficiency Categories:
 Code Compliance – Accessibility, Building Code & Life
 Operations – Energy, Maintenance & Security
 Functionality – Mission, Modernization, Plant Adaptation, Obsolescence & Capacity
 Integrity – Appearance, Reliability & Beyond Rated Life
 Environmental – Air/Water Quality, Asbestos, Lead & PCB
 Renewal – Updating Appearance

Demonstration of Respondent’s capacity and capability to satisfy factors such cost control, quality of
work, and the ability to commit to and deliver on budgetary objectives, cost estimates and projected
cost savings; and

UGL Unicco is confident in our ability to exceed performance expectations. As such, we encourage our
clients to enter into a performance-based contract to drive results. Based on our experience with similar
organizations, we are willing to negotiate a performance-based contract with a fee-at-risk and reward
structure for specific key metrics such as cost control and quality. This will ensure operational alignment
to deliver the highest overall value. We are confident that a mutually agreed upon scorecard that contains
the key performance indicators with corresponding rewards and penalties will drive best-in-class
performance. The scorecard would be delivered in a format and reviewed at a frequency mutually agreed
upon with the client.
Included in our Appendix Section, please reference sample service level agreements that we implement at
sites to monitor performance, control cost and ensure service deliverables are met.

Dear Mr. Huber:
Sodexo is excited about this opportunity to present our capabilities and qualifications for facilities
operations and management services at the Indiana Convention Center (ICC) and Lucas Oil Stadium

Based on your stated objectives in the RFI document, we understand the City is seeking private-sector

managing multiple services and delivering cost savings, as well as enhancing growth by maximizing
usage of the ICC and LOS.
Sodexo has what it takes to meet your needs and achieve your objectives. We are unlike many other
service providers that offer food and facilities management services. We are unique in the fact that in
addition to our experience and expertise, we focus on innovative comprehensive service solutions in a
holistic approach that helps drive your organization’s success – from a better image, better operation, to a
better bottom-line.
We see a tremendous opportunity to create something truly unique for the ICC and LOS. Our strategy
will include a partnership with SodexoMAGIC, LLC, and the RK Group. SodexoMAGIC, LLC is the
joint venture between Sodexo, Inc., and Magic Johnson Enterprises, providing winning, comprehensive
management solutions for our clients at many locations including stadiums. The RK Group’s “boutique”
convention center operating model delivers a fresh approach to convention business. You will find more

hard work, exacting performance, and exceptional service that his mother expected.

Maximizing Quality, Minimizing Cost

Client-Centered Approach
Sodexo feels so strongly about our clients that we have adopted a global strategy to ensure we satisfy and
retain 100% of our clients. We achieve superior results by employing superior business practices and
tools, training, technology and reporting.
Business Planning
You can count on a detailed business plan, 100% auditable systems, and regularly scheduled reporting.
Our approach has proven results and creates a detailed operating history for our services to assist you with
future planning.
Annual Reviews, Quarterly Business Reviews and Monthly Reporting
You will receive regular, detailed reports demonstrating our ongoing performance in all areas of the
operation as well as year-to-date activity compared to budget.
Customer Feedback
On an ongoing basis, we conduct focus groups and tally customer survey cards, e-comments, and
comment cards. We’ll find out how we’re doing and—based on customer feedback—generate fresh ideas
for new and improved products.
Action Plans
We’ll create a list of obtainable goals for improving each aspect of the services we provide and put into
place the fresh ideas generated from the feedback we received from our focused monitoring systems and
processes.
Service Excellence and Customer Satisfaction Strategy
Growth and Guest Retention
Several studies have found that it costs about five times as much in time, money and resources to attract a
new customer as it does to retain an existing customer. We recognize that customer satisfaction influences
repeat purchases and word-of-mouth recommendations. Therefore, it is our top priority to maintain high
levels of service, be aware of customer expectations, continually improve our products and services
through innovation and training, and to empower our frontline employees to attend to every need of our
customers.
Ensuring and Measuring Customer Satisfaction
We seek continuous feedback from our customers through customer satisfaction measurements. Sodexo
utilizes several tools to capture client feedback on an on going basis, including annual and spring surveys.
We survey customers to help us keep a clear focus on what our customers like and uncover their needs and
displeasures. What are we doing right, and where can we make improvements?
Customer Surveys and Feedback
We are constantly attuned to the satisfaction of our customers, looking for new ways to improve our
products and services. We have a number of tools available to help us.
•
•
•

Comment cards provide ongoing feedback and enable us to identify problems quickly and
immediately take action.
Focus groups generate ideas for new or improved products and services. These Focus groups
can also be used for roundtable taste tests as we evaluate new recipes and station concepts.
Client satisfaction surveys, conducted annually, will give us your perspective on your

20

•

satisfaction, and the satisfaction of your employees and guests. This further enables us to
identify opportunities to refine our services and create and environment of continuous
improvement.
Online customer feedback forms get customer input electronically on the internet, allowing us
to quickly follow up with our customers. We can post discussion pages with comments and
responses, and compile summary reports for your review. A business plan will detail our
response to any areas identified for improvement. Sodexo is committed to continuously
delighting our customers with expert service.

Mystery Shopper Program
Mystery Shoppers help to reinforce the customer experience; therefore Sodexo has a mystery shopper program
available for use at ICC and LOS. Trained “customers” will be on premise weekly to become a guest and dine
in a number of restaurant venues. Their experience will be documented on well thought out forms and relayed
to Sodexo management. On-site and District Managers will communicate results to our clients and develop
corrective actions for continuous improvement of the guest experience.
Customer Service Training
Customer satisfaction is immensely important to all of our people, and we give them the training they
want and need to be their best. Customer service training modules—facilitated in 20-minute sessions—
cover topics such as:
• “FiSH” Training - by Stephen C. Lundin, Ph.D., Harry Paul, and John Christensen
• How to respond to a customer’s needs
• How to present a “service first” image
• The “Art of Communicating” with customers
• Recognizing internal and external customer needs
• How to consistently provide positive customer interaction
Client Benefits

Accounting and Financial Controls
Cost Management
Supplies and labor are the two largest expense components of foodservice and facilities operations and
must be managed with diligence. We use in-depth processes to effectively plan and optimize
performance. We ensure we have maximum staff during peak demand and control labor during low
demand. This ensures we provide ongoing extraordinary experiences while managing expenses to allow
us to provide a maximum return to you. The following are brief highlights of what makes us effective:
Food Production
Trends W@tch: Sodexo’s Supply Management, Strategic Planning, and R&D teams will provide your
operation with current trend data and cost projections. All menus and promotions will be created
using the freshest and most appropriate seasonal ingredients, and will take advantage of the
season’s best values.
Computerized Food Production System: Our Menu Essentials system enables managers to more
effectively track dining habits, inventories and productivity. It reduces the chefs’ and managers’
time spent in offices, planning and purchasing, so they can focus on customer service, quality and
program execution.
Supply Management: Sodexo purchases billions of dollars worth of food, services, supplies and
equipment every year. We maximize our purchasing power and value to our clients and customers
through our global, national and local supply management strategies.
Recipe and Portion Compliances: We create our recipes and portion sizes to satisfy normal appetites.
Recipe and portion compliance assures customer satisfaction with consistent quality products at
expected prices. Our chefs and managers have the flexibility to adjust portion sizes and recipes for
their individual operation.
Waste Chart: We minimize waste through extensive training and careful tracking. We minimize overproduction, pilferage, customer waste and inconsistent portioning. We closely track waste and
investigate any variances. We have achieved significant weekly savings with our waste chart
system.
Labor
Payroll: We complete daily audits of time cards to determine compliance with the master work
schedule. At the conclusion of the week, total hours for compensation purposes are consolidated on
a Payroll Time Report and forwarded to our corporate headquarters for processing. Each employee
is paid—by policy—to the nearest tenth of an hour, and checks are issued on a weekly basis.
Employee/Management Training Programs: An ongoing commitment to training provides not only a
customer service-oriented employee, but one that understands the importance of proper
recipe/portion compliance, proper food handling techniques, and other aspects that ultimately result
in greater savings.
Labor Optimization: We employ a proprietary labor optimization system that enables us to assess
both daily tasks and labor levels. We thoroughly assess the site tasks, labor requirements and
opportunities for synergy and cross training. We measure productivity using Sales (S) or
Customer Count (CC) per Labor Hour (LH) analysis. No universal S/LH or CC/LH formula
exists; it will be customized for your operation to account for the unique conditions and desired
service level.

Quality Management

22

Our proven quality management program will not only ensure consistently high standards throughout
every aspect of the ICC and LOS operations, it is a great tool to help us monitor and improve our
performance.
Our sanitation and safety programs are the most sophisticated in the industry and they exceed most state
and local regulatory standards. You and your guests can dine with confidence knowing that every
precaution has been taken according to Sodexo’s stringent food safety system- HACCP (Hazard Analysis
Critical Control Point). Our operation will fully comply with OSHA and local health ordinances.
Our business measurement metrics and financial reporting are industry leading and supported by our
cutting-edge technology.
We will be the best in class in every product, service and process. The following matrix indicates some of

November 24, 2009
Mr. Michael Huber
Office of Enterprise Development
200 E. Washington St.---Room 2501
Indianapolis, IN 46204
Dear Mr. Huber:
We have reviewed the City of Indianapolis’s “Request for Information and Qualifications,” dated October
20, 2009, concerning potential provider of services at the Indiana Convention Center (“ICC”) and Lucas
Oil Stadium (“LOS”). In response, Pacers Sports & Entertainment (“PS & E”) and Indianapolis
Convention & Visitors Association (“ICVA”) have initiated the formation of a partnership with two of the
world’s most qualified industry leaders; AEG, and Global Spectrum.
Pacers Sports & Entertainment is a very valuable and experienced operator of major facilities in this
community, having managed Market Square Arena from 1983 through 1999, and is now the current
operator/manager of Conseco Fieldhouse. In the 10 years of Conseco Fieldhouse, PS & E has continually
demonstrated its ability to manage and conduct events in a multi-purpose facility, having served over 17
million visitors at events ranging from Pacers and Fever games, World Swimming Championships, FFA
National Conventions, Big 10 Basketball Championships, rodeos, circus performances, hockey games/ice
shows, and many concerts and community events. Based on that experience, combined with the
familiarity of the many facets involved in operating facilities with the best interests of the community in
mind, PS & E is well-positioned to join with these partners to operate LOS and ICC.
Indianapolis Convention & Visitors Association is created to advance tourism and economic growth in
Indianapolis, and it is a natural part of this joint effort. Through its expertise in sales, marketing, and
public/media relations, the ICVA is continually one of the country’s leaders in attracting meetings,
conventions, and visitors to Indianapolis. Additionally, ICVA provides outstanding service to these many
visitors, whether they are here for a weekend get-away or to attend a convention or special event. The
ICVA fully understands that the economic success of this region is tied to its success, and the expertise of
the ICVA is delighted to be a part of this partnership.
Specifically, we propose that our organizations would be the leaders of this effort and form a partnership
with AEG Worldwide and Global Spectrum. This would combine the outstanding local commitment,
knowledge and marketing capabilities with two of the world’s most qualified industry leaders. We
anticipate being capable of providing complete support for the ICC and/or LOS and all of the significant
events outlined on page one of the RFI.
As worldwide leaders in venue development and management as well as live sports and entertainment
creation, production, and promotion, AEG is uniquely positioned to lend their expertise and resources to
this partnership.
As owners or operators of such world-class facilities as STAPLES Center (Los Angeles, CA), Prudential
Center (Newark, NJ); Sprint Center (Kansas City, MO); Citizen’s Business Bank Arena (Ontario, CA);
The Rose Garden (Portland, OR); American Airlines Arena (Miami, FL); Target Center (Minneapolis,
MN); Acer Arena (Sydney, AU); Wukesong Arena (Beijing, China); Ahoy Arena (Rotterdam,

Netherlands); Globe Arenas (Stockholm, Sweden); Qatar National Convention Centre (Doha, Qatar);
Color Line Arena (Hamburg, Germany); O2 World Arena (Berlin, Germany); and The O2, a 28-acre
development located in the eastern part of London along the Thames River, which includes a 20,000-seat
arena and over 650,000 sq. ft. of leisure and entertainment, AEG Facilities has created partnerships to
operate more of the world’s top 100 venues (23) than any other operator.
As part of their role, AEG Partnerships would be responsible for providing various support services and
resources to stimulate additional revenue growth and creation of new revenue streams for our venue,
while enhancing some of our various business practices, creating new marketing partnerships, and
generating additional sales initiatives for the facilities.
Critical to the success of this partnership will be the booking of our venue. To this end, AEG and its live
music division, AEG Live, will provide valuable programming support to our team. In addition to
promoting recent national concert tours for artists such as Taylor Swift, Leonard Cohen, Kelly Clarkson,
Wisin & Yandel, Bon Jovi, Celine Dion, Miley Cyrus, Britney Spears, Kenny Chesney, Paul McCartney,
and American Idols Live. AEG venues have booked and hosted notable events such as NBA and NHL
All-Star Games; Grammy, Espy, and American Music Awards; NCAL regional and national
championships in a variety of sports; championship tennis; national and international figure skating
championships and exhibitions; as well as family shows; made for television special events; and
convention-related programming.
The organization is also very familiar in the development and programming of sports and entertainment
districts. Now in its final stage of development, the AEG-created L.A. LIVE, a 4-million square
foot/$2.5-billion downtown Los Angeles sports, residential and entertainment district adjacent to the
STAPLES Center and the Los Angeles Convention Center, featuring the recently opened Club Nokia - a
2,300 capacity live music venue; Nokia Theatre L.A. LIVE, a 7,100-seat live theatre; a 54-story, 1001room convention “headquarters” destination (featuring The Ritz Carlton and JW Marriott hotels and 224
luxury condominiums – The Ritz Carlton Residences at L.A. LIVE – all in a single tower); the
GRAMMY Museum, a 14-screen Regal Cinemas L.A. LIVE Stadium 14 theatre; “broadcast” facilities for
ESPN, along with entertainment, residential, restaurant, and office space has clearly established itself as
the nation’s most versatile and busiest “live content campus”.
Additionally, affiliated AEG divisions that will lend their support to the partnership include AEG
Merchandising, a multi-faceted merchandising company; AEG Creative, a full-service marketing and
advertising agency; AEG Global Partnerships, a division responsible for worldwide sales and servicing of
sponsorship naming right and other strategic partnerships; and Bounce, one of the most respected live
entertainment production companies.
Global Spectrum is one of the world’s leaders in providing private management services to public
assembly facilities. Global Spectrum currently manages eighty-eight (88) facilities in North America.
These include:







34 Arenas
26 Convention Centers
11 Stadiums
7 Theaters
5 Ice Facilities
5 Specialized Venues/Entertainment Districts

2

Global Spectrum’s parent company owns the Wachovia Center and Spectrum in Philadelphia. These two
arenas, and the adjacent Citizens Bank Park (MLB Phillies), are managed by Global Spectrum.
Global Spectrum also manages the NFL Arizona Cardinal’s 63,000-seat University of Phoenix Stadium in
Glendale, AZ, which also includes a 160,000 sq. ft. Exhibit Hall.
As an example, Global Spectrum was awarded the management of the one million square foot Miami
Beach Convention Center on September 1, 2008. In its first year of operation, Global Spectrum was able
to achieve the following improvements over the performance of the previous manager:






Reduced the prior year operating loss by over $600,000
Improved the budgeted loss by $450,000
Reduced overall expenses by $1 M
Reduced electrical consumption resulting in savings of nearly $200,000
Booked over $600,000 in short-term new business

We are well aware of Global Spectrum’s business model for operating convention centers and stadiums,
and this is the type of performance that we would expect this partnership to produce. Their unprecedented
level of success is well documented in this RFI Response. We believe Global Spectrum will have an
immediate positive effect on event programming and the overall bottom-line of both the ICC and LOS.
Most of Global Spectrum’s U.S. based accounts have management agreements that must comply with the
guidelines of 97-13 and Section 141(a)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code. We are confident that any
arrangement that may be ultimately negotiated with the CIB and the City will be in full compliance with
the terms and covenants of the Financing Documents and User Agreements.
This partnership made up of four highly-capable entities would focus on increasing revenue and
managing expenses to revenue in order to significantly improve the overall bottom line of both ICC and
LOS; maintaining the high quality of services along with community interests; and providing integrated
sales and marketing efforts. On behalf of the four partners, we are prepared to offer our full corporate
concentration and resources to this project, and we look forward to the opportunity to work with you on
this exciting civic project. A full description of the background, experience, and qualifications of each of
these four entities is enclosed in this RFI Response.
As you continue this review of how to best operate/manage these facilities, we look forward to
cooperating with you to identify the best ways to achieve efficiencies, enhance performance, and create
benefits that are in the best interests of this community. We are committed to insuring that these valuable
assets are operated to the maximum benefit for the entire community, both economically and socially.
Thank you and please contact us with any questions or comments.

Yours truly,

Pacers Sports and Entertainment
Pacers, Sports & Entertainment All Under Conseco Fieldhouse Roof
The Indiana Pacers have been a fixture on the Indiana sports scene since 1967. Conseco Fieldhouse has
been a fixture on the Indianapolis skyline since 1999. Pacers Sports & Entertainment (“PS & E”) is now
the fixture that combines the two entities.
The Pacers are well known and Conseco Fieldhouse is also well known. In its 10 years, the 18,165-seat
venue is still regarded by many as the finest basketball arena in the world. It is also very unique with its
one-of-a-kind retro look that combines all of the finest amenities an arena can offer.
Pacers Sports & Entertainment oversees both, along with the WNBA’s Indiana Fever, which has emerged
as one of that league’s top teams. Owned by Herbert Simon, Chairman Emeritus of Indianapolis-based
Simon Property Group, PS& E is one of Indiana’s largest entertainment industry companies with more
than 170 full-time employees.
The company has been built with the Indiana Pacers franchise as the foundation, and PS & E has
diversified into additional sports and entertainment areas that are helping to fuel growth by providing
year-round revenue generating events.
PS & E has been instrumental in attracting and staging many prestigious events, besides Pacers and Fever
games. They have included:





Concerts, which have included Beyonce, Prince, Eric Clapton, Paul McCartney, the Gaither
Homecoming, Simon & Garfunkel, Bruce Springsteen, Elton John, Tim McGraw and Faith Hill,
Blue Man Group, John Mellencamp, Taylor Swift, and Miley Cyrus.
Special events, including the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, Disney on Ice, the
World Famous Lipizzaner Stallions, WWE pro wrestling, the Harlem Globetrotters, the Promise
Keepers, the Future Farmers of America, the Heartland Film Festival, the Lance Armstrong Tour
of Hope, and numerous meetings, receptions, dinners, and seminars.
Sporting events, including the Big Ten men’s and women’s basketball tournaments, the Indiana
High School Athletic Association’s girl’s and boy’s basketball tourneys, the John R. Wooden
Tradition college basketball games, hockey, arena football, the FIBA World Basketball
Championships, and the FINA World Indoor Swimming Championships.

PS& E is not just about events, though. A priority is to give back to the community and demonstrate the
organization’s desire to be a good corporate citizen. Two ways PS& E does so are through the Pacers
Foundation and numerous community initiatives.

Founded in 1993, Pacers Foundation’s mission is to build collaborative initiatives to encourage Indiana’s
youth in making winning life choices. We invest in our community’s youth by making grants of cash and
in-kind contributions to non-profit groups throughout Indiana and scholarships that share our mission and
“fit” within one of our Grant Funds. Since its founding, more than $5 million in grants, scholarships, and
Pacers and Fever tickets has been awarded.
Additionally, PS & E is engaged in many community initiatives with numerous programs and events. To
say PS& E is involved in helping the community is an understatement. PS& E conducts more than 35
annual community betterment programs and events each year, such as Pacers Academy (an alternative
school for at-risk students); Indiana Heroes (honoring individuals who have made a unique impact on
others); and various reading and educational programs.
Overall, PS & E continues to provide a significant economic and social impact for Indianapolis and
Indiana.

Indianapolis Convention and Visitors Association
The Indianapolis Convention & Visitors Association (“ICVA”) is a private, non-profit sales and
marketing organization formed in 1923. It is governed by a board of directors, with additional insight
provided by an advisory board. Currently ICVA employs a staff of 50 professionals. ICVA is funded by
private and public sources and currently operates on a budget of $10 million. Approximately 75percent
of the funding is derived from a marketing contract with the Capital Improvement Board of Marion
County, through which ICVA is tasked to increase visitation to the City and to impact utilization of key
venues.
The ICVA’s mission is to advance Indianapolis economic growth through tourism. Its strategic goals
related to that mission are:






Increase the number of visitors and their spending
Expand the positive perception of Indianapolis
Positively influence the visitor experience
Advocate the importance of tourism to Indianapolis’ economic vitality and quality of life
Be recognized as a highly effective, accountable, metric-driven destination marketer

The product we market is the destination: Greater Indianapolis and its meeting spaces, hotels, attractions,
arts, sports, dining, shopping venues, and visitor offerings. ICVA implements marketing and/or sales
activities directed to convention and meeting planners, tradeshow producers, sporting event organizers,
group leisure planners, event attendees, delegates, and leisure travelers, with the goals of invitation,
securing visitation, and providing exceptional experiences while in Indianapolis. ICVA’s core activities
consist of:









Convention, meeting and special event sales
Convention, housing and visitor services
Brand development and management
Group and leisure marketing
International marketing
Public relations and communications
Arts, culture and music partnerships
Local business partnerships and investment

According to a Global Insight report, in partnership with D.K. Shifflet & Associates, 21.9 million visitors
annually provide $3.56 billion in total annual economic impact on the Indianapolis economy. ICVA’s
direct contribution to this impact is in excess of $400 million. Visitors to Indianapolis contribute 34
percent of total visitor spending within the state of Indiana ($10.4 billion.)
Visitor activity creates jobs, and in fact, Indianapolis tourism sustains 66,621 jobs and $1.9 billion in
wages. In Indianapolis, one in 10 private, non-farm jobs is generated by the spending of tourists.
Travelers also generate a total of $794 million in federal, state, and local taxes, of which $225 million was
directed to the state and $178 million to the City. Taxes generated from Indianapolis tourists reduce the
tax burden by $613 for every Indiana household.

Facilities Management Strategies
Our designated operator, Global Spectrum, was incorporated in the year 2000 and has provided
comprehensive pre-opening services to over 20 of their managed venues. More services are fully
described on the following pages and clearly demonstrate their knowledge and experience with all aspects
of venue design, construction, improvements, and renovations.
As part of all of their management agreements, Global Spectrum is responsible for overseeing the Capital
Improvement process as described below.
Global Spectrum has a number of long-term management agreements, including the following:




John Labatt Centre, London, ON, Canada – 50 years
Penticton Facilities, BC, Canada – 20 Years
Abbottsford, BC, Canada – 10 Years

Because many of their agreements must comply with IRS guidelines, our terms have been limited to 5
years but virtually all have been renewed resulting, practically speaking, in relationships of 10 years or
longer.

Capital Improvements
In regards to capital improvement budgets, Global Spectrum’s standard procedure is to inform the
contract administrator of the need for capital improvements on a regular basis. Generally, any items
below $5,000 are part of Global Spectrum’s operating budget and items over $5,000 are part of their
normal reports that classify capital improvement projects into three classes:
1.
2.
3.

Absolutely necessary improvements
Self-funding improvements
Efficiency improvements (not absolutely necessary)

Capacity and Capability to Perform
Global Spectrum does not subscribe to a “one-size-fits-all” management philosophy. They recognize that
each venue has its own unique set of variables including market, size, competition, and the individuals
goals of each client. Global Spectrum works with their clients to establish a clear set of objectives for the
client’s venues, and after researching and analyzing key factors about the venue including reviewing
budgets, past and current event bookings, marketing plans, operational plans, and other elements, they
prepare a customized pro-forma, budget, operations manual, and marketing plan for the client to review
and approve.
As a specific and recent example, Global Spectrum was awarded the management of the one million
square foot Miami Beach Convention Center on September 1, 2008. In its first year of operation, Global
Spectrum was able to achieve the following improvements over the performance of the previous manager:






Reduced the prior year operating loss by over $600,000
Improved the budgeted loss by $450,000
Reduced overall expenses by $1 M
Reduced electrical consumption resulting in savings of nearly $200,00
Booked over $600,000 in short-term new business

Global Spectrum’s Corporate Operations Department will complete an Operational Audit for the ICC and
LOS. This audit is a constructive critique of the operational systems, physical plant, and each of the
building components that make up the venues. By completing an in-depth analysis, the audit provides an
understanding of the overall physical conditions of the physical plant and identifies areas that may need
immediate attention. This also serves as the basis of how Global Spectrum inventories HVAC,
electromechanical equipment as well as FF&E and then transfer this information onto their MicroMain
preventive maintenance system.
Global Spectrum devotes a great deal of time and energy into the communities of the facilities they
manage and the events held in these facilities. First and foremost their marketing efforts pay close
attention to the areas that effect patron satisfaction. Safety, quality service, and an enjoyable experience
are the most important priorities at their managed-facilities. Within ninety (90) days of Global Spectrum
being awarded a management contract, they provide their client with a comprehensive Marketing and PR
Plan that consists of the following elements:

Current Clients
Celebrating its 10th anniversary as a company in 2010, Global Spectrum has become one of the leading
and best financially resourced private public assembly venue management companies in the industry.
With a roster of only seven venues in 2000, Global Spectrum began an aggressive, ambitious effort to:
 Expand the number of Global Spectrum-managed venues
 Broaden the company’s scope of expert services
 Extend to geographic locations throughout North America and the world
Today, Global Spectrum’s client roster is moving toward 100 venues in cities worldwide, with its primary
business base in the US and Canada.
Some factors cited by its clients as a reason why they selected Global Spectrum to manage their venue is
its manageable size, the depth and talent of its corporate support team, and the confidence that they will
benefit from ready access to its senior management team on both corporate and regional levels.

Competitive Advantages of KnightFM
Cost Savings Strategies
KnightFM’s main objective is to reduce our customer’s facility operating
budget while continuously improving service and quality. We accomplish this
by being the industry leader in implementing cost savings strategies and
through our ISO 9001:2000 Certified Quality Management System (QMS).
We reduce costs by managing critical business processes. Over the past ten
years we have achieved over $2 billion in hard savings for our clients.
Self Performance Experience & Flexible Workforce
KnightFM has over 15 years experience in the Facility Management industry.
To save our customers costs, we self-perform as many services as possible,
and with our flexible workforce, we are able to combine job descriptions and
assignments. This aids in the reduction of the headcount required, while still
maintaining the quality of service that our customers have grown to depend
on. Our employees are our greatest resource and we communicate the
lessons we learn across our sites for continual improvement advantages.
Leveraged Purchasing
KnightFM has national account service agreements with numerous material
vendors and suppliers of services that are not self performed. These
agreements give us leverage in pricing and a foundation for quality and
continuous improvement. Our suppliers continually introduce new
technologies for efficiencies in the facility management industry. KnightFM
prepares specifications and a schedule to obtain competitive bids. We review
these bids, taking into account opportunities to source to minority suppliers.
Once business has been awarded, the successful supplier’s performance is
continuously monitored and evaluated per our ISO requirements.
Global Perspective Experience
KnightFM has a unique and special qualification to communicate with
countries that require techniques to overcome the language barrier,
specifically in the Asiatic Pacific theatre. We have demonstrated our
qualifications for markets by exercising a professionalism that gains
confidence. KnightFM demonstrates honesty in our deliverables that has put
us in 1st place among our foreign competitors.

304 S. Niagara St. l Saginaw, MI 48602 l Phone (989)793.8820 l Fax (989)399.9093 l www.knightfm.com

Green Focus
KnightFM has been able to reduce janitorial chemical spend by as much as
40% using a standardized set of Environmentally Preferable core cleaning
chemicals. We are able to do more with less while providing superior
products at a substantial cost savings. The benefits are the use of high
quality and environmentally sound chemicals, improved cleanliness, reduced
chemical inventory and storage requirements, improved worker safety
through comprehensive training and error-proofing of chemical dispensing
systems.
Diverse Customer Base
KnightFM provides facility management services to a wide array of customers
ranging from stadiums and municipalities to the automotive industry. Each of
these customers has specific requirements. Our commitment is to customize
a unique solution that adds value while reducing overall cost
ISO Certification
KnightFM has allocated the resources needed to maintain ISO 9001:2000
Certification. The Quality Management System (QMS) meets the standard
requirements per the ISO 9001:2000 and is designed around a problem solving &
continual improvement model. This model is integrated into the flow of each process
and activity to drive continual improvement, ensuring that the necessary follow-up
and feedback is filtered throughout the lifecycle of each process.
Corporate Support
Our Chief Operating Officer is a 6 Sigma professional who guides our corporation
toward continuous improvement in all aspects of the business.

Capital Improvements
Since 1998 Knight Facilities Management has been providing excellent FM
management for many customers in China. KnightFM has been with GM in China
since the beginning, and have since gained clients like Toyota, Volkswagen, Nissan,
SAIC office tower, etc. KnightFM has recently been awarded an FM Agreement with
GM that includes all building systems, equipments, etc. We evaluate compliance
and savings strategies for all systems (Electrical - from a 35KV down through the
distribution channels and generators, Mechanical - all HVAC and cooling tower
systems, Plumbing & Fire systems - all waste water, potable water, sprinklers &
pumps, etc.) KnightFM is also responsible for the Data Center (Precision Cooling,
UPS, etc.)
KnightFM is involved in the Commissioning and Systems Design for Maintainability
activities.
Furthermore, we are part of the LEED team (Leadership in energy and
environmental design for United States Green Building Council) that secured a gold
level certification with the USGBC for building energy and environmental friendliness.
Ten percent savings is a modest average - usually higher.
In the US, KnightFM has been involved in many building critical, equipment
operating and maintenance plans that result in savings.
General Motors Wixom Powertrain and Chrysler Yucca Proving Grounds are two
examples where we have reduced the operating budgets by upwards of 30%.
KnightFM has refurbished large compressor chillers and boilers, maintained cooling
towers and Air Handling Systems, etc. We are also responsible for the Building
Automation and Controls that are critical for the Energy Management Systems resulting in further savings. KnightFM has led lighting upgrades and right-sizing
strategies that result in overall lower costs. Our ability to save cost is proven, not
only in the short-term operating costs, but also in the long-term sustainment of the
value of these building equipment assets.
KnightFM utilizes CMMS (Computerized Maintenance Management System)
planning and management software to track assets, history, maintenance plans,
ensure warranty optimization, track performance, etc. Our expertise is the
balancing of short-term savings with long-term asset value sustainment - creating
the optimum strategy across the lifecycle of the equipments/systems at the lowest
costs to align with the customer's goals and needs.
Delphi Saginaw Steering Systems – Lab Relocation 2008
CaravanKnightFM did a lab move at Delphi Saginaw Steering that involved a
relocation of the Column Assist Electric Power Steering durability lab, to the
Manufacturing Development Center. This involved 16 machines, disconnected,
moved and re-installed in the new location on schedule without interrupting test
schedules for customers. This avoided the need to lease outside floor space at a cost
of $1.2 million per year.

Cost Control, Quality of Work and Ability to Commit and Deliver on
Budgetary Objectives
Actual Cost Savings for the Waste Reduction Program at General Motors Powertrain
Wixom MI Plant
CaravanKnightFM negotiated a lowered price for compactor rental and reduced the
number of switch- outs per month. This resulted in a lowered cost of $2,000 per
month. Original cost $54,000 per year – New cost $30,000 per year, resulting in a
savings of $24,000 per year
Chemical & Material Cost Savings for Sarasota County
Sarasota County - Use of Chemical Proportioning systems vs. the gallon free pour
Total of more than 60% Cost Savings
Actual Customer Cost Savings Labor
CaravanKnightFM Reduced a janitorial position by combing work into one job. By
making frequency reductions and combining tasks, thereby reducing costs by $3,350
per month and $40,200 per year.
Work Load Leveling at General Motors Warren Tech Center
In this case, KnightFM analyzed the work demand and re-designed the staff
assignments to reduce approx. 20% of the workforce. Additionally, KnightFM
replaced the existing workforce with one that was more cost effective with greater
productivity.
Between the core work demand reductions and the new staff savings, KnightFM
saved General Motors almost 11 million dollars of actual bottom-line annual
operating expense. The risks of such reductions and transitions were mitigated
through intense planning efforts, analysis of work-driver data, numerous corporate
support project management personnel, and intense customer communication.

KnightFM Global Quality Management
The organization is fully committed to maintaining a world-class Quality
Management Program through the use of a standard ISO 9001:2000 certified
Quality Management System. This organization’s Quality Management System
(QMS) is maintained under the Technical Services Department.

Budget Objectives
The budgeting process will involve accumulating and organizing historical data and
expense data related to the facility’s operation, assessing and projecting the
facility’s position in the current market as well as in the future, establishing goals
and objectives that are consistent with the facility’s mission statement and
understanding of the overall economic environment.

FM Budgets
KnightFM’s main objective is to reduce our customer’s facility operating budget while
continuously improving service and quality. We accomplish this by being the
industry leader in implementing cost savings strategies and through our ISO
9001:2000 Certified Quality Management System (QMS). We reduce costs by
managing critical, yet non-core business processes so that our customers can focus
on their core products and/or services.

A job description is written for each function, detailing who is responsible for each task, when they are to
do it, the time scheduled for the task, and the tools and support needed. Together, these procedures help
us ensure that the right people are at the right place at the right time with the right equipment.

hurricanes of 2005 that devastated the region. SMS employees were able
to raise $75,000 dollars including matching funds from the corporation to
aid SMS employees affected due to the hurricanes.
Since 2005, SMS Cares has continued to help many families throughout
the nation, who have been affected by personal tragedy. Some have been victims of random acts of
violence; others are hit with unexpected healthcare issues or deaths in the family. No matter the tragedy,
our family of employees has been there to help a fellow colleague in need through generous donations.

TRAINING PROGRAM
Because our most valuable investment is our personnel,
SMS has a formal training process in place to ensure
consistent high quality service to the City of Indianapolis.
FACILITY MANAGER
Our Facility Manager is the most important management
position in our organization. The Facility Manager is
responsible for orchestrating all systems and procedures of our
quality control program and directing every phase of our operation -all in an effort to do “Whatever It Takes” to provide the City of Indianapolis with the quality of service
that is unequalled in the industry.
All of our Facility Managers are required to complete our progressive management-training course, a 260
hour program we developed to meet and exceed our customer’s standards of excellence. This intense,
hands-on program consists of every aspect of our business from technical to administrative to financial -to ensure that all of our managers are able to offer the best possible service.
One of the most critical responsibility areas for new managers is developing a working knowledge of all
financial reports associated with managing a cost center. Hands-on training is enhanced with written
guidelines and instructions in the Facility Manager’s Manual. Each manager is given a copy of this
valuable tool when they begin employment. Managers are required to have an updated copy on site at all
times. The Manager’s Manual serves as a resource in their day-to-day operations.
All Facility Managers have performed the hands-on technical tasks expected of our non-exempt
employees. Once training is complete, our managers are supported at all times by a professional staff of
regional and corporate support.
HOURLY EMPLOYEES
ORIENTATION
Hourly employees go through a thorough training process when they begin employment. The Facility
Manager or Supervisor gives each employee a one-on-one orientation. A standard orientation checklist is
used to convey information in a consistent manner. One of the most important aspects of new employee
orientation should consist of a complete review of the Personnel Policy Handbook.
NEW HIRE TRAINING
SMS believes that our housekeepers should be well informed of their responsibilities as an employee and
our responsibilities to them as their employer. The Facility Manager first reviews the following sections:
¾ Hiring, Employment‐at‐Will
¾ Probation Period
¾ Training Period
¾ Equal Employment Opportunity
¾ Sexual Harassment

Vacations
Holidays
Approved Time Off
Leave of Absence
Pay Periods and Payday
Overtime, Break Periods, & Changes in Personnel Status
Our employee's recognition of their responsibilities and performance is vital to the City of Indianapolis.
SMS not only recognizes this but trains our employees to as well. We train our employees on the
following sections of Employee Responsibilities and Performance:
¾ Customer Relations
¾ Quality of Work
¾ Confidential Information
¾ Safety, Emergency, & Security Procedures
¾ Uniforms & Appearance
¾ Telephone Calls & Messages
¾ Breakage, Attendance & Tardiness
¾ Disciplinary Procedures, Grounds for Immediate Dismissal, Rules to Remember
¾ Communications, & Employee Concerns
As part of the Employee Safety Training, the Facility Manager discusses the physical location of the
safety equipment such as the MSDS book and location of emergency medical facilities. The employee is
then given a safety test to certify their understanding of the Safety Program.
SMS and the appearance of your facilities is a direct reflection of the Facility Manager and his/her staff.
The specialized operations, which we perform, put us on stage every day; therefore it is essential that we
focus on locating, hiring, and orienting quality people. Equally important is our ability to train and
promote good employee relations in order to retain good employees.

This strategy reflects the dedication
Figure 1: Account Relationships
Johnson Controls has to supporting our
facility management customers.
The graphic above represents our long standing relationship with some of our main clients.
Johnson Controls will perform the work for the ICC and LOS facilities using an approach
to facility O&M that is comprehensive and effective, proven through experience. Our approach is
in use at major facilities around the world, facilities that involve every kind and degree of
technical sophistication and a full range of support levels and services.
In essence, our overlying strategy in delivering services to organizations such as yours is to
leverage our people, processes and technologies to deliver the most efficient services possible.
We believe in the principle of self-perform as the best means of delivering the majority of
services to our customers. For those services that are not our core competency (landscaping,
pest control, etc.) and regulatory (elevators, fire, life, safety) we will use a combination of our
leveraged national providers and local suppliers that best meet the needs of our customers. In
the case of the CIB facilities we will self-perform the general maintenance, HVAC maintenance
(filter changes, air handler PM’s plumbing, electrical to the skill level of our team. Every activity
will be evaluated by our team to determine the best approach. During the first year of the
contract we will evaluate the work load and right size our team to the most efficient operation.
By integrating the following management strategies and executing them at a high level, we are
able to deliver superior service to our clients.


The unifying elements of our approach are establishing a Staff and Organization
specific to the work on the Project
 Identifying and Managing the Workload
 Managing the Performance of the Work
 Documenting and Evaluating Results

Response to CIB‘s RFI for ICC and LOS FM Services

Our Work Management System
Johnson Controls has standardized on the Maximo Computerized Maintenance Management
System (CMMS) to code, identify, prioritize, schedule, track, manage and measure all of our
work for CIB. The CMMS schedules and tracks work, and collects, manages and provides
historical data on all building systems, elements, utilities and equipment at the facility. This data
is a critical component in managing and facilitating performance of non-recurring work such as
emergency and service calls, recurring work such as preventive maintenance (frequency based
scheduling with job plans), recurring routine maintenance, shop support, pest control, trash
removal, indefinite quantity work, and special projects. Tracking and identifying services is done
using an established numbering and work type coding system. We have documented work
control/data management processes that will be tailored specifically to our operations at
Evansville to ensure superior facility support services. Data integrity, data security, and a
complete and accurate historical database will be maintained and updated with strict discipline
to fundamental relational database protocols. This data is maintained and managed to provide
accurate information across the board to enhance the value of the business while minimizing
risk.
We will use the CMMS to derive all data used to quantify key performance measures and
prepare customized performance reports for CIB’s management. These reports will provide
useful data for your management as well as our management and work team. As new
requirements are developed or older requirements change, we will develop new reports or
adjust existing reports to meet these requirements.
We can optimize your existing building maintenance systems by integrating them into Maximo.

Our Work Management Process
Johnson Controls will manage all work (from maintenance work to safety meetings) to be
performed under the contract. Our initial plan is to use a Johnson Controls feature, the On-line
Service Center (OSC), for the creation of demand work orders. This feature will give designated
CIB personnel the capability to input a request for facilities support. As the scope of
responsibility expands to include other facilities, we can transition from the OSC to the use of
our Customer Call Center so that we capture all work requests regardless of the location of the
facility
Work Management Process Overview
Preventive maintenance and routine recurring work are scheduled via the CMMS as mandated
by frequency requirements. These work orders are published on the same date of each month.
Supervisors manage and assign the work. Unscheduled work is classified by work type and
tracked in the CMMS. Once a request has been received through the OSC, our Customer
Business Manager (CBM) will dispatch the request to the appropriate support staff member. The
OSC report includes the date, time, caller’s name, phone number, location, equipment
identifiers, and description of required service or problem. The CBM will create a work order
entry in the CMMS for capturing related cost and technical data.
The technicians perform the work, report details of the work/repair, including labor, materials
and required service. If the work order requires materials not in inventory, the technician initiates
the requisition process for those parts. If the work requires outside contractor involvement, the
technician notifies the CBM. Technicians also identify work requirements in the facilities, initiate
work orders and complete actions as instructed by the CBM. The technicians will be trained in
the CMMS procedures so that they record all activities relative to all work orders in the CMMS.

without the express written permission of Johnson Controls, Inc.

Response to CIB‘s RFI for ICC and LOS FM Services

The CBM reviews and approves all work orders, requisitions, child work orders, outside service
field reports and any CMMS-generated reports (daily, weekly, monthly).
The CBM audits performance, labor and material costs, scheduling and completion statistics
and monitors efficiency for all aspects of the contract. Using the CMMS, the CBM identifies,
reports, posts and recommends corrective actions to address negative trends. Corrective
actions are communicated as urgent. Management takes the lead in corrective action and
follow-up. We operate as if the customer is present. Quality and cost control are second only to
safety. Transparency is not only valued but encouraged.

Managing the Performance of the Work
After the work has been identified and assigned, Johnson Controls manages the performance of
the task using job plans and our management programs, such as quality assurance and safety.
These plans and programs give our work force the tools to perform the work.
Job Plans. We use job plans to ensure consistent quality in the performance of maintenance
tasks. We have one of the largest databases of job plans in the industry, covering virtually every
type of equipment, and we share these across our organization to ensure that our technicians
approach tasks in the same manner, regardless of location. The plans we will use for the project
at your facilities will be tailored specifically to the needs of these facilities. We will load the job
plans into the CMMS so that they are automatically distributed to the technician with every PM
work order.
The job plans help ensure that technicians follow a prescribed sequence of tasks, follow
appropriate safety procedures, use the right materials, and document their actions. The plans
also provide a baseline by which we can evaluate performance of the maintenance work. This
evaluation, by our CBM, is the heart of our quality program. The CBM will use job plans to check
whether the job has been done right the first time, and to have an objective standard to use in
making the assessment.
Quality Plan. Johnson Controls uses a Quality Management System that has proven
especially effective on operations and maintenance projects. In general, we build our quality
program to meet our internal and our client’s definition of quality service, and generate a set of
project objectives that form our performance standard. This method ensures that Johnson
Controls clearly understands and proactively participates in meeting project goals and achieving
customer satisfaction. Project and individual performance goals are set to a level exceeding
performance standards. Performance evaluations are based on the individual’s success in
achieving overall project goals; thus, employees are motivated to apply persistent, dedicated,
and focused effort to achieve their goals.
Safety Plan. Our safety plan is designed to enable our staff to work safely, ensure that good
safety practices are observed, implement actions to correct safety deficiencies, and conduct or
coordinate all accident investigations. The safety plan covers:
 Safety concerns applicable to all employees, such as confined space entries, fire
safety, and fire drills.
 Routine actions that present a safety hazard, such as the operation of material
handling equipment.
 Those actions identified as hazardous, such as electrical work, use of ladders, and
lifts.
Johnson Controls safety plan is a total program that involves every employee. Supervisors
are responsible for administering the safety plan with the technicians. They ensure that areas
are maintained in a safe, healthful condition, that operations are conducted safely, and that

Response to CIB‘s RFI for ICC and LOS FM Services

safety regulations are enforced. They also appoint a safety representative within their
department to serve on a project-wide safety committee. Each employee must comply with all
safety rules and regulations as a condition of employment.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Johnson Controls will coordinate with CIB to establish
key performance indicators for the project. These will include KPIs for the work done by
Johnson Controls and by the subcontractors. We will establish a baseline and goals for each
KPI, and then use the CMMS and other tools to track our progress toward our goals. These
KPIs will demonstrate to CIB that we are meeting your goals for the facilities, and they will also
help identify opportunities for productivity improvement. We will also track performance by our
subcontracting partners so that we can ensure they are delivering the level of service required
by CIB. With this knowledge, we can more effectively deploy our resources to ensure your
facilities, systems, and equipment function as designed.

Subcontract Management
At Johnson Controls, we are fortunate to be able to self-perform many services, technical and
non-technical, through cross-utilization of existing staff or because of density of customer
business in a certain geographic area. The decision on what services to subcontract vs. selfperform is based on many factors, including nature/scope of the service, availability of suppliers
in the geographic area, cultural fit with CIB, and cost to perform the service.
Subcontractor management is a key component of our total service portfolio. Instead of a
traditional buyer/seller perspective, we typically drive increased value for our customers by
maintaining and continually developing a cadre of National and Regional Preferred Suppliers,
which ultimately produces significant pricing leverage for our customers.
Our suppliers are evaluated based on a variety of factors including financial capability,
geographic coverage, demonstrated technical expertise, past performance, qualifications of
personnel, ability to meet specifications, and competitive pricing. Our process for screening
potential suppliers includes reference checks, financial status, and a site visit to a comparable
project/account when and where appropriate.
We select suppliers that can provide the best value in terms of quality, cost, and
responsiveness. The contracts contain terms and conditions that provide the best mechanism
for managing the provision of services or materials. The performance-based contracts we
negotiate with suppliers assure us of obtaining quality service. Our supplier management plans
track and control costs and performance as closely as if we were doing the work ourselves. In
general, we manage subcontractors using the same tools we use to manage our own costs:
defined scope of work, performance reviews, and budget review and analysis.

Certifications
Johnson Controls has all licenses and certifications essential to performing facility maintenance
services for CIB. Johnson Controls is an active member of all major facility management
associations, including IFMA, CoreNet, and BOMA, and is a corporate leader and sponsor of all
three organizations. Many of our local facility managers are active members of their local
organizations.

Client Relationship / Service Management
Customer service and satisfaction are our number one priorities. We understand that, for the
service provider, the process of earning a customer’s trust begins on the first day of the
© 2009 Johnson Controls, Inc. Do not copy (physically, electronically, or in any other media)
without the express written permission of Johnson Controls, Inc.

Response to CIB‘s RFI for ICC and LOS FM Services

relationship – and it never ends. This is the foundation of our philosophy of customer service for
as long as the partnership exists.
The foundation for a successful relationship must be laid even before the contract is executed.
Before entering the relationship, it should be clear that the client and Johnson Controls share
the same vision for the relationship. Therefore, a new contract should begin with a meeting to
clearly define outsourcing roles. Then, an action plan can be deployed to carry out these
expectations.
We will clearly understand your business objectives and will develop a plan to put your
expectations into action. Regular review meetings will be conducted to monitor the progress of
the action plan.
Over the course of a long-term relationship, it is natural for a client’s needs and expectations to
evolve. For that reason, we will periodically revisit the action plan. By continually monitoring our
service and product attributes that you value most, we will be able to continuously adapt or
improve our delivery of business solutions.
In addition to monitoring customer needs and expectations, we must also monitor their
perceptions. Our goal is to clearly understand what is important to our customers so that we can
proactively make changes before any dissatisfaction may arise. That understanding also helps
us to continually bring innovation to our customers’ businesses. We will track your satisfaction
through regular surveys and one-on-one interviews.

Transition
Johnson Controls has completed many successful transitions of various services including
complete outsourcing of non-core activities for its customers. Our processes have been
developed through ongoing analysis and feedback of many of these transitions. We feel that we
are able to provide a transition of services that is “best in class”. Johnson Controls approach for
a successful transition of operations is one of effective and efficient management of the process
which involves changes for the people, the customers, the service providers and the suppliers,
all of which have a stake in the success of the transition.
Through pro-active communications, the Johnson Controls Transition Team can explain to all
parties involved what to expect during the transition process. The frequency of our reports and
communication will be jointly determined by Johnson Controls and CIB. Feedback is
encouraged so the Transition Team and Managers from CIB can have an optimum effect on
assessing and managing stakeholder expectations.

2. CAPABILITIES
Demonstration of Respondent’s capacity and capability to satisfy factors such cost control, quality of work, and the ability to
commit to and deliver on budgetary objectives, cost estimates and projected cost savings; and

Risk Management
Johnson Controls recognizes that all projects contain risk. Similar projects’ historical experience,
business experience, and experienced personnel allow Johnson Controls to forecast and limit
most project risk. Project risk is often caused by inexperience, lack of communication, unreliable
suppliers, and lack of proper project control systems.

Response to CIB‘s RFI for ICC and LOS FM Services

Changed site conditions, material damage, labor strikes and facility access, quality of work,
worker safety, and financial terms all may contribute to project risk. Johnson Controls is
experienced managing project risk and we take our responsibility to do so very seriously.
Johnson Controls and the project team will manage project risk using the following systems and
methodologies.
Thorough and continuous planning:
 Detailed quantification of facility audits
 Subcontract document review and legal review of terms and conditions
 Adherence to safety programs
 Application of claims avoidance programs
 Use of regular and multiple communication systems
 Use of superior technology
 Competitive bidding and supplier evaluation
 Procedures for management of asbestos, lead paint, and hazardous materials
 Employee and customer training
 Insurance
 Supplier and subcontractor bonding
 Product warranties
Johnson Controls understands that customers perceive a
risk that the proposed energy savings may not reach the
Key Differentiator: Assuming and
levels agreed to as part of the contract. To mitigate that
managing our customer’s risk sets
risk, and remove it entirely from CIB’s concern, Johnson
Johnson Controls apart from others.
Controls will provide a performance guarantee as part of
this contract. This guarantee will shift all risk for the
contract to Johnson Controls.
We will make this guarantee part of the contract and ensure that it clearly communicates how
savings will be achieved and clearly defines both parties' responsibilities. Disclosure of this
information is critical to the long-term success of the project. All aspects of our assured
performance guarantee will be mutually agreed upon before we execute the contract.
Our assured performance guarantee works in a straightforward manner. If the efficiency
improvements and energy savings are less than the guaranteed amount, we will pay the
shortfall. The guarantee is monitored monthly and reconciled annually. The assured
performance guarantee is not a third-party insurance policy. We are directly accountable for the
financial risk.
Quality Management
Johnson Controls utilizes a Quality Management System that has proven especially effective on
operations and maintenance projects. We develop a clear picture of our client’s definition of
quality service, and generate a set of project objectives that form our performance standard.
This method ensures that Johnson Controls clearly understands and proactively participates in
meeting project goals and achieving customer satisfaction. Project and individual performance
goals are set to a level exceeding the acceptable performance standard. Performance

evaluations are based on the individual’s success in achieving overall project goals; thus,
employees are motivated to apply persistent, dedicated, and focused effort to achieve their
goals.
The Johnson Controls’ Quality Plan is customer focused within the context of meeting
contractual obligations while using the processes to understand and exceed customer
expectations. It enables our business leaders to engage the involvement of employees, and to
follow and adjust processes to improve on a continuous basis to yield enhanced business
output. This systems approach to quality provides the tools for factual decision making at
various levels of service and management.
The Quality Plan is a component of the Quality Management System (QMS) for Johnson
Controls-Services North America FM (SNA FM) organization.
This QMS consists of the following:
 Johnson Controls Business Operating System (BOS)
 Johnson Controls SNA FM Quality Policy
 Johnson Controls SNA FM Quality Plan
 Knowledge Management (including compliance management status)
 Performance Measurement and Reporting
 Customer Satisfaction
 Continuous Improvement
The Johnson Controls Quality Plan is a standard business operating practice and is
implemented and followed for all facilities management accounts. In addition to knowledge
management, performance measurement and reporting, customer satisfaction, and continuous
improvement, the design relies on regulatory compliance to support decision making based on
the analysis of data and information.

3. TEAM ORGANIZATION
Identification of all persons that will be actively engaged in performing the management and operation of the ICC and/or LOS,
including for key persons, summaries of their backgrounds and relevant experience and qualifications which correlate to the type
of facilities operation management facet being sought by the City. The submission should include a list of major clients and
projects each individual has worked on in the last five (5) years and with a specific emphasis on engagements lasting ten (10)
years or longer.

Johnson Controls’ organization for the work at the CIB – LOC and the ICC facilities is built on
the principle of alignment of resources to meet requirements. Our organization has overall
leadership through an on-site Customer Business Manager, who provides control of and
visibility over key functions essential to the accomplishment of the work. The organization is
designed so that all work is allocated through our on-line service call center so there is one
major point of control to preclude the duplication of work and ensure visibility. The following text
discusses the organizational elements and the role they play in the accomplishment of the work.
Customer Business Manager. Our Customer Business Manager will have authority over dayto-day contractual administration. His autonomy will afford him complete flexibility to allocate
personnel and to respond to critical requirements in a variety of time-sensitive situations. As
Johnson Controls’ formal point of contact with CIB’s management, he will directly manage this

Response to CIB‘s RFI for ICC and LOS FM Services

account. Although he will delegate day-to-day operational authority to his various personnel, he
will ultimately be responsible for the operational performance at this account.
The Customer Business Manager will:
 Coordinate schedules and the Company’s resource assignments based upon your
requirements and schedule constraints
 Manage the overall account by monitoring and reporting on the status of the work,
actual versus planned progress, and by consulting with the company’s management
regarding deviations from plan and proposed corrective actions in accordance with
agreed upon change control procedures
 Act as Johnson Controls’ point of contact for all aspects of contract administration,
including invoicing for services and status reporting
 Facilitate review meetings and conferences between CIB and Johnson Controls’
executives when scheduled or requested
 Communicate among and between facilities staff, other stakeholders, and our account
staff
 Identify and provide CIB with timely written notice of all issues that may threaten our
contractually required performance
 Ensure that adequate quality assurance procedures are in place
 Meet with other service providers working at the ICC LOS and other facilities, as
necessary, to resolve problems and coordinate the work
 Develop, review and own a rolling five year capital budget plan
 Manage minor capital improvement projects such as roof repair, HVAC equipment
replacement, small building modifications, and coordinate moves, adds and changes
with appropriate representatives and sub-contractors
 Hire, discipline, train, and motivate personnel
 Tailor existing Johnson Controls procedures and policies to meet the unique
operational requirements of these facilities
 Ensure contract compliance regarding environmental, safety, and health concerns
 Manage and coordinate requirements, plans and actions between subcontractors
We recognize the complex nature of this project and the importance of timely completion and
reliable operation. The team selected for this project will be dedicated and committed to the
success of this project.
While we have several qualified candidates on staff to fill the role of customer business
manager for CIB, we have not designated a specific person to fill the position at this time. We
believe that it is important to involve CIB in the selection process to ensure that the most
appropriate person is selected for the job.
As a result, we have not included a specific individual’s resume within this proposal, but, rather,
a sample resume of the type of individual that we will select to fill the role of the customer
business manager. This individual is representative of the skilled personnel that Johnson
Controls will consider for this key position, ensuring that the individual finally selected is a
proven Johnson Controls employee who has demonstrated the leadership, customer
satisfaction and skill sets consistent with this prestigious account.

Executive Summary
The Indianapolis Office of Enterprise Development is examining operational
management opportunities and alternatives for the CIB and its Facilities. IKON
Office Solutions currently provides on-site support services for the ICC and
could expand the offering to meet the Office of
Enterprise Development’s specific goals:
Identify operational efficiencies and
cost savings for the Facilities
Build relationships with strategic
partners
Maximize usage of the ICC and LOS
Evaluate potential economies of scale in facilities operations
management
Enter into a multi-year agreement with one (1) or more Respondents
for the operation and management of the Facilities.

IKON Office Solutions, Inc., a Ricoh Company (IKON), has carefully reviewed
the requirements of the RFI and appreciates the opportunity to respond. This
proposal presents the city an overview of our scope, approach and methodology
to the requested services. We are confident that the IKON advantage will be
clearly evident.

IKON Strategy
IKON understands that the City is taking this RFI to an RFP and has existing
financial commitments as well as the tenants at Conseco Field House. IKON’s
preliminary strategy takes this into consideration and believes the benefits and
finances of a consistent enterprise wide expansion is advantageous to the CIB at
this time. IKON’s offering is simple and can be done through your current
contract:
Extend the current ICC contract to the LOS ,Conseco Field House and
it’s tenants
Extend and track IKON Production Center Services offerings to all CIB
Facilities
Extend and track IKON’s UPS National Account Overnight Mailing
discounts
Utilize and track IKON’s local 501C Pre-sort House partner for
maximum outgoing mail discounts
Utilize and track savings from our current facility back up staff for on–
site support service requirements that are currently being out-sourced off
site.
Expand our ―TRAC‖ software to the other facilities to enable electronic
job submissions of IKON services that also tracks ongoing savings.
Expand current copy to incorporate the workgroup and desktop printers
in each facility forcing an optimization for each current MFP and the
elimination of several printers.
Provide document workflow consulting services to assist in automating
manual paper intensive processes resulting in scanning solutions and the
decrease in the need to print.
Provide ―pro-active‖ marketing to incoming clients to further keep
services here in Indianapolis rather than have print and marketing
materials shipped in before scheduled events.
Work with our clients, Indiana Black Expo, NCAA and events related to
these IKON clients and utilize the expanded services of the ICC during
scheduled events here in the City.

IKON recognizes that the Office Of Enterprise Development intends to send out
an RFP and select it’s supplier as a Facilities Management Contractor. Our
Facilities management contract is already in place with regards to document
output. The success of our consultative approach is based on our detailed analysis
and executing on our ―Summary of Finding and Proposal‖. Therefore, we look
forward to the opportunity to present our solution and address any questions the
Office of Enterprise Development may have in order to move forward.

The Right Resource Service Center
IKON routinely services multiple sites using multiple manufacturers’ equipment.
Now being acquired by Ricoh, the equipment manufacture, we not only focus on
service and process improvement but can further reduce the costs of acquiring the
equipment eliminating the need of the distributor. This proposal is IKON’s first
step in creating a unique resource center and print management strategy that is
tailored to the Office of Enterprise Development’s specific needs. Our tentative
plan is a three-tier approach:
 Reduce the overall costs of print by tracking all copies and
prints in the facilities. Enabling the current facility equipment to print
and scan will lower costs by as much as 50% taking volume from the
expensive workgroup printers. A typical government facility
statistically prints more volume than it copies. In a 30 day study of
print, IKON would be able to not only inform the Office of Enterprise
Development on how much they spend on print, but whom and what
they are printing. Additionally, with new tracking software, print can be
routed to the most cost effective devise allowing IKON to be the
―Printer Police‖ and the city focuses on their core business initiatives.
 Decrease turnaround time in the copy center through
electronic job submission, automated finishing capabilities and
providing several overflow centers, two of which are downtown
Indianapolis . Submitting jobs electronically allows for multiple
locations to send jobs, proof jobs and track where they are in the
system. One overflow center will also allow for litigation copy and scan
jobs to be done at a more competitive price to the Office of Enterprise
Development and accommodate ―after hour‖ work by providing second
shift availability.
 Track and expand our current services. Meeting monthly with
our clients allows for full transparency of executing on our proposed
solutions and also for the current ―silo‖ business units.

IKON understands that The Indianapolis Office of Enterprise Development has
many undiscovered service requirements. If IKON is selected as the vendor, a
detailed analysis of cost savings and business efficiencies will be provided. An
overview of this ―Summary of Findings‖ is attached. This deliverable is also
accompanied by a detailed proposal.
The key to the success of this project is the IKON team that will execute this
strategy. The Indianapolis Office of Enterprise Development will continue to see
that we have the experience and the reference list to back it up. The following
describes the depth of services IKON can provide to the Office of Enterprise
Development and the methodology that is the framework to our success.

IKON Scope

The following is IKON’s proposed initial scope that is the expansion of our
current services.
Extend the current ICC contract to the LOS ,Conseco Field House
and it’s tenants
A detailed on site analysis of each location would be required to provide
an extension to the current contract. Please review the attached IKON
Analysis and Summary of Findings document. The tenants at Conseco
would also have access to IKON’s Resource Services and billed back
accordingly. Currently there is ―revenue sharing‖ in place for incoming
clients and events. IKON’s goal is to grow this revenue.
Extend and track IKON Production Center Services offerings to all
CIB Facilities
IKON provides pickup and delivery of our printing, copying, scanning,
document finishing services from our off site Overflow Production
Center. A sample of our services is as follows:
Print and Copy Services:
Digital files/Hard Copy
B/W and Color
Tabs- Paper or Mylar

Stapling/Collating

IKON’s Production Center also provides Business Cards and many more
Printing services that could eliminate the number of vendors being
utilized through electronic job ordering and digital proofing for
continued increase in customer service and cost savings.
Extend and track IKON’s UPS National Account Overnight Mailing
discounts
IKON is able to share its UPS discounts with its IMS customers.

IKON’s discounts are subject to change in the event of a new contract
negotiation. Any changes will be communicated to the field.
Utilize and track IKON’s local 501C Partner that is a Pre-sort
House for maximum outgoing mail discounts

This Presort Partner processes 200,000 - 400,000 pieces of mail
each and every day. All first class mail is processed through an
Optical Character Reader, bar coded, sorted and delivered to the
post office every night. The result is faster delivery of your mail
and a discounted cost of up to 8.2 cents per piece. IKON’s on site
team manages and tracks the mail and provides monthly postal
savings. Some of our clients have had issues with ―returned mail‖.
Address corrections are done during the processing and reported
back electronically to client to update data base and eliminates
USPS charges. With regards to mail, IKON also has a national
partnership with Neopost, a global mail manufacture of postal
equipment, postal software and postal consulting. This relationship
offers an average of 15% additional discount rather than buying
direct or from other distributors.

Utilize and track savings from our current facility staff for on–site
support service requirements that are currently being out-sourced
off site.
IKON has a team of Field Support Representatives (FSR)
responsible for supporting operational objectives at all
existing customer sites within a geographic territory. These
Field Services Representatives are considered to be on call
and can be assigned to a customer location on very short
notice. Field Support Representatives substitute for
personnel who are out of the firm due to illness, vacation,
jury duty, etc. and are trained on the functions and methods
specific to the individual site operations. To maintain
consistency and service levels, Field Support
Representatives spend time in their assigned sites regularly
to familiarize themselves with the operation and the client
with them. IKON Management Services has aligned our
Field Support Representatives in Indianapolis under one
Integrated Account Manager assigned to our downtown
accounts. As a result, all primary Field Support
Representatives that would service the CIB are experienced
in the convention center’s vertical market.
The Site Manager at each location is responsible for ensuring
that all staffing levels are being met, and that Field Support
Representatives are assigned to cover for any absences. If at
any time staffing levels fall below the contracted amount, the
Site Manager will inform the appropriate account personnel.
These un-staffed hours can also be included in the Monthly
Management Report.
Implement our ―TRAC‖ software to the other facilities to enable
electronic job submissions of IKON services and bill back to
departments that also tracks ongoing savings.
Standard IKON management reports include summaries of activity,
performance and costs. IKON creates, views, and shares reports via
its Web-based TRAC SolutionSM tool. TRAC manages the complete
service lifecycle from request through billing. It also allows IKON
to perform job-time data entry, which means that as the job is
received and processed, critical data for reporting and billing is
entered into TRAC. Information is not recorded on a paper log and
then later summarized in a Microsoft® Excel® spreadsheet. As a
result of this process, the frequency of reporting is ongoing and
perpetual. At any time during the course of business, the customer
can log in and determine the activity level, performance level and
actual service cost.
o

In addition, the billing process begins with job-time data entry.
After the job is completed and archived, it is summarized in a

employee resource planning (ERP) system for electronic billing
and payment.

METHODOLOGY

assets and services in an on-site environment, to maximize operational efficiency.

IKON Managed Services Methodology

The methodology is unique in how we:
Translate customer needs into cost-justified
solutions using innovative technology and
measurable service levels
Design and manage the implementation process
Build on nationally validated standards and best
practices
Consistently develop and motivate employees to
deliver world-class service
Consult to ensure alignment with evolving
customer business strategies
Our quality management program comes out of
operational best practices. This section details policies
and procedures for inspecting work, tracking the
success, and reporting quality back to the customer.
Every site has a specific Site Procedure Guide which
details the services performed on a daily basis
From the signing of the contract, our Customer Strategy
& Communication process insists that we maintain
frequent and ongoing communication with the CIB to
review both performance and strategy and together
create action plans to remain innovative. This enables us
to fulfill our promise—to add value today and for years
to come.
The customer strategy review process will include the
following communication phases:
Phase 1—Executive Review
We sit down ―executive to executive‖ each year and
revisit CIB’s strategic priorities for the upcoming fiscal
year. IKON senior area management and key CIB
executives review organizational priorities.
Phase 2—Customer Satisfaction Survey

Confidential

© 2009 IKON Office Solutions, Inc.

The Indianapolis Office of Enterprise Development
Page 17

After the executive-level meeting, we conduct a
customer satisfaction survey and reanalyze the operation
to see if new processes or technologies could generate an
increased return on investment. After we have this data,
we conduct an internal meeting (an Integrated Account
Review) to discuss potential solutions and prepare a
proposal for an improved and updated document
strategy.
Phase 3—Document Strategy Review
We then form a document strategy review team,
consisting of CIB’s management personnel and local
IKON management. This team reviews the customer
satisfaction survey, IKON analysis/study findings and
the proposed document strategy. After it is approved, the
revised document strategy includes a draft
implementation plan for consideration.
Phase 4—Quarterly Strategy Update Meetings
Together, we schedule Quarterly Strategy Update
Meetings. During these meetings key CIB management
and local IKON management teams review progress,
remove obstacles and address trends. We also use these
meetings to share any relevant news or information that
will help make the document strategy a reality.
Phase 5—Monthly Review
On a monthly basis, our local account and operations
management teams meet to review our Monthly
Management Report and Commitment Action
Document, which include actions to support quantitative
goals and objectives.
To ensure that all of the phases mentioned above are
continuously met IKON utilizes Executive Site Audits
to provide a quality checkpoint ensuring that each site is
installed and operating following the prescribed
processes and practices to a standard level of
compliance. The executive site audit includes a face-toface conversation with the customer to assess the level
of customer satisfaction with our services. The
objectives of the executive site audit are to:
Drive consistency and define how each site can
achieve the highest level of performance
possible.
Recognize outstanding performance.
Ensure executive team involvement with new
accounts.
Measure the effectiveness of a site installation.

support the local infrastructure by creating an appealing venue for a wide array of events that
serve the local community, businesses and visitors.
The City of Indianapolis’ Office of Enterprise Development is seeking a qualified service provider
to effectively manage the ICC and LOS. Key goals are to maximize operating efficiencies, build
relationships with strategic partners, draw more events to the venue and leverage economies of
scale.

Executive Summary
Consistency
CBRE will provide the City of Indianapolis with Playbooks that provide best practice Facilities
Management (“FM”) processes and technology solutions from CBRE’s ServiceInsight platform.
This enables us to automate the FM best practice processes, maximize the productivity of the FM
team, and improve reporting capability for management to monitor and track performance.
Operating Expense Savings
Our FM approach drives an average of 10–20% reduction in operating expenses. Key areas of
focus for ICC and LOS will include leveraging our purchasing power (CBRE manages over $20
billion in property-related expenditures annually) as well as leveraging vendor contracts, supplies,
and labor efficiencies via implementation of our technology solution. Based on our preliminary
inspection of ICC and LOS, we have already identified numerous opportunities for savings in
energy management.

Driving revenues from retail/concession leases is critical to maximizing the income of ICC and
LOS while simultaneously ensuring the satisfaction of attendees. CBRE has retail leasing experts
that can identify the ideal mix of concession-type tenants at the highest rates the market can
command. Our Retail Services team is fully equipped to help you seize additional revenue
opportunities at these venues.
CBRE can leverage our local, regional and national tenant relationships to enhance retail
tenancy. Our nationwide retail network is composed of more than 500 retail brokers who
disseminate information on properties and tenants across the country to ensure that the
properties we represent have access to abundant opportunities. There is not a national retail
tenant that is not represented by CBRE somewhere in the country.
Measurable Results
Continual monitoring of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) drives performance and focus. We will
work with the City of Indianapolis to develop meaningful KPIs. They can include categories such
as budget variances, savings initiatives, cost avoidance initiatives, customer satisfaction ratings,
safety and environmental compliance, vendor diversity, reliability and outages. CBRE’s Balanced
Scorecard will track and report performance results.
Sustainability Program Implementation
As the world’s largest real estate services firm, CBRE is in the unique position to provide
environmental leadership in the properties we occupy and manage. To embrace this
responsibility, we have formed the Sustainability Solutions Group, a team of experts focused on
balancing environmental concerns with cost-effective business solutions. Using a systematic
approach, our client-dedicated teams focus on fact-based outcomes that lessen environmental
impact and generate immediate results and long-term financial benefits. This enables CBRE to

will work with an experienced Controller. Together, they will ensure solid accounting and
financial reporting for the ICC and LOS. Also, CBRE is compliant with section 404 of the
Sarbanes Oxley Act. In fact, we were the first real estate firm to attain Sarbanes Oxley and SAS

Response to Questions
PNC Park

CBRE has served as the exclusive leasing and facility
management agent to the Pittsburgh Pirates for PNC
Park since 2000. PNC Park is a 1-million-square-foot
major-league baseball facility, which includes 60,000
square feet of office space and 25,000 square feet of
retail space. The stadium has a seating capacity of
38,496, providing an intimate venue for fans.
CBRE has worked with the Pirates to achieve the following at PNC Park:
In-sourced janitorial services
Developed facility-wide energy reduction initiative, generating over $200,000 in savings
Winterized the Club Level to allow for year-round use
Recent two-year fixed-price electricity supply agreement generated $260,000 in annual
savings
Enhanced service levels through internet based work order/preventive maintenance program
Seattle Municipal Tower

CBRE has managed Seattle Municipal Tower for the City of Seattle since
2005. Approximately 98% of this 1.2 million square foot tower is
occupied by City departments. In the first year of operations alone, we
successfully transitioned the property, implemented a building portal
and reduced operating expenses.
In the summer of 2007, the Seattle Municipal Tower began
experiencing brownout conditions that were severely impacting all
major building systems and tenant operations. It was discovered that
the building was incurring harmonic issues exceeding acceptable levels
and that the building’s elevators were the source of the problem.
CBRE was faced with the challenge of reducing harmonic levels,
restoring power quality to acceptable standards, and maintaining daily building operations–all
while delivering a cost-effective solution to our client.
CBRE determined special filters could be built and tuned to the specific harmonics/frequencies
produced by the elevators. Solutions such as this had been previously applied in the audio and
manufacturing industries, but had never been applied to a class A high-rise office building.
CBRE’s unique solution not only corrected the distorted harmonics, it eliminated the brownout
conditions. It will also deliver future energy savings. Specific benefits include:
Savings of $3.8 million to client (Total Project Costs: $146,000 vs. projected $4 million)

Capabilities
The transition process involves assembling a team comprised of CBRE functional leaders and the
proposed team to clearly define our key deliverables and develop a detailed plan that will be
used as a key tracking tool throughout the process.
CBRE will kick off the transition of ICC and LOS with a planning session, wherein our transition
team develops a charter that includes a clear delineation of our scope, objectives, stakeholders,
as well as key deliverables and milestones. During this session, we also identify the specific
activities each functional and support area will undertake to implement our improved services.
These activities will be placed into the work plan, which is updated weekly through a rigorous
control process, to ensure that all parties stay on track and on schedule with their activities.
The work plan will be categorized according to the transition time period (Initiation, Transition,
Post-Transition) and by service line (Account Management, Accounting, Transaction
Management, Lease Administration, Facilities Management and FM Support Operations.) Within
these sections, we detail specific deliverables that we promise to deliver and the expected
durations for each activity.

While CBRE directly manages many aspects ourselves, we also engage subcontractors for certain
services. Our approach to the “self perform vs. subcontract” decision balances on the questions
of impact, duration and investment.
Impact–CBRE prefers to self-perform those tasks that have the maximum potential to impact
the service delivery process. These positions create strategy, develop processes, manage
service quality, improve technical service delivery, assure employee safety, communicate with
the City of Indianapolis, control risks and constrain costs. Our proposed organization
structure staffs the ICC and LOS with required management and technical staff to ensure the
leverage of these functions across all service areas. High volume, low-skilled positions and
very low volume high-skilled positions are typically contracted to third parties.
Duration–CBRE and CBRE Technical Services prefer to maintain a stable workforce staffed at
a baseline level of work demands. Minor spikes are absorbed within the base staffing model
and project-oriented work spikes may be carried by non-account specific, variable CBRE or
CBRE Technical Services resources. Work efforts that are recurring and have short durations,
like chiller or UPS annual routines, are typically contracted to specialized service providers.
Investment–Some services require a line of specialized training (Food Service) or specific
equipment investment (Electrical High-Voltage IR Scanning). We believe purchasing such
resources through a specialized sub-contractor provides the best use of capital.
CBRE’s philosophy generally is to self-perform the technical services such as maintenance and
energy, and subcontract the non-technical services such as janitorial, roads and grounds, food

Capabilities
managers, transaction managers, lease administrators, and accountants. Self performance can
result in reduced costs (removing a layer of overhead and profit) by developing cross-trained
teams and provides a “sense of ownership” on behalf of CBRE employees who work onsite.

SUPPLIER MANAGEMENT
CBRE believes that managing and mentoring the performance of our suppliers is critical to the
success of this engagement. Our facility management playbooks provide our team with a
standardized approach that uses quarterly surveys of the management team along with annual
occupant surveys to track the success of all subcontracted services.
CBRE has developed a standard framework to govern the supplier management process.
Additionally, we typically institute a specific Supplier Rating and Measurement Program for each
client based on the needs and requirements of the account. We regularly measure our suppliers’
performance through walkthroughs, customer satisfaction surveys, management quality control
inspection, scorecards, and quantitative analysis.

REVENUE MAXIMIZATION

Retail Leasing
Leasing to concession retailers drives significant revenue for the facilities. Opportunities exist to
seize additional leasing opportunities at ICC and LOS that will simultaneously enhance the guest
experience. CBRE’s retail leasing experts can identify the ideal mix of tenants. There is not a
national retail tenant that is not represented by CBRE somewhere in the country.
Lease Administration
Meticulous lease administration is critical to maximizing the earning potential of the ICC and
LOS. It is also a critical component for managing all aspects of each tenant's lease. The Facility
Manager and Controller are responsible for the following items:
Abstracting all leases on the approved abstract form
All abstracts must be reviewed and approved at Senior Facility Manager level or above
Input of all leases and amendments into the accounting system
Preparation of escalation billings
Tracking of security deposits and letters of credit
Critical dates management
Managers transferred to or transitioning from an assignment are to conduct complete audit of
all leases within 30 days
CBRE conducts an internal audit to ensure accuracy

Capabilities
PROCUREMENT
Our Facility Managers are trained to leverage our procurement platform to identify areas that can
be improved to enhance operating systems and efficiencies to reduce a facility’s overall expenses.
Strategic Sourcing Network
Dedicated, full-time CBRE employees operate at a global level to manage our company-wide
procurement practices. Our Procurement Managers deliver solutions and savings opportunities
for their assigned accounts on a day-to-day basis, and are connected to our Strategic Sourcing
functional leadership via the Sourcing Network. The Sourcing Network conducts collaborative
sourcing events such as multi-account “group” bidding, bulk purchasing and reverse auctions.
The group is involved in supply chain management industry organizations, including the Sourcing
Interests Group (SIG) and the Institute for Supply Management (ISM).

CBRE has relationships with the most qualified suppliers and subcontractors in the industry,
enabling us to achieve deeper discounts than those available on a one-off basis in the local
marketplace. CBRE’s Sourcing Network manages our relationships with global suppliers and
service providers and all company-wide negotiated pricing discounts. In a recent account
transition, we were able to offer a 9% discount on a high-dollar subcontracted service, using the
same service provider, under the same scope of work, solely due to CBRE’s national contract with
the incumbent subcontractor.
Multi-Account Group Bidding
An integral part of our sourcing strategy for ICC and LOS will involve conducting bids collectively
with other CBRE-managed accounts. The table on the following page highlights some results of
our program.

QUALITY MANAGEMENT
CBQ is the exclusive quality management platform of CBRE. An internal network of people,
processes and tools, CBQ ensures consistent, best-in-class service delivery to our clients.
CBQ defines a systematic approach to quality service delivery. Complementing PortfolioIQ™,
CBRE’s comprehensive portfolio optimization framework, CBQ provides account teams with
access to the latest tools and best practices that support superior portfolio performance. By
implementing CBQ on each client account, CBRE is differentiated from other service providers–
pioneering an industry-leading quality program. Five guiding principles frame and inform this
Quality Platform:
Client Focus–Our clients’ goals and strategies drive our account strategy and service
approach.
Process Framework–Our process methodology leads to consistent execution and predictable
service delivery.

Continuous Improvement–We strive to progressively improve our processes, technology
and expertise, resulting in the continual enhancement of each account.
Ethical Foundation–Integrity, fairness and transparency are values that guide our actions
and empower our relationships.
Global Standards
CBQ establishes baseline service delivery standards for all client accounts. These standards form
the CBRE criterion for consistent, quality service delivery–while protecting against risk or financial
loss. CBQ Global Standards are implemented in every service line and for account management
overall.

KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
CBRE believes the continual monitoring of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) drives performance
and focus. We recommend that KPIs are jointly developed between the City of Indianapolis and
CBRE during the transition period and measured quarterly by the Strategic Evaluation Team (SET).
KPIs are both quantitative and qualitative and include such areas as occupancy cost reduction,
training, and customer satisfaction.
Establishing KPIs is a critical component of each CBRE outsourcing partnership, and needs to link
the client’s long-term objectives to the day-to-day tactical activities. The KPIs are weighted and
reflect the priorities of the client’s business plan. KPIs can include, but are not limited to:
Budget variance
Specific savings initiatives
Cost avoidance initiatives

BALANCED SCORECARD
CBRE uses a Balanced Scorecard to report on KPI performance results. Collaborative tracking
processes are put in place to collect information relevant to these metrics and communicate
results for feedback. We work with our clients to analyze the outcomes to ensure performance
meets or exceeds expectations. Typical categories within the balanced scorecard include:

Customer Satisfaction–Survey result targets from end users and/or client real estate
management.
Service Delivery/Processes–Performance targets regarding reporting, communication,
service delivery levels, process improvement achievements, etc.
Technology–Goals related to implementation of new technology and consistent operation of
existing systems.
Employee Development–Job satisfaction surveys of the CBRE team, training goals and
targets, etc.

CUSTOMER SATISFACTION
CBRE measures and reports customer satisfaction on four levels, as described on the following
chart from the most tactical to strategic.

faster decision-making and dynamic
performance measurement across
every service line we support.
Insight leverages the best-in-class
underlying applications from the
industry (e.g., work order system,
lease administration system, others) with CBRE’s proprietary executive reporting tools, market
intelligence, and advanced strategy tools.
Insight provides our strategists with proprietary tools, market research, economic forecasting and
benchmarking data which is analyzed against account performance to uncover savings
opportunities.

TECHNOLOGY

CB RICHARD ELLIS | INFORMATION & QUALIFICATIONS TO CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS FOR COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE SERVICES

Capabilities
PortfolioIQ is a proprietary, strategic account management tool that uses a robust, technologyenabled assessment process to drive innovation, best practices and continual improvement.
PortfolioIQ is used to identify cost savings and service delivery opportunities across all core
functions. The concept is simple, but the results are powerful. A recent PortfolioIQ diagnostic with
an existing CBRE client identified over 30 cost saving opportunities valued at $60 million in
savings over four years. PortfolioIQ was developed to solve four primary objectives:
Reduce costs
Increase portfolio flexibility
Improve alignment between the business and portfolio
Increase service levels
PortfolioIQ is ultimately about documenting and leveraging best practices in an efficient manner,
prioritizing and communicating CRE initiatives, serving as a roadmap to identify opportunities,
and ensuring long-term continuous improvement through its integration with CBRE’s quality
management program.

At CBRE, Health, Security, Safety and Environmental (HSSE) responsibilities are an important part
in the way we do business. Successfully managing HSSE issues is an essential component of our
business strategy. Through observance and implementation of this policy, we assist in protecting
the environment and the overall well-being of all of our employees, clients, subcontractors, and
the communities of which we are a part.
Achieving these objectives requires us to identify HSSE risks arising from our activities and reduce
them to the lowest practical levels. Our goal is to minimize impact to the environment and to
prevent harm to our employees, our clients, our communities, and all others who could be
affected by those activities.
CBRE management will maintain a proactive approach toward creating safe working
environments for all employees and will continually promote safety education and training for all
employees, continuously review the HSSE program to identify potential areas of improvement,
and ensure that a thorough evaluation of all incidents is performed.
We will continually monitor and address the environmental and health impact of our operations
by reducing waste, emissions, and discharges and by using energy efficiently.
We will maintain awareness of HSSE matters in a proactive fashion that will provide a valueadded service to our clients. This awareness is achieved through education, communication,
clearly established HSE responsibilities and expectations, and defined goals and standards
appropriate for our operations and in concert with those of our clients.
At CBRE we believe that zero incident performance in HSSE is more than a goal, it is an
expectation that is achieved on a task-by-task basis.

ENERGY AND SUSTAINABILITY
CBRE professionals are actively engaged with clients around the world in developing and
implementing “green” programs. We have also established a global task force to aggregate and
share best practices, create educational programs for clients and employees, and develop
internal policies and business practices.
At the facilities CBRE occupies, we expect to achieve carbon neutrality by 2010 through a
combination of energy savings, more efficient space utilization and carbon emissions reductions.
CBRE helps clients achieve sizable reductions in energy use through a variety of supply and
demand-side approaches. CBRE’s approach is based on six core components, providing a full
range of services to consistently improve energy performance and the bottom line.

A sound macro-level plan is a fundamental component of CBRE’s overall energy cost
management strategy. It involves a thorough evaluation of the client’s facilities to determine the
potential for energy cost savings company-wide. An effective macro-level plan creates client buyin early in the process. It also lays the foundation for a more comprehensive program in the
future that includes supply-side and demand-side analysis on a facility-specific basis.
Sound Billing and Information Management
CBRE works with experienced external energy partners to screen each client’s utility bills for
accuracy and to ensure timely payment. External partners also collect and maintain detailed
information about the client’s energy use in a Web-based format. Gathering detailed
consumption data at the facility-level is a critical step toward understanding opportunities for
energy cost savings. It enables CBRE to benchmark energy use at your facilities.
Effective Demand-Side Management
CBRE helps clients achieve sizable reductions in energy use through a variety of demand-side
approaches. One key strategy is changing occupant behavior through energy awareness
programs. Changing operations and maintenance procedures–including adjusting the time that
major building systems come online to evaluating the impact of custodial services on energy use–
is key to CBRE’s approach. CBRE also supports infrastructure upgrades to improve equipment
efficiency, including using energy savings to pay for new equipment on a guaranteed basis.
Infrastructure Upgrades
CBRE has developed cost savings initiatives relating to infrastructure upgrades to improve
equipment efficiency. CBRE uses the latest technologies to reduce energy consumption. Coupled
with rebates and CBRE’s buying power, CBRE has been able to achieve very favorable returns on
investment and net present value savings relating to the installation of this equipment. Many of
these technologies do not require a large investment relative to the return.

Capabilities
Supply-Side Management
CBRE offers value-added supply-side services. In “choice” states, CBRE and external energy
partners help clients secure the most cost-effective rate from the utility, taking into account the
client’s appetite for risk. CBRE provides expert analysis to help clients evaluate opportunities for
cost savings through fuel switching, onsite power generation, and curtailment. CBRE also ensures
that clients are classified under the correct tariff structure, often leading to significant savings.
Reporting On Results For Energy Cost Management
Through informative quarterly reports, CBRE carefully documents savings achieved from energy
cost management measures. This action ensures that both the client and CBRE benefit from a
successful energy management program under CBRE’s performance-based contracts.
Energy Initiatives

Benchmarking than 1,204 office properties, representing over 228 MSF by the end of 2008
Completing a “best practices audit” for more than 600 properties, with additional progress

INTRODUCTION
The City of Fort Wayne engaged the Hunden Strategic Partners team, which includes Sink Combs
Dethlefs (SCD), referred to collectively as HSP, HSP Team or Team, to conduct a market, financial
and impact analysis related to the development of a mid-sized arena to be located in downtown
Fort Wayne. Given the success of Parkview Field in bringing consistent warm-weather activity,
crowds and energy downtown, as well as the overall improvement in downtown development,
many stakeholders wondered if an event center that is active primarily from fall through spring
would generate similar energy, activity, and improvement to business in downtown Fort Wayne,
creating a year-round set of event facilities.
The primary questions that HSP was requested to answer are:
!

Is there enough potential activity and demand in the market to support the
development of a new arena downtown, given the existence of the larger Coliseum
outside of downtown?

!

Are there events that are accepting lesser dates or less ideal accommodations
currently that would improve or expand their activity at a new, smaller facility?

!

How much would the arena cost and would it need ongoing financial support beyond
the initial development?

!

How would this ongoing arena activity benefit downtown and all of Fort Wayne?
What impacts are expected?

!

What are the optimal governance options for the facility to ensure success?

Many cities have used event facilities as activity and demand generators to enhance their
downtowns and overall development efforts. The activity of arenas can generate consistent usage,
which provides consistent nearby street-level activity for restaurants and bars and some retail. It
also provides downtown employees and residents a major activity center nearby to walk to after
work. Yet the facility itself must be able to generate enough events on the calendar to keep it
operating without significant financial support. No arena pays completely for itself -- clearly the
War Memorial Coliseum has received tens of millions of dollars in state and local financial
support for capital and operations over its lifetime – the design and operating concept of any new
facility should ensure that it can maximize revenues and minimize expenses for a net positive
operating profile.
HSP met with key stakeholders, interviewed and surveyed existing and potential arena users,
analyzed the competition, reviewed the physical and calendar situation at the Coliseum, analyzed
the market, investigated comparable situations, and worked with SCD to understand the state of
art in arena design today.
Based on HSP’s analysis, the following was determined:

Fort Wayne Downtown Arena Analysis

Executive Summary – Page 1

!

The Coliseum is a larger and successful facility that has received significant market
and government support over several decades. It has expanded several times,
including an expansion of the arena “bowl” to increase the number of seats. It excels
at very large events, including those public shows and concerts that require acres of
parking.

!

The market is large enough that having one facility attempt to service all of the event
types has meant that it is difficult for many users/events to get dates at a reasonable
cost (comparable to other like markets). While the Coliseum has many space options,
it is difficult for it to be all things to all events.

!

The Coliseum has a difficult time accommodating all of the events that would like to
use the facility, given demand for the same dates during many months of the year.
Some events are accommodated in alternate spaces (not the primary arena bowl) that
user groups do not prefer.

!

The Coliseum seating bowl is much larger than what most events, games and acts
can fill (in many cases double the size necessary). This results in the events seeming
“empty” to the players, band and audience, which diminishes the experience. In fact,
the facility rarely fills all the seats. While it can curtain off sections, the set up is not
ideal for hosting smaller events.

!

There are current users (both sports and event producers for certain events) who
would prefer a smaller, more intimate arena setting, with seating that is closer to the
court/floor, with better date options.

!

There is a gap between the large capacity at the Coliseum and the small capacity at
the Embassy Theater. There are many events that are simply too large or not the
right type of event for the Embassy, but are too small to break even or work well in
the very large Coliseum.

!

There are many examples of new mid-sized arenas in markets with existing larger
arenas nearby where both have active calendars. There are acts and events for large
and small/mid-sized arenas and they often do not overlap.

!

Fort Wayne’s downtown has enhanced its reputation as a fun, walkable city with
more leisure time activities, at least in the warmer months via the development of
Parkview Field. However, during the cold months, unless there is an event at the
Grand Wayne Center or Embassy Theater, the downtown still has a limited number of
“demand generators” like an arena or event center. Most restaurants and retail
businesses need that consistent year-round demand in order to survive. Currently
there are a number of vacant restaurant spaces that would be much more viable with
more events throughout the year.

!

As HSP has noted in its work on the Grand Wayne Convention Center, in terms of
the destination itself, Fort Wayne is at an inflection point. It has developed enough
facilities to begin to be noticed and acceptable for certain types of events and
visitors, not to mention residents. However, in order to attract higher spending
groups, visitors and residents an improvement in the downtown attractiveness is

Fort Wayne Downtown Arena Analysis

Executive Summary – Page 2

necessary. Expanding existing facilities like the GWCC is not enough. The key deficit
now is in the destination package and appeal of downtown Fort Wayne. The key
items that are missing are nodes of restaurant and entertainment activity, more high
quality hotel choices and an overall vibe of “things to do” downtown. The
development of Parkview Field and related projects has helped, and the new Ash
tower will also help. However, more restaurants, a potential event or entertainment
center and retail/general downtown activity (from residents, workers, visitors) will
help.
!

The impact in terms of activity and recaptured demand is expected to have
measurable and intrinsic benefits to Fort Wayne. Fort Wayne is one of few strong
mid-sized Midwest regional centers of its size without a major university or a state
capital. It has thrived despite the odds, while many other similar cities in the Midwest
have contracted. Fort Wayne has retooled and reinvested, including downtown. The
attractiveness of its downtown is the heartbeat of what Fort Wayne offers to
businesses, residents and visitors. It receives visitors from throughout northern
Indiana, northwest Ohio and southern Michigan for its events and to use its hospitals
and retail nodes. A new event center downtown will reinforce and enhance this draw
to the city, especially to downtown. New residential and restaurant development is
much more likely after the development of such a facility. Corporations will be more
likely to locate downtown with such a facility.

Summary of Report & Recommendations
The summary of this report’s chapters, its recommendations and projections are shown next.

SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS FROM CHAPTERS
Local Demographics and Economy
The city of Fort Wayne is located in northeastern Indiana, southwest of South Bend and west of
the Ohio state border. Just to the west of Fort Wayne is Warsaw, Indiana. The two cities are
renowned hubs for medical engineering and medical technology companies. Fort Wayne is the
largest city and seat of Allen County.
The MSA had a 2010 census population of 416,257. According to 2013 population estimates, the
MSA has grown to 424,122. The city proper increased in population between the 2000 and 2010
census from 205,727 to 253,691, or 23.3 percent.
The region has seen steady growth during the past decade. This is due in part to Fort Wayne’s
proximity to Warsaw, IN, the “World’s Orthopedic Capital” and growth in tourism to Allen county.
The area has also transitioned from a manufacturing base to one that includes growing service,
financial and other companies, including Vera Bradley. However, its manufacturing economy is
strong, headed by General Motors and others. The orthopedic industry is an $11 billion dollar
global industry that attracts jobs, conventions and investments into the northern Indiana region.
Nearly six million people visit Fort Wayne annually.
The community has seen steady growth throughout the past decade. This is due in part to a
diversified economy, growing airport facilities and nearby industries, and efficient regional access
via roads and railways. The community has also seen substantial growth in the tourism business,
especially related to downtown development. Nearly six million people visit Fort Wayne each year,
and the community hopes to continue to grow the local tourism industry. The new Parkview
Field, recently expanded Grand Wayne Center and new Courtyard by Marriott convention hotel,
Embassy Theater, and the War Memorial Coliseum complex are outstanding facilities that draw
hundreds of thousands of visitors to the community each year, especially to downtown. The
primary event facility not located downtown is the Coliseum. This focuses much visitor activity
outside of downtown for many events.
This downtown enhancement, combined with the growing market size, is a positive environment
for the development of additional event facilities downtown.

Local Market Analysis
HSP evaluated the local sports and entertainment venues to determine both the supply of local
facilities for event as well as the existing demand for arena events to determine how a downtown
arena could impact the Fort Wayne market. The facilities were determined by their location,
facility components, quality, and discussions with local and regional sport and entertainment
organizations.

The following map shows the sports and entertainment venues in the Fort Wayne metro area.

Fort Wayne Downtown Arena Analysis

Executive Summary – Page 5

Figure 1

Located three miles northeast of downtown Fort Wayne, the Allen County War Memorial Coliseum
is the largest venue in the Fort Wayne metro area, with a seating capacity of 13,000. Foellinger
Theatre and Piere’s Entertainment Center, which have capacities of 2,751 and 2,000 spectators,
are the only other venues located outside of the downtown limits. The Embassy Theatre, USF
Performing Arts Center, C2G Music Hall, and Grand Wayne Center comprise the downtown sports
and entertainment venues.
The Fort Wayne market is currently dominated by the Allen County War Memorial Coliseum,
which is the primary sport and entertainment venue in the community. Facility tenants, such as
the Mad Ants and Derby Girls, have little influence on their rates or event dates due to the lack of
supply of facilities, as well as their reliance upon the Coliseum. In addition, the facilities provided
are not ideal as they are too large to create an intimate and exciting atmosphere. While
management is expert at the Coliseum, these organizations are not satisfied with their current

Fort Wayne Downtown Arena Analysis

Executive Summary – Page 6

!

situation, and would be interested in moving to a smaller, more intimate facility in downtown Fort
Wayne.
The concerts being held at the Coliseum are often held with the upper bowl curtained off,
suggesting that a smaller venue would be more ideal for many events. While the intent of a new
facility is not to pull events from the Coliseum, if events are not performing as well as they could,
they could move and the benefits would accrue to the fans and users/tenants. In addition, there
are a number of new events not occurring currently that would be induced to a new, smaller
facility. A downtown arena would provide much-needed competition to the market and allow Fort
Wayne to potentially attract some entertainment events that the market cannot currently
accommodate.

Small & Midsized Arena Trends
Arena and multipurpose event center development for mid-sized metropolitan markets and
suburban areas of major markets have been increasing in the last decade for a variety of reasons.
Smaller venues provide an opportunity to host the size of events that make financial sense for
many market sizes, including performing arts, concerts, family shows, and community events,
not to mention trade shows and conventions. In certain metropolitan areas, like Fort Wayne,
these facilities often attract events that are too small for (or make more financial sense than in)
the large facilities, like the Coliseum. There is often a wide gap in the capacity between the largest
and next largest venue in the community, which is the case in Fort Wayne. The Coliseum is a
very large venue for this size market and the Embassy Theater is a smaller concert/performance
venue for specific types of events. There is no dedicated facility for events that would prefer to fit
in a facility between 3,000 and 10,000 seats. Many of these events that tour the U.S. are not
finding a home in Fort Wayne and there is a growing roster of events for these smaller arenas.
Producers of these events can often make more money in a smaller venue than a larger one, as
rental and other deal components are more favorable. Also, acts and teams like to play in
facilities that are similar in size to the audience. Most performers or teams do not like to play
within a large facility that is only partially filled.
More content (events, performing acts, etc.) has been developed to tour these smaller venues.
Fort Wayne should be able to host a number of concerts, family shows, and other events and
should be able to induce new events to the market and accommodate other events that currently
are not being optimally accommodated at other venues currently.

State and Regional Arenas
Fort Wayne’s primary event, concert, and family show facility competition comes from arenas in
Indiana, southwest Michigan and northwestern Ohio. The cities shown on the following map and
table have been identified as the most directly competitive facilities. However, in terms of where
arenas draw their audience from, these markets are mostly worlds unto themselves and it is not
very frequent that Fort Wayne residents travel to these arenas to see sporting events, concerts or
family shows. In fact, it is often the case that residents of areas like South Bend-Elkhart-Goshen

would travel to Fort Wayne for an event. Each of these arenas, except the Ford Center, is within a
three-hour drive of Fort Wayne.
The following map shows these non-Fort Wayne arenas in relation to Fort Wayne.

As shown, the Bankers Life Fieldhouse in Indianapolis has the largest crowd capacity and is also
the only arena in the list to have a team in one of the major leagues (NBA or NHL) as a tenant.
This facility is the biggest in-state competitor due to the size and number of marquee topgrossing concerts and shows, some of which might not stop in Fort Wayne, or if they do stop,
may be at a later date. Fort Wayne is a popular stop for concert promoters as the market has the
reputation of selling more tickets than is typical of a market of that size. However, if Fort Wayne
is not on a national tour’s first itinerary through the Midwest, then a venue in Fort Wayne may be
able to schedule a show on an “off” night between two shows in larger markets. Otherwise, Fort
Wayne’s residents will travel to larger cities, like Indianapolis, Detroit or Chicago to see a highly
valued show or one that is only going to major facilities.

Fort Wayne Downtown Arena Analysis

Executive Summary – Page 10

South Bend’s renovated Joyce Center, at the University of Notre Dame, lies about 90 minutes to
the northwest, however, with the Notre Dame basketball and volleyball schedules, and other
student activities, the arena is often in use and does not host many touring concerts or other
shows. Residents of South Bend will often travel to Chicago, Fort Wayne or area casinos to see
live events. Evansville’s 2011 Ford Center is the state’s newest multi-use arena and is only
competitive with Fort Wayne in situations involving Indiana state athletic tournaments and
revolving state shows or events.
Arenas in Kalamazoo, Battle Creek, Grand Rapids and Toledo are the only other possible arenas
that may possibly present any competition, however, their populations, media markets and tenant
sports teams are within their own areas of dominant influence, and rarely advertise in the Fort
Wayne market, just as Fort Wayne would not expect a large percentage of population from Grand
Rapids or Kalamazoo to travel to Fort Wayne to see a show or event. Therefore they do not
present any real threat of competition to an arena in Fort Wayne.
A new arena in Fort Wayne is not directly in competition with these profiled arenas because they
serve different geographical populations and markets. However, Fort Wayne already pulls
audiences from surrounding markets like South Bend-Elkhart and Toledo. With additional event
options on the calendar in a compelling setting, Fort Wayne would likely establish itself as the
entertainment hub for the northern Indiana and southern Michigan region, not to mention western
Ohio.
For the regional markets, there are several examples of how a new arena venue, even a small
one, can provide a resurgence of energy, money, interest, and human life into a city’s downtown.
Just as Parkview Field has brought new excitement and fans into downtown, an indoor
wintertime venue could provide the same type of stimulus in downtown Fort Wayne. It has shown
to work in cities such as Indianapolis and Grand Rapids, both larger cities, but also in Evansville,
a smaller city, where a first-rate arena is hosting the NCAA Division II Men’s Basketball Elite Eight
tournament in consecutive years, and bringing thousand of fans from across the country. A city
like Toledo, which is not a great deal larger than Fort Wayne, and is more economically stable,
can sustain two arenas that both bring popular talent to the city, while each serves their own
purpose on their end of the city (one being a basketball arena for a university and the other is an
ice hockey and municipal entertainment facility to help a distressed downtown scene).
Cities such as Battle Creek and Kalamazoo, which are both smaller than Fort Wayne, have found
ways to make use of their aging facilities by keeping them fresh with inventive ways to keep the
public using them. In Battle Creek, the Kellogg’s arena receives thousands of student-athletes and
their parents each year due to their commitment to hosting high school athletic championships.
Kalamazoo’s arena and exhibition hall bring in shows such as flower and garden shows, and
trade shows to accompany skating clubs and hockey tournaments.
Overall, the regional arena facilities show that even in small or mid-sized markets, multiple
facilities can be well utilized in a single market. It also suggests that the primary audience is
found within the metro area and just beyond, unless the venue is extremely large or there are no
other venues in surrounding areas. An example of the large facility that pulls from other markets

Fort Wayne Downtown Arena Analysis

Executive Summary – Page 11

is Bankers Life in Indianapolis. An example of a facility that pulls from as far as 150 miles is the
Ford Center in Evansville, due to the lack of facilities in any direction for about two to three
hours’ drive time (Indianapolis, Nashville, St. Louis).

Comparable Arena Profiles
There have been a number of new, smaller arenas built in the U.S over the past decade that offer
similarities to the situation in Fort Wayne. HSP sought out arenas in smaller markets or arenas in
markets where there was already an existing larger arena to determine how the market could
support the newer, smaller facility while still supporting the existing facility.
The purpose of investigating comparable facilities is two-fold. It is important to understand if and
how such facilities have performed in similar markets and what implications their performance or
physical program should have on what is recommended in Fort Wayne. Also, investigating their
demand history (attendance, event types and number of events) as well as specific line item
revenue and expense detail provides a top-down and bottom-up approach to understanding how
a similar facility could perform in Fort Wayne.
HSP has reviewed a number of facilities and discusses them as well as implications below.

The comparable facilities were chosen based on the facility size as well as the local area
demographics. The cities where the facilities are located are cities with MSA populations between
150,000 and two million people. The facilities are located within or near several large
metropolitan statistical areas where they compete with larger arenas and other similar-sized event
centers and meeting centers, like Ft. Wayne, which is located approximately 125 miles north of
Indianapolis, Indiana.
The Cross Insurance Arena in Portland, Maine is the largest of the comparable facilities with a
concert seating capacity up to 8,795. The five other comparable facilities have concert capacities
between 7,000 and 8,700, and basketball capacities between 5,800 and 6,800.
Each facility identified was developed to meet the individual demands for communities with
increased demand for recreational and/or sports and entertainment facilities. While the size and

Fort Wayne Downtown Arena Analysis

Executive Summary – Page 12

scale of these facilities varies, each venue attracts similar event types. HSP sought to identify
situations where multiple facilities, large and small, were serving a market as would be the case
in Fort Wayne (which serves an area larger than just the Fort Wayne MSA). One example is the
set of three facilities, two small and one large in Maine and New Hampshire. All are in the same
market, generally speaking, and all are successful. While the two smaller facilities attract or split
the same types of concerts, the smaller facilities do not take events from the larger Verizon Arena
in Manchester. They are simply two different sizes and are attractive to two different sets of event
types. This is expected to hold true in Fort Wayne. Similar situations play out in the Boise and
Omaha markets.
Tenants provide a stable event schedule and help to supplement each facility’s usage and
financials. Newer venues integrating flexible function space are able to support and attract new
groups and events, which generates positive and new economic impact on the city. In addition,
maximizing revenue-generating features such as naming rights, sponsorships, premium seating,
and concessions in the venue not only benefits the bottom line, but also provide opportunities to
develop partnerships in the community. Although large market cities are developing single
purpose venues, small market cities have the challenge of developing flexible multipurpose
venues that can attract a variety of events, while keeping the setting intimate for spectators.
The Project’s success will depend on how well the facility’s management and staff can meet the
standards set by these comparable facilities. Not only do these venues offer insight into the usage
and financial performance, they will also serve to benchmark industry competitive trends. For Fort
Wayne, a new facility should include the amenities expected by both users (bands, event
coordinators, talent, teams, etc.) and visitors.

SWOT Analysis

Strengths
!

Committed Community Leadership. The City of Fort Wayne and Allen County’s
leadership have demonstrated a commitment to stimulating redevelopment and
reinvestment in the community, especially the downtown area. In addition, these
commitments may take the form of financial contributions that could allow for better
facilities geared toward a longer-term growth trajectory.

!

Downtown Redevelopment. Downtown Fort Wayne has seen improvement based on
private investment and public leadership. A vibrant downtown consists of popular
restaurants, shops, and entertainment, providing a more visible face to the city and
drawing more visitors from the surrounding areas. This helps the community as a
whole and proves to visitors, residents and business owners that it is serious about a
vision for itself. When private interests see development occurring on a regular basis
downtown, they have more confidence to invest as well. The success of Parkview
Field and surrounding developments have given downtown new life. Now people are
interested in expanding the active feeling that occurs in summer months to the rest
of the year.

Fort Wayne Downtown Arena Analysis

Executive Summary – Page 13

!

Strong Existing Event Demand. Perhaps one of the most encouraging signs for a
project is the strong demand for time and space at the War Memorial Coliseum.
Currently, demand is so strong that the calendar is full much of the year and events
and tenants that want dates have to settle for lesser dates or facilities within the
Coliseum. With a new arena facility, Fort Wayne will be able to have more events
occurring more often within better accommodations.

!

Potential for More Events. The success of a new arena cannot rest on transfer of
events from existing venues. Based on interviews and the success of other similar
facilities, there will be new events and potential tenants for the arena that do not exist
in or come to Fort Wayne now. The facility would fit a size range that is simply not
available today and that is attractive to many potential events.

!

Net positive impact on the Embassy Theater. Based on the analysis and interviews,
a new arena would not compete for events with the Embassy Theater. The Embassy’s
set up and size is such that there are very few events that would consider both types
of options, given the size and configuration difference. On the positive side, the more
that downtown is active, the more local and regional residents will walk downtown
and see the Embassy and what it has to offer. A stronger downtown should result in
a larger audience for the Embassy.

!

Strong and Growing Market. Fort Wayne is one of the few cities and regions of its
size and type in the Midwest that continues to grow. It weathered the last recession
well and transformed into a regional center for health and related industries,
advanced manufacturing, service industries and is a regional youth sports hub. The
convention center and downtown, along with new hotels, have helped the area
become stronger in terms of conventions and events. In short, Fort Wayne is a
growing, attractive and safe regional center of activity.

!

Access. Fort Wayne’s access off of I-69 and US 30 give it easy access to many major
cities across the Midwest, and hence make it easy for visitors to come to events
downtown.

!

Growing Content for Small Arenas. There has been a boom in small and mid-sized
arenas across the US for 15 years and there is specific content (family shows,
concerts, etc.) that has been developed for this size venue. There are many more
small and mid-sized venues across the U.S. than major arenas and so this provides
the acts a steady stream of opportunity. A new facility would provide an opportunity
for those acts to come to Fort Wayne.

Weaknesses
!

Midsized Market with Existing Larger Arena. The regional marketplace has been
supporting the Coliseum for decades and the facility has enjoyed success. While it is
larger than necessary for most events and is often too busy to accommodate the
desires of all users, it performs well and most users have few complaints. This
suggests that a new arena will need to thread the needle of the market by attracting

Fort Wayne Downtown Arena Analysis

Executive Summary – Page 14

new events in all categories and also providing better service and accommodation
that existing users are receiving at the Coliseum. For some event types, this will not
be a challenge, but for others, the Coliseum is still a strong representative for the
Fort Wayne market and accommodates users well. In larger markets, having multiple
arenas can be supported by the large marketplace. In Fort Wayne, the new facility will
need to fit a niche in size, event type, and downtown location that offers something
unique and beneficial to users and attendees.

Opportunities
!

New Events for Fort Wayne. Currently, the Coliseum is so busy during certain times
of the year that dates are not available or the cost to acquire dates is too high. As a
result, there appear to be a number of events that are not coming to Fort Wayne or
existing events are taking lesser dates or days of the week. There are also existing
users/events that are paying more than they otherwise would, which makes the event
less profitable and less likely to succeed or return. With a new facility, there will be
more opportunity for events of all sizes to host their event in Fort Wayne.

!

Better Setting for Smaller Events. Currently, the Coliseum is simply too large to
make most events feel exciting and as if they are in an appropriately size facility. With
more than 10,000 seats, any event with fewer than 7,000 attendees (most events)
tend to feel less engaging. This has a negative impact on the players or performers,
who feel they are playing to an emptier facility, as well as the attendees, who feel as
if they are in an emptier, less exciting setting. With a better, tighter atmosphere,
smaller events and basketball games, for example, should attract more attendees,
making them more successful and popular for the community.

!

Design Oriented for Basketball and Closer Viewing. HSP is recommending a design
that brings the action closer to the seats. While the Coliseum is designed for hockey,
which results in a non-intimate basketball setting, the proposed arena downtown
would have a basketball-oriented design.

!

Opportunity for Events to “Own” the Facility. Smaller markets can attract groups
that do not like being one of many events in a larger facility or forced into
accommodations that are not an ideal size or setting type. In a smaller facility, an
event is able to book an entire building and fill it.

!

Opportunity for Events Covered by Television. With a new facility, the community
would have the opportunity to attract NBA exhibition events that are nationally
televised, as well as NCAA basketball playoff games (Divisions II and III) that are also
nationally televised. This will provide additional free positive press for downtown Fort
Wayne that currently does not exist.

!

Catalytic Development. The proposed arena can serve as a catalytic development to
retain and attract businesses, groups, and visitors to downtown Fort Wayne. An
event center/arena can be the catalytic development that generates year-round activity
to support the development of restaurants and other downtown businesses. Such

Fort Wayne Downtown Arena Analysis

Executive Summary – Page 15

activity only exists in the warm months now (beyond conventions). With additional
events and businesses, more hotels are likely (the arena should generate enough
room nights to support an additional small hotel downtown). Development is often a
catch-22 situation. An investment such as an arena is not necessarily feasible without
other amenities and demand generators. Other amenities and demand generators are
not as likely to occur as quickly without an arena. To start the development trend,
public entities can spur action by investing in this area now, helping to bridge the
risk gap that has kept other developers reticent to take a risk. Businesses and
entrepreneurs notice when the city is aggressive and takes and active role in
improving itself via public-private partnerships, key public investments, and other
quality of life enhancements. These create an environment where others are then
more willing to invest time, money, talent and effort into a new business in
downtown Fort Wayne, move there as residents, or visit with their group. New
conventions that would not consider the area now, may be swayed if the event
facilities are expanded in such a way, more restaurants exist, and the hotel package
is larger.
!

Economic, Fiscal and Employment Benefits. The Project will entice visitors to visit
Fort Wayne businesses, restaurants and meeting/event facilities. These visits result in
increased downtown spending, and in turn, an improved local business environment,
additional tax collections and an increased number of employment opportunities. The
visibility that visitors will have of the downtown from the new arena will show off the
community to a new population that may consider visiting again or even moving to
the community. Currently, many people outside Fort Wayne simply are not visiting.
This strategy worked for Indianapolis. A generation ago it did not have much to offer
downtown. Yet with persistent investments, more and more people came to know the
city as a vibrant, growing and enjoyable community. Success breeds success.

!

Strong Relationship & Synergy with Neighboring Projects, Especially the Grand
Wayne Convention Center. A new arena project in Fort Wayne could benefit and
partner with the Grand Wayne Center to attract events that currently cannot be
housed in the facilities at the GWCC alone. Representatives from the GWCC noted in
interviews that having an attached arena would allow Fort Wayne to potentially bid on
and host new and larger events, including those that need a larger assembly set-up
(direct marketing conventions and religious meetings) or more large flat floor space
for tradeshow booths.

Threats
!

Cost – The cost of the project is not insignificant and that could threaten the
possibility of development.

!

U.S. Economy and Weaker Demand – Anytime the economy contracts, which
happens every six to ten years, the performance of venues like arenas suffer,
although typically not in a way that jeopardizes long-term success.

Fort Wayne Downtown Arena Analysis

Executive Summary – Page 16

!

Competition from the Coliseum – While Fort Wayne and the County should see a
growing pie of spending and events from a new facility downtown, the existing
Coliseum may consider such a facility a threat for certain events. As such, efforts
should be made to ensure that the success of both facilities is a priority by public
sector sponsors. Competition typically leads to lower prices and better service and
experiences. So what may be perceived as a threat should actually improve the
market for events, promoters and attendees.

Implications and Recommendations
As has been demonstrated in this report, the Fort Wayne market, its citizens and events would
benefit from a venue that fits a sizing need that is larger than the Embassy Theater and smaller
than the Coliseum. There are a number of events that will come to such a facility that are
currently not using either existing facility. They may be in lesser accommodations locally (certain
concerts, graduations, sports events) or simply not coming to the market at all. In addition, there
is so much demand for space and time at the Coliseum that some events are being squeezed into
tougher date slots or are paying more than they otherwise would with more choice. The Mad
Ants are an example of a tenant that would help free up the Coliseum for better sport, concert,
and other event dates while providing the NBA D-League team a home, dates, and television
broadcast opportunities that are not present now.
The sizing of a venue is driven by the market, users/tenants and site situation. The sizing with the
most opportunity is a facility with 4,500 – 6,000 seats and onsite amenities and parking to
activate the streets and enhance success. Given the limited number of well-located and potentially
available sites downtown, a facility with nearly 5,500 seats in a basketball configuration is
recommended.
In terms of location, the block directly to the west of the Grand Wayne Convention Center
(GWCC) is recommended, due primarily to its ability to connect to the GWCC, its proximity to
existing nodes of activity (Parkview Field) and its larger than typical size. The size allows the
arena to have some attached parking and loading opportunities, as well as street-level
restaurants. One of the primary purposes of this Project is to act as an economic development
generator for downtown. Having restaurant and bar opportunities with large swaths of glass,
allowing for an open and engaging street-level environment in the area all around the facility is
key.
As for other parking, there are many parking structures and lots downtown that are only filled
during the day. These make excellent parking options at night and on weekends during events.
When Evansville developed its arena (double the size of the recommended arena here), no
additional parking was developed and there have been no complaints by users, as they have been
able to utilize the vast amounts of existing weekday parking for events.
The recommended facility and its seating formats are shown in the following table.

As shown, the recommended arena would seat 5,333 for basketball, more than 6,000 for a center
stage concert, nearly 6,200 for boxing, and more than 5,700 for an end stage concert. In the case
of a rodeo set up, about 3,400 seats would be available.
The next table shows the other amenities recommended for the facility. It should be noted that
cost was a factor in limiting the size, amount and quality of all facilities. While the total seat
counts were not impacted, efforts were made to reduce the costs in a number of ways.

Round Tables

Source: Sink Combs Dethlefs

Details surrounding the recommended facility include 32 points of sale in 12 concession locations
and three major street-level restaurants facing out to the street as well as inside the arena during
events. Other food and beverage opportunities are available at the premium seating level, with the
lounge, loge, and suites all featuring food and beverage before and during events. As is standard
with all new facilities, a premium lounge/restaurant at the loge level is critical to attracting higher
spending attendees and corporate users. Fourteen suites are recommended, with two different
size categories. There are suggested to be a variety of loge seating options, including fixed,
casters, and bar height stools.

Fort Wayne Downtown Arena Analysis

Executive Summary – Page 19

In terms of support amenities, all the modern amenities, including locker rooms, offices, large
and numerous restrooms and other support facilities are recommended. A 157-stall parking deck
is recommended on site. This could be expanded with additional levels. It is likely that key staff,
tenants, and premium ticket/suite holders would have access to these spaces. An overhead
connector to the Grand Wayne Convention Center is recommended so that more events can be
lured to a shared, larger facility than if the two were separated. Given the two existing connected
hotels, the arena addition to the complex would make it quite impressive to meeting and event
planners.

Site
Based on the analysis, the best site is the block just west of the Grand Wayne Convention Center.
It will focus event activity downtown and leverage existing strengths, provide a unique and
interesting site and walkable location and will be amongst other community assets.
In the next figure, the site is shown to the left of the Grand Wayne Convention Center. A second
and less optimal alternative is the block north of the GWCC.

The budget assumes the development of a 160,750-square foot arena, 157-stall garage,
connector to the GWCC and three restaurants. The total current budget without soft costs is
$48.65 million and is estimated to be $63.25 million with soft costs and pricing inflation by the
time the facility is built.
The next figures show the layout and site plan of the facility. The first one, below, shows the
basketball configuration. One of the key differences between this design and the Coliseum design
is that the raked seating begins essentially at the basketball court level, whereas at the Coliseum,
there are many rows of essentially flat seating before the raked/raised seating begins. This new
design keeps the fans closer to the action on the floor than they currently experience at the
Coliseum.

The Mad Ants are expected to have 25 home games. The model does not assume any indoor
soccer or football tenants, although these are a possibility. Family shows are projected to stabilize
at six per year, with 14 concerts per year and ten other sporting events. Graduations, flat-floor
events and meetings/banquets are expected to add 46 other annual events.

In total revenue is projected to increase from $2.7 to $4.0 million over the period. This includes
the annual naming rights payment, which is not always counted as an operating revenue item,
but instead used to support initial debt service. After accounting for all operating expenses, net
operating income is projected to be negative $77,000 in the first year, increasing to $396,000 by
the tenth year.

Impact Analysis
The gross operations of the Project will generate a significant amount of economic activity and
various taxes and will support a number of new jobs onsite. However, the critical analysis is the
amount of net new spending generated by the Project in community. While most of the activity
will be new to Fort Wayne, some will be transferred from the Coliseum. However, the reason that
many events will transfer from the Coliseum is the belief by event sponsors that the turnout,
experience, and economic results will be better there. Certainly that is the belief for Mad Ants
basketball, other sports events that will thrive in a basketball-centric format, and concerts that
work best in smaller environments. There will also be many new events, including concerts,
family shows, and flat floor expos and conventions.
In order to determine the impact of these net new events and improved performance of existing
events, HSP made assumptions about the various event types and how many new daytrips and
overnights will occur as a result. The net new room night impact should bring support for an
additional 70 to 80 hotel rooms downtown, which is enough to support an additional small or
boutique hotel.
The basis for the impacts will be the net new room nights due to the Project as well as the net
new day trips, which have a lower economic impact than overnights. The daily spending by
visitors and the overnight spending by overnight visitors all contribute to the economic impact of
the Project.

Economic, Earnings, Employment and Fiscal Impact
In addition to the expected revenue generated onsite, the increased economic activity will result in
higher fiscal activity, income, and employment for the Fort Wayne economy.
The table below shows the direct net new spending, based on the analysis.

Spending on food and beverage is the largest component of new spending to Fort Wayne,
followed by lodging spending. Over the period, a total of nearly $170 million in direct new
spending is projected from the Project over 20 years.

New full-time equivalent jobs (FTE’s) are projected to vary over the period based on the net new
spending, averaging approximately 200 over the period. This is not the number of jobs onsite,
but the number of new full-time equivalent jobs supported in the Fort Wayne economy due to the
activity at the Project (not including construction).

Fiscal Impact
The fiscal impact of the Project is the benefit to the county and city via taxes generated,
essentially through new sales, lodging, food/beverage, and income taxes. The community and
Capital Improvement Board benefit from a variety of taxes collected, including new county
lodging, income, and food and beverage taxes. In addition, due to the professional sports district,
the CIB can capture onsite state sales tax (7.0 percent) and onsite income tax (3.4 percent).
The following table shows the projections of the various taxes.

Governance Options
One of the most important decisions for a public entity that is considering an event center/arena
project is the structure of ownership and management of the facilities after completion. The
manner in which a municipality structures the ownership of the development and the type of

Fort Wayne Downtown Arena Analysis

Executive Summary – Page 30

management of the facilities are central to the success of the project. The community will need to
establish the best ownership and management structure under which the proposed arena would
operate to best suit the needs of the community and to foster the success of the project, not to
mention the neighboring and potentially connected Grand Wayne Center.
The following table shows the nature of facility management.

The most common facility management structures, when considering independent and private
management as non-governmental, would be 35 percent for this category, followed by
government at 32 percent, although it is higher for smaller venues. As the seating capacity
increases, management tends to shift away from government, primarily due to the fact that the
largest arenas are for NBA and NHL tenants and these teams prefer to manage the facilities and
capture all revenue.
Given the existing positive experience the community has had with the CIB and Grand Wayne
Center, this authority-directed manager model appears to have merit in Fort Wayne. However, at
the county level, the successful Coliseum has been run by an independently hired manager who
reports directly to County government. Both structures allow for some lack of transparency, as
the information released to the public is somewhat up to the discretion of the parties. However, in
order to optimally manage facilities, true transparency is key and the initial structure would set
such a model in place. Any new structure should ensure that the performance of the facility is
made public, including all operating revenues and expenses as well as number of events and
attendance. By keeping performance transparent, the public and others can keep pressure on the
manager to continually improve performance for the benefit of the community.
HSP generally prefers models where management does not directly report to the government
entity, but instead reports to a dedicated independent entity, such as a board. However, that
board’s activity and information should be transparent to the community. This guarantees
independence yet also responsibility to own up to the truth about performance.
