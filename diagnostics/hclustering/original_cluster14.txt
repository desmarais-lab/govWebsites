1.0 Authority. Pursuant to authority granted under ‚ÄúOrdinance of the City of Evansville,
Indiana Concerning Trees‚Äù Creating a Tree Advisory Board, and approved by the
Common Council of the City of Evansville, Indiana, on the 1st day of May, 2001,
having had the advice and assistance of the Tree Advisory Board, established in
said Ordinance, hereby promulgates the following as the Arboricultural
Specifications and Standards of Practice for the City of Evansville, Indiana,
hereinafter called the Arboricultural Specifications Manual.
2.0 Policy
2.1 All work on public trees shall comply with the ‚ÄúOrdinance of the City of Evansville,
Indiana Concerning Trees‚Äù of the City of Evansville, Indiana, and this
Arboricultural Specifications Manual.
2.2 The Arboricultural Specifications Manual shall be adhered to at all times, but it may
be amended at any time that experience, new research, or laws indicate that
improved methods or circumstances make it advisable, and only then with the
advice and assistance of the Tree Advisory Board, all as provided for in the
above said Ordinance.
2.3 The Arboricultural Specifications Manual, the standard for work performed on or with
trees on a daily basis, shall be updated by the Tree Advisory Board as needed.
The Tree Advisory Board shall have the authority to modify, amend, or extend
the Arboricultural Specifications Manual at any time that experience indicates
improved methods or whenever circumstances make it advisable.
2.4 The policy of the Tree Advisory Board shall be to cooperate at all times with the
public, property owners, other municipal departments, public utilities and with
appropriate not-for-profit organizations.
2.5 The Evansville City Arborist, in consultation with the Tree Advisory Board, shall
have the jurisdiction, authority, control, supervision, and direction over all trees

4

Last Revised 2/4/10

planted or growing in or upon public property, and the planting, removal, care,
maintenance, and protection thereof.
3.0 General Specifications
3.1 The Arboricultural Specifications contained in this document are to serve as a
standard for all work performed on or with all public trees and development
projects that include tree plantings as required by the Evansville Area Planning
Commission. These standards will apply whether the work is performed ‚Äúinhouse‚Äù, contractually by private businesses, or by private individuals.
3.2 All terms used in this manual, which are defined in the ‚ÄúOrdinance of the City of
Evansville, Indiana Concerning Trees‚Äù, shall hold the same definition in this
manual.
3.3 A permit shall be obtained from the Tree Advisory Board, through the City Arborist‚Äôs
office, before any person, either for himself or another, prunes, removes, or
destroys any public tree.
3.4 All requests for bid specifications for landscaping should be reviewed by the City
Arborist and/or other qualified members of the Tree Advisory Board before they
are sent out to potential bidders. This will allow trained arborists and
horticulturists a chance to see whether items in the bid need to be altered for
long-term plant survival.
3.5 A site meeting shall be conducted between the contractor, the City Arborist, and a
representative from the public department responsible for the project before any
landscape work is to be performed. During such meeting the City Arborist shall
inform the contractor how all work shall be performed including, but not limited to,
proper planting techniques, proper irrigation techniques, proper mulching
techniques, and proper maintenance techniques. The City Arborist shall also
make clear to the contractor their responsibilities outlined in the contract for the
landscaping, and the contractor‚Äôs guarantee/warranty period for all vegetation
planted and/or maintained by them.
3.6 Oversight for contract administration of landscaping shall be performed by city
arborist. The City Arborist shall monitor, and regulate work done by the
landscape contractor(s) throughout the contract period. All non-compliance
issues of the contract by the contractor shall be reported to the public department
responsible for the project, and to the Tree Advisory Board. Follow up work and
routine maintenance work needed after the contract has been fulfilled shall be
determined by the City Arborist, and reported to the appropriate department.
3.7 It shall be unlawful for any person to engage in the business of cutting, trimming,
pruning, or removing any tree within the City of Evansville, for hire, without first
procuring a license as required by the ‚ÄúOrdinance of the City of Evansville,
Indiana Concerning Trees‚Äù codes 2.90.010 through 2.90.150.

Last Revised 2/4/10

3.8 Authorized work on or with public trees neither expresses nor implies a right to
violate any local, state, or federal law while in the process of performing such
work.
3.9 All such work shall be conducted in a manner as to cause the least possible
interference with, or annoyance, to others.
3.10 All personnel utilized for work on or with trees shall be trained to perform the work
properly and safely in accordance with these Arboricultural Specifications, and
ANSI standards.
3.11 Only a licensed tree pruner shall perform work on trees, except during
emergencies. An emergency shall be an instance when a public tree(s) has
been severely damaged by storms or other causes or is obstructing utility wires,
etc.
The Board of Public Works or public utilities may without permit resort to topping
or severe cutting back of limbs of public trees, but should report all such actions
to the Tree Advisory Board.
3.12 A licensed tree pruner is recommended, but shall not be required, for trees being
pruned or removed as part of a new development on public property, so long as
the project has been approved by Area Planning Commission. Tree preservation
and any tree pruning work that is required, shall be done in accordance with the
standards set forth in this manual.
3.13 Any use of tools and equipment for pruning, trimming, repairing, maintaining and
removing trees shall be in accordance with ANSI standards.
3.14 Approved street and sidewalk warning devices shall be in position as required at all
times while work on public trees is being performed. Adequate barricades and
other warning devices shall be placed and flagmen shall be stationed as
necessary for the safety of pedestrians and vehicles. All closures of public
rights-of-way shall be approved by the Evansville Safety Board.
3.15 Whenever overhead utility lines, gas lines, water lines, sewer lines, or other
improvements upon a public area are jeopardized by any authorized tree pruning
or removal activities, the proper authorities of the utilities involved shall be
consulted prior to performing any work activity and all requested precautions by
any such authority shall be followed. Those performing work shall be responsible
for having utilities located prior to planting, stump grinding, or any other type of
digging.
3.16 Companies that violate or ignore bid agreements during the installation or
maintenance of landscape plantings, or refuse to honor warranties, shall be

6

Last Revised 2/4/10

deemed a non-responsible bidder, and shall be denied an award on a bid for
landscaping for a period of no less than three years from the date of the violation.
3.17 All contracted landscape plantings shall have a minimum of two, or preferred three
year warranty. Bids should be worded such that landscape maintenance for a
minimum of two years, or for a preferred three year period, be performed by the
landscape installation company. Whoever plants landscaping on site shall be
responsible for their health. This will promote more conscientious planting
practices, and avoid the need to determine blame for tree failure.
3.18 All companies bidding on planting/maintenance must develop a complete postplanting maintenance program. This will include, but not be limited to: irrigation,
fertilization, pruning/training, and pest control. Pest control refers to controlling
insects, diseases, weeds, and other harmful agents.
4.0 Planting
4.1 Acceptable Tree Species. The Appendices contain lists of tree species or their
varieties and cultivars acceptable and approved for planting on public property.
No species other than those included in this list may be planted on public
property without written permission of the Tree Advisory Board.
4.2 Size. Unless otherwise specified by the Tree Advisory Board, all species and their
cultivars or varieties shall conform to ANSI standards.
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢

Medium and Large trees (listed in Tables II and III) ‚Äì 2¬Ω‚Äù caliper;
Small trees (listed in Table I) ‚Äì 1¬Ω‚Äù caliper;
Medium and large evergreen trees and multi-stem trees ‚Äì 12‚Äô height
Small evergreen trees and multi-trunk trees ‚Äì 10‚Äô height
Shrubs ‚Äì 5-gallon containers or equivalent balled and burlapped.

4.3 Grade. Unless otherwise allowed for specific reasons, all trees shall have
comparatively straight trunks (except for those that are multi-trunk), well
developed leaders and tops, and the roots shall not only be characteristic of the
species, cultivar or variety, but also shall exhibit evidence of proper nursery
pruning practices. They shall have acceptable balance between top and root. At
the time of planting, all trees must be free of mechanical injuries, and other
objectionable features that tend to affect the future form and health of the plant.
4.4 Location and Spacing.
4.4.1 Pavement and tree spacing for street trees and trees in public areas.
The distance that trees may be planted from curbs, curb lines and sidewalks may
be no closer than the following: Small trees, two (2) feet; Medium and Large
trees, three (3) feet.

7

Last Revised 2/4/10

4.4.2 Pavement and tree spacing for trees in parking lots. The distance that
trees may be planted from curbs, curb lines and sidewalks may be no closer than
the following: Small trees, three (3) feet; Medium trees, four (4) feet; and Large
trees, five (5) feet.
4.4.3 Driveways, Alleys and Intersections. Trees shall be planted at least
fifteen (15) feet from driveways and alleys. No street trees shall be planted at an
intersection corner within 25 feet of the curved intersection.
4.4.4 Utilities. No tree, other than those listed as small trees in the appendices
of this manual, may be planted within twenty (25) feet of any overhead utility
wire. Minimal planting distances from overhead utility wires should be based
upon mature tree height and spread. Species shall be selected for planting
under utility wires so that the maximum height of the trees at maturity will not be
the same or more as the height of the lowest electrical transmission wire. Trees
that have canopy heights exceeding the height of transmission wires shall be
spaced from utility poles at least a minimum of one-half (1/2) of their total mature
canopy spread plus ten (10) feet.
4.4.5 Other Utilities. Shade trees shall not be planted closer than fifteen (15)
feet from all lampposts and should allow for proper lighting. Trees planted near
light posts shall be monitored, and pruned as needed, to prevent obstruction of
light.
4.4.6 Spacing Between Trees. As a general recommendation, trees and shrubs
should be spaced so that they are separated by a minimum of one-third (1/3) of
their total mature canopy spread.
4.4.7 Miscellaneous. All planting on unpaved streets without curbs or sidewalks
must have the approval of the Tree Advisory Board, who shall determine the
location of the tree, so that it will not be injured or destroyed when the street is
curbed and paved, or when sidewalks are constructed. No street tree shall be
planted within ten (10) feet of any fire hydrant or stop sign. Where overhead
lines or building setback presents a special problem, the selection of planting site
and species shall be determined by the Tree Advisory Board.
4.5 Tree Transport and Storage. Trees shall be transported fully covered by tarp(s) to
prevent them from drying out and getting wind burn. During transport and
storage roots and root balls shall be routinely inspected and watered as
necessary to prevent from drying out. If proper moisture content of roots and
root balls cannot be maintained on site, they shall be healed in properly until they
are planted.
4.6 Tree Inspection. Trees shall be inspected for proper root to shoot ratio before
being accepted according to ANSI Z60.1-2004, and shall be replaced with
acceptable root stock when rejected. Trees shall also be rejected if they have

8

Last Revised 2/4/10

defects or have poor structure for that species. Balled and burlapped trees shall
have burlap removed from top of root ball to inspect root collar depth to
determine if the tree is acceptable.
4.7 Tree Planting Method.
4.7.1 Planting Depth and Width. The hole for tree planting shall be dug to the
depth of the measurement of the tree being planted from the root flare to the
bottom of the root ball. Care shall be taken to not confuse the tree graft, if one is
present, with the root flare (see figure 1). The root flare of trees that are
containerized or balled and burlapped shall be exposed to determine this
measurement before digging. Pits for the planting of trees shall be at least three
times wider than the diameter of the roots or root ball. The edges of planting pits
shall be scarified to prevent glazing of soil after digging.

Figure 1. Root Graft Vs. Root Collar (Flare)
4.7.2 Removal of Foreign Objects. Brick, rock, foreign roots, and other debris
that is not considered soil shall be removed from planting pits. Burlap, ropes,
and wires shall be either entirely removed from balled and burlapped trees, or cut
back at least 1/3rd down the sides of the root ball before backfill is used. Soil
may also be completely removed from balled and burlapped trees so long as
roots are not damaged. Containers shall be completely removed from trees
before planting containerized trees, and containerized tree roots shall be pruned
and spread apart as necessary to improve future root growth and prevent root
girdling. Roots of the trees shall be kept damp during these processes to prevent
drying out.
4.7.3 Tree Placement. The tree shall be centered in the planting hole with the
tree completely upright and with the root collar between zero to one inches above
ground level, and absolutely no lower than ground level. If the root collar is not at
ground level, soil shall be added or removed from the bottom of the pit until the

9

Last Revised 2/4/10

proper height is achieved. If soil is placed into pit to adjust root collar depth it
shall be tamped down before backfilling.
4.7.4 Amendments. Only the original soil removed shall be used as backfill, and
no soil amendments shall be used, unless the entire site is being amended with
the same amendment material and at the same percentage of amendment
uniformly.
4.7.5 Backfilling and Watering. As soil is placed into hole, clumps of soil shall
be broken up to a maximum size of ¬Ω inch size clumps. Water shall be used
during backfilling intermittently to improve soil settling. When the planting is
completed, the entire root area shall be thoroughly saturated with water. Care
shall be taken to prevent the tree from becoming off center during this process.
4.7.6 Staking. Tree trunks shall be guyed, or supported in an upright position,
according to accepted arboricultural practices. The guys or supports shall be
installed so that they will neither girdle or cause serious injury to the tree nor
endanger public safety. Tree stakes, guy wires, and supports for trees shall be
removed the spring following the first full growing season.
4.7.7 Trunk Protection.Tree trunk protectors, if used, shall consist of wire mesh
screen, which shall be placed around trunk loosly in a way that it can be slid up
and down the trunk, unimpeded, and shall not be tied to the trunk, but shall be
attached to itself in the manner of a loose tube around the tree (see figure 2).
Trunk protection shall be removed the spring after the first full growing season.

Figure 2: Trunk Protection.
4.7.8 Tree Grates and Mulch. Organic mulch shall be immediately placed
around trees after planting for a minimum distance of three feet, or to the edge of
pavement, whichever comes first. The mulch layer shall be applied at a minimum
height of two inches, to a maximum height of four inches. Excessive mulch will
not be piled against the tree trunk (mulch volcano), and all mulch shall be pulled
away from the trunk one inch (1‚Äù). Acceptable mulch materials include wood

10

Last Revised 2/4/10

chips, shredded bark, bark nuggets, and similar products. No other mulch
material may be substituted without authorization from the Tree Advisory Board.
Grates shall not be used around trees.

Mulch shall be
pulled one inch
from trunk of the
tree

The root collar/flare shall be
0 to 1 inches above ground
level and not planted under
ground level

Hole should be dug 3 times
the width of the root ball

Mulch shall be 2 to 4 inches thick, in a flat ring around the tree
Use no
amendments or
fertilizers in fill

Cut wires,
rope and
burlap more
rd
than 1/3
down from top
of root ball

Figure 3: Proper tree planting.
5.0 Newly Planted Tree Care.
5.1 General. Newly planted trees (trees planted within 3 years), shrubs and other
plants shall require special maintenance for two or three growing seasons
following planting. All maintenance practices shall follow approved arboricultural
standards.
5.2 Watering. Trees shall be watered when one inch of rain water has not fallen within
7 days, or within 7 days of last watering. Proper watering of trees shall consist of
the equivalent of one inch of rain (1/2 gallon per square foot of soil) for the root
zone per tree per week. Gator Bags can be used, but must be completely filled
once per week for proper watering. Programmable or manual irrigation systems
may also be used, but shall be programmed or run only once per week after lawn
is established. To prevent overwatering of trees, irrigation that is required to run
more than once per week for other vegetation shall be set separately from the
irrigation that is installed for watering trees.
5.3 Fertilization. Fertilization of trees should not be needed for trees unless a nutrient
deficiency has been observed and shall only occur after approved by the Tree

11

Last Revised 2/4/10

Advisory Board. Fertilization of public trees shall follow ANSI standards or other
accepted arboricultural standards. Fertilization, if deemed necessary, shall be
done according to soil nutrient deficiencies, and current lawn and landscaping
fertilization shall be calculated, before fertilization mixes and a rates are
calculated. Only broadcast fertilization of wet or dry fertilizers over root system of
tree shall be accepted unless otherwise approved by the Tree Advisory Board.
5.4 Insect and Disease Control. Tree species that are resistant to insects and
diseases should be selected for plantings. Frequent and thorough inspections
shall be made to determine when measures for the control of insects and
diseases shall be taken. Before chemicals are used to resolve pest and disease
issues, the specific tree species and pest shall be properly identified to ensure
proper control method and alternative controls should be considered in the place
of chemicals. If fungicides, herbicides or pesticides are required to be applied for
controlling disease, pests or weeds, they must be applied by an Indiana Licensed
Pesticide Applicator, or by an employee working under direct supervision of a
licensed applicator who is within direct contact of the employer, as per the
regulations set forth by the Office of the Indiana State Chemist.
5.5 Pruning. Pruning newly planted trees shall consist of removing dead, broken, or
injured branches, water sprouts, and the suppression of uneven growth that
affects form. Pruning shall be practiced as often thereafter as needed to assure
strong branch unions. Newly planted trees need not have lower branches
removed until they are well established, or unless the branches visually or
physically obstruct paved right-of-ways and signs. Pruning of public trees shall
follow ANSI standards or other accepted arboricultural standards.
6.0 Established Tree Care.
6.1 Pruning and Removal. No topping of trees shall be permitted. All large,
established trees shall be pruned to a height of at least eight (8) feet above
sidewalks and twelve (12) feet above streets. All cuts shall be made with a saw
or pruner and only at the nodes or crotches. No stubs shall be left. No spurs or
climbing irons shall be used to climb trees, except when trees are to be removed
or during an emergency rescue. All dead branches shall be removed; branches
that cross or rub should be pruned to eliminate future problems. The stumps of
all removed trees shall be cut to at least six (6) inches below the ground level
where feasible. Stump grindings shall be hauled off, and the soil cavity shall be
filled with top soil, tamped, leveled and re-seeded. Pruning of public trees shall
follow ANSI standards or other accepted arboricultural standards.
6.2 Insect and Disease Control. Before chemicals are used to resolve pest and
disease issues, the specific tree species and pest shall be properly identified to
ensure proper control method and alternative controls should be considered in
the place of chemicals. If fungicides, herbicides or pesticides are required to be
applied for controlling disease, pests or weeds, they must be applied by an

12

Last Revised 2/4/10

Indiana Licensed Pesticide Applicator, or by an employee working under direct
supervision of a licensed applicator who is within direct contact of the employer,
as per the regulations set forth by the Office of the Indiana State Chemist.

6.3 Fertilization. Fertilization of trees should not be needed unless a nutrient
deficiency has been observed and shall only occur after approved by the Tree
Advisory Board. Fertilization of public trees shall follow ANSI standards or other
accepted arboricultural standards. Fertilization, if deemed necessary, shall be
done according to soil nutrient deficiencies, and current lawn and landscaping
fertilization shall be calculated, before fertilization mixes and a rates are
calculated. Only broadcast fertilization of wet or dry fertilizers over root system of
tree shall be accepted unless otherwise approved by the Tree Advisory Board.
6.4 Cabling and Bracing. As a general rule, cables should be located above the
crotch at a point approximately two-thirds (2/3) of the distance between the
crotch and tops of the branch ends. Rust-resistant cables, thimbles, and lags
should be used. The ends of a cable should be attached to hooks or eyes of lags
or bolts inserted near the ends of the branches; thimbles must be used in the eye
splice in each end of the cable. In no instance shall cable be wrapped around a
branch. All cabling and bracing practices shall follow ANSI standards or other
accepted arboricultural standards. Cabling and bracing shall only be performed
by a Certified Arborist.
7.0 Tree Protection.
7.1 Protection or Removal. In the circumstances where construction and utility
operations underground will affect the health of a tree, a determination will be
made considering the overall value of the tree. The criteria for determining a
value for a tree will be based on species, size, condition, location, cost of
preserving the tree, and urgency of work to be completed. A decision based on
this value will be made concerning the protection or removal of the tree in
question. This decision shall be made jointly by the Tree Advisory Board and the
City Engineer or appropriate city official.
7.2 Construction Zone. Existing trees in or near areas to be developed (construction
sites) shall be guarded with temporary fencing. Placement of the fence is to be
at a minimum distance of one and a half feet (1.5‚Äô) for each inch in trunk
diameter measured at breast height (4¬Ω feet). All vehicles, construction
equipment, building materials, dirt, or other debris shall be kept outside of the
barrier.
7.3 Root Pruning. When large roots are to be cut during trenching or grading, pruning
of roots must be done with the proper pruning equipment. Clean, flush, smooth
cuts shall be made on tree roots.

13

Last Revised 2/4/10

7.4 Underground Utilities. All installations of underground utilities upon public
property, which may conflict with tree roots, are subject to the review and the
approval of the Tree Advisory Board before the project starts. All installations
through tree drip-line areas should follow approved tunneling methods.

Driver pleads guilty in crash that killed 13-year-old Hadleigh Cave
Christopher Stimac pleads guilty to hit-and-run felony charge
(Indianapolis, Ind.) Marion County Prosecutor Terry Curry announced today that
Christopher Stimac has pleaded guilty to a felony charge for fleeing the scene of a fatal car
crash on March 4, 2011. Stimac pleaded guilty to Failure To Stop After an Accident
Resulting in Death (Class C Felony) for the crash that killed 13-year-old Hadleigh Cave.
The 2011 crash occurred on the 5100 block of South Franklin Road when Cave was struck
by Stimac‚Äôs vehicle while walking with friends. Cave died as a result of injuries sustained in
the crash.
The investigation that followed revealed the make and model of the vehicle involved in the
crash. In June 2015, the IMPD Hit and Run Unit was contacted by Stimac‚Äôs estranged wife.
The information she provided allowed detectives to gather the evidence necessary to arrest
and charge Stimac for leaving the scene of the fatal crash.
Pursuant to the plea agreement, Stimac faces a potential sentence of two to eight years for
the Class C Felony conviction. A sentencing hearing is scheduled for July 20, 2016, at 1:00
p.m. in Criminal Court 5.
A charge of a crime is merely an accusation, and the defendant is presumed innocent until
and unless proven guilty.

   2. CITY COUNCILMAN DR. JOHN CRAWFORD DISCUSSES PLAN TO INVEST IN RIVERFRONT
      DEVELOPMENT AND NEIGHBORHOOD SIDEWALKS AND ALLEYS



****** CITY_COUNCILMAN_DR._JOHN_CRAWFORD_DISCUSSES_PLAN_TO_INVEST_IN_RIVERFRONT
DEVELOPMENT_AND_NEIGHBORHOOD_SIDEWALKS_AND_ALLEYS ******


April 28, 2017 - City Councilman Dr. John Crawford today discussed his proposal
to invest in riverfront development and neighborhood sidewalks and alleys.

Councilman Crawford was joined by fellow Council members Tom Didier, Tom
Freistroffer, Glynn Hines, Mayor Tom Henry, members of the Mayor&rsquo;s
Administration and officials from Fort Wayne Community Schools at today&rsquo;s
news conference.
Riverfront development highlights:
Riverbank stabilization - $4 million
Riverfront phase II - $25 million
Riverfront phase III - $50 million
Expand development west of phase I
Expand the public amenities
Increase flood capacity of public space
Create private development sites near the river

Neighborhood sidewalks and alleys highlights:
Investment of $40 million over the next 10-15 years
Build 40 miles of new sidewalks for connectivity from neighborhoods to schools
Repairs on existing sidewalks &ndash; up to 200 additional projects with
property owners
Invest in and increase life span of alleys &ndash; historically a low priority

An adjustment in the local income tax could generate the necessary money, $9.6
million per year for the City of Fort Wayne, to invest in the riverfront and
neighborhood sidewalks and alleys. These revenues would help advance phases two
and three of riverfront development, add new sidewalks throughout Fort Wayne
and address areas of Fort Wayne Community Schools and East Allen County Schools
that lack sidewalks for children. The plan would also allow for expanding the
maintenance program for existing sidewalks and repairs to alleys throughout the
City.

The average household with an income of $49,000 would see an increase of $6 per
month or $73 per year if the local income tax is adjusted by .15 percent. Fort
Wayne/Allen County has and would continue to have the lowest income tax rate of
almost all surrounding counties. Individuals on fixed incomes would not have
their Social Security income taxed under this proposal.

&ldquo;Enthusiasm to proceed with the full scope of riverfront development is
high among the great majority of citizens. Having a vibrant and thriving
riverfront destination is will allow the City of Fort Wayne to attract and
retain high-paying jobs and top talent which will ensure that our economy
continues to grow far into the future, &ldquo; stated Dr. John Crawford.
&ldquo;Having a strong neighborhood core for citizens to reside is imperative
to the health of Fort Wayne. Improving our infrastructure in making sure that
there are sidewalks for every child to walk to school on and that our
neighborhoods are connected is paramount to the overall health of the
community. I am thankful for the strong leadership of these members of the Fort
Wayne City Council who are standing with me today and Mayor Henry, who are all
committed to moving our city forward.&rdquo;

&ldquo;The City of Fort Wayne is experiencing momentum and investments like
never before. Our downtown is thriving, neighborhoods are growing and
we&rsquo;re seeing a positive business climate with job growth and expansion
projects,&rdquo; said Mayor Henry. &ldquo;In order to continue to see
successes, though, we can&rsquo;t stop now. We must remain committed to moving
forward in the right direction to make Fort Wayne and northeast Indiana a point
of destination. I applaud Councilman Crawford for his leadership on this issue.
Through strong fiscal management and bipartisan efforts, this proposal is a
collective effort and an example of our commitment to providing opportunities
and making a meaningful difference.&rdquo;

High-wage jobs, new businesses, the retention of current businesses, population
growth and attracting young professionals make it vital to continue to invest
in Fort Wayne and provide quality of life amenities that make our community and
region attractive. One of the ways to see continued momentum is by supporting
community initiatives that make Fort Wayne viable and sustainable now and in
the future.

The proposal is scheduled to be introduced to City Council in June with a final
vote anticipated in July. The process will include public hearings as part of
City Council&rsquo;s discussion to invest in the riverfront and neighborhood
infrastructure. Public meetings will also be conducted to provide residents,
neighborhoods and businesses an opportunity to learn more about the proposal. A
complete schedule will be released in the coming weeks.

4. That residential areas provide healthful surroundings for family life; and
5. That the growth of the community is commensurate with and promotive of the efficient and economical
use of public funds" (I.C. 36-7-4-201).
Indiana Code further states that these units of government may establish planning and zoning entities to
fulfill this purpose (I.C. 36-7-4-202).
With the above state enabling legislation as its basis, land use planning has been ongoing for well over
a half century in many of Indiana‚Äôs local governments. The first consolidated city/county plan commission to
be established here was in 1955. Today, the Evansville-Vanderburgh County Area Plan Commission serves the
entire area of Vanderburgh County, containing 235.74 square miles (U.S. Census Bureau), with Evansville being
the only incorporated city and Darmstadt as the only incorporated town

FUNCTIONS OF AREA PLAN COMMISSION
AREA PLAN COMMISSION (APC)
The APC members are an appointed board that serves without compensation. Their
membership is composed of thirteen voting members, seven from the City and six from the County.
County Representatives
Member of the County Commissioners
Member of the County Council
County Surveyor
School District Representative
Two Citizen Members

City Representatives
Member of the Common Council
Member of Board of Public Works
Five Citizen Members

The Area Plan Commission meets on the second Thursday of each month at 4:00 P.M. in Room
301, City Council Chambers, in public hearing. The meeting is open to the public for citizen
comments on agenda items and consideration by the Commission. The Area Plan Commission keeps
minutes of its proceedings and official actions. These minutes and files are public record and are
kept in the Area Plan Commission office, Room 312 of the Civic Center Complex.
The following is a typical list of items heard by the Plan Commission:
ÔÇ∑ Requests for primary subdivision approval for plats and replats;
ÔÇ∑ Requests for city and county rezonings;
ÔÇ∑ Reports from staff; and
ÔÇ∑ Requests to amend the City and County Zoning and Subdivision Ordinances.
A set of criteria in State law and the Zoning Code must be considered by the APC in
determining appropriate actions on these items. One of those considerations is the Comprehensive
Plan, which serves as a guide for the Area Plan Commission and elected bodies on making all land
use decisions. Table 1 shows the data on the number of development proposals filed and the
actions taken by the APC in 2014. Except for the Rezonings and Special Uses categories, the number
of proposals requested in other categories was higher this past year than in 2013 and, in some cases,
2012 as well. The type of subdivisions filed were primarily minor as opposed to major subdivision plats.

BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS
The Board of Zoning Appeals (established in 1925 by the original zoning ordinance) is an
appointed board that serves without compensation. State enabling legislation provides for a system
of variance and appeal from the Zoning Ordinance requirements. The Board of Zoning Appeals
(BZA) is the local judicial entity that rules on these items.
The following is a typical list of items heard by the BZA:
ÔÇ∑ Requests for Variances from one or more of the Zoning Code requirements;
ÔÇ∑ Requests for Special Uses which by their nature cannot be classified in the usual
residential, commercial, or industrial zoning districts;
ÔÇ∑ Appeals by a petitioner of decisions made by administrative staff, administrative
board, or other bodies (except for the Plan Commission itself), in relation to
enforcement and/or interpretation of the Zoning Ordinance or issuance of
Improvement Location Permits.
Since the BZA acts as a judicial board, State Statue prohibits contact with any board member
concerning agenda items. Following a public hearing, the Board makes a determination of
approval, approval with conditions/limitations, denial, or modification based upon criteria found in
State law and in the Zoning Ordinance.
The BZA meets in open public hearings the third Thursday of each month at 4:00 P.M. in the
City Council Chambers, Room 301. The Board keeps minutes of official actions of its proceedings.
These minutes and files are public records and are kept in the Area Plan Commission office, Room
312 of the Civic Center Complex. See Table 1 for information relative to the number of variance and
special use requests heard by the Board of Zoning Appeals.

FINANCING
The Area Plan Commission is financed by annual appropriations from Vanderburgh County
and the City of Evansville. The total budget for 2014 was $ 786,385.00, 85% of which is funded by
Vanderburgh County and 15% by the City of Evansville. In 2014, the Area Plan Commission also
returned $296,904.98 to the County general fund in revenue it generated from filing and permit fees.
This figure is an 80 percent increase (over $130,000.00) in funds returned to the County above the
2013 total, due to the new fee schedule adopted by APC in early 2014. Information concerning the
2014 Budget and Disbursements is provided in Table 2. Table 3 displays the amount and type of fees
collected by Area Plan Commission for all revenue items such as rezoning and subdivision filing fees.

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN
The U.S. Supreme Court in their 1926 decision on Village of Euclid vs. Ambler Realty Company
(272 U.S. 365, 1926) determined that zoning was a valid use of the police power. Communities now
had a means of determining their own character. Courts began to perceive the need for a
comprehensive appraisal of all the land within the political jurisdiction and the consideration of
contiguous lands. This comprehensive appraisal was to determine appropriate land use and to
provide a firm basis for zoning decisions.
Because a community is a complex organization with many interrelated parts, the designation
of appropriate land use is an involved planning process. For this determination to effectively meet
future needs, local officials must have a good understanding of the interrelationships between the
diverse set of elements that make up the community such as types of soils, flooding potential,
vehicular circulation, availability of utilities, and many others. To meet this need, the Comprehensive
Plan was developed, which assimilates and organizes this information and designates appropriate
land uses, as a guide for the future.
Thus, the Comprehensive Plan is:
1. A comprehensive document addressing all functional components of development
within the City and County;
2. A set of action plans containing goals, objectives, and policies of the community
pertaining to orderly growth and development and quality of life;
3. A guide for the physical development of the community, including future land use;
4. A long range (20-year) planning document identifying what the community
aspires to become, suggesting actions to achieve these desires, and listing strategies
and techniques to avoid anticipated problems in the future; and A legal basis for the
local land development regulations in the community and is required by state law
(I.C. 36-7-4-601 and 701) to legally adopt zoning and subdivision ordinances.
The current Comprehensive Plan was adopted in 2004 after an extensive Plan review and
update. The Plan reflects input and assistance from numerous government agencies and private
individuals, from an appointed citizen Vision Committee, and from the general public in a series of
Comprehensive Plan meetings. The review and update of the Plan is part of an ongoing planning
process which involves the following primary functions of the Evansville and Vanderburgh County
Area Plan Commission:
7

1. Conducting an ongoing program of comprehensive and land use planning
accomplished through extensive research in areas such as demographics, education,
health, public safety, housing, public utilities, waste management, recreation,
transportation, and natural hazard mitigation.
2. Implementing the Comprehensive Plan by administering, updating and enforcing the
related ordinances (Zoning Ordinance, Subdivision Ordinance, Flood Hazard Ordinance
and Thoroughfare Regulations) and by coordinating related private, public, and
governmental actions.
3. Reviewing and providing an analysis of all land use proposals filed (e.g. rezonings and
subdivisions) for consideration by the Area Plan Commission, City Council, County
Commission, and Town of Darmstadt;
4. Advising local units of government on land use planning issues and providing
any requested information or special planning studies.

WORK ACCOMPLISHED IN 2014
COMPREHENSIVE PLAN
The current City/County Comprehensive Plan was adopted in 2004 by the Area Plan
Commission, Town Board of Darmstadt, City Council, and County Commissioners. Copies of the Plan
are available for review at the Area Plan Commission office, at several of the Public Library branches
and on the internet at the APC website: http://www.evansvilleapc.com. As part of the on-going
effort to implement the current Comprehensive Plan, in 2014, the APC continued to work on
accomplishing some of the recommended plan strategies or policies.
Work on an update of the current Comprehensive Plan began in 2010 providing another
opportunity for the public to look at the ‚Äúbig picture‚Äù and develop strategies to help shape the future
development of our community. Four public meetings were held early in the planning process to
obtain comments from City and County residents. Other local agencies that have responsibilities
related to land use and development have assisted staff by reviewing the draft Plan update, and
providing information and comments on the Plan, including the Department of Metropolitan
Development, the Evansville Metropolitan Planning Organization, the City and County Engineers, and
the Water and Sewer Department. Updating of the background data on which the Plan is based is
now essentially complete. New information incorporated into the draft Plan includes demographic
data from the 2010 Census, the 2010 land use inventory, more recent population projections, and
many other updates.
To improve the look of the Plan and to incorporate appropriate content from the regional
sustainability plan (officially titled ‚ÄúThe Millennial Plan for 2040‚Äù) which was adopted in April, 2014, the
APC staff worked with the County Commissioners to secure funding to hire the Lochmueller Group,
the local consultants who authored the Millennial Plan. Specifically, the LG will reformat the
Comprehensive Plan to have the same professional look as the Millennial Plan and will also redesign
graphics using a more modern graphics software. The contract with the LG was finalized at the end
of 2014. Hearings on the draft Plan update will be held, and the Plan will be completed and
adopted in 2015.

ZONING ORDINANCE
The City and County Zoning ordinances govern land use in Evansville and Vanderburgh
County. The ordinances define the districts into which the City and County are divided, the
restriction on the uses within the districts, and the site development standards (amount of green
space, parking, etc.) within the districts. Per State law, rezoning decisions are made at public
hearings of the Area Plan Commission (acting as a recommending body), City Council, County
Commissioners, and Town Board of Darmstadt (who make the final decisions and adopt the rezoning
ordinances).
In 2014, the Area Plan Commission staff continued to research, write staff field reports, and
provide verbal comments at the Area Plan Commission and Board of Zoning Appeals meetings on
each proposed rezoning, variance, appeal, and special use. Verbal comments are provided at the
hearings to update the members on any changes that occurred since the staff field report was
written, and to inform the general public attending the meeting. Staff has continued to make visual
11

presentations using multiple digital images of each site area including aerial photographs for all site
development proposals before the APC and BZA. Following public meetings, applicants are notified
of official actions and records of the meeting are prepared and kept on file for future reference.
Official Zoning Maps, the permanent record of zoning districts for Evansville and Vanderburgh
County, are located on the GIS website (www.evansvillegis.com) and are updated monthly. The
zoning maps, in conjunction with complete and accurate legal descriptions, are maintained and
updated by staff for reference by the public as the primary source of zoning information, and are the
basis for issuing Zoning Certificate letters.
The review of rezoning, variance, and special use petitions is a significant aspect of the Area
Plan Commission‚Äôs efforts to administer the Zoning Ordinance. Table 1 displays the number of these
petitions filed in 2014, and the action taken by the Area Plan Commission. This data shows that the
APC staff processed and coordinated the review of 33 rezoning petitions. Of these petitions, 36 were
approved by the City Council or County Commissioners (additional carried over from previous year).
The total number of variance and special use petitions filed for consideration by the Board of Zoning
Appeals were 85 and 35 respectively.
The APC Staff researched, drafted, and obtained approval for several Zoning Code
Amendments in 2014. The first two amendments were a follow-up to work done in 2013 on the
following topics:
1. The issuance of improvement location permits, elimination of the requirement that plans
for multi-family developments be reviewed by both the Subdivision Review and Site
Review Committees, and updating the list of the Commercial Site Review Committee
members identified in the Code. In conjunction with this code change, staff also
prepared a new application form for non-residential and multi-family residential permits.
The modifications to the application form were adopted by the APC, and they went
into effect in April, 2014. An updated fee schedule was adopted by APC and also
went into effect in April 2014 to set fees at levels more comparable to other Indiana
mid-sized cities and counties.
2. The elimination of the requirement for hard and sealed surface for mini-storage and a
few other low traffic generating uses in the County if they meet certain requirements,
such as a perimeter green buffer. This amendment was adopted by the County in
January, 2014.
3. Another amendment passed in 2014 addressed temporary signs. More specifically, new
standards were established for on-premise, temporary signs such as banners, sandwichboards and flag signs. The amendments eliminated certain temporary signs from the
requirement to obtain a sign permit and listed those types of temporary signs within
certain parameters as exempt from permit requirements. The APC staff worked with an
ad-hoc Temporary Sign Committee appointed by the Mayor and included other
interested parties to reach a consensus. This proposal was adopted by the City Council
in July, 2014, along with a minor follow-up clarification amendment adopted later in the
year. Staff will monitor whether the new ordinance is working as intended in the City. If

12

no problems arise over a reasonable period of time, a similar County version of these
sign code changes will be filed for adoption by the County Commission.
4.

The City Council initiated an ordinance change in 2014 to relax parking requirements
for entertainment uses in the Downtown, along West Franklin Street and North Main
commercial areas. Staff worked with the City Council to revise the amendment to only
apply to the Downtown due to the extensive parking infrastructure (public parking
garages and surface lots) that exist in that area, and to expand the parking waiver to
all commercial uses. The APC recommendations for the Franklin and North Main
corridors were influenced by property owners‚Äô comments in these areas who requested
to be removed from the amendment. These areas do not have the extensive parking
availability as in the Downtown. After discussion of these concerns with the City Council,
a consensus on a final version of this amendment was reached that allowed for the
elimination of parking requirements for all uses except for residential and child care
facilities in the C-3 Zoning District area of the downtown only. The ordinance change
was approved by the City Council in November, 2014.

Work on an additional Zoning Code amendment was initiated by staff in 2014 after the
suggestion for code amendments was made by a cellular provider who complained that the current
Code requirements were making it too difficult to find sites meeting the spacing requirements for new
cellular towers. Instead of just looking at changing the spacing requirements, staff undertook an
extensive look at Codes from other communities and determined that a more comprehensive
approach was needed to update the entire portion of the Code addressing wireless communication
facilities. A draft of this new section of the City and County Zoning Codes was completed in 2014.
The first draft of this ordinance change was recently reviewed by representatives of the interested
private cellular company and revisions are currently being made. Once work on the revisions is
complete, the second draft will be distributed to all interested parties and be discussed at an APC
meeting. It is anticipated that these amendments will be adopted in 2015.

ZONING ENFORCEMENT
The Evansville-Vanderburgh County area has three Zoning Enforcement/Investigator Officers
who, among other responsibilities, respond to complaints from the public, make site inspections and
take other enforcement actions. Enforcement personnel are responsible for investigating all
complaints of Zoning Code violations, contacting property owners when complaints are verified by
inspection, maintaining thorough and confidential case files, and working with individuals in violation
of the Zoning Code to effect prompt compliance. If all other methods are unsuccessful including
issuing fines, court action is initiated to ensure compliance. In 2014, there were approximately 800
complaint site inspections and, when warranted, these inspections were followed by issuance of
almost 600 Zoning Code violation letters.
In addition, the APC staff ensures that all proposals for new development also comply with the
ordinance. In 2014, staff continued inspecting new or expanded multi-family, commercial and
industrial development sites prior to the issuance of Certificates of Occupancy by the Building
Commission to ensure that the construction is consistent with the approved site plans. When
significant discrepancies are found that do not comply with Zoning Code requirements, the
developers are notified to make the necessary corrections. Certificates of Occupancy are not issued
13

until an inspection by APC staff reveals that the construction is in conformance with the approved
site plan.

SITE REVIEW PROCESS
The Site Review Committee is another of the ongoing review boards of the Area Plan
Commission. This Committee meets weekly to review plans for all new commercial development,
industrial development, all other non-residential uses, and apartment complexes, prior to issuance of
improvement location permits. During this meeting, plans are reviewed for conformance with
applicable codes, and the applicant is notified if additional information is needed. If a site plan is
denied, the Area Plan Commission staff notifies the applicant in writing.
The APC staff chairs the Site Review Committee meetings, serves as primary intake for commercial
and industrial permit applications, and is responsible for monitoring the permit through the review
process. Application forms and plans are received and reviewed, computer entries are made, and
plans are dispersed prior to the weekly Site Review Committee meeting to the following offices:
Building Commission
County Engineer
County Surveyor
City Engineer
Fire Department
Water and Sewer Utility
Other requested City & County agencies
Table 3 shows that in 2014, applicants paid APC fees to file 241 site development plans for review.
The total number of site plans reviewed was 245 which included plans of government entities that do
not pay fees. Of the total number of plans reviewed, 84 percent of these sites are located in the City
and 16 percent in the County.
Examples of the major projects reviewed are:
CITY PROJECTS:
ÔÇ∑ HCW Evansville (Double Tree Hotel), 601 Walnut Street, 10 Story ‚Äì 244 room hotel
ÔÇ∑ Old Evansville Brewery, corner of Fulton Ave. & W Indiana St., change of use/remodel
for offices.
ÔÇ∑ Delaware Trace Apartments, 4201 North Green River Road, 2nd phase with 5 buildings ‚Äì
80 apartment units
ÔÇ∑ Meijer Store, 2622 Menard‚Äôs Drive, 192,940 sq. ft. retail store with convenience store/gas
station
ÔÇ∑ Two Kins Investment, 1824 Pollack Avenue, 6 buildings ‚Äì 76 apartment units
ÔÇ∑ CVS Pharmacy, 609 North St. Joseph Avenue, 13,225 sq. ft. retail building
ÔÇ∑ Echo Community Health Care, 316 Chandler Avenue, 2 story - 5,785 sq. ft. building
ÔÇ∑ Brickyard Condominiums, 3615 Upper Mt. Vernon Road, 1 ‚Äì 6 unit building
COUNTY PROJECTS:
ÔÇ∑ Schnuck‚Äôs Market, 12920 Old State Road, 59,000 sq. ft. grocery & 14,000 sq. ft. retail
building
ÔÇ∑ Woodward Development, 15000 Foundation Drive, 100,000 sq. ft. spec warehouse
ÔÇ∑ Evansville Baseball/Softball Complex, 4300 Heckel Road, 8 baseball/softball fields
As part of an on-going effort to revamp the Site Review process, the staff unveiled the start-up of a
project tracking link on the APC website, where an applicant or a representative for a Site Review
project undergoing review can see a map of the projects currently under review, and click on their
14

location, which will then display information about the project including all the agency comments
and whether each agency has given their approval or if it is still pending. This will be helpful for the
applicants to be aware of their project‚Äôs status, the nature of any agency comments, and what
agency(ies) they might still need to contact to obtain approval and issuance of the Improvement
Location Permit from the APC. It will also give an opportunity to local contractors to see what
projects are being considered for approval in the City and County, and provide permit status
updates.

ISSUANCE OF PERMITS
The Area Plan Commission issues improvement location permits for residential, commercial,
and industrial uses before construction activity can begin. These permits are not only required for
new structures, but are also issued for additions, accessory buildings, changes of use, and signs. In
2014, the Plan Commission processed a total of 1,992 applications for improvement location permits.
The trends section of this report below provides more information and analysis of these permits and
other 2014 development related data.

SUBDIVISION REVIEW PROCESS
As designated by State law, the Area Plan Commission has sole authority over the subdivision
process. Prior to filing a subdivision plat, the APC mandates that all applicants requesting plat
approval or subdivision waivers must meet with staff in a pre-application conference. Requests for
primary subdivision plat approval are reviewed initially by the Area Plan Commission staff to insure all
required information for submitting a plat is included, and then by the Subdivision Review Committee
for technical assessment. The Subdivision Review Committee meets the second Monday of each
month to review major subdivisions. The Committee reviews all applications for subdivision plat,
replat and plat vacation approval, and makes recommendations to the Area Plan Commission.
Proposed subdivision plats and agency comment forms are distributed by staff to the following
offices:
Building Commission
City Engineer
County Engineer
County Surveyor
Health Department
Evansville Water and Sewer Utility
Evansville Metropolitan Planning Organization
Determinations on primary plat and replat approvals for minor subdivisions have been
delegated by the APC to the Subdivision Review Committee. A change in procedure was initiated
about a year ago that allows minor subdivisions to be reviewed by the Subdivision Review
Committee each week after the Site Review meeting. This results in a much quicker review time and
shorter time-frame for getting agency comments on minors back to the applicant, instead of waiting
a month to be discussed by the Subdivision Review Committee. This procedure has been working
well as minor plats generally do not have significant technical issues or complications. In most cases,
minor plats that are approved by the Subdivision Review Committee are not heard at the APC public
meeting unless accompanied by a request for subdivision waiver.
Major subdivisions, those with three lots or more, must be heard at a public meeting of the
Area Plan Commission. The plats, the staff field reports on each proposal, any recommended
conditions of plat approval, and other relevant information are then presented at the public hearing

15

for a determination on primary plat approval. Following public meetings, applicants are notified of
official actions and records of the meeting are prepared and kept.
The Area Plan Commission has delegated the authority to grant secondary plat approval to
the Executive Director. Secondary approval has multiple requirements that have to be met prior to
recording the plat. One of these requirements involves submittal of a Letter of Credit ensuring that all
subdivision improvements are installed by the developer at no cost to the taxpayers. As of December
31, 2014, the Area Plan Commission held 79 letters of credit for subdivision improvements. The Area
Plan Commission monitors the construction status of all subdivision improvements in the City and
County. In the subdivisions with active letters of credit, the total value of all improvements amounts
to $17.9 million. Since some of these improvements have been completed, the Area Plan
Commission is currently holding nearly $3.1 million in letters of credit for the remaining improvements.
These amounts change as improvements are made, inspected, and accepted.
As part of the subdivision process, the Area Plan Commission staff approves subdivision and
street names to avoid duplication, and assigns addresses for new lots in the City and County.
Table 1 shows that there were 55 subdivisions filed in 2014. Of these plats, 6 major subdivisions
were granted primary plat approval by the Area Plan Commission and 35 minor subdivisions were
approved by the Subdivision Review Committee. The number of subdivisions filed last year was
somewhat higher than the number filed in 2013. Table 1 also shows that the APC approved 3
subdivision waivers in 2014, and 4 requests were filed to vacate all or a portion of an existing plat.
Staff also worked on a proposed amendment to the County Subdivision Code in 2014 that
addressed expiration of primary plat approval; updated other wording in the Code; removed
sidewalks from the letter of credit requirement for new subdivisions by making their installation
contingent upon the issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy for new structures, allowed for
modification of the sidewalk requirements to install alternative pathways within a subdivision instead
of or in addition to sidewalks if desired by the developer; required any waivers of the sidewalk Code
provisions to be approved by the Area Plan Commission and the Board of Public Works (in the City) or
recommended for approval by the APC and approved by the County Commissioners (in the
County); and required all subdivisions installing any sidewalk to submit a pedestrian plan showing the
proposed location of the sidewalk and handicapped ramps. This ordinance was approved by City
Council in December, 2014, and was approval by the County Commission in February, 2015.
Along with these Code changes, the Area Plan Commission approved a new letter of credit form for
the banks to follow when submitting a letter of credit. The new wording on the form eliminates the
need for the staff to track the expiration dates of letters of credit, as the new letters do not expire-they automatically renew. The new letter of credit changes also require a 10 percent contingency
be added on cost estimates instead of 5 percent, and require inflationary increases in the amount of
letters of credit if the subdivision improvements are not complete and accepted.

INFORMATION AND TECHNOLOGY
GIS WEB MAPPING AND APPLICATIONS
The Area Plan Commission continued to support IT/GIS operations in 2014 by maintaining
numerous GIS layers along with many other on-going activities. The following is a description of these
projects and activities over the past year.
Commercial Site Review Status: Launched In December, 2014, this web map application provides
the public and other interested parties access to searchable and interactive information related to
commercial development within the City of Evansville and Vanderburgh County. Committee
members of Commercial Site Review are able to update the current review status of a project and
have that information published to the web map in real time, increasing communication between
the reviewing agency and the project applicant.
Residential Growth 2007-2014 This web application consists of data compiled and geocoded from
several permit systems that were in use over the years. The result is a time based map illustrating the
areas of residential development activity over time.
Application Summary 2014 All applications received in 2014 have been geocoded and can be
viewed by type (e.g. City Rezoning‚Äôs, Agricultural Building permits, On Premises Signs, etc.). The results
are summed to show area of activity and count summaries.
Economic Development Areas. A simple map viewer for the Evansville and Vanderburgh County TIF
Area boundaries as well as the Enterprise Zone.

DATABASE MANAGEMENT & RECORDS
APC continues to perform the weekly Property Master update/import for the Munis Permitting
Application. Property records that are entered into GIS are combined with property data from the
Assessor‚Äôs office to create the Property Master Table. This table is then imported into Munis, and
serves as the source data for the Munis permit application.
In 2014, staff combined the County Surveyor‚Äôs and Area Plans digital subdivision records into
one directory, thus creating a more efficient method of obtaining data through GIS and the creation
of the Subdivision Plat Index available at www.evansvilleapc.com
In addition, staff scan all new permit site plans, both commercial and residential. The plans are
then linked to the corresponding permit record in the Munis permit database.

AREA PLAN COMMISSION WEB SITE
In 2014, the APC converted its entire website over to the new City/County Vision Internet page
providing a more modern look and feel, while preserving the same level of information and its
availability. The Area Plan Commission domain and web address still remains:
www.evansvilleapc.com.
The Area Plan Commission web site includes all APC and BZA filing dates, meeting dates,
agendas and meeting minutes, staff field reports as well as instruction packets, forms, fees, the
Commercial Site Review agendas, and 2010 census data for the City and County. The entire
Comprehensive Plan and the City/County Zoning Codes are also available on our web address. All
this information will continue to be available in printed form in the Area Plan Commission office. In
addition to the Zoning Map, the website now offers a Maps and Apps directory for web mapping
applications. The APC also recently started an open data initiative, In addition to the regular
maintenance and web applications, providing GIS data to the public from a download page on
http://evansvillegov.org/index.aspx?page=3391

COMPUTER REFRESH CYCLE
Since information technology work depends heavily upon having the proper hardware, in
2014 we continued the process of changing out the old APC office computers with new ones having
GIS capability. In addition, with combined funds from other offices, we purchased a large-format
scanner/printer to replace our older, inoperable machine. These purchases will greatly improve our
ability to respond faster to customers and overall provide higher quality work.

COMMITTEE PARTICIPATION
The APC Executive Director and staff serve on the following committees beyond the
Subdivision and Site Review:
Downtown Design Review
Local Emergency Planning
Evansville MPO Technical
Pigeon Creek Greenway Advisory
Flood Advisory

18

NFIP / CRS
One of the ordinances that the APC helps to administer along with the Building Commission is
the Floodplain Management Ordinance. This ordinance was rewritten and adopted in 2011 based
on State Statue and is a requirement for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program. As
part of its duties in regard to floodplain management, the APC chairs the Flood Advisory Board which
considers any requests for variances to this ordinance. There were no floodplain variance requests
filed in 2014.
Through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), as of November, 2014, City and County
residents had 1,216 insurance policies totaling $281.15 million in coverage for potential flood damage
to their homes or businesses. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and Indiana
Department of Natural Resources administer the NFIP and ensure that local governments meet the
minimum requirements. To reduce the amount of the premiums paid for this flood insurance by City
and County residents, the Area Plan Commission coordinates the City and County‚Äôs participation in
the Community Rating System (CRS) Program. This rating, as established by FEMA and the Insurance
Service Office (ISO), rewards communities with insurance premium discounts for a variety of local
flood protection efforts that go beyond minimum NFIP requirements.
The City and County have continued to meet the requirements for their current CRS rating as
a Class 8 community. This rating means that City and County residents have received and will
continue to receive 10 percent discounts for their NFIP policies issued or renewed since April 1, 1999.
As a condition of continued participation in the CRS program, we are required to recertify annually
that we continue to implement the credited activities. The APC staff coordinates and compiles the
City and County CRS recertification documentation to keep the 10 percent insurance discounts our
residents currently enjoy.

PIGEON CREEK GREENWAY PROJECT
The proposed Pigeon Creek Greenway project will entail construction of a 40-mile paved
bicycle and pedestrian trail throughout the City and County. Currently, almost 7 miles of the trail is
complete along Pigeon Creek and through the Downtown riverfront. It has become a popular
community amenity that improves the quality of life for our residents and visitors. The Area Plan
Commission staff contributed to the project in 2014 through its participation on the Greenway
Advisory Board and assistance to the Parks Department on Greenway related matters, particularly
mapping the existing and proposed trail route. The APC staff also continued to notify Greenway
officials of development proposals that could impact a planned greenway route; and participated
as part of the Steering Committee for the upcoming 2015 Bicycle/Pedestrian Master Plan.

CENSUS
The Area Plan Commission holds the designation as a State data center affiliate for the
Evansville Metropolitan Statistical Area, and is a depository for Census data. Some of the local
census data and information is available on the Area Plan Commission website, and also at the Area
Plan Commission office. This data can be obtained for various demographic levels, including the
MSA, County, City, township, census tract and census block geographic units. The APC staff
responded to numerous requests from businesses, non-profit organizations, government agencies,
and the general public for local and regional census data. The APC routinely disseminates this
19

information as a public service, as we the local agency that annually offers this assistance for the City
and County. The Census Bureau depends on the cooperation of local governments to provide data
support and technical assistance.

PROVIDING PLANNING I NFORMATION TO THE PUBLIC
A continual function of the Area Plan Commission is that of a clearinghouse for information
concerning land use, zoning, population estimates and projections, housing, growth and
development, and other planning issues that affect the area. Information requests are frequently
received from developers, realtors, public officials, and the general public.

PROFESSIONAL EDUCATI ON
To increase staff knowledge on information that will allow the Plan Commission to better serve
City/County residents, the APC staff received training on the Munis Permitting, Tyler Cashiering, and
KRONOS Timekeeping software and benefitted from online webinars. Several of the staff members
participate in continuing education programs on an ongoing basis to meet professional certification
requirements, such as the Indiana Chapter of the American Planning Association annual state
conference.

CURRENT DEVELOPMENT TRENDS
ANALYISIS OF APC DEVELOPMENT DATA
The trends for various types of development proposals reviewed by the Area Plan Commission
over the last 10 years are illustrated in Table 4. This data shows that the development activity level in
2014 was generally about the same as previous years. However, subdivision activity has been
rebounding since its recent low point in 2009. The 55 subdivisions filed in 2014 is the highest level of
subdivision activity over the last ten years, and represents a 20 percent increase from the 2013 total.
The rezoning activity and the number of special uses filed were down slightly from the 2013 totals.
These figures reflect general economic conditions that are continuing to improve.
The amount of land affected by the approved rezonings and the subdivision plats recorded in
2014 are shown in Tables 5 and 6. APC records for last year show that a total of 95.8 acres was
rezoned, most of which was in the Commercial zoning category. In looking at the total acreage
rezoned in both the City and the County, every zoning category recorded acreage decreases from
the 2013 totals. The commercial districts accounted for the largest decrease among all zoning
categories due to the significant drop in acreage rezoned in the County. Land zoned into the
Commercial and Industrial districts actually increased somewhat in the City. The majority of the
newly zoned land in 2014 was also in the City.
The subdivision information in Table 6 shows a total of 168 lots were recorded on 203 acres
within the 47 subdivisions recorded in 2014. The lot total in the recorded subdivisions and
parcelizations is a low for the 3-year reporting period shown in Table 6, due to the lower than normal
lot total in the County. Given that the number of subdivisions recorded in 2014 as shown on Table 4 is
not a low number, the 2014 subdivisions had a fewer number of lots per recorded plat. The majority
of the new subdivisions are located in the County and are residential in nature. The acreage and the
number of recorded lots result in an average lot size that increased from the previous year total of
0.87 acres per lot. The average lot size for 2014 was 1.21 acres per lot. The new subdivisions will
improve the availability and selection of lots in our community.
Table 7 shows data on the type and number of Improvement Location Permits issued by the
Plan Commission in 2014. The total number of permits issued by the Area Plan Commission during the
year was 1,992. This represents only a one percent increase in permits issued from 2013. Most of the
permit categories on Table 7 show an increase for 2014. The categories with the largest number of
permits issued last year were Signs (621) and Additions and Remodeling (444). The Additions and
Remodeling category recorded the biggest gain for 2014 and Signs showed the biggest loss over the
past year due to a Code change exempting most temporary signs from permit requirements. Permits
for Single Family homes in the City also showed an impressive 74 percent increase, while permits for
55 commercial/industrial buildings were issued last year, a 41 percent climb from the 2013 total. The
Single Family and Commercial Activity Map on Page 24 illustrates the locations of the residential and
commercial permits issued in 2014.
Table 8 shows that residential permit activity in 2014 increased by 7.7 percent from the previous
year total. However, the 435 housing units permitted in 2014 is still somewhat below the normal
21

amount of units permitted in a ‚Äúgood‚Äù year, which is typically 500 units in the City and the County
together. Of the total housing units permitted overall, 45 percent of the units were permitted for
locations in the City, while 55 percent were permitted for the unincorporated County.
When examining these residential permits by type of unit, Table 8 shows a total of 308 single
family and 128 multi-family units permitted. This split on housing type equates to about 70 percent of
the new units being single family. When considering the geographic area in housing type, 89
percent of the total units permitted in the unincorporated area of the County were single family,
while just over half of the units permitted in the City were multi-family. This data demonstrates that
the units constructed in the City are providing more of a variety in housing types than the new units in
the County, which tend to be more traditional, suburban single-family.
In looking just at geographic area, the unincorporated County had 240 units permitted and
the City had 196. While the total for the County has been stable over the last few years, the City total
has been increasing. As has been the case for the last several years, none of the township growth
totals are considered to be a high level of permit activity (over 150 units) considering our past growth
trends. The data for our fastest growing areas shows a surprising change this past year as Knight
Township in the City, (in the Moderate growth category), recorded the most growth (with 127 units
permitted). Unincorporated Center Township has traditionally been our fastest growing area, but it
didn‚Äôt have as strong of a year in 2014 as it has in the recent past (only 103 units permitted). It was
followed closely by Scott Township (with 91 units). The growth in Pigeon Township showed the biggest
decline from the 2013 totals due to no multi-family growth occurring in 2014, which is highly unusual.
The 2004-2025 Comprehensive Plan has three growth scenarios and projections for the amount
of new residential land that could be required by Year 2025, with the highest projection being 7.4
square miles. Although only about a third of a square mile was used for lots platted in 2014, the high
projection for future residential land still appears to be valid. With the national economic outlook
continuing to rebound from the recession, the local development data is showing steps in the right
direction, and considering proposed local projects such as the downtown Hotel, the Evansville
branch of the IU Med School and the Promenade (far east side of the City) on the near horizon, we
expect these factors to have positive impacts to help grow the economy of our region well into the
future. The trends indicated in this local data are that our overall growth rate will remain steady and
stable, that the northeast portion of the County will rebound as the fastest growth area for residential
development in the County, and that the trend to multi-family units will continue within the City. Due
to the rate that demolition of older housing is occurring (about 150 units per year), future trends are
also expected to reflect significant urban core redevelopment.

FOR RELEASE: Wednesday, February 22, 2017
CITY HONORS LOCAL AFRICAN-AMERICANS THROUGH BILLBOARD TRIBUTES
In honor of Black History Month, the City of South Bend has released a series
of billboards around the community intended to enrich residents‚Äô
understanding of local African Americans who have contributed to South Bend‚Äôs
history and culture. ‚ÄúAfrican American history is a deep part of South
Bend‚Äôs story, and the leadership of great African Americans in South Bend
deserves to be celebrated,‚Äù says Mayor Pete Buttigieg. ‚ÄúThe billboards
remind us of the importance of black history to our community.‚Äù The 15
African Americans leaders selected to be honored by the Black History Month
Committee are Cheryl Ashe, Robert Batteast, Al Carothers, Shalon Christine
Davis, Lonnie Douglas, James Harris, Linda Johnson, Dawn Jones, Kintae Lark,
Aaron Lowery, Bishop Eddie L. Miller, Melvin Reed, Hedy Robinson, Charles
Stafford and Cynthia Taylor. ‚ÄúWe strived to recognize residents that shaped
our city by making a significant difference here,‚Äù says Gladys Muhammad,
associate director of South Bend Heritage. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important to tell stories
of a diverse South Bend not only during Black History Month, but all year
round.‚Äù

COUNCIL UTILITY COMMITTEE EXAMINES TRANSFER DETAILS
Newly-appointed committee to meet again July 19
INDIANAPOLIS ‚Äì The City-County Council Utility Transfer Oversight Committee on Tuesday
received a detailed overview of the proposed definitive agreements to transfer the water and
wastewater systems to Citizens Energy Group. The overview and discussion was the first of two
hearings the committee will conduct to consider the Approving Ordinance and final agreements
proposed by Councillor Mike Speedy, District 24, on June 28.
This committee was created by the Council on May 17, when the Council voted 18 to 11 to
allow the City to move forward with final negotiations with Citizens. If approved by the
committee at their next meeting on July 19 at 5:30 p.m., the ordinance and the agreements will
be referred to the full Council for review and approval on July 26. The Utility Transfer Oversight
Committee is comprised of 11 Councillors, with six appointed by Council President Ryan Vaughn
and five appointed by Council Minority Leader Joanne Sanders.
‚ÄúI appreciate the diligent work of the Utility Transfer Oversight Committee. We look forward to
providing more information to the committee so they can forward the agreements to the full
Council for final approval on July 26,‚Äù said Mayor Greg Ballard. ‚ÄúThe utility transfer is a once in a
generation opportunity for our city to ensure more efficient and effective utilities, while
enabling us to address decades of underinvestment in crumbling city infrastructure. The
transfer will remove our vital community water and wastewater systems from partisan politics
and place them in the professional hands of the Citizens public charitable trust with its 123-year
reputation for customer satisfaction and operational excellence.‚Äù
Carey Lykins, president & CEO of Citizens Energy Group, said the committee hearing was
‚Äúanother good discussion in the ongoing dialogue important to ensuring the utility transfer
meets the needs of all community stakeholders. We look forward to continuing this dialogue
with the Council and the community as we work to make our utilities more efficient and
complete important system improvements to ensure safe, quality drinking water and cleaner
area rivers and streams.‚Äù

Councillor Vaughn said the committee plans to meet again on July 19. ‚ÄúAfter five hearings
earlier this year, this most recent hearing gave councilors an excellent overview of the
agreements. I look forward to the administration‚Äôs and Citizens‚Äô follow up to the questions
asked by my fellow councillors,‚Äù said President Vaughn.
Pending final approval from the Council, the transfer will provide the City with more than $425
million in revenue that will be invested in infrastructure improvements. The investments will
create thousands of Indianapolis jobs while rebuilding crumbling roads, sidewalks and bridges
and demolishing unsalvageable abandoned homes.
