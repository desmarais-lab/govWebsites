RULES AND PUBLIC POLICY COMMITTEE

The Rules and Public Policy Committee of the City-County Council met on Tuesday,
September 29, 2009. Chairman Robert Lutz called the meeting to order at 5:31 p.m.
with the following members present: Bob Cockrum, Monroe Gray, Barbara Malone,
Angela Mansfield, Marilyn Pfisterer, Lincoln Plowman and Joanne Sanders. Councillors
Dane Mahern and Benjamin Hunter were also in attendance. General Counsel Robert
Elrod and Chief Financial Officer James Steele represented Council staff.
Chairman Lutz asked Councillors to introduce themselves and indicate which portion of
the County they represent.
PROPOSAL NO. 256, 2009 - calls upon the hospitality industry to reduce the negative
impact of outsourcing jobs on the community
Chairman Lutz said that this item has been on the calendar for some time and he
realized a couple of representatives of organizations that should have been notified of
this meeting were not notified. He asked with consent of the co-sponsors, Councillors
Plowman and Sanders, if this proposal could be postponed to allow those organizations
to weigh in on this matter.
Councillor Sanders moved, seconded by Councillor Plowman, to “Postpone” Proposal
No. 256, 2009 until October 13, 2009. The motion carried by a vote of 8-0.
PROPOSAL NO. 286, 2009 - amends the Code regarding residency requirements for
employees of the City and County
John Galloway, manager of training for the City of Indianapolis, Human Resources
Division, stated that this proposal insures that seasonal or temporary employees hired
for city or county positions be residents of Marion County on the first day of
employment. He said that the current ordinance does not make a distinction between
seasonal employees and permanent full-time employees with regard to residency
requirements. The current ordinance requires that a new employee must move into the
county within six months of accepting employment with the city or county. He said that
currently, only the Mayor, or his designee, or an elected official, or his or her designee,
has the authority to waive that residency requirement. He said that presently, lower
level supervisors can hire people living outside of Marion County for temporary or
seasonal positions, because most of these positions do not even last six months, and
therefore, they are able to circumvent this residency requirement. He said that this
proposal will close that loophole and allow the city and county to be more consistent in
their hiring practices.

Rules and Public Policy Committee
September 29, 2009

Councillor Mansfield said that she tried to close the waiver loophole back in 2004 and
did not get much support at that time. She said that she believes this is a good first
step, but that they need to also look at the waiver policy, as many people are getting
waivers without the warranted specialized or unique skills. She said that Marion County
has many different communities with different income levels and skill sets, as well as
several universities, and she feels there are plenty of residents to meet these
requirements and fill these positions. She said that she would like to see this entire
residency ordinance revisited and believes those who receive tax dollars for working for
the city should also live in the community.
Councillor Malone said that she supports the proposal, and there have been times when
she has noticed employees driving vehicles with out-of-state license plates. She
understands that some try to keep their plates because they do not want to pay a higher
tax, but she believes a policy should also be in place to require them to have at least instate, if not in-county, tags. Chairman Lutz said that he believes there is a state law that
requires residents to change their plates within a certain number of days. Councillor
Malone said that this might be the case, but it still seems to happen and is hard to
enforce.
Councillor D. Mahern said that this is an issue very close to his heart because it affects
people in his district. He said that his district has one of the highest unemployment
rates in the county, and most of these residents would take seasonal or temporary work,
but those jobs are going to out-of-county residents. He said that this proposal is a great
first step, but he belives the residency requirement needs to be looked at overall, even
with respect to contract employees.
Councillor Sanders asked if there has been any research on the number of employees
impacted by this change. Mr. Galloway said that the numbers from April to August of
2009 showed 442 seasonal employees in city departments. Of those employees, 418
positions were within the Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR), and 55 of those
employees lived outside of Marion County. He said that he does not have numbers for
the County seasonal positions.
Chairman Lutz stated that not any elected official can issue a waiver, but only those
elected agency heads who are responsible for hiring for an open position. Mr. Galloway
said that this is correct.
Councillor Cockrum asked why the language “first day of employment” is needed. Mr.
Galloway said that it was chosen to make it as clear as possible and to eliminate any
loopholes.
Councillor Sanders agreed that this proposal is a good step in the right direction, but
added that she also believes full-time positions need to be looked at as well. She said

Rules and Public Policy Committee
September 29, 2009
Page 3
that there is currently a full-time employee honing their skills in a Marion County position
who will then be running for office in Hamilton County.
Councillor Gray asked if this change affects those departments with their own human
resources departments, such as police, fire and the Prosecutor’s Office. Mr. Galloway
said that there are some exceptions, and he believes the police are one of them, but
does not know about the others. Councillor Mansfield said that the Prosecutor’s Office
would be bound by this ordinance, but police and fire would be exempted due to state
law. She added, however, that she believes law enforcement personnel should live in
the community they serve, as well, and the city should make every effort to hire Marion
County residents to fill these positions. Councillor D. Mahern added that only sworn
police and fire positions are exempted, but civilian staff are covered by this residency
requirement.
Councillor Malone moved, seconded by Councillor Sanders, to send Proposal No. 286,
2009 to the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried by a
vote of 8-0.
PROPOSAL NO. 303, 2009 - amends the Code to add a new section regarding the
internet posting of city and county contracts
Chairman Lutz said that he spoke with Councillor Ed Coleman, the sponsor of this
proposal, earlier today and he was not able to attend tonight’s meeting. Chairman Lutz
said that he would like to see the proposal postponed for approximately 30 days to allow
time to further review and discuss some of the language in the proposal.
Councillor Gray moved, seconded by Councillor Malone, to “Postpone” Proposal No.
303, 2009 until November 4, 2009. The motion carried by a vote of 8-0.
BUDGET REVIEW/RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CIVIL TAXING UNITS
Warren Park and Spring Hill
PROPOSAL NO. 369, 2009 - reviews the 2010 tax rates, tax levies and budgets of the
Towns of Warren Park and Spring Hill and adopts recommendations with respect
thereto
James Steele, Chief Financial Officer for the Council Office, provided handouts (Exhibits
A, B, and C) summarizing the budget review, levy review and spreadsheet
recommendations for the two remaining civil taxing units, the Towns of Warren Park and
Spring Hill. He said that Spring Hill has no levy or tax rate and, therefore, no
recommendations were made. With Warren Park, they changed the assessed valuation
according to certified amounts and froze the levy, which caused their tax rate to go up
because of the reduction in the assessed valuation. He said that based on these
recommendations, Warren Park may want to consider changing their tax rate before
passing their budget to protect that levy. He said that they have made no

Rules and Public Policy Committee
September 29, 2009
Page 4
recommendations to change budgets because they do not know what those budgets
contain, and have only adjusted assessed valuations, levies or tax rates.
Councillor Gray asked where Warren Park and Spring Hill are located. Councillor
Hunter stated that Warren Park is in his district between Washington Street and 10th
Street just west of Shadeland Avenue. Mr. Steele said that Spring Hill is near Crow’s
Nest. Chairman Lutz said that Spring Hill is in northwest Indianapolis in Washington
Township near Kessler and Cold Springs Road, just west of the Riviera Club and the
White River.
Councillor Pfisterer asked if there has been any conversation between these entities
and Mr. Steele or others in city administration. Mr. Steele said that there has not, since
this is a non-binding review.
Councillor Plowman asked for the definition of an excluded city, and stated that he
assumes these two towns are not excluded cities. Robert G. Elrod, General Counsel,
stated that these two are classified as included towns. He said that when UniGov took
place, excluded cities were classified as having a population of at least 5,000, and there
were only four of them at that time, and can only be four, as they cannot incorporate or
expand anything after that statute was adopted. He said that the remaining included
towns were left with very few powers, other than local law enforcement and some
jurisdiction over streets and sidewalks, with everything else falling under the authority of
the consolidated city.
Councillor Gray moved, seconded by Councillor Malone, to send Proposal No. 369,
2009 to the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried by a
vote of 8-0.
There being no further business, and upon motion duly made, the meeting was
adjourned at 5:55 p.m.
Respectfully Submitted,

Robert Lutz, Chairman

Monday, October 24, 2016. Chairman Vop Osili called the meeting to order at 5:34 p.m. with the
following members present: Zach Adamson, Jared Evans, Colleen Fanning, Scott Kreider, Jeff
Miller, David Ray and Leroy Robinson. General Counsel Fred Biesecker and Council Chief
Financial Officer Bart Brown represented Council Staff.
Chair Osili asked the committee members to introduce themselves and state which district they

Jennifer Fults, Administrator for Community Development, Department of Metropolitan
Development (DMD), reviewed a PowerPoint presentation in detail, which is attached as Exhibit A.
Some key points are:
2017 Action Plan

Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA)
 Awards are competitive, but only receive two applicants per year
o HOPWA applications are reviewed by DMD staff
o First time applicants must meet a threshold review that determines eligibility
o Applicants are scored by experience, demonstration of the need for programming and
the amount of non-City funds leveraged
CDBG and HOME Construction
 General construction applications are the most competitive
 Submitted applications are first reviewed by DMD staff to confirm eligibility
 Applications are submitted for review by a committee of local stakeholders
Ms. Fults stated that in addition to these projects, she would like to discuss a couple of activities that
they are proposing to fund in 2017. One is the Commercial/Industrial Improvement Program in the
amount of $547,000 to award funds to properties owners of commercial and industrial properties.
These properties will be located in low-income neighborhoods and are buildings that are vacant or
underutilized. The funding would be matched by the property owner to get the property back in use.
Ms. Fults said that for this pilot program, they have formed partnerships with the Department of
Business and Neighborhood Services, Homeland Security and the Indy Chamber to be part of the
review process to look at the applications and determine the types of repairs needed and figure out if
that will make a difference in the building being repaired. Ms. Fults stated that the other program is
called the Healthy Food Initiative. She said that this City has low-income neighborhoods which are
in a food desert with residents that do not have access to healthy food. Ms. Fults stated that they are
looking at proposals from developers to address the food access issue in those low-income areas.
Chair Osili asked who the applicants are for the OOR awards. Ms. Fults stated that on slide eight of
her presentation, it lists those recipients. She said that OOR is traditionally for non-profit community
development corporations, the Indianapolis Neighborhood Housing Partnership, and for the first
time, Habitat for Humanity.
Chair Osili asked if there was a difference in the process for Construction applications that were
submitted. Ms. Fults stated that some of the applicants meet with DMD and they went over their
application and provided feedback.
Councillor Evans asked what NRSA stands for. Ms. Fults stated that it stands for Neighborhood
Revitalization Strategy Area. Those areas are where they target their funds.
Chair Osili asked what would be the role of the Indy Chamber. Ms. Fults said that they would be
looking at that program from a business aspect; for example, whether the property is a marketable
building Chair Osili stated that the Indy Chamber’s Business Ownership Initiative (BOI), has amicroloan program, and he is hoping that BOI might be folded into this pilot program. Ms. Fults said that
her staff has met with BOI and they are looking forward to working with them.
Councillor Miller stated that he would encourage DMD to work with the Indy Food Council on their
pilot food program.
Councillor Robinson asked if DMD has a Council district breakdown of the distribution of funds.
Ms. Fults answered in the affirmative, stating that she will provide that to the Councillors.

Metropolitan & Economic Development Committee
October 24, 2016
Page 3

Councillor Adamson asked if the Consolidated Plan and the Action Plan are in a tangible form that
they can see. Ms. Fults answered in the affirmative, stating that she can provide the links to those
plans. She said that it is also located on DMD’s website.
Councillor Robinson asked if DMD can also show what the grants are for and where the dollars are
going for the food insecurities. Ms. Fults said that the funds that are set aside for the Healthy Food
Initiative for 2017 have not been determined as of yet. She said that it will be done through an
application process, but they will still provide the committee with a breakdown of where those funds
are being spent in which districts.
Mr. Biesecker stated that in looking through attachment A in the proposal, the Christamore House is
not listed, but it is listed as a sub-recipient of the General Public Service awards. Ms. Fults stated that
she will have that corrected.
Councillor Adamson moved, seconded by Councillor Fanning, to send Proposal No. 354, 2016 to the
full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried by a vote of 8-0.
Angela Smith Jones, Deputy Mayor for Economic Development and Emily Mack, Director, DMD
asked permission to hear Proposal Nos. 355 and 356, 2016, together. Chair Osili asked for consent.
Consent was given.
PROPOSAL NO. 355, 2016 - approves an amendment to the declaratory resolution and
redevelopment plan for the Consolidated/Harding Street Redevelopment Area to include the 2016
Expansion Area - GM Area
PROPOSAL NO. 356, 2016 - approves an amendment to the declaratory resolution and
redevelopment plan for the Consolidated/Harding Street Redevelopment Area to include the 2016
Expansion Area - Market East
Ms. Smith-Jones and Ms. Mack reviewed a PowerPoint presentation in detail, which is attached as
Exhibit B. some key points were:
Expanding the Downtown Consolidated Tax Increment Finance (TIF)




TIF Theory
o TIF is a tool that may be used to help overcome redevelopment obstacles that have
not been overcome by normal operations
o TIF is the use of new property taxes generated by redevelopment to help pay of costs
of removing obstacles
o The “but for” test
Two Proposed Areas
o General Motors (GM) Stamping Plant
 GM closes plant in 2011
 Lack of public infrastructure inhibits redevelopment
 Connectivity challenges reduces potential of transformative redevelopment
o Market East Expansion

Metropolitan & Economic Development Committee
October 24, 2016
Page 4
o Significant and difficult to redevelop public uses that will or could need to be
redeveloped:
 Jail I & II, the Arrestee Processing Center (APC) and Liberty Hall
 Downtown Heliport
o Existing infrastructure is not always supportive or conducive to retail and
neighborhood living
Chair Osili asked if this gives them the opportunity to look at the Waterfront. Ms. Smith-Jones
answered in the affirmative.
Councillor Adamson asked if this proposal was just a presentation and they are not voting on it.
Chair Osili answered in the affirmative.
Councillor Fanning stated that the GM Stamping plant has been a frustration for the City for a while.
She asked if it was Ms. Smith-Jones’ belief that adding it to the consolidated TIF district would free
up the barrier that has been experienced trying to redevelop that site. Councillor Fanning asked why
has this not been done before. Ms. Smith-Jones stated that she cannot speak to why this has not been
done before, but having it as a part of the downtown TIF would allow them to do any additional
remediation. She said that this is a blank slate so there is a lot of additional demolition, remediation
and connectivity.
Councillor Adamson stated that the City only receives a return on this investment from a TIF if the
entity that goes into that location is a tax paying entity. He said that perhaps a not-for-profit or a
governmental agency would not have any return. He asked if they are considering any protection of
that not happening. Ms. Smith-Jones stated that as with any proposal with regard to any abatements,
it would have to come back to Council for final approval and not done in a vacuum.
Councillor Adamson stated that the fact that the GM Stamping plant is a prime location for
something happening in that area. He asked has there been any discussion to establishing some sort
of parameters for establishing what the project profit margins will be on these projects and holding
the developer to that. Chair Osili stated that is a discussion needed to be had offline because it is very
detailed.
Councillor Adamson said that with regards to the remediation for the GM Stamping plant, he asked
why would the City be responsible for it rather than GM or RACER Trust. Ms. Smith-Jones stated
that GM was required by the federal government to bring it up to commercial grade level and IDEM
has signed off on it that GM has done that. She said that the reason the City may or may not have to
come in is that it may be decided to be used for residential purpose. She said that because it would be
City-owned, the City would have to do the remediation if residential.
Councillor Adamson asked with regards to the Market Street expansion, why is Old City Hall in that
footprint. Ms. Mack stated that Old City Hall is owned by the City of Indianapolis and it is a publicly
owned facility and has invested dollars into it. She said that the reason they included it is because
they want to recapture their investment. Councillor Adamson stated that if it is a City-owned
property, how are they able to recoup taxes. Ms. Mack stated that they have a PILOT agreement with
21C Hotels. Councillor Adamson asked where are they at with 21C. Ms. Mack stated that they have
met with representatives from 21C to talk about the project and where they are at.

Councillor Nytes askedwhat the time frame is to makethe $75,000commitment. Ms. Benell
answeredthat it is not dueuntil 2008. Councillor Nytes saidthat sheurgesthe Assessorsnot to sign
the contractfor IncomeWorks but to wait until a more clearunderstandingof how it will connectto
the new system. An increasefrom $10,000a yearto $75,000a yearis a significantdifference. Ms.

(includedas Exhibit A) outlining her presentation.
Councillor Nytes askedwhat qualified entitieswill needto havetheir notes"rolled" as referredon
slide threeof Exhibit A asa result of the delayof the distribution. Ms. Aeschlimanansweredthat
therearethreefunds for the City of Indianapolis:the Park GeneralFund,the Fire GeneralFund,and
the IndianapolisMetropolitanPolice Department(IMPD) GeneralFund;the County hastwo funds:
the Family and Children Fundandthe Marion CountyGeneralFund; Indygo's GeneralFund; and
the Indianapolis/MarionCounty Public Library's (IMCPL) GeneralFund. Councillor Nytes asked
if the interestimpact for the variousloansis known. Ms. Aeschlimansaidthat it will dependon
whenthe June30thdistribution is received. Shesaidthat the noteshavebeenissuedfor a 3.5% to
4% interestand could result in a $250,000to $300,000impactif the notesare issuedthroughmidSeptemberor October.
Chair Sandersaskedif the borrowing is includedfor the Family and Child Welfare. Ms.
Aeschlimanansweredin the negativeand statedthat this transactionis a cash-flowissueonly and
doesnot include debtborrowing or budget-gapfinancing. Shesaidthat only 800/0of the approved
levy canbe borrowedfor the given year.
Councillor Plowmanaskedif this is doneeveryyear. Ms. Aeschlimanansweredthat the warrant
programis doneevery yearbut this borrowingis different. Councillor Plowmanaskedif the
borrowing would be doneregardlessof ,'trending." Ms. Aeschlimanansweredin the negativeand
statedthat the proposalwill authorizeborrowing for City fundsthat arenot traditionally a part of
the program. Shesaidthat authorizationfor the issuanceof tax warrantsis doneyearly in Juneand
December.This issuanceinvolvesfundsthat are not a ~ of the normal borrowingsthat will
realizecashdeficits becauseof the latenessof the June30dldistribution. However,shesaidthat the
normal borrowing is includedin the proposal. Councillor Plowmanaskedif it is anticipatedthat
authorizationfor tax warrantsasa normal courseof businesswill not be necessaryin the future.
Ms. Aeschlimanansweredthat it dependson fund balancesandcashreservesand is up to the

get through six months. Ms. Aeschlimansaidthat the problemthis yearis that thereis intereston
the original note that is dueJune30th,but the City is unableto pay the note so additionalinterest
will accruedresultingin paymentfor the noteplus intereston the additionalborrowing. Councillor
Plowmanaskedif it would be a savingsto taxpayersif the City hadthe ability to haveenoughcash
reservesand not haveto borrow. Councillor Nytes answeredthat it would be a savingsbecause
therewould be no interest,but somemay questionif it is cost effectiveto taxpayersto allow the
moneyto simply sit aroundin fund balances.Shesaidthat the answerwould bestlie in performing
a financial analysis.
Councillor McWhirter askedif the notecanbe paid off early if taxescomein beforemid-September
or October. Ms. Aeschlimanansweredin the affirmative.
Kyle Willis, ProjectManager,IndianapolisBond Bank, spokeaboutbackgroundinfonnation on
"trending", key points shownon slide four of Exhibit A. He saidthat propertytaxespayablein
2000and after will havereal propertythat is subjectto a yearly fe-evaluationprocess.Ms.
Aeschlimansaidthat slide six of Exhibit A lists the City fundsthat needassistanceandthe total
annualtax levy for eachfund. Councillor Nytesaskedif the maximumamountthat eachfund can
borrow is listed in Exhibit A or in the proposal. Ms. Aeschlimanansweredthat the maximum
borrowing amountis in the proposal,which is 80% of what is listed in Exhibit A.
Councillor McWhirter askedwhy thereare so many blank spacesin the proposal. Ms. Aeschliman
answeredthat the approvalof the resolutionalsoinvolvesapprovingthe warrantfonn. Shesaidthat
the blank spacesare on the warrantfonn andthosespaceswill be filled in whenthe warrantis
finalized.
Councillor Nytes moved,secondedby Councillor McWhirter, to forward ProposalNo. 231, 2007to
the full Council with a "Do Pass"recommendation.The motion carriedby a vote of 5-0.

Chair Sandersaskedwith regardto ProposalNo. 230, 2007,if the Information ServicesAgency
(ISA) canprovide the Committeewith infonnation on whereIncomeWorks fits into the new
propertysystem. Shital Patel,Chief Information Officer, ISA, saidthat thereis an interface
betweenIncomeWorks and the new propertysystem,and nothingis being developedthat is similar
to IncomeWorks. Shesaidthat the currentvendormay be ableto developthat type of application
or implementIncomeWorks. Shesaidthat ISA hasnot beeninvolved in the contractprocess,so
sheis unawareif ISA 's Application Developmentstaff cando the work requiredto developthat
type of application. Chair Sanderssaidthat shewould like to seeif the cost canbe negotiated
differently if the currentvendoris ableto do the work. Ms. Patelansweredthat ISA can look into
that.

Rick Powers, Division of ComplianceAdministator, Departmentof Metropolitan Development,
read a statement(attachedas Exhibit B) and distributed a copy of his presentation(attachedas
Exhibit C). Mr. Powers statementand presentationsummarizedthe need for purchasing and
implementing the Accela software program and the approval of ProposalNo. 232, 2007. He
presenteda softwaredemonstration(Exhibit D) abouthow the Accela softwareprogramhelpedto
quickly assessthe damagein New Orleansthat was createdby Hurrican Katrina. [Clerk's note:
The disc of Exhibit D is on fIle in the Council office with the original setof minutes.]
Mr. Powers said that the demonstrationshoweda great deal of technology in the field, such as
notebooksin the hands of the inspectors. The City has an advantagein that there will be no
additional investmentto include that type of technology as it is already present. However, the
City's older technologyis too big to pushforward via an air card.
Councillor Bateman asked if an analysis has been done on how much the City will save by
implementingthe program. Mr. Powersansweredthat someReturn on Investment(ROI) studies
havebeendoneandthat informationcanbe sharedwith the Committee.
Mr. Powerssaid that the Accela systemwould speakdirectly to the needrelative to insurancerates
and what is being done in that area. He said that one problem that was determinedwas that
Building Inspectionswas performingabout30% of the inspectionsrequiredto ensurePublic Safety
relative to the homeone lives in being inspectedbeforeit is occupied. Mr. Powerssaid that staff is
being doubledand that will put the departmentin the 70 percentileto 80 percentile,which still does
not meetthe insuranceindustriesexpectations.He said that the new technologyis expectedto help
pick up the speedto allow completionof 100%of requiredinspections.
Ken Sorenson's,Chief TechnologyOfficer, ISA, presentationbeganon slide four of Exhibit C.
Councillor Nytes askedif the softwarewould have the capacityto support sometype of property
registrationprogram. Mr. Sorensonansweredin the affirmative.
Mr. Sorensonreferred to slide six of Exhibit C, the Area Overview, and statedthat the program
really simplifies the environmentfrom a managementperspective,a userperspective,and improves
overall efficiency within the environment. He said that he included Disaster Recovery in the
overview becauseit allows ISA to replicatedata so that as transactionsare enteredinto the system,
they are replicatedto anothersite. Mr. Sorensonsaid that if the primary data centeris destroyed,
functionscan be doneby switching to anothersite within a matterof minutes. The hostedsite will
be locatedin California. Chair Sandersaskedif there is a backupin caseboth sites are destroyedi
Ms. Patelansweredin the affimlative.
Mr. Sorensonsaid the graph on slide six also reflects that systemswill be replacedwith regardto
compliance. Someof the systems,suchas licensingfunctions,will be removedbecausethe Accela
programcan be usedto bring thosefunctionsto the bareminimum. He said for example,the Fire
Department'sPlan ExaminationDepartmentwill move into ISA' s areaand will be supportedand
visible within the system. That is what is meant by the program having adaptability across
departmentswith like functions. Ms. Patel said that ISA is also working with and coordinatingthe
implementationof Accela with Health and Hospital. Mr. Sorensonsaid that many of the City's

Administration and FinanceCommittee

applicationsare developedon-site; therefore,implementingthis packagesolution will reducethe
amountof supportcurrently required.
Mr. Sorensonsaid that slide sevenof Exhibit A, lists the modulesincludedin the software The list
includes:

.

.
.

Land Management- core module used to replace Tidemark and its functionality. A
completesolution for planning,permitting, inspectingand enforcingland useviolations.
CitizensAccess- allows citizensto accessinformationvia the web
GIS - in addition to current system, an integrated piece that allows for display of
information to be donemorerapidly without going throughthird-party viewers.
Wireless - allows staff to perform jobs remotely, to accessinformation if connection
available or to do things off-line and download information into the syStem once
reconnected.
InteractiveVoice Response(IVR) - allows peopleto requestinfonnation over the telephone.
Service Request- will allow Siebel to be requestedwithin the Mayor's Action Center
(MAC) and would track citizens' requests.

Mr. Sorensoncontinuedwith slide eight, the ProjectSummary. Chair Sandersaskedif the kick-off
will be after the go-live datein Phase1. Mr. Sorensonansweredin the affirmative. He saidthat the
last slide illustratesdetailedcosts.
Councillor McWhirter askedhow much the maintenancecontact is that is referencedin the Total
Project Cost shown on slide eight of Exhibit A. Mr. Sorensonansweredthat it is approximately
$240,000per year. Councillor McWhirter askedif that amountis included in the $4 million cost.
Mr. Sorensonansweredthat the $4 million includes five years of maintenance,and the cost will
increasea maximum of 6% beginningin the sixth year.
Councillor Plowmanif the City hasthreeyearsto pay for the software. Mr. Sorensonansweredthat
it will be financedand paid with three equal paymentsof approximately$1.4 million. Councillor
Plowmanaskedwhy it will take so long to go-live. Mr. Sorensonansweredthat it will take time
becausean II-year old systemwill be removedand a completelydifferent systemwill be installed.
He said that this software is dramatically different and will require training, conversion of
databases,migrating within multiple departmentsand integrating. He said that the City will go

fromthreeor four separate
suitesof softwareto one.

.

Councillor Plowman askedwhat type of accesswill the public have in comparisonto what they
have now. Mr. Sorensonsaid that citizens will be able to requestservicessuch as inspections,
perform contractor registrations,or submit compliancecompletion cards. He said that there is
currently outside vendor support completing some of the requests,but the new system could
possiblyevenleadto online permitting.
Councillor Bateman asked about the difference between the citizen's accessand the service
requests. Mr. Sorensonsaid that servicerequestsprovide customersthe ability to requestservices
and citizen's accessprovidesthe communitythe ability to seewhat is being done for the City. He
saidthat the two are different, but integratedbecausethey aremoduleswithin the samesystem. The
service request is a MAC or citizen relationship function where it will integrate with Systems

outsideof the cell, but it is also a component. He said that the systemwill be integratedwith the
new propertysystem,aswell assystemswithin otheragencies.
Chair Sanderssaidthat a technicalamendmentneedsto be madein Section3 of the proposal,under
subheadingTotal Increase. It was broughtdown as $1,398,908million and it shouldbe $1,348,908
million. Councillor Nytes moved,secondedby Councillor McWhirter, to amendProposalNo. 232,
2007with the correctedtotal increaseamount. The motion carriedby a vote of 5-0.
Chair SandersaskedMr. Sorensonto explain the sourceof funding for the project. Mr. Sorenson
said that it will be fee supportedby the Pennit Sub Fund within the Departmentof Metropolitan
Development(DMD). He said that the funding came from the fee increasethat was done April
2006;therefore,it is paid for.
Councillor Nytes askedif the Permit Sub Fund is a sub fund of the ConsolidatedCounty Fund. Mr.
Sorensonansweredin the affinnative and statedthat the proposalwill authorizea transfer of $1.3
million from the ConsolidatedCounty Permit Sub Fund to the ISA Fund. ISA will make the three
year paymentsfor the software. Councillor Nytes askedif the ending fund balanceof the Permit
Sub Fund is known. Mr. Sorensonsaid that he believesthat the Permit Sub Fund balancewas
approximately $7 million or $8 million, which is enough to cover the transfer and have funds
remammg.
Chair Sandersasked if the transactionis no interest financing Mr. Sorensonansweredin the
affirmative.
Councillor Nytes moved,secondedby Councillor McWhirter, to forward ProposalNo. 232,2007 to
the full Council with a "Do Passas Amended"recommendation.The motion carriedby a vote of 5o.
With no further businesspending, and upon motion duly made,the Administration and Finance

Good evening. We will be looking to you this evening to make new
technology available to us in the very near future via this fiscal ordinance of
1.4 million, and an overall purchase amount of just over 4 million over the
next three years. This will affect the DMD Permits Sub Fund Balance;
however, ISA has been involved in negotiating on our behalf toward a service
upgrade/replacement of Tidemark with Accela and moving the contract to
their area for management as an enterprise solution. This took place on
somewhat of a fast track because of the enterprise flavor of the services
provided by this robust solution. In doing so, ISA was cognizant of our
construction seasons and the impact of an implementation process on our
staff's daily roles within those seasons. In a nutshell, as a result of those
constraints, we are before you today to provide a brief of services that we
hope to employ as a replacement to Tidemark and many systems throughout
the enterprise. The IT Board has approved those services and allowed for
contract signing with a funding dependent clause contained therein, we have
also briefed the Metropolitan Development Committee, and now finally
appear before you and the Council for fiscal approval.
This solution has actually been contemplated ever since a labor intensive
tornado damage assessment in 2002 and each incident response since then,
to include the recent emergency exercise. At that time we were simply
looking for ways to streamline our disaster mitigation efforts. We were
provided a demonstration of a component of the system we are here to
discuss today. During that demonstration it became painfully apparent that
our current technology was lacking in many areas. Maybe most of all in the
area of integration with other agencies and their respective technologies.
Since then other factors have been contemplated and acted upon. Those
factors have also made this a breakout year for DMD and the Division of
Compliance in particular. We are in the midst of adding the staff and
services needed to address Insurance Survey Office findings that are related
to home owners insurance rates in Marion County. When we have
completed these service level enhancements that a substantial fee increase
has provided for, and part of which is devoted to perpetual technology
improvements, we will also have added the following staff to our division; 10
additional Building Inspectors, 3 Building Code Analysts, 5 Zoning
Inspectors, a Legal Case Specialist and a Landscape Review Specialist. We
have also moved the Business Licensing inspection role from the Office of

1

Finance and Management, and IFD plan review into our offices. Considering
the dramatic changes we are making by adding staff, and equally if not
greater changing policies and processes to improve government oversight of
the construction industry, and code enforcement to address public safety; we
have still found that the results needed to resolve our shortcomings will
require a robust technology upgrade to carry us the distance. However, with
this huge challenge we also realized we have even greater opportunities.
We have been working with many other departments on the Software
Integration Committee established by the Mayors Office researching this
system known as Accela Automation that will provide for integration across
department lines, and provide a means to remove many of the silos of our
legacy systems. Our technology is aging, but we are still on the forefront of
developing new ways to do business. Technology must keep abreast of our
requirements, and we in turn, must keep abreast of mission supporting
technology. We are using limited wireless applications, we have GPS
integrated into our inspection operations via cellular phones, and our vehicles
are equipped with docked laptops that operate remotely. However, we can
only go so far with the legacy systems that these enhancements are
providing a means to update. We also have third party systems in place that
are actually impeding our moving forward. We now come before you with a
solution and an opportunity to change the landscape of technology in our City
and County.
The Accela Automation product is a suite of software modules that will allow
DMD to upgrade and enhance our current software (Tidemark, CliPS, Table
Editor, and in the future we hope it incorporates support for the missions of
the Mayors Action Center, and Asset Management as we fully realize its
capabilities) as well as provide the opportunity to integrate several key
business processes that rely on additional 3rd party software systems. This
software will also provide a means to support the enterprise in like-functions
including, planning, permitting, licensing, inspection, enforcement,
application-integrated mapping/GIS, Interactive Voice Response, citizen
access and services, and a huge leap forward in emergency response. All of
this functionality equates to dramatically increased service delivery in DMD,
but more importantly, for the first time, the ability to truly integrate technology
in support of like core functions and even systems across the enterprise. We
do indeed envision this system as an enterprise solution to many processes.

2

For example, the Service Request module functionality is a dramatically
enhanced ability that relates to our current Citizen Relationship Management
(CRM) solution in the Mayors Action Center. This component will fully
integrate with the planning, permitting, licensing, inspection, enforcement,
application-integrated mapping/GIS, IVR, citizen services, and emergency
response functions provided by the same system, and integration of systems
outside of Accela software scope; and as noted previously there is also a
module that operates in the asset management arena that could benefit us in
the future. Hence, offering even greater enterprise interoperability. Ken will
expound on the other modules during his comments.
Now we would like to show you the emergency response damage
assessment component in operation in New Orleans following Hurricane
Katrina. Then I will turn it over to ISA to share other particulars.

Update from Community Corrections regarding Juvenile Home Detention shift to
Juvenile Probation – Brian Barton, Director of Community Corrections

PUBLIC SAFETY AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE COMMITTEE
The Public Safety and Criminal Justice Committee of the City-County Council met on
Wednesday, June 20, 2007. Chair Mary Moriarty Adams called the meeting to order at
5:36 p.m. with the following members present: Vernon Brown, Sherron Franklin, Lynn
McWhirter, William Oliver, Lincoln Plowman, and Cherrish Pryor. Absent was
Councillor Scott Schneider.
Chair Moriarty Adams asked for consent to bring the update by Community Corrections
to the head of the agenda. Consent was given.
Update from Community Corrections regarding Juvenile Home Detention shift to
Juvenile Probation – Brian Barton, Director of Community Corrections
Mr. Barton said there is a potential transfer of the Juvenile Home Detention program
back to Juvenile Probation. Two years ago the Home Detention program was moved to
Community Corrections to open up the Juvenile Center and to try to leverage more
money. He said a lot of goals were met by moving the program to Community
Corrections; however, the Juvenile Judge and others felt that the Home Detention
program should return to Juvenile Probation. Mr. Barton said this decision went before
the Community Corrections Advisory Board and the board approved the shift. Mr.
Barton said with the shift, Community Corrections can concentrate on adults.
Robert Bingham, Chief Probation Officer, said the transfer benefits Community
Corrections and the Juvenile Probation operation because it allows Community
Corrections to focus on adults and the work release center. He said the Juvenile
Probation Office has committed to a program called Juvenile Detention Alternatives
Initiative, which is a very aggressive program to decrease the population at the Detention
Center. He said by decreasing the population, they have to come up with alternatives to
supervise and treat some of the juvenile issues. Mr. Bingham said Home Detention
provides a component to supervise juveniles via electronic equipment or supervise them
at the home with staff. He said all of the Department of Corrections’ (DOC) funding will
be transferred from Community Corrections to the Probation Department. He said they
are ready to implement the shift by July 1, 2007, with approval.
Chair Moriarty Adams asked if there will be a shift in personnel. Mr. Bingham replied in
the negative and said they have two individuals that are current Probation staff and they
will hire two additional staff members.
Councillor Oliver asked what determines if a juvenile is put on an electronic monitor.
Mr. Bingham said it depends on the level of risk the juvenile will pose to the community.
Councillor Oliver asked if there is a cost to the juvenile or guardian. Mr. Bingham said
there is a cost of 80 cents per day, assumed by the Probation Department.

Public Safety and Criminal Justice Committee

Councillor Pryor asked if the funding would need to be transferred before the shift
begins. Mr. Barton said a fiscal proposal is forthcoming and they will start their grant
year in July 2007. He said all the counties were delayed in getting their notice from
DOC.
Councillor Brown moved, seconded by Councillor Pryor, to approve the shift of Juvenile
Home Detention to Juvenile Probation. The motion carried by a vote of 7-0.
PROPOSAL NO. 273, 2007 - appoints Jesse B. Lynch to the Board of Public Safety
Mr. Lynch said he was employed with Indianapolis Public Schools (IPS) for over 37
years and retired in 2001. Some of his positions at IPS were Assistant Principal,
Principal of several IPS schools, and Regional Director in charge of all IPS on the south
side of the city. He said he is interested in this board position because he has always
worked with children and the public. He is also retired and would like to give something
back to the community. Mr. Lynch said he believes he could be a useful person on the
board because he is a good listener and has been involved in several problem-solving
situations.
Earl Morgan, Director of Public Safety, said he welcomes Mr. Lynch’s appointment to
the board and looks forward to working with him.
Councillor Brown asked if Mr. Lynch will be taking Dr. Brown’s position on the board.
Mr. Morgan replied in the affirmative and said the July meeting will be Dr. Brown’s last
meeting.
Councillor McWhirter asked if there are any restrictions on serving on two boards at the
same time. Mr. Lynch said he researched this issue, and as long as he is not on a paid
board, there is no problem.
Chair Moriarty Adams added that the background check was successful.
Councillor Brown moved, seconded by Councillor Pryor, to send Proposal No. 273, 2007
to the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried by a vote of 70.
PROPOSAL NO. 274, 2007 - appropriates $187,521 in the 2007 Budget of the Marion
County Prosecutor (State and Federal Grants Fund) to fund a "Fatality Crash Reduction
Effort" focusing on reducing crashes on local roadways and county interstates, funded by
a grant to the Marion County Traffic Safety Partnership from the Indiana Criminal Justice
Institute

Public Safety and Criminal Justice Committee

Lisa Bentley, Chief of Operations, Prosecutor’s Office, said this is a multi-agency effort
that will focus on reducing crashes along roadways and interstates. Don Bickel, Director
of the Marion County Traffic Safety Partnership for the Prosecutor’s Office, said they
will be concentrating on high crash intersections and interstates. He provided the
committee with a list of those intersections (Exhibit A, attached).
Councillor Pryor asked for an explanation on what would be done at these locations. Mr.
Bickel said officers will be working individually and as groups looking for aggressive
driving and any other violations that cause most crashes within Marion County.
Councillor McWhirter asked if there are any other restrictions, such as lights, lanes, or
signage that can be improved by the Council in these areas. Mr. Bickel said the primary
issues are the amount of traffic and driving behavior in these areas. However, officers do
note any type of defects or automatic signal problems that may lead to crashes.
Robert Yahara, citizen, said he supports this proposal because 86th and 71st Streets really
need to be addressed.
Councillor Brown moved, seconded by Councillor McWhirter, to send Proposal No. 274,
2007 to the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried by a vote
of 7-0.
PROPOSAL NO. 275, 2007 - approves an increase of $5,644,044 in the 2007 Budget of
the Department of Public Safety, Fire Division (Fire Service District and Fire Pension
Funds) to provide operational expenses, including salaries, benefits, supplies, contracts
and equipment associated with the consolidation of the Warren Township Fire
Department (WTFD) into the Indianapolis Fire Department (IFD), financed by 2007 tax
levy, County Option Income Tax and other revenues transferred from Warren Township
to the City of Indianapolis
Terri Falker, Chief Financial Officer with the Department of Public Safety, said they are
seeking the approval to appropriate a sum that is estimated to fund the anticipated merger
of WTFD into IFD. The amount is estimated to fund Characters 01 – 05 beginning July
1, 2007 through December 2007. She said they are requesting $5,298,119, and the
appropriation will be funded through the Fire General Fund and the Fire Pension Fund.
The General Fund amount will be $4,445,354, and the Fire Pension amount will be
$854,565. Ms. Falker said the merger will bring several enhancements to the public and
firefighters’ safety. This merger will eliminate the need for either WTFD or IFD to take
out emergency loans to cover the $1.2 million estimated operating deficit of 2007.

Public Safety and Criminal Justice Committee
June 20, 2007
Page 4
Councillor McWhirter asked if there is an amendment to the proposal, because Ms.
Falker’s numbers do not match the current proposal. Chair Moriarty Adams replied in
the affirmative and directed the committee to the amendment (Exhibit B, attached).
Councillor Brown moved, seconded by Councillor Oliver, to “Amend” Proposal No. 275,
2007 per Exhibit B. The motion carried by a vote of 7-0.
Councillor Franklin asked if additional funding is needed in addition to the requested
transfer from WTFD. Ms. Falker replied in the affirmative and said the amendment
reflects the reduction that the tax levy will have on IFD. Robert Clifford, City Controller,
said WTFD will turn over their property tax levy to the City of Indianapolis for 2007, a
portion of their County Option Income Tax (COIT), and any remaining revenues that are
left from the first half of the year. He said they should receive the funding within the
next month or two. Councillor Franklin asked for additional clarification. Mr. Clifford
said revenues will be transferred from WTFD to appropriate money to the IFD to pay
firefighters and any other operating expenses. Councillor Franklin asked if the transfer is
WTFD’s COIT that they currently obtained. Mr. Clifford replied in the affirmative and
said WTFD taxes now become the revenues of the City of Indianapolis.
Councillor Brown asked for clarification on the $345,000 shortfall. Mr. Clifford said the
Department of Local Government Finance (DLGF) cut the budget they approved for IFD
because of the shortage of fund balance for revenues in the second half of 2006. He said
IFD showed a negative fund balance; therefore, DLGF increased the budget by the
amount that would have been negative. Mr. Clifford said IFD cannot withstand a
$350,000 budget cut, and this should be a temporary cut to balance the budget. He said
when additional revenues are identified, they need to be transferred to IFD. Councillor
Brown asked what the WTFD operating budget is for a 12-month period. Ms. Falker said
it is between $10 and $12 million.
Chair Moriarty Adams asked for clarification on IFD having a negative fund balance the
last half of 2006. Mr. Clifford said because the revenues were short the last half of 2006,
they would have had a negative fund balance in 2007, if the appropriation were not
completed.
Jeff Seidenstein, Budget Manager, Office of Finance and Management, said the state
requires the city to do an 18-month projection of the budget, and last summer they
projected the revenues from July through December 2006 and four months of projections
for 2007. The budget is based on these projections and revenues, and when the revenues
fell short in 2006, then the balance at the end of 2007 would be $345,000 less than
anticipated. Therefore, the budget needed to be cut in order to not have a negative balance
at the end of this year.

Public Safety and Criminal Justice Committee

Mr. Clifford said, for the most part, they did not have any significant reductions in any
other appropriations. Mr. Seidenstein added that the County Capital Release Fund was
reduced by the state because of a miscalculation, but will not impact the budget.
Mr. Yahara said this proposal is an example of the complexity of government and how
long it takes to work things through between the city and state.
Councillor Franklin asked if this proposal is funded with the 2007 COIT that was increased
last year. Mr. Clifford replied in the negative and said this proposal will be funded with
WTFD COIT. Councillor Franklin asked if they are asking for additional money that is not
available or to raise taxes in addition to transferring money from Warren Township. Mr.
Clifford replied in the negative.
Councillor Pyror moved, seconded by Councillor Franklin, to send Proposal No. 275, 2007
to the full Council with a “Do Pass as Amended” recommendation. The motion carried by
a vote of 7-0.
PROPOSAL NO. 276, 2007 - approves an increase of $47,348 in the 2007 Budget of the
Marion County Public Defender Agency (State and Federal Grants Fund) to fund mental
health services, sentencing consultants and an intra-family violence diversion program,
funded by a federal grant administered by the Indiana Criminal Justice Agency ICJA)
Judy Spray, Sentencing Director for the Public Defender Agency, said this is the third
year of this grant, and the time frame is July 1, 2007 until December 31, 2007. The total
project cost is $78,913. The federal portion will fund $47,348, and the local match is
$31, 565. She said the local match consists of $23,845 in salary and fringes, operating
expenses of $4,269, and a contribution from Midtown Mental Health Center for $3,452.
No new money is needed to fund the local match. She went on to explain each program
funded by this grant (found in Proposal No. 276, 2007, attached)
Councillor Brown asked how many juveniles re-offended that completed the programs.
Ms. Spray said they did not track re-offenders in the first year of the program, but this is
part of the new grant to track re-offenders.
Councillor Oliver asked what the savings is with juvenile diversion. Ms. Spray said they
have not tracked the savings, but will start tracking the savings and re-offenders.
Councillor Oliver asked what kind of offenses the juveniles are committing. Ms. Spray
said, for the most part, it is battery on a family member or related offenses.
Mr. Yahara said crime needs to be defined in order to properly address it and find a
solution.

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE
The Economic Development Committee of the City-County Council met on Wednesday,
April 21, 2010. Chair Jeff Cardwell called the meeting to order at 5:34 p.m. with the
following members present: Jose Evans, Barbara Malone, Doris Minton-McNeill, Mary
Moriarty Adams and Ryan Vaughn. Absent was Michael McQuillen.
PROPOSAL NO. 3, 2010 - re-nominates David Oeth to the Speedway Economic
Development Commission
Mr. Oeth stated that he was born and raised in Speedway and that he and his wife have
lived at their current address for many years and have raised three children. He said
that he worked for Allison Gas Turbine for 42 years, retiring in 2002. Mr. Oeth stated
that working at Allison Gas Turbine and being involved with the Speedway Christian
Church and various other organizations has given him the experience to serve on this
board. He said that he is interested in Speedway staying the way it is and he would like
to help in any way he can. Mr. Oeth stated that the main thing for speedway is to
support the renovation of the town and bring in new business and investments. He said
that the redevelopment has started with construction on Main Street and it will help
bring new business to the town. He said that he hopes to be reappointed to the
Commission.
Larry Vaughn, citizen, asked if Mr. Oeth considers selling utilities a part of economic
development for a city or town. Mr. Oeth stated that whatever needs to be done to
improve the economic situation for a city or town is something that needs to be
considered. Mr. Vaughn asked how someone can be certain that their business will not
fail and the labor and tax dollars will not have been spent in vain. He asked if bringing
businesses in through some kind of bait or bribe would be a dangerous path to take.
Chair Cardwell stated that he does not know that the city has taken any baits or bribes.
Mr. Vaughn asked if when new businesses are brought in and let them have tax
abatements for ten years and rest on the tax rolls, is that economic development. Chair
Cardwell answered in the affirmative.
Councillor Vaughn moved, seconded by Councillor Moriarty Adams, to send Proposal
No. 3, 2010 to the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried by
a vote of 6-0.
PROPOSAL NO. 33, 2010 - appoints Michael Halstead to the Indianapolis City Market
Corporation Board of Directors
Mr. Halstead stated that he has an architectural firm in Fountain Square. He said that he
moved to Indianapolis in 1987, after graduating from Ball State University. Mr. Halstead
stated that he has been a great fan of the City Market. He said that he has served on
the City Market Foundation Board for the last four years and has spent a lot of time at
the Market hoping to make as many improvements as possible. Mr. Halstead stated that
he is looking forward to serving the Market any way that he can. Chair Cardwell asked if

Economic Development Committee
April 21, 2010
Page 3 of 6
Mr. Halstead has been made aware of the meeting schedule. Mr. Halstead stated that
he has attended the last two board meetings as a public participant. He said that he has
been meeting with the fundraising and development committee every Tuesday morning
at Wayne Schmidt’s office and is hoping to become the chair of the fundraising
committee. Councillor Vaughn asked what the greatest challenge is that the Market is
facing currently and in the future. Mr. Halstead stated that right now, the vendor mix is
the wrong mix at the Market. He said that it needs to be fresh foods. He said that the
Board has been working on getting new vendors, consolidating the vendors inside the
main hall, and looking at other uses for the east and west wings. Mr. Halstead stated
that they need to maintain the historic quality of the old hall first and foremost. He said
that the Market is right downtown next to the cultural trail and they should capitalize on
that. The Market does not have any beer or wine vendors and he thinks it will help the
stand owners attract the younger crowd, especially on the weekends. Mr. Halstead said
that the interior needs to be more colorful and alive inside.
Larry Vaughn, citizen, stated that downtown Indianapolis has enough alcoholic
establishments and it will not be wise to turn the Market into another bar.
Councillor Vaughn moved, seconded by Councillor Moriarty Adams, to send Proposal
No. 33, 2010 to the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried
by a vote of 6-0.
PROPOSAL NO. 116, 2010 - approves the Mayor's appointment of Michael Huber as
Deputy Mayor for Economic Development
Mr. Huber stated that he has served as Director of Enterprise Development. He said
that his job is to run the Mayor’s performance management tool called IndyStat, which
involves the Mayor’s monthly review, detailed analysis and publishing of the City’s
financial and performance data.
Mr. Huber stated that he is succeeding Nick Weber, who has worked very hard in the
last two years to try and create and retain jobs in Marion County. Mr. Huber discussed
some detailed information about Mayor Gregory Ballard’s Vision. Some key points
include:
Mayor Ballard’s Vision
•
•
•
•

High quality of life and affordable cost of living
Excellent educational institutions in Indianapolis and Central Indiana
Indianapolis’ active charitable and non-profit sector provides opportunities
for civic engagement
Create more jobs at a faster pace

o Demonstrate outstanding customer service and speed on
permitting, zoning and other issues impacting businesses
o Identify other support needs and Federal and State dollars for

BC Forward created 200 new jobs and retained 276 jobs
Apparatus created 130 new jobs and retained 73 jobs
Comlux created 400 jobs and retained 80 jobs
USA Football created 20 new jobs

Mr. Huber stated that in the next year, Mayor Ballard’s Administration will do their best
to invest proceeds from the proposed utility transfer in a manner that rebuilds
neighborhoods and spurs business growth, creates new construction jobs in
Indianapolis ($425 million equals 10,000 –plus potential new jobs), develops local and
Minority Business Enterprise/Women Business Enterprise (MW/BE) businesses by
maximizing their roles on infrastructure projects, and developing strategic areas of the
City where jobs are expanding (life sciences corridor, Northwest side Tech corridor) and
should be expanding.
Mr. Huber stated that the mission given to him by Mayor Ballard is to facilitate the
creation and retention of jobs, invest infrastructure capital strategically with long-term
jobs creation, work with the Office of Educational Innovation (OEI) to create more highquality education options for children, and continue to improve the City’s speed and
customer service in helping businesses.
Councillor Vaughn asked if Mr. Huber could identify one major hurdle or challenge for
Marion County in its effort to attract and retain new business, what it would be. Mr.
Huber stated that it would be that too many highly educated people are leaving
Indianapolis for other opportunities. He said that investing in some of the areas like the
Tech corridor would keep that talent in Indiana.
Councillor Minton-McNeill asked if Mr. Weber is still employed with the City. Mr. Huber
answered in the negative. Councillor Minton-McNeill stated that in previous
conversations with Mr. Weber, they discussed youth employment. She asked if Mr.
Huber will continue to follow up with that. Mr. Huber answered in the affirmative, stating
that they just announced the Indianapolis Private Industry Council (IPIC) Youth Works
Program will create many high-quality paying jobs for youth in Indianapolis. He said that
the target is youth between 18 and 22 years old. Councillor Minton-McNeill asked if
there will be any work over the summer for 16 year olds. Mr. Huber stated that IPIC has
some programs for that age group and students who are vulnerable at dropping out of
high school. He said that he is still getting caught up to speed with the different
programs offered in the area of Workforce Development and will be happy to talk with
Councillor Minton-McNeill as he becomes more familiar with the programs.

Economic Development Committee

Page 5 of 6
Councillor Minton-McNeill asked if for some reason the transfer of the utility company
does not happen, what the Mayor’s office will do. Mr. Huber stated that if the transfer
does not go through, they will look for other ways to free up infrastructure capital. He
said that the city does have financial incentives like tax abatements and other financial
tools designed to facilitate the expansion of companies. Mr. Huber stated that the city
will still need capital that is devoted toward reacting fast, because Indianapolis is in
competition with other cities and more so than money, the factor is speed.
Councillor Evans stated that he has done research on the things that Mr. Huber has
done as the Director of Enterprise Development, and feels that, Mr. Huber is just
another Steve Goldsmith in terms of wanting to privatize everything. He stated that
because of that and other things he has done as the Director of Enterprise
Development, he will vote against the proposal. Mr. Huber stated that although they
have not agreed on everything, he respects Councillor Evans’ opinion. He said that they
are asking people to see that what they are proposing is not a privatization, but actually
a public partnership. He stated that he is sorry that he could not win Councillor Evans’
support, but he still looks forward to working with him.
Mr. Vaughn stated that Mr. Huber is claiming that on the transfer of the water company,
there will be10,000 jobs. He asked if Mr. Huber could guarantee the employment
performance of a private corporation. Mr. Vaughn asked if there will actually be $460
million at the table for the waterworks deal or if it will just be the $100 million that this
corporation borrowed and brings to the table with them. He asked if their fees will be
deducted from the $100 million, which could result in only $70 million being transferred.
Chair Cardwell stated that some of Mr. Vaughn’s questions will be addressed during the
presentation portion of the committee meeting. He asked if Mr. Huber could address Mr.
Vaughn’s question about the 10,000 jobs. Mr. Huber stated that the 10,000 jobs are
benchmarked, and that information is from the Federal Government Department of
Transportation and they hope that number is accurate. The proceeds from the proposed
utility transfer, if approved by the Council, will go to critical infrastructure and there will
be hundreds of construction projects in the next few years. Mr. Huber stated that these
proceeds are being used to build up local firms and companies and give them more
opportunities than they would otherwise have had in the next couple of years. He said
that this would be a huge job creator for Indianapolis.
Councillor Minton-McNeill stated that Mr. Huber was involved with a proposal for the
selling of the parks. She asked what the thinking was behind that. Mr. Huber stated that
it is not accurate to say that they were involved with the sale of the parks. He said that
they have been active in trying to figure out higher and better uses for city real estate.
Some remarks made by the Mayor and others were misconstrued as a campaign to sell
the parks. He said that they have not sold any parks in the last couple of years. Mr.
Huber stated that they have increased their partnerships with a lot of organizations that
have helped them use city real estate at a higher and better use. Councillor MintonMcNeill asked if there are any plans to sell any of the parks in future. Mr. Huber stated
that this is not an issue that they are pursuing right now.

Minutes

and the motion passed unanimously.
Discussion Items
Wireless Networking Update
Mr. Turner updated the Board on wireless technology with a PowerPoint presentation on
the City/County’s network environment relating to wireless and the authentication
process.
Ms. Davis inquired how a plan would be defined for implementation of a wireless
network. Mr. Turner responded that a complete plan has not been developed. Mr.
Hineline stated that there is general interest from several areas but no area has stepped up
to ask for a complete deployment of the technology. This would be because of the new
nature of the technology and funding. Currently, IFD has asked ISA to install wireless at

IT Board Minutes
Page 2
Fire HQ for their conference and training rooms. IPD has identified that this technology
will allow them to increase an officer’s time in the field and they have acquired grants to
fund their wireless initiative. Due to the funding source, the initial plan starts with IPD
and will branch out according to need and benefits derived in the pilot program.
Ms. Sadler asked how wireless networking fits into the list of projects defined at the
retreat. The IT Board needs a mechanism to deal with special funding circumstances that
may or may not fit into the large objectives. Ms. Davis stated the current goals for
reduction in spending should be a part of the review process when new opportunities
arise.
RFP Process
Ms. Davis inquired about the outstanding issue of the 2004 ISA budget and the funding
request for outside resource assistance. Mr. Hineline stated he did not understand there to
still be an issue to address and had not included it on the agenda because of that. He
stated the 2003 budget allotment for outside assistance for the RFP was reduced from
$400,000 to $250,000 when ISA reduced its 2003 budget in June. As had been
discussed, the $400,000 spending level had been maintained in the 2004 budget request
approved by the Board at the previous meeting. Mr. Hineline explained this is a very
specialized area and he believed external help and expertise is necessary for the
city/county to be successful. He has determined given the shortened time frame and the
reduced funding levels, he recommends contracting with Gartner due to their already
developed knowledge of our environment and depth of resources. Such an agreement
with Gartner will be a services contract, can be sole-sourced, and will not require
bidding. Mr. Borgmann concurred with that statement. Between now and the end of the
year, assisted by Gartner staff, a scope for the RFP will be developed including service
levels, basic contract information etc. Mr. Hineline wanted to be clear the IT Board
understood these outside resources were not just to save local staff from writing an RFP.
The bulk of the fact-gathering, analysis and writing of the RFP will be done with internal
resources. ISA will be using Gartner as a “trusted advisor”. The Gartner representatives
will be used to provide their specific depth of knowledge of many IT sourcing contracts
and processes. Without outside assistance, it is likely we will not be as successful in
bidding, awarding, negotiating and delivering a solid five-year contract for IT support.
Ms. Davis and Ms. Sadler discussed modifications of the budgeted money for outside
consulting services to assist with the RFP. Mr. Hineline advocated a need for appropriate
assistance to guide the teams in their responsibilities, service levels, evaluations and other
tasks. He also pointed out the Gartner consulting services contract will be flexible to
change as services are used. When asked, he stated his personal belief was $200,000
each year was as low as should be considered. He felt this covered the technical areas but
Mr. Borgmann also felt he needed outside legal assistance given the special nature of this
contract.

IT Board Minutes

After some discussion, Ms. Sadler motioned to approve $150,000 for the 2003 budget
and $150,000 for the 2004 budget for services related to the RFP. Motion was seconded
by Ms. Davis and passed by a three to one vote with Judge Payne voting against the
motion.
After the vote, Judge Payne pointed out to the Board that with a potential $65 million
dollar contract, Mr. Hineline should be trusted to use what is required to get the job done.
The entire RFP process will be a significant undertaking with many technical issues, legal
language and contract writing likely beyond what the ISA staff is equipped to handle. He
stated the Board should be more open to allowing the technical staff do what they are
there to do in support of the Board.
Since the Board had already approved the motion, Ms. Womacks offered the opportunity
to transfer funds in the 2004 budget if the need arises for additional resources.
Ms. Davis and Ms. Sadler both reiterated their interest in putting the Board in a better
position to understand the technology needs of the City and County as we go through the
RFP process.
Mr. Hineline addressed the issue of a BAA (Broad Agency Announcement). Multiple
sources stated a BAA never had any legal presence, as it was another name for their RFP
process. As of January 1, 2003, the State discontinued using the BAA title. Once this
was identified as not an available option, ISA began development of an RFI to be issued
to gain best practice approaches to define the RFP. The RFI will not be used as a
screening document to short-list the RFP eligible vendors.
The RFI is planned for publication the last week of August or the first week of
September. The IT Board agreed to schedule another meeting to review the draft of the
RFI. The preferred date was Friday morning, August 29th.
Mr. Borgmann stated the structure of the RFP should follow the Public Private
Partnership Agreement statutes.
These statutes provide specific items for the
development of the contract and the award of the contract. A copy of these statutes will
be given to the Board members.
A communications plan is being prepared. Mr. Hineline updated the Board he had
addressed all ACS staff at their last quarterly meeting to try to head off concerns and to
start preparing them for the bidding process. He stated to them this bid was not due to
any shortfalls in their service. The IT Board was going out to market because of their
fiduciary responsibility to compete these contracts periodically.
Mr. Hineline discussed that the Strategic Plan was edited based on initial feedback from
the retreat and was sent to the Board for further review. Additional comments are
welcome.

IT Board Minutes
Page 4
In regard to the RFP development and evaluation team, Mr. Hineline stated he has
developed stronger concerns with the position the Board took at the retreat of stating the
IT Board would be the evaluation team. The Board needs to remain at an arms length to
the process of evaluating and recommending a vendor. The rationale is to keep the Board
separate to moderate the evaluation committee, review the process and then award the
contract. He recommended a separate group, which may have Board members as a part
of the group, present a recommendation as a formal step to the award process. Ms.
Sadler stated she is concerned, given the importance of the global perspective of this
contract and the potential individuals serving on the committee, non-board members
might not be able to effectively cover the Board’s thoughts. It was stated any Board
member would be welcome to attend any and all review sessions to assist them in
remaining in touch with the process. This raised the issue of an IT Board quorum
potentially being present for these meetings and the impacts of having to meet the open
door meeting requirements. It was stated these deliberations can be closed meetings but
they would still need to be posted to meet the law.
After further discussion, Ms. Sadler motioned to approve the development and evaluation
committee make up as originally presented in draft at the retreat of:
Three Board Members (Chairperson plus two)
Chief Information Officer
Two County Representatives
Two City Representatives
ISA’s Deputy Director of Contract Compliance
Judge Payne seconded subject to discussion regarding the 48-hour notice, and the motion
passed unanimously. Each meeting will be an executive session with 48-hour notice in
case there is a quorum of Board members present.
Status Reports
CIO Report
Mr. Hineline reported the ACS staff at 148 E Market have been moved to 129 E Market
in a very quickly organized move this past weekend. He thanked all the ISA and ACS
staff involved in making this transition so quickly. Ms. Davis received a very positive
response to her question of the ACS staff in the audience regarding the improvement in
their office space conditions.
The Prosecutor final moves to 251 E Ohio Street also went very well.
GIS staff have been working with DMD and Ball State to help in the efforts of the
abandoned property initiative. GIS technology is being utilized on handheld technology
and is going very well.

IT Board Minutes

ACS was able to diagnose, limit the spread, and attack the intrusion of the MS Blaster
worm that hit the City/County on Monday August 11th. Mr. Hineline commended ACS
for their efforts to develop and execute a counterattack to remove the worm and clean up
the infection by the time the national antivirus companies had published their first
signature files identifying the culprit.
The power outage issues that hit New York, Canada, Northern Ohio and Southern
Michigan ensued in a review of the back up generators and other power concerns with the
City/County equipment and buildings. Mr. Hineline reminded everyone of the
importance of our business continuity plans and that many of them do not deal with a
power failure as widespread as this one that occurred. ISA would have had the 9th floor
computer room powered with our UPS and the Building Authority diesel generator but
the air conditioning for the computer room is not separately powered. This would result
in ISA having to shut down in some number of hours and move to our disaster facility.
Almost every location where government staff work would have had no power to use to
access the computers. Only a very limited number of hardened city/county sites have
generator capacity.
A failure in the programming on the main telephone switch caused the recent failure.
The system corrected itself and reset itself within 2-3 minutes. However, due to a flaw
the remote sites supported by their own telephone switches did not reconnect to the
City/County Building. These sites were down for almost 3 hours until a fix was
implemented which required a full reset of the entire system and that took down the
entire building for 30 minutes. ISA is continuing to work with Avaya concerning the
issue and the response.
ACS Report
Mr. Nero stated Mr. Hineline covered much of what was in the ACS report. He thanked
ISA for their help in getting the staff at 148 E Market St moved to 129 E Market St.
Ms. Womacks thanked ACS for their cooperation and help with all the tax bill changes.
New Business
Mr. Flynn presented an update on the JTAC state court case management system project.
The Board requested Mr. Flynn be placed on the agenda at the each regular meeting for
ongoing updates on this important project to local government.
The special IT Board meeting will be scheduled for August 29th during the morning hours
to review and finalize the RFI.
The next regularly scheduled monthly Board meeting will be held on September 16, 2003
in room 260.

PARKS AND RECREATION COMMITTEE
The Parks and Recreation Committee of the City-County Council met on Thursday,
September 21, 2006. Chair Vernon Brown called the meeting to order at 5:02 p.m. with
the following members present: Bob Cockrum, Susie Day, Ron Gibson, Monroe Gray,
Jr., Dane Mahern, William “Duke” Oliver, and Earl Salisbury.

Joseph Wynns, Director Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR), introduced
Jason Gabehart, who replaced Stephanie Seawell as grant coordinator for DPR.
Mr. Gabehart stated that he has been with DPR for about a year.
Chair Brown asked for consent to hear Proposal Nos. 484 – 485, 2006 together.
Consent was given.
PROPOSAL NO. 484, 2006 - approves the Department of Parks and Recreation’s
interest and need to purchase approximately one (1) acre of land adjacent to the
main entrance to Krannert Park
PROPOSAL NO. 485, 2006 - approves an appropriation of $73,000 in the 2006
Budget of the Department of Parks and Recreation (Park General Fund) to
purchase a parcel of land to allow for widening the entrance to Krannert Park,
financed by the balance remaining in the Parks Department's Land fund (a subfund of Park General)
Paul Smith, Real Estate Manager for DPR, stated that the proposal is really
straight forward. These are two resolutions that are tied together and both of
them have to do with the purchase of some property next to the main entrance at
Krannert Park. He said that the owner of the house has unfortunately passed
away and there was an opportunity to sell the property to DPR. He said that DPR
had the property appraised which came to $90,000. Mr. Smith stated that there
were funds found in the Parks Land Fund, and they added some capital funds to
come up with the $90,000. He said that council approval is needed, because the
amount is over $25,000. He stated that the funds have to be appropriated into
DPR’s account from the Park Land Fund.
Councillor Salisbury stated that he runs at Krannert Park every morning and
enjoys it very much. He said that with there being a lot of accidents, there seems
to be a safety consideration. Councillor Salisbury asked if the property was north
or south of the main entrance and if it included the house and the acreage behind
it. Don Colvin, Administrator for DPR, answered in the affirmative stating that it
was north of the main entrance.
Councillor Mahern asked if there will be additional appropriations or if there are
already enough funds to demolish the house. Mr. Colvin stated that typically
those funds come out of the capital improvement budget, so there will be no
additional appropriations.

Parks and Recreation Committee

Councillor Cockrum stated that there should be a technical correction in the
proposal where the word, “north” should replace “south” in the second
WHEREAS paragraph. Councillor Day also noted that in the proposal under
Section 1, the word, “north” should replace “south”
Councillor Cockrum moved, seconded by Councillor Salisbury to make a
technical amendment to change the word “south to “north” throughout the
proposal. The motion carried by a vote of 8-0.
Councillor Brown asked how big is the house and if the demolition will be
scheduled. Mr. Smith stated that the house is about 1,500 to 2,000 square feet.
Mr. Colvin stated that traditionally how DPR obtains quotes from several vendors,
and then DPR will take the lowest qualified vendor to demolish the property.
Chair Brown stated that the reason for his question is that the Indianapolis Fire
Department (IFD) looks for structures that are to be demolished to use for
training. Mr. Smith stated that he will look forward to talking with Councillor
Brown to discuss those options.
Councillor Oliver asked Mr. Smith to explain the location as he could not visualize
it. Mr. Smith stated that the land is right next door to the entrance, and when this
land is added to the park, DPR can actually widen or move the entrance drive
over and make it wider. He said that when public safety vehicles are trying to get
into the park in an emergency, it is just impossible with the current entrance. Mr.
Smith stated that with the purchase of this property, DPR will be able to widen
the driveway in such a way as to allow not only the regular vehicles but, public
safety vehicles as well. Mr. Wynns added that right now, it is wide enough for a
one-way entrance and there is two-way traffic going through. He stated if DPR
does not want accidents to happen.
Councillor Salisbury moved, seconded by Councillor Gibson, to send Proposal
No. 484, 2006 to the full Council with a “Do Pass as Amended” recommendation,
and Proposal No. 485, 2006 to the full Council with a “Do Pass”
recommendation. This motion carried by a vote of 8-0.
PROPOSAL NO. 486, 2006 - approves an appropriation of $4,744 in the 2006
Budget of the Department of Parks and Recreation (Park General Fund) to pay
for equipment, field maintenance, uniforms and other costs associated with a
youth baseball program held this summer at Riverside Park, financed by a grant
from the Cal Ripken Senior Foundation

Parks and Recreation Committee

Jason Gabehart, DPR Grants Manager stated that this proposal is basically self
explanatory. He said there is no match for the grant and that the grant strictly pays for
the program at Riverside Park.

Councillor Oliver stated that he did not understand why that high of an amount
needs to be appropriated to pay for equipment, field maintenance, uniforms, and
other costs from the Cal Ripken Foundation. He also asked how far those funds
will go for the different teams. Mr. Gabeheart stated that in the original proposal,
it was proposed that 48 children will actually be served and divided up into four
teams. He said that after it was implemented, DPR had 34 children that attended
the league and benefited from the grant. Councillor Oliver asked how the field
maintenance and the purchasing of equipment ties into the amount requested.
Mr. Gabehart stated that field maintenance means fixing up the baseball mound,
each individual base, home plate and just the basics. He stated that it was not
necessarily going out and renovating the field, it is just adding small
improvements. Councillor Oliver asked how many uniforms there were and what
the names of the teams are. Mr. Gabehart stated that there are approximately 48
uniforms, and that he only remembers the A’s and the White Sox.
Councillor Gibson moved, seconded by Councillor Oliver, to send Proposal No.
486, 2006 to the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. This motion
carried by a vote of 8-0.
PROPOSAL NO. 487, 2006 - approves an appropriation of $45,395 in the 2006
Budget of the Department of Parks and Recreation (Non-Lapsing State Grants
Fund) to renovate and pave basketball courts with asphalt that has been
integrated with recycled tire materials at Douglass, Pride, Hawthorne, Bertha
Ross and Denver Parks, financed by grants from the Indiana Department of
Environmental Services (IDEM)
Mr. Gabehart stated that DPR was awarded two grants from Indiana Department
of Environmental Services (IDEM). He said that at each of the parks listed, DPR
is going to renovate the basketball courts using an environmentally friendly
asphalt surface that is made from recycled tires. He said that from research
studied, the recycled tires help to compact the asphalt and make it last longer.
Mr. Colvin stated that this project helps the environment by using recycled
resources. He said that DPR thinks this will help reduce injury on some of the
courts, because you can get better traction for the players. He stated that this is
an experiment and DPR is hoping to get a longer life expectancy so those dollars
are better invested. Mr. Wynns stated that the goal is to complete every hard
surface, including the parks, parking lots, tennis courts, and basketball courts by
2009.

Parks and Recreation Committee

Councillor Cockrum asked if DPR has a comparison of costs. Mr. Colvin stated
that it is a little more costly up front because of the newness of the project. He
said that he does not have an exact answer at this time but will be happy to
report back in a couple of years with the results.
Councillor Gray stated that a few years ago, Indiana was to become the test
market for this project, and asked if those projects for the basketball courts were
accomplished. Mr. Wynns answered in the affirmative stating that Indiana was
the first and since then, it has been opened up to a couple of cities in Indiana.
Councillor Gray asked if the cart paths were going to be redone at the various
golf courses. Mr. Wynns answered in the affirmative.
Councillor Cockrum asked if there is a local business that does mixing of the
asphalt. Mr. Colvin stated that there is a specialist at IDEM that understands the
process and that person goes to the local asphalt plant and actually injects it at
the plant.
Councillor Brown stated that he hopes DPR can aggressively pursue getting
some grants to resurface individual tennis courts. My. Wynns said that project will
begin in 2007.
Councillor Gibson moved, seconded by Councillor Salisbury, to send Proposal
No. 487, 2006 to the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. This motion
carried by a vote of 8-0.
PROPOSAL NO. 488, 2006 - approves an appropriation of $265,250 in the 2006
Budget of the Department of Parks and Recreation (City Cumulative Capital
Fund) to restore funds from a prior year purchase order that will be used toward
the cost of constructing the Earth Discovery Center at Eagle Creek Park
Wayne Simpson, DPR Chief Financial Officer stated that these funds are to finish
the Earth Discovery Center. He said that due to some accounting problems that
caused DPR to cancel the appropriation; the funds went back into the fund
balance. Mr. Simpson stated that this ordinance re-appropriates those funds so
that DPR can continue to finish the Discovery Center. Councillor Brown asked for
the date of completion on the Discovery Center. Mr. Colvin stated that DPR is
about 80% complete and the target date is for the end of December 2006.
Councillor Gray moved, seconded by Councillor Gibson, to send Proposal No. 488,
2006 to the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried by a
vote of 8-0.

Councillor Cockrum asked Mr. Wynns to give a brief description on the accident
that happened at Eagle Creek Park. Mr. Wynns stated that there was an
unfortunate drowning at Eagle Creek. He said that three young, Hispanic men
were swimming in the cove area, which is a non-swimming area. He said that
one person was under water for about 25 minutes and the water temperature
was about 67 degrees. Mr. Wynns stated that with those temperatures,
hyperthermia and cramps set in. He said that it is a tragedy because there are a
lot of Hispanics using Eagle Creek. Mr. Wynns stated that there are signs up all
over warning of the dangerous area in the park. Chair Brown asked if those signs
are in English and Spanish. Mr. Wynns answered in the affirmative. Mr. Wynns
stated that DPR will continue to keep posting signs everywhere.
Mr. Wynns thanked the committee for their support for the Parks budget. He
stated that DPR will do the best to spend the funds wisely and not be foolish in
our expenditures.
With no further business pending, and upon motion duly made, the Parks and
Recreation Committee of the City-County Council was adjourned at 5:20 p.m.

METROPOLITAN DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE
The Metropolitan Development Committee of the City-County Council met on Monday,
June 4, 2007. Chair Dane Mahern called the meeting to order at 5:32 p.m. with the
following members present: Ron Gibson, Scott Keller, Angela Mansfield, and Mike
Speedy. Absent were Rozelle Boyd, Lance Langsford, Jackie Nytes, and Marilyn
Pfisterer.
Chair Mahern asked for consent to bring the presentation to the beginning of the agenda.
Consent was given.
Presentation on the Division of Compliance Accomplishments – Rick Powers,
Administrator
Mr. Powers read a statement on the Division of Compliance Accomplishments (Exhibit
A, attached).
Councillor Keller asked if the division can legally question citizens on proper building
permits. Mr. Powers replied in the affirmative and said they have guidelines in place, and
if they feel the request is absurd, they do question. Councillor Keller asked if there is a
way citizens can receive assistance during the weekend and after hours. Mr. Powers
replied in the affirmative and said they have on-call inspectors in the areas of right-ofway and building inspections. He said the calls would go to the Department of Public
Works (DPW) dispatch.
Councillor Gibson commended the staff at the division and looks forward to the work
they will do in 2007.
Councillor Mansfield asked if anyone reviews the signs in rights-of-way to determine
whose signs they are in order to fine them. Mr. Powers said that without an ordinance
revision, it would be extremely difficult to fine because of the people who manufacture
the signs and corporate entities that advertise. He said the corporate entities often have
disclosures within employee contracts that clearly prohibits putting signs in rights-ofway, releasing their reliability. Mr. Powers said they would actually have to see the
people putting the signs out in order to fine.
PROPOSAL NO. 233, 2007 - approves an appropriation of $40,100 in the 2007 Budget
of the Department of Metropolitan Development (Consolidated County Fund) for
equipment and services associated with the installation of emergency lights and laptop
docking stations for new vehicles
Mr. Powers said the Information Service Agency (ISA) took on the role of replacing their
computers in the city agencies. He said the stands used to mount laptops in their vehicles
was removed from their budget because they thought the stands would be included in the

Metropolitan Development Committee

Page 2
ISA replacement schedule. Mr. Powers said the need for light bars is a result of the new
vehicles they are receiving, and the vehicles require the emergency lights for workers in
the streets. He said they were approved to purchase the new vehicles, but the lights are
not interchangeable from the older fleet; therefore, new emergency lighting needs to be
purchased.
Councillor Mansfield asked what the source of funding is for this project. Mr. Powers
said the source is the Permit Sub-Fund from the Department of Metropolitan
Development (DMD).
Councillor Speedy asked what will happen to the old equipment. Mr. Powers said if they
have some of the old vehicles in their inventory, they will hold the lights as replacement
parts; otherwise, they will surrender them to Fleet Services. Councillor Speedy asked if
the new equipment is bought through Purchasing. Mr. Powers replied in the affirmative.
Councillor Speedy asked if there a competitive bids. Mr. Powers replied in the
affirmative.
Councillor Gibson moved, seconded by Councillor Speedy, to send Proposal No. 233,
2007 to the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried by a vote
of 5-0.
With no further business pending, and upon motion duly made, the Metropolitan
Development Committee of the City-County Council was adjourned at 5:54 p.m.

SLIDE 1 = INTRODUCTION AND LOGO SLIDE
Good evening Chairman Mahern, and other distinguished
members of the Council. I would like to spend some time
with you this evening too share some news about your
Division of Compliance.
If I could take a moment, I would like to introduce the
leadership team from our division:
Johnny Guest, Assistant Administrator, Inspection Services
and his managers.
Scott Mason, Building Inspections Manager is attending
Special Deputy training, but deserves noting due to his
efforts as manager of that unit.
Danny Hayes, Zoning Inspections Manager.
Donna Price, Assistant Administrator, Permitting Services
and her managers.
Kirt Havlin, Permitting Manager.
Stefan Wolfla, Infrastructure Development Manager.
George Krack III, Infrastructure Supervisor
Matt Kline, Infrastructure Supervisor
Fernando Alcocer, Assistant Administrator, Operations and
Information Services and his managers.
Deidra Harris, Office Manager, and her assistant Japhia
Collins
Steve Spencer, Customer Service and Licensing Manager.
Rhonda Fields, our Data Maintenance Manager
SLIDE 2 = ADMINISTRATOR and AAs
The Division of Compliance continues to move forward on
several landmark fronts. We have moved through the

second phase of our service level increases that the fee
increase you approved is providing for. Next year we will
complete the addition of staff. The result of many changes
has dramatically modified the configuration of the division.
When completed, we will have provided 13 additional
Building Inspectors, 4 additional Zoning Inspectors; two of
which were moved from the Office of Finance and
Management to facilitate taxi and business licensing
inspections. We will have created a professional plans
examination unit comprised of a Professional Engineer
managing the group, four Building Code Analysts, and a
Landscape Review Specialist augmenting their efforts. Also
assisting this unit will be the IFD plan review group. Finally,
we have measured and streamlined the process for referral
of cases to the City Prosecutor via a Legal Case Coordinator
position.
The spotlight burns brightly upon us, and we take our high
profile role to heart. We will continue reengineering our
efficiencies and we are confident that even more victories lay
ahead. The increased fee revenues and associated services
are the catalyst that is changing our organizational structure
and the capabilities of our division. We applaud your
assistance in making them realities.
SLIDE 3 = PERMITTING SERVICES
Our staff has been working with other City agencies and you
on various initiatives. Most recently, we embarked on a
realignment effort that will add to the change in
organizational structure and capabilities I mentioned earlier,
and will increase efficiencies and services. We are
continually in the process of reviewing and consolidating
resources, or creating new ones.

SLIDE 4 = INSPECTION SERVICES
Of particular note and as noted previously, our Building
Inspection unit is still growing to an eventual strength of 23
inspectors, and will attain an inspection rating of over 90
percent to facilitate increased public safety via issuance of a
Certificate of Occupancy in 2009. In fact, we believe we will
begin by issuing those certificates for new residential
structures first and then build our capabilities toward
commercial buildings.
We are still working in concert with IFD and have created a
Plans Examination unit that will be responsible for
performing construction, fire, life safety, and accessibility
reviews to ensure those areas are addressed in the concept
phase of a project. The IFD Plans Examiner is currently colocated with us.
SLIDE 5 = INFORAMTION SERVICES
Our staff continues to conduct comprehensive training and
certification levels are ever increasing. Our capabilities and
credibility is at an all time high. Our relationships with
builders are also steadily rising as they become accustomed
to a better-trained staff and our agency’s oversight of
responsible construction practices. Our staff working with
our sister divisions and DPW now provides a greater
awareness of responsible development via contractor
orientations, and a newly created seminar platform that
addresses the challenges of redeveloping in urban
environments that have existing infrastructure and
surrounding development established in some cases
decades before.

SLIDE 6 = ACCELA AUTOMATION – HIT SACE BAR
TWICE
Technology is a key word this year. Earlier today we
conducted the project kick-off meeting, and tomorrow we
begin implementation of Accela Automation. You have
already recently heard a great deal about this system so I
won’t go into further detail. However, suffice it to say that
the landscape of technology across many departments will
be changing in dramatic fashion via this product, and
replacement or integration of many aging legacy silo
systems. The Software Integration Committee established
by the Mayors Office was instrumental in making this happen
and their efforts are about to pay huge dividends.
SLIDE 7 = MADISON ELEVATIONS
We, along with our counterparts in DPW Engineering are
relocating our operations to 1200 S. Madison Avenue. What
you see here are architectural renderings of the elevations of
the building, which following renovation will face south. The
facility is located on the southwest corner of Madison and
Morris. With our growth in staff, the 35,000 square foot first
floor will be welcome added space. Although moving an
operation of our size and complexity is a challenge, we look
forward to being in our new home sometime around the end
of this year. And speaking of DPW, what a pleasure it is
pleasure it is working with Kumar Menon, Pat Holdsworth,
Tim Method, John Williams, John Workman, Victoria Kluck,
Larry Jones, and I know I’m going to begin forgetting people,
so I will shut up now, but, there are indeed many others on
the DPW team that assist us everyday, and their services
are greatly appreciated.
SLIDE 8 = YEAR TO DATE

Now for some performance numbers:
Year to Date the Mayors Action Center has electronically
sent us over 2,500 investigation cases.
Our staff continues to remain active in over 300
neighborhood group meetings annually and participates in
countless civic events, including City Hall for a day and
Neighborhood blitzes.
Signs are always an interesting number; our Zoning staff's
enforcement of the general sign ordinance has netted the
removal of over 8,500 signs from the public rights of way
thus far this year.
Over 3,200 Abandoned or Inoperable Vehicles have been
cited, involving over 2,300 properties. We continue to
average a 60% voluntary compliance rate in this area.
In 2006, the voluntary compliance rate for zoning
enforcement increased to almost 80%. They performed over
32,000 inspections in 2006. That’s three plus years at that
phenomenal rate, and they are tracking along those same
lines again. 5 short years ago, that rate was half that
number.
SLIDE 9 = PROJECTIONS – HIT SPACE BAR TWICE
Some 2007 projections:
For the first time since I have lived in Indianapolis, Building
Inspectors will perform close to 50% of its requested
inspections. That may not seem like a number to boast of,
but last year before we embarked on adding staff to this unit,

and the improved policies and procedures that Scott Mason
and his supervisors are enacting went into place, they
hovered at about 30%. In fact, that number was one of the
strongest factors in bringing us to address insurance rate
concerns. We still have 6 vacancies in this area that the
new positions have created which makes the increase in
performance even more impressive.
Our Right of Way Inspectors will perform over 15,000
Inspections.
Our Information Services staff will issue over 4,500
professional listings.
We need to make technology improvements in this area, but
even with that challenge, our Data Maintenance staff is on
track to digitally archive over 500,000 documents.
Finally, as usual, the face of our division in the lobby, the
Permitting staff, is holding a pace for approximately 50,000
construction-related permits.
SLIDE 10 = INTRO SLIDE WITH LOGO
I know that Director Plambeck, this committee, the full
Council, the Mayor, and the citizens of Indianapolis have
become accustomed to our high level of performance, and
we want to ensure you that we will continue to serve you
with pride. As busy as we are going to be over next year
with new technology implementation, a move to a new
location, and another step toward increased public safety via
the Certificate of Occupancy; we will not back away from the
remarkable day-to-day support the people of Indianapolis
receive and deserve from us. I say this often, but really
could never say often enough; I admire my staff’s efforts,

they are visionaries and consummate professionals; each
and every one. I truly enjoy serving with them.
Thank you. If you have any questions, I will do my best to
answer them for you

Chair Oliver asked where they get their funds. Ms. Hazlett stated that big supporters
are Lilly Endowment, IPL, and the Pacers, as well as several others. She stated that
they work with Indy Parks and the Department of Public Works (DPW) to prioritize
needs and then discuss those things they think they can fund; then go out and find the
funding. Chair Oliver stated that Douglass Park is on his wish list, and hopes it is on
their list, as well. Ms. Hazlett stated that it is on their radar.
DEER MANAGEMENT PROGRAM
Don Colvin, deputy director, DPW, Parks Planning Division, gave a brief presentation
regarding the deer management program that was implemented at Eagle Creek Park.
Following are a few key points:
•
•
•
•

Implementation was done to reduce the ongoing destruction of natural habitat
and negative effect of deer at Eagle Creek Park
Reduced deer and vehicle collisions in and around Eagle Creek Park as well as
personal destruction to the residential homes that surround the park
249 deer harvested, 5174 lbs. of venison donated to Gleaners Food Bank
Phase 1 hunt with the Wounded Warriors, Phase 2 hunt with United States
Department of Agricultural Sharpshooting

Brittany Davis, Eagle Creek Park, Senior Park Manager, stated that they are very
grateful that they were able to do the deer harvest, and that they are already seeing
some signs of improvement. She stated that they realize that they are not there yet;
and if they are not able to continue the management plan, they are going to lose the
progress they have made so far. She made the following key points:
•
•
•
•

Department of Natural Resources recommends a deer population of 10-15 deer
per square mile, and they harvested 48 per square mile
Estimated that 553 deer were in the park
Each year the population can increase by 20%
Formed a deer educational committee

Councillor Simpson asked if they had reached out to the residents that surround Eagle
Creek Park. Ms. Davis stated that they are fortunate to have support from the
neighbors.
Alex Upchurch, president, Eagle Creek Foundation, stated that he is thankful for the
future the park now has due to the deer reduction.
EMERALD ASH BORER
Bill Kincius, Urban Forestry, manager, stated that the Emerald Ash Borer (EAB) is an
exotic invasive pest from Asia that came over on shipping crates. The borer insect
completely consumes the living tissue of an Emerald Ash tree. He stated that it is found
in every county in Indiana and in several midwest and eastern states. He stated that in

Parks and Recreation Committee
April 14, 2016
Page 3

2013 they initiated a comprehensive street tree inventory to get a grip on all issues with
the trees. He stated that they kicked the project off with a grant from the state. He
stated that they also took advantage of a $200,000 United States Department of
Agriculture (USDA) grant.
Councillor Fanning asked if constituents still need to call in and report the Ash Trees or
if they are going to be handled through their inventory. Mr. Kincius stated that if
something happens to a tree that changes its condition, it needs to be reported. He
stated that their understanding of the trees will be the condition they were in when they
were inventoried. Councillor Fanning also requested to have more information
regarding the U.S Forestry service grant for Washington Township.
Councillor Simpson asked how big the budget is. Mr. Colvin stated that it is about $2.5
million; $1 million of it goes to the Keep Indianapolis Beautiful program, and the other
$1.5 million is for this program, both in parks and along the streets. Councillor Simpson
asked if the projects were bid out. Mr. Kincius stated that at this time they are using
their on-call contractors, Ace Tree Service and Green Arbor Tree Experts.
EAGLE CREEK PARK
Brittany Davis, Eagle Creek Park, Senior Park Manager, stated that they have had
some very impressive numbers in the last few years. Attendance continues to rise;
therefore, gate revenue and total revenues have risen. Last year, staff was awarded
the Mayor’s performance award for an 11 percent increase in revenue without
increasing expenses. Following are a few key points of her presentation:
•
•
•
•
•

Matt Neil, constituent, stated that he lives across the street from the main entrance to
the park and he is not able to plant anything in his yard because the deer will eat it. He
stated that he drives down 56th Street daily, and there are often about one dozen deer
very close to the edge of the road, making it hazardous to drivers. He stated that the
initial hunt helped with the amount of visible deer along 56th Street.
Thomas Kites, citizen, stated that his two teenage daughters were driving down 56th
Street when a deer totaled the car they were driving. Thankfully, they were not injured.
There being no further business, and upon motion duly made, the meeting was

[Clerk’s note: Councillor Vaughn left at 5:53 PM]
Chair Moriarty Adams stated that she had been contacted by some of the members of the police
department regarding the overtime and staffing for the Super Bowl on February 5th. She stated

Members of the Public Safety and Criminal Justice Committee
January 18, 2012
Page 3
that she asked members of the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) to explain the problem and the
command staff from IMPD to respond.
Bill Owensby, President of the FOP Local 86, stated that some of the FOP members had
approached him regarding scheduling and overtime for the upcoming Super Bowl. There is some
concern that with days off being cancelled for the two weeks prior to the Super Bowl that
officers would not be able to take their required days off before the end of their pay period and
would not receive overtime pay for the hours they worked.
Rick Snyder, FOP, explained that they are concerned that they have not seen the schedules and
they just want to make sure that every corner of the City is covered, not just downtown.
Everyone can agree that this is a once in a lifetime event and that everyone will have to give a
little more than usual, but they also want to make sure they are getting paid to do so.
Chair Moriarty Adams asked that Public Safety Director Frank Straub and IMPD Chief Paul
Ciesielski respond to the concerns of the FOP. Director Straub stated that the safety of both the
Citizens of Marion County and visitors here for the Super Bowl is the responsibility of everyone
in the Department of Public Safety. They are committed to making sure that everyone is safe. He
stated that he would be turning his seat at the table over to Deputy Chief Mike Bates who has
been working on the Super Bowl effort for more than two years. Deputy Chief Bates stated that
he has been working on staffing levels for the Super Bowl for quite a while and has been in
communication with command staff and the FOP about how days off and overtime would be
handled. The process would be just like any other major event. Any time over regular hours
would be paid as comp time and over that would be paid as overtime.
He knows it will be difficult for some of the officers to get their time off in before the end of the
pay period but he has been working with their supervisors to make it as easy as possible.
Councillor Mascari asked if the City is being reimbursed for overtime for Public Safety.
Director Straub stated they would be receiving some money from the Capital Improvement
Board for public safety, but that it would not cover all the costs that they will incur. That is why
they are working with the officers to make sure they can get their days off in before the end of
the month.
Chair Moriarty Adams commended Chief Ciesielski and Deputy Chief Bates for all of their hard
work and dedication to the City and to their work on the Super Bowl. She asked that after the
Super Bowl they come before the committee and give a report regarding the expenses incurred
by Public Safety. Deputy Chief Bates agreed that they would do so.
With no further business pending, and upon motion duly made, the Public Safety and Criminal
Justice Committee of the City-County Council was adjourned at 6:50 p.m.
Respectfully submitted,

Mary Moriarty Adams, Chair
