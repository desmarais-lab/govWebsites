Funds
The Indiana State Board of Accounts (SBOA) defines “fund” to
mean “cash or a group of accounts set aside for the purpose of
accounting for monies or other resources of general functions or
specific activities . . . in accordance with the system of accounts
prescribed by the State Board of Accounts or as required by statute”
(State Board of Accounts, Accounting and Uniform Compliance
Guidelines Manual for Cities and Towns, State of Indiana, reissued
2006).

Fund; Parks General Fund; Public Safety Income Tax Fund –
County; Public Safety Income Tax Fund – City; Personal Services
Contingency Fund – County; Personal Services Contingency Fund –
City; Guardian Ad Litem Fund; and Medical Care for Inmates Fund.
What all of these funds have in common is that they each will each
receive a substantial amount of flexible tax revenue. Thus, there is
the ability to reallocate the flexible revenue flowing to these funds
across many competing operational needs.

Funds that the SBOA prescribes for use by cities include but are not
limited to, general funds, special revenue funds, debt services funds,
capital projects funds, internal service funds, and agency funds.
Funds included in the 2015 Introduced Budget represent those that
require appropriation by the City-County Council. Appropriation is
the authorization of the City-County Council by ordinance to make
disbursements or to incur obligations for specific purposes.

Dedicated Funds
Dedicated funds, on the other hand, are funds which receive revenue
from taxes or non-tax sources that have very restricted legal uses. A
more apt of a dedicated fund description is a fund that receives little
or no revenue from flexible tax revenue sources. Some examples are
the Parking Meter Fund and the Permits Fund. These are both
dedicated funds because their revenue sources have strictly limited
legal uses.

General Funds
General funds are funds which receive a substantial share of their
revenue from taxes that have very broad flexibility. For example, the
1% County Option Income Tax (COIT) distributions and the County
General Fund property tax levy may legally be used to fund any
governmental purpose.

The Consolidated City also uses dedicated funds to account for the
proceeds of specific revenue sources (e.g., special revenue funds)
and/or for expenditures restricted to a specific purpose (e.g. debt
service funds; enterprise funds). Debt service funds (aka sinking
funds) are used to account for the accumulation of revenue for the
payment of long-term debt principal and interest.

The core general operating funds for the Consolidated City are:
County General Fund; Consolidated County General Fund (aka City
General Fund); Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department
(IMPD) General Fund; Indianapolis Fire Department (IFD) General

Grant Funds
Finally, the Consolidated City also employs grant funds to collect
revenues and track expenditures for grant monies received from
other units of government.

Revenues
State law requires adoption of a balanced budget, which shall include
all anticipated revenues and expenses of every organizational unit
(with the exception of utilities). As such, all appropriations adopted
by the City-County Council must be fully supported by (1) revenue
that is legally eligible to support proposed expenses, and/or (2) fund
balance (essentially prior year, unencumbered revenue) that is legally
eligible to support the proposed expense.

The Consolidated City relies primarily on property and income taxes
to fund its operations. However, a significant amount of revenue is
derived from Fees and Charges as well as from Federal and State
Grants. The following pages provide more detailed information
about property tax rates, levies and districts as well as the various
types of income taxes, tax rates as well as the available uses of such
funds.

Property Tax
Citizens of the Consolidated City are subject to several overlapping
property tax districts which levy taxes for city and county general
purpose funds, as well as specific services. Taxpayers residing in
overlapping districts would be subject to the tax rates of each
applicable district.
Certified Levy (Gross Levy)
The total property tax levy for a taxing unit before the property tax
cap is considered. Referred to as “certified” because it is approved
by the State Department of Local Government Finance (DLGF).
DLGF approval is required to ensure that the levy amount is within
maximum levy limitations set by State law.
Net Levy
The expected property tax levy after deducting the property tax
circuit breaker credits attributable to the property tax caps.
Gross Assessed Value
The assessed value of a property before applying any eligible
property tax deductions or abatements (which lower the property’s
taxable assessed value). The property tax caps are set based on each
parcel’s gross assessed value.

Property Tax Cap (aka Circuit Breaker)
The property tax cap, also known as the “circuit breaker,” was
enacted by the Indiana General Assembly in 2008 and subsequently
amended into the Indiana Constitution. The cap guarantees that
property tax rates in overlapping districts cannot exceed a certain
capped percent of the parcel’s gross assessed value. The “circuit
breaker” amount represents property tax liability waived because it is
above the level allowed under the property tax caps. The property
tax caps are as follows:
1% - for Homestead property
2% - for other residential property and agricultural land
3% - for commercial and industrial property
Taxing Districts & Rates
The following pages show the taxing districts along with the Net
Assessed Values (NAV) of taxable property within those districts for
pay year 2015. The Tax Rate for a district is determined by the
following formula:

Net Assessed Value (Taxable Assessed Value)
The taxable value of property after all eligible property tax
deductions and abatements are applied.

Income Tax
State law allows Indiana counties to impose a local income tax on
the State adjusted gross income of county taxpayers.
Also, counties may choose between several income tax options and
combinations. Each type of local income tax option is regulated by
specific rules and rate restrictions. Residents of Marion County are
subject to three interrelated income taxes in the form of the County
Option Income Tax (COIT), the Levy Freeze Local Option Income
Tax (LOIT), and the Public Safety Income Tax (PST).
This local income tax is collected by the State Department of
Revenue then distributed to counties based on the amount due to
each county on State income tax returns processed.
County Income Tax Council (CITC)
Local income tax is imposed or modified in a county by the action of
the CITC. In Marion County, the CITC is composed of the CityCounty Council and the fiscal body of each city or town that lies
either partially or entirely within the county. The other members of
the CITC are the Lawrence City Council, the Beech Grove City
Council, the Southport City Council, and the Speedway Town
Council.

County Option Income Tax (COIT)
Current Rate: 1.00% Maximum Rate: 1.00%

COIT revenue may be used for any lawful purpose of the
governmental unit.
Levy Freeze Local Option Income Tax (LOIT)
Current Rate: 0.27% Maximum Rate: 1.00%

An additional income tax rate may be imposed to generate revenue to
replace property tax levy growth. Thus, imposing this tax reflects a
policy choice to shift fiscal reliance from property tax to income tax,
not an overall tax increase.
Once imposed, this rate may neither be rescinded nor decreased.
Each year the CITC must hold at least one public meeting to discuss
whether or not Levy Freeze LOIT rate should be increased.
Public Safety Income Tax (PST)
Current Rate: 0.35% Maximum Rate: 0.50%

Because Marion County has imposed a Levy Freeze LOIT rate, State
law allows adoption of a PST rate. PST revenues may be used for
police and fire, including pensions, emergency services,
communications systems, jails and related facilities, and other items
related to public safety.

Voting representation on the CITC is based on each member unit’s
share of the total county population. In Marion County, the CityCounty Council holds over 90% of the voting representation on the
CITC.

Expenditures
Expenditure Categories (Characters)
In addition to the restrictions imposed by agencies/departments
regarding funding sources, agency spending is further restricted by
limiting the total funds available to support various spending
categories or “characters”. The Consolidated City employs five
separate characters to segregate spending. Each is described as
follows:

Properties and Equipment (Character 4)
This category includes expenditures for the acquisition of, or
addition to assets such as land, infrastructure, buildings,
improvements other than buildings, as well as machinery and
equipment.

Internal Charges (Character 5)
Personal Services (Character 1)
This category includes expenditures for salaries, wages and related
employee benefits provided for all Consolidated City employees.
Employee benefits include employer contributions to group health
and life insurance, pension benefits, unemployment compensation,
uniform allowance and similar benefits.

This category includes internal charges such as expenditures for the
Mayor’s Action Center, the Office of Corporation Counsel and Fleet
Services.
If a department has a negative appropriation for Character 5, it
means that department is a provider of internal services and a net
recipient of internal charges.

Materials and Supplies (Character 2)
This category includes articles and commodities that are consumed
or materially altered when used. Supplies include office supplies,
operating supplies, repair and maintenance supplies and other similar
items.

Other Services and Charges (Character 3)

This category exists for only City departments. Similar expenditures
from county agencies are reported as Character 3 instead. Since the
Information Services Agency (ISA) is a County agency, their
charges are not administered through Character 5. Both City
departments and County agencies pay ISA charges through
Character 3.

This category includes expenditures for services other than personal
services required by the Consolidated City either to carry out its
assigned functions or to fulfill moral or legal obligations. Other
Services and Charges includes professional services, communication
and transportation, printing and advertising, insurance (excluding
group health, life and self-insurance), utility expenditures, contracted
repairs and maintenance, rentals, debt service expenditures for
principal and interest payments as well as long-term debt.

Agency Budget Summaries
The Agency Budget Summaries section:
1) provides an operational overview of each of the county agencies
and city departments;
2) details the funding sources that will fund each
agency/department; and
3) outlines how those agencies/departments intend to spend those
funds by expenditure category or “character”.

Sources
The “Sources” listed for each agency/department budget represents
either a single or a collection of funding sources available to an
agency/department (See the Funds section for further explanation).

Final vs. Adopted vs. Revised vs. Introduced
For the purpose of comparison, each summary shows recent
historical data for agency/department budgets. The following
explains the terminology used in these comparisons.
Budget Introduced shows the amounts budgeted for each
agency/department as determined by agency/department finance
officers and the Office of Finance and Management. This is the
budget introduced by the Mayor to the City-County Council for
amendment and eventual adoption.

Expenditures

Budget Adopted shows the amounts budgeted for each
agency/department as adopted by the City-County Council in
October of the preceding fiscal year.

Agencies and departments are restricted in how they can use the
funds available to them. The Consolidated City employs five
separate expenditure “Characters” to categorize these uses (See the
Expenditures section for explanation of these characters).

Budget Revised shows the budget as amended through fiscal
ordinances approved by the City-County Council throughout the
fiscal year

DPS ADMINISTRATION
Introduction
The City of Indianapolis Department of Public Safety (DPS) will remain a national model leveraging the unique strengths of the Police, Fire, Homeland Security,
Animal Care and Control, and Communications Divisions as an integrated department. DPS will deliver the highest quality of public safety services in a fiscally
effective manner to secure the Greater Indianapolis area by preventing, preparing for, responding to, and recovering from routine emergencies and large-scales
incidents. The Administration unit of DPS provides coordination and leadership for the agencies within DPS.
Structure
The Department of Public Safety comprises five integrated divisions as well as the Citizens Police Complaint Office (CPCO) and the Mayor’s Office of Re-Entry.
The Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department, Indianapolis Fire Department, Division of Homeland Security, Animal Care and Control, and Public Safety
Communications operate within one department and share resources in innovative ways. This structure increases operational effectiveness by leveraging the
strengths of each division to provide public safety services to the City of Indianapolis/Marion County. Each of the divisions has their own operational goals and
unique personalities. The Department of Public Safety was created by Section 251 of the revised municipal code. CPCO, independent of the Indianapolis
Metropolitan Police Department, was created by city ordinance. The CPCO affords citizens of the Consolidated City of Indianapolis Marion County who believe
they have been treated improperly by an IMPD officer the opportunity to have his or her complaint(s) both heard and investigated. Mayor Gregory Ballard
established the Office of Re-Entry to develop collaborative partnerships among government, businesses, faith-based organizations, and community members to
leverage resources, to ensure sustainability by enhancing crime prevention strategies, and evaluating outcomes based on data collection and quality of life
enhancement, for ex-offenders and the community.

DIVISION OF HOMELAND SECURITY
Introduction
The Division leads an integrated Department of Public Safety effort to secure, prevent, prepare, respond, investigate, and ensure resiliency from natural or humanmade threats and hazards to the city, and to sustain a confident public. The Division is also responsible for preparing plans and managing the safety and security of
special events when anticipated requirements exceed the capability of the concerned geographic area. The Division of Homeland Security was created by Section
251 of the revised Municipal Code.
Structure
The Division was formed to unify divisions within the Department of Public Safety to create the capacity to deal with terrorist attacks, major disasters, planning and
managing special events, and other emergencies. By embracing a single set of guiding principles, from the Director of Public Safety to the frontline employee, we
have created a single division working to secure the City of Indianapolis/Marion County.
The Division does not operate in a vacuum. Other Federal, State, and local institutions participate actively in the Division’s efforts to work within the intelligence
community, investigate, disrupt terrorist activities, pre-planning and managing special events, and in the preparation for and response to major disasters, as do our
private and non-profit sectors and international partners. We will continue to work cooperatively to ensure that all of the instruments of local power – including
leadership, specialized technical expertise, research, and development investments – are brought to bear on the challenges we face in a coordinated and unified
manner.

MARION COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT
Introduction
The Marion County Superior Court is comprised of thirty-six elected judges, thirty-nine commissioners and magistrates, and over 690 staff employees within four
divisions - Civil, Criminal, Juvenile, and Probate. Additionally, Probation, Juvenile Detention Center, and Court Administration all function as independent
departments/divisions under the purview of the Court. The Court is governed by an Executive Committee consisting of four judges elected by their peers for terms
of two years. The Executive Committee oversees the general policy and management of the Court.
Structure
Court Division
The thirty-six courts of the Court Division handle more than 50,000 civil
cases and more than 40,000 criminal cases each year. Some courts are
designated problem solving courts such as domestic violence, drug,
community, and traffic. In addition, the Traffic Division handles over
120,000 cases each year.
The Criminal and Civil Term Committees select a Chair bi-annually from
within their respective judicial members to address issues specific to their
respective courts. The General Term meets monthly to provide a forum for
review of issues.
Probation Department
The Probation Department is comprised of the adult and juvenile divisions.
Its mission is to enhance community safety through enforcement of court
orders while striving to empower individuals and change lives. Probation
assists in relieving jail bed concerns through both pre-trial and probation
services. More than 11,000 adults and 2,000 juveniles were serviced by the
probation department in 2013. The department has embraced the role of
evidenced based practices in their daily operations focused on the initiatives
that are proven through research to impact recidivism. The Juvenile Division
continues to implement strategies endorsed by the Juvenile Detention
Alternative Initiative resulting in a substantial reduction in the number of
juveniles being detained in the Juvenile Detention Center. A presiding judge
for Probation is appointed by the Executive Committee every two years.

Court Administration
Court Administration manages and supports the overall operation of the Court
including human resources, finance, payroll, facilities management, juror
services, procurement, information technology, fleet, and staff training.
Juvenile Detention Division
The Marion County Juvenile Detention Center (MCJDC) is a maximum
security holding facility for detained youth. The MCJDC maintains youth,
ages 11-18 years, in a safe and secure environment while allowing continuity
of services. Each youth detained attends school, participates in mental health
and basic health exercises, and increases healthy social skill-building
processes. The Marion Superior Court is committed to providing a safe and
secure Juvenile Detention Center while providing practical, effective, and
high-quality living and learning services to youth. A presiding judge for
Detention is appointed by the Executive Committee every two years.

criminals accountable for their actions, preserving the rights of victims and continually seeking justice, all while maintaining the highest of ethical standards.
Structure
Criminal Charging Division
Police agencies present cases to this division for criminal charging
determinations. Deputy prosecutors determine what charges are to be filed in
each case, or if additional investigation is necessary.

Special Victims Team
This area of the office includes cases involving sex crimes and domestic
violence. It also handles cases of child abuse and leads the office’s efforts
and collaboration with the Julian Center.

Major Case Division
The Major Case Division handles major felony cases, including homicides.
Victim Advocates are assigned to each of these courts to ensure that victims
are notified of actions taken by the court and that they receive guidance and
support throughout the criminal justice process. Within the Major Case
Division, a Special Crimes Team includes prosecutors dedicated to human
trafficking, arson and unemployment insurance fraud.

Community Prosecution Division
Community prosecutors are assigned to the police districts and special areas.
These prosecutors work closely with district commanders and detectives to
develop strategies to protect and defend the communities served by the
respective police districts. Community prosecutors also encourage
community participation in public safety and crime prevention, engaging
residents in problem solving and establishing and maintaining partnerships.

Grand Jury Division
For cases involving white collar crime, public corruption, tax evasion and
other long term investigations, the Prosecutor has a staff of investigators and
lawyers dedicated to the collection of evidence and prosecution of these
cases. If criminal activity is suspected, the evidence is presented to a Grand
Jury composed of six citizens of Marion County who are presented with the
evidence and determine if criminal charges are filed. Currently, investigators
assigned to the Grand Jury Division represent detectives from the
Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department, Marion County Sheriff’s
Department, and Indiana State Police.

Juvenile Division
This division is responsible for filing and prosecuting acts of delinquency by
children 17 years of age and younger, including truancy cases. In certain
cases, more serious crimes can be directly filed to the adult criminal courts.

Strike Team
This division is responsible for three (3) areas of crime – drugs, guns and
gangs. Vigorous prosecution of these crimes is essential to the safety of the
community. The Strike Team partners with various police departments
throughout the county to assist in investigations, arrests, charging decisions
and the presentation of the case to the court.

sentence modifications. This division also handles all requests for
expungement of arrests and convictions and the sealing of criminal records.

MARION COUNTY COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS
Vision and Mission Statements
Vision
To provide the citizens of Marion County a safer community.

Mission
To enhance public safety by raising offender accountability through the use
of evidence based practices and interventions.

Structure
Home Detention
The electronic equipment used for client monitoring includes active radio
frequency for typical home detention clients as well as global positioning
satellite equipment for high risk offenders, including domestic violence
offenders who are on home detention. Community Corrections also offers
electronic alcohol monitoring equipment. Offenders may be placed on any
combination of Home Detention, GPS, and Alcohol Monitoring. All
offenders under supervision have a variety of programming available.
Community Corrections utilizes the Indiana Risk Assessment System (IRAS)
to assess the risk of reoffending and services needed for all clients under
supervision. Based on overall risk score and identified criminogenic needs,
clients may be placed into the following evidence based programs presented
by trained facilitators: Parenting, Anger Management, Thinking For a
Change, Substance Abuse Treatment, as well as Job Readiness workshops
and GED/ABE. Mental health programming is also available for those
mentally ill offenders who might otherwise have been incarcerated at the
local or the state levels. MCCC has an Addictions Intervention Component
which focuses on addictions issues.

Work Release
In October 2007, the agency opened the Duvall Residential Center which
provides services for male work release offenders and has capacity for up to
350 residents. All residents of Duvall are eligible for the same programming
opportunities as electronic monitoring offenders.
Through contracts with service providers, we are able to serve offenders at 3
other locations. Volunteers of America (VOA) currently provides a total of
60 beds for female offenders split among General Population, Community
Transition Program, and the Mental Health Component at Theodora House.

DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS
Introduction
The Indianapolis Department of Public Works (DPW) aims to improve residents’ quality of life through multi-modal connectivity, green space, capital
improvements, universal accessibility, and collaborative public and private partnerships. DPW builds and maintains public infrastructure, park land, manages solid
waste collection and the city’s entire fleet—striving always to provide effective, efficient customer service to citizens and visitors to Indianapolis, Marion County
and ensuring a healthy, safe, and natural environment.
Structure
Leadership:
DPW is led by a director appointed by the mayor. The director is supported
directly by a chief of staff. Under DPW leadership are several offices that
can be organized into four main divisions: Policy and Planning, Engineering,
Fleet Services, and Operations. These four divisions are not rigid: On a dayto-day basis, they merge to solve problems and increase livability across the
City and Marion County.
Policy and Planning
The Policy and Planning division works cooperatively to manage the
administration of the entire department, as directed by DPW leadership. This
division includes finance, the city-county council liaison, communications,
the Office of Sustainability, and the Office of Disability Affairs. While the
Office of Sustainability and the Office of Disability Affairs are housed within
DPW and report to the DPW director, they oversee livability and ADA issues
for the entire City and County. The offices within Policy and Planning work
closely with DPW leadership as well as deputy directors and administrators in
Engineering, Operations, and Fleet Services to ensure policies are developed
and implemented with fidelity, efficiency, and quality.

Engineering Division
The Engineering division plans, designs, constructs, and maintains all streets,
sewers, roads, bridges, multi-modal paths, trails, parks, green spaces, and
thoroughfares. It is also responsible for access control, traffic control, and
lights for these assets. Furthermore, the Engineering division manages the
development of studies, inventories, programs, and projects—and manages all
contracts related to transportation and storm water infrastructure. In 2013,
DPW’s Engineering division welcomed staff from Indy Parks and now
oversees parks capital development and land stewardship activities.
Engineering—in collaboration with Operations and Fleet Services—works to
directly implement the vision of DPW and City leadership.
Fleet Services
The Fleet Services division is responsible for the maintenance, fueling,
monitoring and repair of all vehicles and other City-owned equipment—
including public safety vehicles—and the operation of a municipal garage.
Further, Fleet Services maintains and supplies fuel for vehicles and
equipment owned by several other governmental agencies on a contractual
basis. Like Operations, the Fleet Services division includes union and nonunion employees.

Operations:
The Operations division is responsible for solid waste collection and disposal;
maintenance of streets, traffic systems, levees, dams, as well as park facilities
and grounds; forestry work; and snow and ice removal from City streets. This
division is comprised of both union and non-union employees. The work
performed in DPW’s Operations division requires highly skilled, dedicated
staff; for that reason, DPW safety and training are housed in this division, as
well.

OFFICE OF MINORITY & WOMEN BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT
Introduction
The Office of Minority &Women Business Development works to enhance
the City’s growth and economic stability through promotion of contracting
and procurement opportunities for MBE/WBE/VBE/DOBEs

Through community outreach, special events and programs such as startup
consulting and certification services, the DMWBD is an active partner to all
City of Indianapolis certified MBE/WBE/VBE/DOBEs.

Structure
Certification
MBE, WBE, VBE and DOBEs must be certified with the City through the
DMWBD. The DMWBD must verify that they meet the requirements of the
certification program. Recently implemented was the disability-owned
business enterprise program (DOBE). This program will be similar to the
MWBE certification process but the Office of Disability Affairs will process
the disability approval portion of the applicant and then the business entity
information will then be processed by the DMWBD.
Business Development
The DMWBD acts as a resource center for MBE, WBE, VBE and DOBEs
and provides programing that assist with growth and development of
companies, through outreach events, and educational workshops.
Compliance
DMWBD is responsible for reviewing all contracts, and the tracking of MBE,
WBE, VBE and DOBE participation on all contracts. DMWBD monitors
contracts to ensure the participation goals are being met.

Diversity Program
Recognize businesses and organizations that encourage, embrace, and
celebrate differences that foster a better place in which to live, work, and raise
a family.
The DMWBD is responsible for the Mayor’s Celebration of Diversity Award
luncheon, and working with the Indiana Black Expo on the Summer
Celebration, and the Circle City Classic event.
Budget change
Prior to the DMWBD budget being moved from the Mayor’s budget, we had
$8,000 in character three to be used for consulting services. Since that time
we have cut 2 FTE positions to meet budget cut requirements. These cuts
resulted in a significant decrease of business development and outreach to the
community, but resulted in savings of over $30k in character one for the
department. $22k, the remaining balance in character one from the FTE
position cuts was moved into character three for use in consulting services to
focus on contract compliance, and work force development. The total budget
line item is $30k.

amounts of data needed for both efficient and modern assessment results. It

MARION COUNTY SURVEYOR
Introduction
Marion County Surveyor's Office was established by the Indiana Constitution in 1851. General Land Office surveys in what is now Marion County began in 1819.
Marion County is part of the rectangular survey system (Public Land System), which divides the land into sections that are one square mile. All real estate
boundaries in Marion County can be traced back to the Public Land System. Statute law requires the Surveyor to recheck at least five percent of the section corners
each year, there are over 2300 corners. The Marion County Surveyor’s Office maintains a Legal Survey Record Book and a Corner Record Book. No fee is charged
for surveying services provided to any city, county and other governmental agencies.
Structure
The Marion County Surveyor's Office has three areas of focus, each with their own operational goals and activities while being unified by a common vision.
Surveying
In the field, the staff performs the precise measurements of Section Corners
and ties, per Indiana Code and replacing said monuments as necessary. We
monitor the Eagle Creek Dam for horizontal and vertical movement as well as
performing vital research within the office.
Information Technology
Information Technology supports the needs of the Surveyor’s Office. This
area compiles the data surveyors collect in the field by use of AutoCAD and
GIS software. Further, that data along with both the corner history and
drawing (which this department provides) is posted onto the county’s website.
We collect and quality check all measurements to ensure accurate, reliable
information is provided.

Preservation
Preservation is as much a part of the Surveyor’s Office as surveying and
technology. We believe in the importance of preserving our past for the
future generations. Understanding the necessity of creating legible electronic
copies of the records, maps, surveys and plats housed in the Surveyor’s
Office to ensure that they will be easily accessible for years to come. By
concentrating on this now we have been able to scan or have scanned already
deteriorating documents.

Having a greater reliance on new technology has helped the Surveyor’s
Office to build a solid fiscal commitment to provide government and private
sector agencies and companies timely, accurate and useful information, while
helping us and these agencies and companies save taxpayers money and time.
Finally, these advancements in technology have enabled us to fulfill our legal
obligation for the completion of the Alcohol & Tobacco Commission’s
Verification of Business Location forms.

Debt Service
The Consolidated City carries different types of debt associated with
various programs and services. This debt takes on two forms: (1)
general obligation debt, which is supported by a pledge of the full
faith and credit of the Consolidated City and is usually funded by tax
revenue, and (2) special revenue debt, which is supported by a
pledge of a specific revenue stream.

Special Revenue Debt
Special revenue debt is mostly associated with Tax Increment
Financing (TIF) districts throughout Marion County. This debt is
supported through property tax increment capture. This financing
tool is used to develop and grow various communities and
neighborhoods that otherwise would have little growth potential.

Generally, the revenue stream pledged for special revenue debt is a
fee or other non-tax revenue. In the case of debt funded by tax
increment financing (TIF), tax increment revenue captured is
segregated from the regular property tax revenue of the Consolidated
City.

TIF funds, including debt service for TIF bonds, are not appropriated
by the City-County Council. In Marion County, the Metropolitan
Development Commission (MDC) serves as the fiscal body for TIF
funds.

The Consolidated City of Indianapolis, Marion County takes pride
and care in maintaining its AAA (stable) credit rating for its general
obligation debt.
General Obligation Debt
Most of the Consolidated City’s general obligation debt is related to
transportation, parks, and emergency communications infrastructure.
Other general obligation debt is related to police and fire pension
costs as well as redevelopment efforts throughout the Consolidated
City.

Other special revenue debt includes economic development bonds
which are typically supported by a revenue stream generated by a
specific investment. An example would be a bond issued to finance a
parking garage with the parking fees pledged to pay the debt service.
Another example would be financing stormwater projects,
undertaken by the Consolidated City to address flood control
problems, with stormwater fees pledged to paying the debt service.
TIF debt service and other special revenue debt service is not
included in tables presented in this report, but is available separately.

Debt service payments for general obligation debt are typically
funded entirely, or in part, with tax revenue. Only tax-supported debt
service is included in tables presented in this report.

Introduced Budget
for the

Consolidated
City of Indianapolis,
Marion County
Presented to the
Indianapolis-Marion County
City-County Council
August 13, 2012

To the Members of the Indianapolis City-County Council,
It is my distinct honor to present the 2013 Budget for the Consolidated City of Indianapolis, Marion County. In recent weeks multiple national
media outlets have reported on the troubling fiscal situation of many cities across the nation, including seven that have declared bankruptcy. Thanks
to the leadership of my administration and this body, Indianapolis is not and will not be among them.
This budget proposal increases funding to public safety and criminal justice, continues funding of critical government operations and maintains
Indianapolis’ strong fiscal outlook for the future. It is a responsible plan that includes no borrowing and is fully funded. It maintains the strong
fiscal position of Indianapolis and preserves our position as an attractive, low-tax place for people to work, live, and raise a family.
This budget proposal increases funding to the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department, Indianapolis Fire Department and the Marion County
Sheriff’s Department by nearly $20 million. It maintains all other agencies at 2012 budget levels with additional funding to cover higher fixed costs.
I also am proud to say this budget includes funding for the first merit-based salary increase program for City-County employees.
I welcome your review, and I look forward to fruitful discussions about this budget.
Sincerely,

Gregory A. Ballard
Mayor

Executive Summary
FISCAL ENVIRONMENT
2012 Revenue Surprise
The fiscal position of the Consolidated City of Indianapolis, Marion County entering the 2013 budget cycle is substantially different than anticipated
when the 2012 budget was adopted due to two (2) significant revenue surprises – a lower than expected property tax circuit breaker loss and a major
correction to local income tax distributions from the State.
Based on final 2012 property tax levies for all Marion County taxing units, as approved by the State Department of Local Government Finance
(DLGF), the property tax circuit breaker loss for all taxing units was 23% less than projected for the 2012 budget. This was due mainly to approved
2012 school district levies for debt service and capital projects being much lower than expected. As a result, the combined 2012 property tax collections
for the Consolidated City’s seven (7) property tax-supported operating funds are now estimated to be $9.7 million higher than budgeted.
As for local income tax revenue, a major revelation occurred in April 2012 when the State Office of Management & Budget (OMB) announced that
$207 million in local income tax collections, due to counties, had been mistakenly under-reported by the State Department of Revenue. As a result,
State distributions of local income tax to counties for all of 2011 and through April 2012 had been too low. For the Consolidated City, this error
corrections means that 2012 income tax revenue will be $46.6 million higher than budgeted ($17.7 million attributable to reporting errors affecting
2011 certified distributions; $28.9M attributable to reporting errors affecting 2012 certified distributions).
Together, these revenue surprises have re-established operating fund balances that were previously projected to be substantially depleted by the end of
2012. In fact, $30 million of the income tax error correction amount was deposited in our Rainy Day Fund. Furthermore, the income tax error
correction also revealed that our underlying local income base was a bit stronger than previously assumed. When adjusted for the error correction, the
Consolidated City’s normalized 2012 local income tax revenue decline since the $281 million peak in 2010 is now $57 million (20% decline) instead of
an $85 million drop (31% decline) anticipated when the 2012 budget was adopted.
2013 Fiscal Conditions
Despite the good news of bolstered operating fund balances and a stronger income tax base, the Consolidated City still faces a very challenging fiscal
environment for 2013. Put in broader context, the $57 million drop in income tax revenue is equal to approximately 10% of our 2012 adopted general
operating fund budget of $568.6 million. Thus, we enter the 2013 budget season with an operating budget gap of $65 million (comparing 2013
projected base operating costs to 2013 projected baseline revenue).
Expectations for both property tax revenue and local income tax revenue are essentially flat for 2013. In fact, 2013 baseline revenue for both property
tax and local income tax are down slightly from the latest estimates for 2012 revenue (assuming no tax policy changes and after adjusting 2012 income
tax collections for the State reporting error correction). Baseline property tax revenue estimates are down because the reduced circuit breaker loss
surprise from 2012 is not expected to repeat. Baseline income tax revenue estimates are down because a balance in the Levy Freeze Local Income

1

Option Tax (LOIT) Stabilization Account (held by the County Treasurer for all government units in the county) will be exhausted in 2012. This means
distributions of Levy Freeze LOIT monies to all taxing units will be reduced in 2013. For the Consolidated City, the reduction will be $3.2 million.
Budgeted property tax and income tax revenues for the Consolidated City in 2013 differ slightly from the 2013 baseline amounts referenced above.
This is because the 2013 introduced budget includes the elimination of a local property tax subsidy call the Local Homestead Credit.
Under this subsidy program, homeowner property tax bills are lowered by spending some local income tax revenue to pay down the property tax
liability before tax bills are sent to homeowners. Thus, the property tax distributions to local government units now include the local income tax
monies used to pay down homeowners’ property tax bills.
When elimination of the Local Homestead Credit is overlaid on the 2013 baseline estimates for property tax and income tax revenue, the income tax
revenue estimate increases and the property tax revenue estimate drops. Therefore, a comparison of 2013 budgeted property tax and income tax
revenue to 2012 results differs from the baseline comparison presented above. More on the effects of eliminating this property tax subsidy is provided
below.
Despite continued revenue weakness expected in 2013, there is reason for optimism that the Consolidated City’s fiscal condition will continue to
improve in 2014 and beyond. With fund balances restored in 2012 and this 2013 budget plan in place, Indianapolis is positioned to excel in the postrecession environment that will inevitably return.
Future Revenue Outlook
The general outlook for growth in the Consolidated City’s tax base remains weak reflecting the sluggish state of the broader economy. In Indiana, there
is generally a two (2) year lag between economic events and the resulting impact on municipal income and property tax revenue. Thus, our tax revenue
for 2013 and 2014 will generally reflect local economic activity from 2011 and 2012.
This lag is due to structural aspects of Indiana’s municipal finance laws. For property tax revenue, changes in the market value of property that
occurred in 2011 are captured in the tax assessments in 2012. Those 2012 tax assessments then define the property tax base for 2013 billings. For local
income tax revenue, earnings realized in 2011 are reported on tax returns filed with the State Department of Revenue in 2012. The 2012 income tax
filings then define the local income tax base for 2013 certified distributions to local government units.
Expectations for property tax revenue growth remain flat. Until broad based economic growth triggers an escalation in property values, we can expect
property tax revenue to remain stagnant. In the property tax cap era, when property value growth is stagnant, allowable levy growth authorized under
State law is offset by rising property tax circuit breaker credits.
However, there is one major bright spot for revenue. A unique and sharp uptick in our certified distribution of local income tax is expected in 2014,
approximately $20 million, unrelated to underlying economic activity. This uptick will be the result of resolving an income tax collection vs
distribution imbalance between the State and counties that occurred during the period of 2008 through 2010.

2

Over those years, the State’s certified income tax distributions to counties far exceeded the local income tax collections received by the State
Department of Revenue. This happened because the Great Recession produced a drop in income tax collections so sharp and rapid that the legal
mechanism in place for adjusting the State’s certified distributions to counties could not keep pace. Thus, the State Treasury found itself in a position
where it was carrying a large negative balance in the clearing accounts used for processing local income tax collections and distributions to counties.
To correct this imbalance, in 2011 the State instituted a cap on local income tax distributions to counties. The cap holds the certified distribution to
each county level for 2012 and forward, until rising income tax collections offset the county’s negative clearing account balance.
The subsequent local income tax reporting error and correction in 2011 and 2012, referenced above, certainly added an additional level of complexity
to process of determining the correct clearing account balances for each county. Those issues have now all been reconciled. We estimate that the
Marion County clearing account negative balance will be resolved in 2013; and thus, the cap on local income tax distributions lifted. This explains the
unusual $20 million uptick expected for the Consolidated City’s share of the 2014 certified local income distribution.
Beyond 2014, we expect local income tax revenue growth to return to a normal relationship to underlying economic activity, but lagged by two years as
explained above.

KEY FISCAL FEATURES
2013 Budget Plan
This 2013 proposed budget offers a roadmap through a difficult fiscal time, without putting at risk the key foundational principles upon which our
continued success is based. It leaves Indianapolis poised to excel, regionally and nationally, in the post-recession environment that will inevitably
come.
This budget’s four (4) key features are: 1) it does not increase taxes on a recovering local economy (though an outdated property tax subsidy is
eliminated); 2) is does continue to pay down the general obligation debt burden of the Consolidated City; 3) it does continue generational investments
in repairing critical physical infrastructure; and 4) it does maintain high level commitments to protecting the public’s safety.
Beyond these core features, the 2013 budget will allow Indianapolis to continue its aggressive and successful efforts in new business development and
attraction, to elevate its international stature, and to innovate in education to make Indianapolis a city of choice for young families.
To navigate this path successfully, we must thoughtfully use the limited resources provided by the taxpayers. To close the $65 million operating
budget gap, the 2013 budget plan is built on these key financial features:





$20 million spend down of general operating reserves;
$17 million spend down of Rainy Day Fund reserves (leaving $13 million balance);
$10 million reimbursement from tax increment financing (TIF) district reserves for past City-paid infrastructure investments;
$8 million net revenue from ending the homestead property tax subsidy;

3

 $5 million from suspension of scheduled 3% pay raise for police and firefighters;
 $3 million savings for 2013 non-election year;
 $1 million revenue from new vehicle personal use surcharge for Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department (IMPD) and Indianapolis Fire
Department (IFD); and
 $1 million reduction in IMPD and IFD overtime
In addition to seeking a reimbursement from TIF reserves, the Consolidated City is also releasing approximately $1.4 billion of allowable tax increment
assessed value (AV) to the general tax base for 2013. This represents more than 25% the total allowable tax increment capture. This action will
generate the combined benefits of: a) lowering total property taxpayer liability by over $15 million; and b) reducing the revenue loss due to property tax
caps by nearly $20 million for all taxing units across the county. Of this $20 million revenue impact, the Consolidated City will realize $8.6 more in
net property tax revenue than it would have otherwise.
This budget plan will also enable the Consolidated City to continue its investments in core information systems to modernize internal operations and
financial controls. This is an investment necessary to both support productivity gains essential to navigating lean times and prepare the City to continue
to excel over the long term.
Strategic Fiscal Actions
In August 2011, the Consolidated City closed a deal transferring of its water and wastewater utility assets and debt to Citizens Energy Group (CEG).
CEG is a local public trust originally created, in 1887, to own and operate the City’s natural gas supply and distribution assets. This unique structure
was devised to protect the citizens of Indianapolis from the twin perceived threats that access to natural gas energy might fall prey to the price
inefficiency of a private monopoly or the political patronage exposure of a government run monopoly.
The deal generated over $450 million in cash proceeds, putting Indianapolis in the enviable position of being able to upgrade its physical infrastructure
while many other municipalities across the nation continue to struggle. These proceeds will fund improvements to roads, bridges, sidewalks, and the
demolition and deconstruction of abandoned properties through Mayor Ballard's RebuildIndy program.
Mayor Ballard is committed to protecting RebuildIndy funds. Thus, no RebuildIndy funds were used in 2012 operating budget nor are any proposed
for use to support the 2013 operating budget for the Consolidated City. Furthermore, $80 million of the proceeds were set aside in a new Fiscal
Stability Fund to maintain the City’s AAA credit rating. This $80 million may not be spent for any purpose until it is no longer necessary to maintain
our AAA rating; then, those funds must be transferred to the RebuildIndy Fund for future investment in infrastructure projects.
By year end, more than $270 million will have been invested to improve roads, bridges, sidewalks, or demolish abandoned properties in every part of
our city. In 2013 and beyond, Mayor Ballard’s RebuildIndy program will invest over $100 million dollars more in addressing remaining infrastructure
needs.
In a single stroke, this transaction positioned Indianapolis to be stronger both in physical assets and financial resilience. As a result, when a sustained
economic recovery does eventually take hold, Indianapolis will be poised to leap forward while many of our peers will have to first play catch up on

4

rebuilding their financial reserves and physical infrastructure base. However, we cannot be complacent because major issues still remain to align
permanent infrastructure funding with long-term reinvestment needs.
Eliminating the Local Homestead Credit
With the advent of the property tax caps, this property tax subsidy has lost its original impact. It has morphed from being a primary tool for protecting
homeowners from rising property tax burdens to an ineffective program that no longer achieves its intended purpose.
With the 1%-2%-3% property tax caps now secured in the Indiana Constitution, homeowners are guaranteed that their property tax bill will never be
more than 1% of their home’s gross assessed value. In Marion County, nearly 40% of the homes are already realizing direct protection in the form of
the Property Tax Circuit Breaker Credit (the mechanism used to invoke the property tax caps). For these homeowners, the Local Homestead Credit
now provides no property tax relief. For the other 60% of homeowners, they have the security of knowing that their property tax bill will never exceed
1% of their home’s value. Even for or these homes, the Local Homestead Credit now provides very little property tax relief, on average about $20 per
year. For lower value homes, less than $50,000 in value, the relief is less than $10 per year.
What really brings the inefficiency of this property tax subsidy into focus is a comparison of the total cost of the subsidy to the total property tax relief
provided. Currently, about $13 million of local income tax revenue is annually redirected to lower homestead property tax bills. Before the 1% cap was
enacted, this action generated a $13 million reduction in homeowner property tax bills (about a 4% reduction in property tax liability). Now, the same
$13 million expense delivers only about a $4.5 million in homeowner property tax relief.
The reason for this dramatic drop in the tax relief yield from this $13 million subsidy is that the 1% property tax cap renders it irrelevant in many cases.
The Local Homestead Credit is applied to a homeowner’s property tax bill before the 1% cap is applied. Thus, for homes with a property tax liability
above 1% of gross assessed value, this subsidy now provides no net additional tax relief. The protection previously provided by the Local Homestead
Credit is now overwhelmed by the relief provided by the Property Tax Circuit Breaker Credit.
What this policy change means for the Consolidated City is about an $8 million increase in net revenue. By eliminating this property tax subsidy, our
share of the local income tax distributions will increase by over $11 million, while our property tax revenue will drop by about $3 million. This drop in
property tax revenue is a direct result of withdrawing the income tax-funded subsidy from the property tax distributions to taxing units.
As further evidence that this property tax subsidy has lost is relevance, the State provided a similar subsidy to homeowners statewide (i.e. the State
Homestead Credit) through 2010. It has since eliminated that subsidy for the same reasons we are now proposing the elimination of the Local
Homestead Credit.

SPECIFIC BUDGET ELEMENTS
General Funds vs Dedicated Funds
The fund structure for municipal government is exceedingly complex. There are many, many distinct funds which comprise the overall fiscal structure
of the Consolidated City. In the face of this complexity, some simplifying assumptions are helpful to bring order and context to the fund inventory that
can appear overwhelming at first glance.

5

Most of the operating budget for the Consolidated City is funded by general tax revenue, both property tax and income tax. General funds are funds
which receive a substantial share of their revenue from taxes that have very broad flexibility.
Dedicated funds, on the other hand, are funds which receive revenue from taxes or non-tax sources that have very restricted legal uses. A more detailes
description of the fund structure of municipal government is provided elsewhere in the report.
100% Base Budget
For the general fund supported County agencies and City departments, the 2013 introduced budget seeks to set funding at the proper level to fully
support current operations (i.e. a 100% base budget). This means that adjustments were made to the budget of each agency and department to: a) close
known gaps between 2012 budgeted appropriations and current operations, with a particular focus on public safety and criminal justice; and b) to fund
rising fixed and semi-fixed costs (e.g. pension contributions; health insurance; rent; internal service charges; multi-year contracts; fuel; etc). In total,
the budgets for general tax-supported agency and department were increased by $27 million (4.7%).
Key features of the proposed budget for public safety and criminal justice are:
 Sheriff’s general operating budget increased $7.6 million (8.4%) to close gaps in funding for their salaries and benefits, Jail II operating contract,
and arrestee medical costs;
 IMPD general operating budget increased $9.8 million (5.5%) to close gaps in funding for rent, utilities, fuel/vehicle maintenance, and equipment
replacement;
 IFD general operating budget increased $3.9 million (2.9%) to close gaps in funding for salaries and benefits;
 funding for inmate and arrestee medical care and guardian ad litem services consolidated into separate funds to highlight their significance and
isolate these expenses from the normal operating costs of the Sheriff and Superior Courts; and
 the $2 million Crime Prevention Grant program will be continued.
Additional key features of the proposed budget for other general government functions are:
 reduced Election Board budget by $2.6 million to reflect that 2013 in a non-election year;
 increased Information Services Agency (ISA) internal charges by 16% to bring them into proper alignment with actual ISA costs (charges up by
$4.1 million while ISA budget is essentially flat);
 continued capital investment in park grounds and facilities to further enhance these key public assets; and
 the $1 million grant to the Indianapolis Arts Council will be continued.
Dedicated Fund Departments
There are four (4) City departments whose operations are funded completely or substantially from dedicated funds. The largest of these is the
Department of Public Works (DPW). The others are: Department of Metropolitan Development (DMD); Department of Code Enforcement (DCE); and
the Public Safety Communications (PSC) division within the Department of Public Safety (DPS). Because these departments don’t receive any flexible

6

income tax revenue, their budgets have not been directly impacted the sharp downturn in income tax revenue since 2010. However, they each face
other types of revenue challenges.
In this introduced budget, DPW’s ability to deliver high quality snow and ice removal services this winter and necessary street and walkway repairs
next spring remains intact. Work will also continue, in earnest, on flood control improvements across the city in 2013. DPW’s road and street
maintenance operation are heavily dependent on motor fuel tax and vehicle license fee revenue shared by the State. Both the economic downturn and
structural changes in the demand for motor fuel have caused this key revenue source to wane over the past decade. Thus, DPW must continue to strive
for savings and service level improvements in response to the weakness in this revenue stream. Fortunately, the RebuildIndy Fund has taken some
pressure off of DPW’s traditional dedicated transportation revenues. However, when the RebuildIndy Fund is exhausted, now projected for early in
2014, the pressure on DPW’s dedicated transportation revenues will return.
DMD is funded largely from federal grants and legally restricted tax and fee revenue. Though shielded from the sharp decline in local income tax,
DMD has suffered from a similarly dramatic tightening of federal grant funds, as the weak national economy and serious federal deficit concerns has
slowed the spigot of federal-aid support for local planning and economic development efforts. In response, the 2013 introduced budget includes a $1.5
million transfer from the City General Fund to maintain DMD at its current service level.
DCE will continue to operate at the level their dedicated, non-fungible revenues support. DCE charges fees only to those who use its service, freeing all
taxpayers of the burden of funding this department; so, its funding level depends more on the effectiveness of its operations than on the general tax
revenue climate of local government.
From a funding perspective, the PSC division is the most unique of the dedicated fund supported City departments. It does, in fact, receive a substantial
share of its revenue from the 1% COIT. However, because the method for allocating COIT revenue to PSC is uniquely prescribed by State law, this
income tax revenue has legal characteristics more like a dedicated funding source than a flexible, general funding source. Allocations of COIT revenue
to PSC come “off-the-top” before the remaining balance is distributed to all other eligible governmental units in Marion County. Thus, the “off-thetop” COIT monies allocated to PSC cannot be shifted to other uses within the operating budget of the Consolidated City.
Because the PSC division is so dependent on local income tax revenue, its funding has suffered as a result of the sharp downturn in local income tax
distributions to Marion County since 2010. The 2013 introduced budget seeks to restore PSC funding to a more appropriate level. To accomplish this,
the 2013 “off-the-top” allocation was increased by 11% (nearly $1 million). This will enable the PSC division to proceed with initiatives to replace an
aging computer-aided dispatch (CAD) system and upgrade the Emergency 911 telephone system
Support for the Indianapolis/Marion County Public Library
Finally, the matter of funding for the Indianapolis/Marion County Public Library (IMCPL) has also been a growing concern over the past few years.
During the 2011 session of the Indiana General Assembly, municipal finance laws governing Marion County were changed to allow a portion of the
COIT revenue to be allocated to the IMCPL. The fact that local income tax revenue is currently stagnant makes the idea of adding new uses for these
scarce funds less appealing fiscally; however, with an eye on the long haul, adding the library to the COIT allocation formula is the right policy.

7

In 2012, for the first time ever, the IMCPL was granted an “off-the-top” COIT allocation equal to 1/10% of the county total. This same policy is
continued in the 2013 introduced budget, providing IMCPL with $169,016.

THE BUDGET PROCESS
Budget planning in a large, complex organization is an iterative and collaborative process that involves the cooperation of every department and
agency. All must work together, under the general guidelines set by the Office of Finance and Management (OFM), to prepare a budget to introduce to
the City-County Council for revisions and eventual adoption.
OFM issued the “2013 Budget Policy and Submission Instructions” on June 4, specifying July 11 as the deadline for initial budget request submissions.
These instructions went out to the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of every department and agency, establishing the guidelines and restrictions every
department must follow when producing their initial 2013 budget request.
As referenced earlier, OFM’s baseline guidance for 2013 agency budget requests was to maintain funding at a 100% base budget level. Again, this
meant setting funding for 2013 at the level needed to support all current operations as they were being executed in 2012. Thus, step one of the 2013
budget request process was for each department and agency to build an initial budget request at their 2012 adopted budget level. From there, OFM was
to work with each CFO and address funding gaps before determining OFM’s introduced budget target for each department and agency. The official
submission date for the 2013 Introduced Budget is August 13 (the first full council meeting in August preceding the September 1 deadline for
introduction of an annual municipal budget ordinance as set by State law).
The 2013 budget process for the Consolidated City was unusual for some unique operational reasons. This was the first year using a new budget
development software, Hyperion, chosen for its compatibility with the new PeopleSoft financial management system installed in January 2012. While
the enhanced functionality of the new budgeting software will pay dividends to department/agency CFOs and policymakers going forward, there were
some unfortunate implementation problems that disrupted the 2013 budget development cycle.
As the July 11 initial budget submission deadline due near, a major hardware disruption occurred, preventing CFOs from accessing the Hyperion
system for all or part of six days (July 10 – 15). In response, OFM extended the initial budget submission deadline to July 25. Then, as many CFOs
were still working to complete their submission, a major software disruption impaired access from July 27 – July 31. All department and agency initial
budget submissions were not finished until August 6, leaving OFM just one week to compile the introduced budget ordinance for submission to the
City-County Council.
To put this time squeeze in context, OFM generally has at least three weeks to compile the introduced budget ordinance. With the unplanned time
squeeze, the final iteration of budget information exchange between OFM and the department/agency CFOs had to be sacrificed to meet the August 13
deadline. Thus, more budget adjustments and corrections than typical will be needed during the Council committee review process that follows budget
introduction.
Currently, final adoption of the 2013 budget is scheduled for the full Council meeting on October 15, 2012. Any budget issues lingering from the
earlier disruption of the introduced budget preparation process will have been resolved. With these implementation problems now behind us, all

8

indications are that the new Hyperion budget system will yield tremendous benefits in the future, both in depth and detail of budget analysis and
flexibility of budget data reporting.

LOOKING FORWARD
Despite challenging financial times, the 2013 introduced budget for the Consolidated City once again sets forth a responsible plan by which agencies
can continue serving all citizens of Marion County, making Indianapolis a safe, livable city now and for decades to come. With a sharp $20 million
rebound in local income tax revenues for the Consolidated City anticipated in 2014, positioning the Indianapolis for continued success from that point
forward was paramount to the budget decisions made in 2013.
Based on the introduced budget, summarized in this report, the budget gap entering the 2014 budget cycle will potentially total $20 - $30 million. This
estimate recognizes that: a) a portion of the $65 million gap for 2013 is closed with the spend down of reserves; b) fixed and semi-fixed costs continue
to rise; and c) tax revenue growth will likely remain stagnant (aside from the unique $20 million income tax uptick in 2014).
To bridge this gap, it is imperative that we maintain some reserves and continue to find meaningful operational savings. To that end, this introduced
budget maintains a $13 million balance in the Rainy Day Fund at the end of 2013. Also, Mayor Ballad has tasked the Office of Audit & Performance
(OAP) to identify at least $15 million in savings from elimination of non-value added redundancies remaining across the operations of all departments
and agencies of the Consolidated City. For example, the Sheriff and the IMPD now engage separate vendors for psychological testing of deputies and
officers. Also, the Sheriff, Superior Courts, and County Prosecutor are exempted from working through the central Human Resources Division of the
Consolidated City.
Such work is the official charge of OAP by virtue of is authorizing code cite. Delivering on this savings goal will require the cooperation of all City
departments and County agencies, and is critical to managing the finances of the Consolidated City until a return of broad based economic growth starts
helping the local tax base recover.

Funds
The Indiana State Board of Accounts (SBOA) defines “fund” to
mean “cash or a group of accounts set aside for the purpose of
accounting for monies or other resources of general functions or
specific activities . . . in accordance with the system of accounts
prescribed by the State Board of Accounts or as required by statute”
(State Board of Accounts, Accounting and Uniform Compliance
Guidelines Manual for Cities and Towns, State of Indiana, reissued
2006).
Funds that the SBOA prescribes for use by cities include but are not
limited to, general funds, special revenue funds, debt services funds,
capital projects funds, internal service funds, and agency funds.
Funds included in the 2013 Introduced Budget represent those that
require appropriation by the City-County Council. Appropriation is
the authorization of the City-County Council by ordinance to make
disbursements or to incur obligations for specific purposes.
General Funds
General funds are funds which receive a substantial share of their
revenue from taxes that have very broad flexibility. For example, the
1% County Option Income Tax (COIT) distributions and the County
General Fund property tax levy may legally be used to fund any
governmental purpose.
The core general operating funds for the Consolidated City are:
County General Fund; Consolidated County General Fund (aka City
General Fund); Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department
(IMPD) General Fund; Indianapolis Fire Department (IFD) General
Fund; and Parks General Fund. Additionally, in 2013, there are six

(6) other funds that are also defined as general operating funds. They
are: Public Safety Income Tax Fund – County; Public Safety Income
Tax Fund – City; Personal Services Contingency Fund – County;
Personal Services Contingency Fund – City; Guardian Ad Litem
Fund; and Medical Care for Inmates Fund. What all of these funds
have in common is that they each will each receive a substantial
amount of flexible tax revenue in 2013. Thus, there is the ability to
reallocate the flexible revenue flowing to these funds across many
competing operational needs.
Dedicated Funds
Dedicated funds, on the other hand, are funds which receive revenue
from taxes or non-tax sources that have very restricted legal uses. A
more apt of a dedicated fund description is a fund that receives little
or no revenue from flexible tax revenue sources. Some examples are
the Parking Meter Fund and the Permits Fund. These are both
dedicated funds because their revenue sources have strictly limited
legal uses.
The Consolidated City also uses dedicated funds to account for the
proceeds of specific revenue sources (e.g., special revenue funds)
and/or for expenditures restricted to a specific purpose (e.g. debt
service funds; enterprise funds). Debt service funds (aka sinking
funds) are used to account for the accumulation of revenue for the
payment of long-term debt principal and interest.
Grant Funds
Finally, the Consolidated City also employs grant funds to collect
revenues and track expenditures for grant monies received from
other units of government.

Revenues
State law requires adoption of a balanced budget, which shall include
all anticipated revenues and expenses of every organizational unit
(with the exception of utilities). As such, all appropriations adopted
by the City-County Council must be fully supported by (1) revenue
that is legally eligible to support proposed expenses, and/or (2) fund
balance (essentially prior year, unencumbered revenue) that is legally
eligible to support the proposed expense.

The Consolidated City relies primarily on property and income taxes
to fund its operations. However, a significant amount of revenue
derives from Fees and Charges as well as from Federal and State
Grants. The following pages provide more detailed information
about property tax rates, levies and districts as well as the various
types of income taxes, tax rates as well as the available uses of such
funds.

Property Tax
Citizens of the Consolidated City are subject to several overlapping
property tax districts which levy taxes for city and county general
purpose funds, as well as specific services. Taxpayer residing in
overlapping districts would be subject to the tax rates of each
applicable district.
Certified Levy (Gross Levy)
The total property tax levy for a taxing unit before the property tax
cap is considered. Referred to as “certified” because it is approved
by the State Department of Local Government Finance (DLGF).
DLGF approval is required to ensure that the levy amount is within
maximum levy limitations set by State law.
Net Levy
The expected property tax levy after deducting the property tax
circuit breaker credits attributable to the property tax caps.
Gross Assessed Value
The assessed value of a property before applying any eligible
property tax deductions or abatements (which lower the property’s
taxable assessed value). The property tax caps are set based on each
parcel’s gross assessed value.

Property Tax Cap (aka Circuit Breaker)
The property tax cap, also known as the “circuit breaker,” was
enacted by the Indiana General Assembly in 2008 and subsequently
amended into the Indiana Constitution. The cap guarantees that
property tax rates in overlapping districts cannot exceed a certain
capped percent of the parcel’s gross assessed value. The “circuit
breaker” amount represents property tax liability waived because it is
above the level allowed under the property tax caps. The property
tax caps are as follows:
1% - for Homestead property
2% - for other residential property and agricultural land
3% - for commercial and industrial property
Taxing Districts & Rates
The following pages show the taxing districts along with the Net
Assessed Values (NAV) of taxable property within those districts for
2013. The Tax Rate for a district is determined by the following
formula:

Net Assessed Value (Taxable Assessed Value)
The taxable value of property after all eligible property tax
deductions and abatements are applied.

Income Tax
State law allows Indiana counties impose a local income tax on the
State adjusted gross income of county taxpayers.
Also, counties may choose between several income tax options and
combinations. Each type of local income tax option is regulated by
specific rules and rate restrictions. Residents of Marion County are
subject to three interrelated income taxes in the form of the County
Option Income Tax (COIT), the Levy Freeze Local Option Income
Tax (LOIT), and the Public Safety Income Tax (PST).
This local income tax is collected by the State Department of
Revenue then distributed to counties based on the amount due to
each county on State income tax returns processed.
County Income Tax Council (CITC)
Local income tax is imposed or modified in a county by the action of
the CITC. In Marion County, the CITC is composed of the CityCounty Council and the fiscal body of each city or town that lies
either partially or entirely within the county. The other members of
the CITC are the Lawrence City Council, the Beech Grove City
Council, the Southport City Council, and the Speedway Town
Council.

County Option Income Tax (COIT)
Current Rate: 1.00% Maximum Rate: 1.00%

COIT revenue may be used for any lawful purpose of the
governmental unit.
Levy Freeze Local Option Income Tax (LOIT)
Current Rate: 0.27% Maximum Rate: 1.00%

An additional income tax rate may be imposed to generate revenue to
replace property tax levy growth. Thus, imposing this tax reflects a
policy choice to shift fiscal reliance from property tax to income tax,
not an overall tax increase.
Once imposed, this rate may neither be rescinded nor decreased.
Each year the CITC must hold at least one public meeting to discuss
whether or not Levy Freeze LOIT rate should be increased.
Public Safety Income Tax (PST)
Current Rate: 0.35% Maximum Rate: 0.50%

Because Marion County has imposed a Levy Freeze LOIT rate, State
law allows adoption of a PST rate. PST revenues may be used for
police and fire, including pensions, emergency services,
communications systems, jails and related facilities, and other items
related to public safety.

Voting representation on the CITC is based on each member unit’s
share of the total county population. In Marion County, the CityCounty Council holds over 90% of the voting representation on the
CITC.

Expenditures
Expenditure Categories (Characters)
In addition to the restrictions imposed by agencies/departments
regarding funding sources, agency spending is further restricted by
limiting the total funds available to support various spending
categories or “characters”. The Consolidated City employs five
separate characters to segregate spending. Each is described as
follows:

Properties and Equipment (Character 4)
This category includes expenditures for the acquisition of, or
addition to assets such as land, infrastructure, buildings,
improvements other than buildings, as well as machinery and
equipment.

Internal Charges (Character 5)
Personal Services (Character 1)
This category includes expenditures for salaries, wages and related
employee benefits provided for all Consolidated City employees.
Employee benefits include employer contributions to group health
and life insurance, pension benefits, unemployment compensation,
uniform allowance and similar benefits.

This category includes internal charges such as expenditures for
Information Services Agency, the Mayor’s Action Center, the Office
of Corporation Council and Fleet Services.
If a department has a negative appropriation for Character 5, it
means that department is a provider of internal services and a net
recipient of internal charges.

Materials and Supplies (Character 2)
This category includes articles and commodities that are consumed
or materially altered when used. Supplies include office supplies,
operating supplies, repair and maintenance supplies and other similar
items.

Other Services and Charges (Character 3)

This category exists for only City departments. Similar expenditures
from county agencies are reported as Character 3 instead. Since the
Information Services Agency (ISA) is a County agency, their
charges are not administered through Character 5. Both City
departments and County agencies pay ISA charges through
Character 3.

This category includes expenditures for services other than personal
services required by the Consolidated City either to carry out its
assigned functions or to fulfill moral or legal obligations. Other
Services and Charges includes professional services, communication
and transportation, printing and advertising, insurance (excluding
group health, life and self-insurance), utility expenditures, contracted
repairs and maintenance, rentals, debt service expenditures for
principal and interest payments as well as long-term debt.

Agency Budget Summaries
The Agency Budget Summaries section:
1) provides an operational overview of each of the county agencies
and city departments;
2) details the funding sources that will fund each
agency/department; and
3) outlines how those agencies/departments intend to spend those
funds by expenditure category or “character”.

Sources
The “Sources” listed for each agency/department budget represents
either a single or a collection of funding sources available to an
agency/department (See the Funds section for further explanation).

Expenditures
Agencies and departments are restricted in how they can use the
funds available to them. The Consolidated City employs five
separate expenditure “Characters” to categorize these uses (See the
Expenditures section for explanation of these characters).

Final vs. Adopted vs. Introduced
For the purpose of comparison, each summary shows recent
historical data for agency/department budgets. The following
explains the terminology used in these comparisons.
Budget Introduced shows the amounts budgeted for each
agency/department as determined by agency/department finance
officers and the Office of Finance and Management. This is the
budget introduced by the Mayor to the City-County Council for
amendment and eventual adoption.
Budget Adopted shows the amounts budgeted for each
agency/department as adopted by the City-County Council in
October of the preceding fiscal year.

DPS ADMINISTRATION
Introduction
The City of Indianapolis Department of Public Safety (DPS) will remain a
national model leveraging the unique strengths of the Police, Fire,
Homeland Security, Animal Care and Control, and Communications

Divisions as an integrated department. DPS will deliver the highest quality
of public safety services in a fiscally effective manner to secure the Greater
Indianapolis area by preventing, preparing for, responding to, and
recovering from routine emergencies and large-scales incidents. The
Administration unit of DPS provides coordination and leadership for the
agencies within DPS.

Structure
The Department of Public Safety comprises five integrated divisions as well
as the Citizens Police Complaint Office (CPCO). The Indianapolis
Metropolitan Police Department, Indianapolis Fire Department, Division of
Homeland Security, Animal Care and Control, and Public Safety
Communications operate within one department and share resources in
innovative ways. This structure increases operational effectiveness by
leveraging the strengths of each division to provide public safety services to
the City of Indianapolis/Marion County. Each of the divisions has their
own operational goals and unique personalities.

The Department of Public Safety was created by Section 251 of the revised
municipal code. CPCO, independent of the Indianapolis Metropolitan
Police Department, was created by city ordinance. The CPCO affords
citizens of the Consolidated City of Indianapolis Marion County who
believe they have been treated improperly by an IMPD officer the
opportunity to have his or her complaint(s) both heard and investigated.

HOMELAND SECURITY
Introduction
The Division leads an integrated Department of Public Safety effort to
secure, prevent, prepare, respond and ensure resiliency from natural or
human-made threats and hazards to the city, and to sustain a confident
public.

The Division is also responsible for preparing plans and managing the
safety and security of special events when anticipated requirements exceed
the capability of the concerned geographic area.
The Division of Homeland Security was created by Section 251 of the
revised Municipal Code.

Structure
The Division was formed to unify divisions within the Department of Public
Safety to create the capacity to deal with terrorist attacks, major disasters,
planning and managing special events, and other emergencies. By
embracing a single set of guiding principles, from the Director of Public
Safety to the frontline employee, we have created a single division working
to secure the City of Indianapolis/Marion County.

The Division does not operate in a vacuum. Other Federal, State, and local
institutions participate actively in the Division’s efforts to disrupt terrorist
activities, pre-planning and managing special events, and in the preparation
for and response to major disasters, as do our private and non-profit sectors
and international partners. We will continue to work cooperatively to ensure
that all of the instruments of local power – including leadership, specialized
technical expertise, research, and development investments – are brought to
bear on the challenges we face in a coordinated and unified manner.

MARION COUNTY COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS
Vision and Mission Statements
Vision
To provide the citizens of Marion County a safer community.

Mission
To enhance public safety by raising offender accountability through the use
of evidence based practices and interventions.

Structure
Home Detention
The electronic equipment used for client monitoring includes active radio
frequency for typical home detention clients as well as global positioning
satellite equipment for high risk offenders, including domestic violence
offenders who are on home detention. Community Corrections also offers
electronic alcohol monitoring equipment. Offenders may be placed on any
combination of Home Detention, GPS, and Alcohol Monitoring. All
offenders under supervision have a variety of programming available.
Community Corrections utilizes the Indiana Risk Assessment System
(IRAS) to assess the risk of reoffending and services needed for all clients
under supervision. Based on overall risk score and identified criminogenic
needs, clients may be placed into the following evidence based programs
presented by trained facilitators: Parenting, Anger Management, Thinking
For a Change, Substance Abuse Treatment, as well as Job Readiness
workshops and GED/ABE. Mental health programming is also available
for those mentally ill offenders who might otherwise have been incarcerated
at the local or the state levels. MCCC has an Addictions Intervention
Component which focuses on addictions issues.

Work Release
In October 2007, the agency opened the Duvall Residential Center which
provides services for male work release offenders and has capacity for up to
350 persons. All residents of Duvall are eligible for the same programming
opportunities as electronic monitoring offenders.
Through contracts with service providers, we are able to serve offenders at
3 other locations. Volunteers of America (VOA) currently provides a total
of 90 beds for male offenders split among General Population, Community
Transition Program, and the Mental Health Component at Brandon Hall.
VOA also operates the Theodora House, which is a residential facility for
60 female offenders. In addition, the Craine House provides the
opportunity for 4 women with pre-school aged children to serve their
sentence in the community while living with their children.

contracts to ensure the participation goals are being met.

Budget change
Prior to the DMWBD budget being moved to the Mayor budget, we had
$8,000 in character 300 to be used for consulting services.
Now that our budget is no longer a part of the Mayor’s budget, we need the
$8,000 back so we can continue to focus on contract compliance, and work
force development.

government expenses based on the value of the property owned. The
County Assessor is responsible for determining the fair market value of
each property in the county. In addition, the County Assessor processes

inheritance tax returns and determines whether taxpayers are entitled to
charitable and non-profit property tax exemptions. Any time a taxpayer
wishes to appeal an assessment decision, the appeal goes through the
Property Tax Assessment Board of Appeals (PTABOA) hearing process
administered by the County Assessor.

staffs, and valuation experts to perform all phases of the assessment process

taxpayers' reports on business personal property. The division has four
satellite offices offering taxpayers a convenient place to obtain residential
assessment information and services.

amounts of data needed for both efficient and modern assessment results. It
also creates satellite-coordinated mapping and connects assessment data to
each property geographically. Moreover, the division manages ownership
changes and records as well as maps changes in the property sizes. The
division is responsible for the sales disclosure process which collects,
reviews, and validates all property sales in the county. Finally, the division
organizes this enormous quantity of data into reports and statistics, which is
useful to the Assessment Division and to other government agencies, and is

MARION COUNTY SURVEYOR
Introduction
Marion County Surveyor's Office was established by the Indiana
Constitution in 1851. General Land Office surveys in what is now Marion
County began in 1819. Marion County is part of the rectangular survey
system (Public Land System), which divides the land into sections that are
one square mile. All real estate boundaries in Marion County can be traced
back to the Public Land System. Statute law requires the Surveyor to

recheck at least five percent of the section corners each year, there are over
2000 corners. The Marion County Surveyor’s Office maintains a Legal
Survey Record Book and a Corner Record Book. No fee is charged for
surveying services provided to any city, county and other governmental
agencies.

Structure
Surveying
In the field, the staff performs the precise measurements of Section Corners
and ties, per Indiana Code and replacing said monuments as necessary. We
monitor the Eagle Creek Dam for horizontal and vertical movement as well
as performing vital research within the office.
Information Technology
Information Technology supports the needs of the Surveyor’s Office. This
area compiles the data surveyors collect in the field by use of AutoCAD and
GIS software. Further, that data along with both the corner history and
drawing (which this department provides) is posted onto the county’s
website. We collect and quality check all measurements to ensure accurate,
reliable information is provided.

Preservation
Preservation is as much a part of the surveyor’s office as surveying and
technology. We believe in the importance of preserving our past for the
future generations. Understanding the necessity of creating legible
electronic copies of the records, maps, surveys and plats housed in the
surveyor’s office to ensure that they will be easily accessible for years to
come. By concentrating on this now we have been able to scan or have
scanned already deteriorating documents.

Having a greater reliance on new technology has helped the Surveyor’s
office to build a solid fiscal commitment to provide government and private
sector agencies and companies timely, accurate and useful information,
while helping us and these agencies and companies save taxpayers money
and time. Finally, these advancements in technology have enabled us to
fulfill our legal obligation for the completion of the Alcohol & Tobacco
Commission’s Verification of Business Location forms.

Debt Service
The Consolidated City carries different types of debt associated with
various programs and services. This debt takes on two forms: (1)
general obligation debt, which is supported by a pledge of the full
faith and credit of the Consolidated City and is usually funded by tax
revenue, and (2) special revenue debt, which is supported by a
pledge of a specific revenue stream.

Special Revenue Debt
Special revenue debt is mostly associated with Tax Increment
Financing (TIF) districts throughout Marion County. This debt is
supported through property tax increment capture. This financing
tool is used to develop and grow various communities and
neighborhoods that otherwise would have little growth potential.

Generally, the revenue stream pledged for special revenue debt is a
fee or other non-tax revenue. In the case of debt funded by tax
increment financing (TIF), tax increment revenue captured is
segregated from the regular property tax revenue of the Consolidated
City.

TIF funds, including debt service for TIF bonds, are not appropriated
by the City-County Council. In Marion County, the Metropolitan
Development Commission (MDC) serves as the fiscal body for TIF
funds.

The Consolidated City of Indianapolis, Marion County takes pride
and care in maintaining its AAA (stable) credit rating for its general
obligation debt.
General Obligation Debt
Most of the Consolidated City’s general obligation debt is related to
transportation, parks, and emergency communications infrastructure.
Other general obligation debt is related to police and fire pension
costs as well as redevelopment efforts throughout the Consolidated
City.

Other special revenue debt includes economic development bonds
which are typically supported by a revenue stream generated by a
specific investment. An example would be a bond issued to finance a
parking garage with the parking fees pledged to paying the debt
service. Another example would be financing stormwater projects,
undertaken by the Consolidated City to address flood control
problems, with stormwater fees pledged to paying the debt service.
TIF debt service and other special revenue debt service is not
included in tables presented in this report, but is available separately.

Debt service payments for general obligation debt are typically
funded entirely, or in part, with tax revenue. Only tax-supported debt
service is included in tables presented in this report.

Funds
The Indiana State Board of Accounts (SBOA) defines “fund” to
mean “cash or a group of accounts set aside for the purpose of
accounting for monies or other resources of general functions or
specific activities . . . in accordance with the system of accounts
prescribed by the State Board of Accounts or as required by statute”
(State Board of Accounts, Accounting and Uniform Compliance
Guidelines Manual for Cities and Towns, State of Indiana, reissued
2006).

Fund; Parks General Fund; Public Safety Income Tax Fund –
County; Public Safety Income Tax Fund – City; Personal Services
Contingency Fund – County; Personal Services Contingency Fund –
City; Guardian Ad Litem Fund; and Medical Care for Inmates Fund.
What all of these funds have in common is that they each will each
receive a substantial amount of flexible tax revenue. Thus, there is
the ability to reallocate the flexible revenue flowing to these funds
across many competing operational needs.

Funds that the SBOA prescribes for use by cities include but are not
limited to, general funds, special revenue funds, debt services funds,
capital projects funds, internal service funds, and agency funds.
Funds included in the 2014 Adopted Budget represent those that
require appropriation by the City-County Council. Appropriation is
the authorization of the City-County Council by ordinance to make
disbursements or to incur obligations for specific purposes.

Dedicated Funds
Dedicated funds, on the other hand, are funds which receive revenue
from taxes or non-tax sources that have very restricted legal uses. A
more apt of a dedicated fund description is a fund that receives little
or no revenue from flexible tax revenue sources. Some examples are
the Parking Meter Fund and the Permits Fund. These are both
dedicated funds because their revenue sources have strictly limited
legal uses.

General Funds
General funds are funds which receive a substantial share of their
revenue from taxes that have very broad flexibility. For example, the
1% County Option Income Tax (COIT) distributions and the County
General Fund property tax levy may legally be used to fund any
governmental purpose.

The Consolidated City also uses dedicated funds to account for the
proceeds of specific revenue sources (e.g., special revenue funds)
and/or for expenditures restricted to a specific purpose (e.g. debt
service funds; enterprise funds). Debt service funds (aka sinking
funds) are used to account for the accumulation of revenue for the
payment of long-term debt principal and interest.

The core general operating funds for the Consolidated City are:
County General Fund; Consolidated County General Fund (aka City
General Fund); Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department
(IMPD) General Fund; Indianapolis Fire Department (IFD) General

Grant Funds
Finally, the Consolidated City also employs grant funds to collect
revenues and track expenditures for grant monies received from
other units of government.

This report excludes TIF debt service, TIF capital and other capital project funds. Those funds are not annually appropriated by the City-County Council.
Debt service funds for other special revenue (i.e. non-tax) bonds are also not included in this report.

Revenues
State law requires adoption of a balanced budget, which shall include
all anticipated revenues and expenses of every organizational unit
(with the exception of utilities). As such, all appropriations adopted
by the City-County Council must be fully supported by (1) revenue
that is legally eligible to support proposed expenses, and/or (2) fund
balance (essentially prior year, unencumbered revenue) that is legally
eligible to support the proposed expense.

The Consolidated City relies primarily on property and income taxes
to fund its operations. However, a significant amount of revenue is
derived from Fees and Charges as well as from Federal and State
Grants. The following pages provide more detailed information
about property tax rates, levies and districts as well as the various
types of income taxes, tax rates as well as the available uses of such
funds.

Note: All revenue reported based on year of actual collection or budgeted collection, except property tax revenue reported on certified tax year basis.

Property Tax
Citizens of the Consolidated City are subject to several overlapping
property tax districts which levy taxes for city and county general
purpose funds, as well as specific services. Taxpayers residing in
overlapping districts would be subject to the tax rates of each
applicable district.
Certified Levy (Gross Levy)
The total property tax levy for a taxing unit before the property tax
cap is considered. Referred to as “certified” because it is approved
by the State Department of Local Government Finance (DLGF).
DLGF approval is required to ensure that the levy amount is within
maximum levy limitations set by State law.
Net Levy
The expected property tax levy after deducting the property tax
circuit breaker credits attributable to the property tax caps.
Gross Assessed Value
The assessed value of a property before applying any eligible
property tax deductions or abatements (which lower the property’s
taxable assessed value). The property tax caps are set based on each
parcel’s gross assessed value.
Net Assessed Value (Taxable Assessed Value)
The taxable value of property after all eligible property tax
deductions and abatements are applied.

Property Tax Cap (aka Circuit Breaker)
The property tax cap, also known as the “circuit breaker,” was
enacted by the Indiana General Assembly in 2008 and subsequently
amended into the Indiana Constitution. The cap guarantees that
property tax rates in overlapping districts cannot exceed a certain
capped percent of the parcel’s gross assessed value. The “circuit
breaker” amount represents property tax liability waived because it is
above the level allowed under the property tax caps. The property
tax caps are as follows:
1% - for Homestead property
2% - for other residential property and agricultural land
3% - for commercial and industrial property
Taxing Districts & Rates
The following pages show the taxing districts along with the Net
Assessed Values (NAV) of taxable property within those districts for
pay year 2014. The Tax Rate for a district is determined by the
following formula:

Income Tax
State law allows Indiana counties to impose a local income tax on
the State adjusted gross income of county taxpayers.
Also, counties may choose between several income tax options and
combinations. Each type of local income tax option is regulated by
specific rules and rate restrictions. Residents of Marion County are
subject to three interrelated income taxes in the form of the County
Option Income Tax (COIT), the Levy Freeze Local Option Income
Tax (LOIT), and the Public Safety Income Tax (PST).
This local income tax is collected by the State Department of
Revenue then distributed to counties based on the amount due to
each county on State income tax returns processed.
County Income Tax Council (CITC)
Local income tax is imposed or modified in a county by the action of
the CITC. In Marion County, the CITC is composed of the CityCounty Council and the fiscal body of each city or town that lies
either partially or entirely within the county. The other members of
the CITC are the Lawrence City Council, the Beech Grove City
Council, the Southport City Council, and the Speedway Town
Council.
Voting representation on the CITC is based on each member unit’s
share of the total county population. In Marion County, the CityCounty Council holds over 90% of the voting representation on the
CITC.

County Option Income Tax (COIT)
Current Rate: 1.00% Maximum Rate: 1.00%

COIT revenue may be used for any lawful purpose of the
governmental unit.
Levy Freeze Local Option Income Tax (LOIT)
Current Rate: 0.27% Maximum Rate: 1.00%

An additional income tax rate may be imposed to generate revenue to
replace property tax levy growth. Thus, imposing this tax reflects a
policy choice to shift fiscal reliance from property tax to income tax,
not an overall tax increase.
Once imposed, this rate may neither be rescinded nor decreased.
Each year the CITC must hold at least one public meeting to discuss
whether or not Levy Freeze LOIT rate should be increased.
Public Safety Income Tax (PST)
Current Rate: 0.35% Maximum Rate: 0.50%

Because Marion County has imposed a Levy Freeze LOIT rate, State
law allows adoption of a PST rate. PST revenues may be used for
police and fire, including pensions, emergency services,
communications systems, jails and related facilities, and other items
related to public safety.

Expenditures
Expenditure Categories (Characters)
In addition to the restrictions imposed by agencies/departments
regarding funding sources, agency spending is further restricted by
limiting the total funds available to support various spending
categories or “characters”. The Consolidated City employs five
separate characters to segregate spending. Each is described as
follows:

Properties and Equipment (Character 4)
This category includes expenditures for the acquisition of, or
addition to assets such as land, infrastructure, buildings,
improvements other than buildings, as well as machinery and
equipment.

Internal Charges (Character 5)
Personal Services (Character 1)
This category includes expenditures for salaries, wages and related
employee benefits provided for all Consolidated City employees.
Employee benefits include employer contributions to group health
and life insurance, pension benefits, unemployment compensation,
uniform allowance and similar benefits.

This category includes internal charges such as expenditures for the
Mayor’s Action Center, the Office of Corporation Counsel and Fleet
Services.
If a department has a negative appropriation for Character 5, it
means that department is a provider of internal services and a net
recipient of internal charges.

Materials and Supplies (Character 2)
This category includes articles and commodities that are consumed
or materially altered when used. Supplies include office supplies,
operating supplies, repair and maintenance supplies and other similar
items.

Other Services and Charges (Character 3)
This category includes expenditures for services other than personal
services required by the Consolidated City either to carry out its
assigned functions or to fulfill moral or legal obligations. Other
Services and Charges includes professional services, communication
and transportation, printing and advertising, insurance (excluding
group health, life and self-insurance), utility expenditures, contracted
repairs and maintenance, rentals, debt service expenditures for
principal and interest payments as well as long-term debt.

This category exists for only City departments. Similar expenditures
from county agencies are reported as Character 3 instead. Since the
Information Services Agency (ISA) is a County agency, their
charges are not administered through Character 5. Both City
departments and County agencies pay ISA charges through
Character 3.

The Agency Budget Summaries section:
1) provides an operational overview of each of the county agencies
and city departments;
2) details the funding sources that will fund each
agency/department; and
3) outlines how those agencies/departments intend to spend those
funds by expenditure category or “character”.

Final vs. Revised vs. Introduced vs. Adopted
For the purpose of comparison, each summary shows recent
historical data for agency/department budgets. The following
explains the terminology used in these comparisons.
Budget Adopted shows the amounts budgeted for each
agency/department as adopted by the City-County Council in
October of the preceding fiscal year.

Sources
The “Sources” listed for each agency/department budget represents
either a single or a collection of funding sources available to an
agency/department (See the Funds section for further explanation).

Expenditures

Budget Introduced shows the amounts budgeted for each
agency/department as determined by agency/department finance
officers and the Office of Finance and Management. This is the
budget introduced by the Mayor to the City-County Council for
amendment and eventual adoption.

Agencies and departments are restricted in how they can use the
funds available to them. The Consolidated City employs five
separate expenditure “Characters” to categorize these uses (See the
Expenditures section for explanation of these characters).

Budget Revised shows the budget as amended through fiscal
ordinances approved by the City-County Council throughout the
fiscal year
Actual Final shows the final expenditures and encumbrances for

DPS ADMINISTRATION
Introduction
The City of Indianapolis Department of Public Safety (DPS) will remain a national model leveraging the unique strengths of the Police, Fire, Homeland Security,
Animal Care and Control, and Communications Divisions as an integrated department. DPS will deliver the highest quality of public safety services in a fiscally
effective manner to secure the Greater Indianapolis area by preventing, preparing for, responding to, and recovering from routine emergencies and large-scales
incidents. The Administration unit of DPS provides coordination and leadership for the agencies within DPS.
.
Structure
The Department of Public Safety comprises five integrated divisions as well as the Citizens Police Complaint Office (CPCO) and the Mayor’s Office of Re-Entry.
The Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department, Indianapolis Fire Department, Division of Homeland Security, Animal Care and Control, and Public Safety
Communications operate within one department and share resources in innovative ways. This structure increases operational effectiveness by leveraging the
strengths of each division to provide public safety services to the City of Indianapolis/Marion County. Each of the divisions has their own operational goals and
unique personalities. The Department of Public Safety was created by Section 251 of the revised municipal code. CPCO, independent of the Indianapolis
Metropolitan Police Department, was created by city ordinance. The CPCO affords citizens of the Consolidated City of Indianapolis Marion County who believe
they have been treated improperly by an IMPD officer the opportunity to have his or her complaint(s) both heard and investigated. Mayor Gregory Ballard
established the Office of Re-Entry to develop collaborative partnerships among government, businesses, faith-based organizations, and community members to
leverage resources, to ensure sustainability by enhancing crime prevention strategies, and evaluating outcomes based on data collection and quality of life
enhancement, for ex-offenders and the community.

DIVISION OF HOMELAND SECURITY
Introduction
The Division leads an integrated Department of Public Safety effort to secure, prevent, prepare, respond, investigate, and ensure resiliency from natural or humanmade threats and hazards to the city, and to sustain a confident public. The Division is also responsible for preparing plans and managing the safety and security of
special events when anticipated requirements exceed the capability of the concerned geographic area. The Division of Homeland Security was created by Section
251 of the revised Municipal Code.
Structure
The Division was formed to unify divisions within the Department of Public Safety to create the capacity to deal with terrorist attacks, major disasters, planning and
managing special events, and other emergencies. By embracing a single set of guiding principles, from the Director of Public Safety to the frontline employee, we
have created a single division working to secure the City of Indianapolis/Marion County.
The Division does not operate in a vacuum. Other Federal, State, and local institutions participate actively in the Division’s efforts to work within the intelligence
community, investigate, disrupt terrorist activities, pre-planning and managing special events, and in the preparation for and response to major disasters, as do our
private and non-profit sectors and international partners. We will continue to work cooperatively to ensure that all of the instruments of local power – including
leadership, specialized technical expertise, research, and development investments – are brought to bear on the challenges we face in a coordinated and unified
manner.

MARION COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT
Introduction
The Marion County Superior Court comprises 36 elected judges, 39 commissioners and magistrates, and over 690 staff employees. The Court is structured into 4
divisions - Civil, Criminal, Juvenile, and Probate. In addition, there are a number of departments within the Court, including Probation, Jury Pool, Juvenile
Detention Center, Information Technology, and Family Court.
The Court is structured internally with an Executive Committee consisting of four judges elected by all Superior Court judges for terms of two (2) years. The
Executive Committee oversees the general policy and management of the Court. The Criminal and Civil Terms select a Chair from within their respective judicial
members and each department/division has a Supervising Judge appointed by the Executive Committee
Structure
Court Division
The 36 courts of the Court Division handle more than 50,000 civil cases and
more than 40,000 criminal cases each year. Some courts are specialty and/or
problem solving courts such as domestic violence, drug, mental health,
community, environmental, and traffic. The Traffic Division in particular
handles over 120,000 cases each year. In addition, the courts manage
programs such as re-entry and community work crews.
Probation Department
The Probation Department comprises two divisions: adult and juvenile. Its
mission is to enhance community safety by enforcing court orders while
striving to change lives. Probation assists in relieving jail bed concerns
through both pre-trial and probation services. The Juvenile Division continues
to implement strategies endorsed by the Juvenile Detention Alternative
Initiative which has resulted in a substantial reduction in the number of
juveniles being detained in the Juvenile Detention Center.

Administrative Division
The Administrative Division manages and supports the overall operation of
the Courts including human resources, finance, payroll, facilities
management, procurement, information technology, fleet, and staff training.
Juvenile Detention Division
The Marion County Juvenile Detention Center (MCJDC) is a maximum
security holding facility for detained youth. The MCJDC maintains youth,
ages 11-18 years, in a safe and secure environment while allowing continuity
of services. Each youth detained within the MCJDC will attend school,
participate in mental health and basic health exercises, and increase healthy
social skill-building processes. The Marion Superior Court is committed to
providing a safe and secure Juvenile Detention Center while providing
practical, effective, and high-quality living and learning services to youth
within the MCJDC.

MARION COUNTY PROSECUTOR
Introduction
The Marion County Prosecutor’s Office seeks to place public safety as the number one priority and responsibility of government. We are dedicated to holding
criminals accountable for their actions, preserving the rights of victims and continually seeking justice, all while maintaining the highest of ethical standards.
Structure
Criminal Charging Division
Police agencies present cases to this division for criminal charging
determinations. Deputy prosecutors determine what charges are to be filed in
each case, or if additional investigation is necessary.

Special Victims Team
This area of the office includes cases involving sex crimes and domestic
violence. It also handles cases of child abuse and leads the office’s efforts
and collaboration with the Julian Center.

Major Case Division
The Major Case Division handles major felony cases, including homicides.
Victim Advocates are assigned to each of these courts to ensure that victims
are notified of actions taken by the court and that they receive guidance and
support throughout the criminal justice process. Within the Major Case
Division, a Special Crimes Team includes prosecutors dedicated to human
trafficking, arson and unemployment insurance fraud.

Community Prosecution Division
Community prosecutors are assigned to the police districts and special areas.
These prosecutors work closely with district commanders and detectives to
develop strategies to protect and defend the communities served by the
respective police districts. Community prosecutors also encourage
community participation in public safety and crime prevention, engaging
residents in problem solving and establishing and maintaining partnerships.

Grand Jury Division
For cases involving white collar crime, public corruption, tax evasion and
other long term investigations, the Prosecutor has a staff of investigators and
lawyers dedicated to the collection of evidence and prosecution of these
cases. If criminal activity is suspected, the evidence is presented to a Grand
Jury composed of six citizens of Marion County who are presented with the
evidence and determine if criminal charges are filed. Currently, investigators
assigned to the Grand Jury Division represent detectives from the
Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department, Marion County Sheriff’s
Department, and Indiana State Police.

Juvenile Division
This division is responsible for filing and prosecuting acts of delinquency by
children 17 years of age and younger, including truancy cases. In certain
cases, more serious crimes can be directly filed to the adult criminal courts.

Strike Team
This division is responsible for three (3) areas of crime – drugs, guns and
gangs. Vigorous prosecution of these crimes is essential to the safety of the
community. The Strike Team partners with various police departments
throughout the county to assist in investigations, arrests, charging decisions
and the presentation of the case to the court.

Correction Division
This division responds to all requests for post-conviction relief and for
sentence modifications. This division also handles all requests for
expungement of arrests and convictions and the sealing of criminal records.

D-Felony/Misdemeanor Division
This division handles the prosecution of misdemeanor and Class D Felony
criminal cases. Cases include operating a vehicle while intoxicated, moving
traffic violations, theft, shoplifting, battery, vandalism, and trespassing. This
division handles more criminal cases than all other divisions combined.

MARION COUNTY PROSECUTOR– CHILD SUPPORT DIVISION
Introduction
The Child Support Division of the Marion County Prosecutor’s Office provides a wide range of services to parents who need child support establishment,
enforcement, or modification. Services are provided and authorized through the federal Title IV-D program and through a cooperative agreement with the Indiana
Child Support Bureau. Services are provided at the downtown office, as well as branch offices located at Flanner House, Center Township Trustee’s Office, Wayne
Township Trustee’s Office, and the Morris Settles Township Center.
Structure
Legal
Deputy prosecutors are responsible for the review, approval, and maintenance
of the cases assigned to the Child Support Division. These cases include
paternity establishment, petitions for child support, contempt cases,
modifications, medical support, interstate cases, and many additional issues
related to child support. Deputy prosecutors are assigned to sixteen (16)
regular weekly dockets and are assigned to additional hearings as scheduled
by the courts. Deputy prosecutors are aided by an attorney assistant who
works with administrative issues and other tasks.
Paternity
Staff in this section prepare cases for court, including pleadings, exhibits, and
genetic testing. These cases often are based upon paternity affidavits
executed by the parents and sometimes include interstate cases.
Litigation
Staff provides support for deputy prosecutors, including preparing cases for
thirteen (13) dockets per week, as well as a number of additional court
hearings. Additional services are provided through this section, including
mediation services and the Parents That Work program.
Interstate
A significant number of cases involve parents and children living in other
states. This section is responsible for coordinating communication and
services across state lines, including paternity establishment, medical support,
child support order establishment and enforcement, and modifications of
child support orders.

Intake
In-person interaction with parents is the primary function of this group. In
addition to seeing 100 appointments in an average week, staff meets with
another 90 parents per week as walk-ins. Primary duties include initial case
creation, document preparation, and preparing cases for attorney review.
Branch
Intake functions are also available in the community, allowing parents the
opportunity to obtain services without having to travel downtown. Duties at
the branch locations are substantially the same as the intake division
previously listed.
Internal Services
Staff assigned to this section provide support services to other Child Support
Division employees. These include maintenance of files, calculating balances
on child support accounts, sending income withholding orders, and working
special reports.
Solution Center
Calls to the Child Support Division’s general access number average about
12,500 per month. Staff assigned to this division provide general
information, schedule appointments, assist in coordinating child support
services to callers.

MARION COUNTY COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS
Vision and Mission Statements
Vision
To provide the citizens of Marion County a safer community.

Mission
To enhance public safety by raising offender accountability through the use
of evidence based practices and interventions.

Structure
Home Detention
The electronic equipment used for client monitoring includes active radio
frequency for typical home detention clients as well as global positioning
satellite equipment for high risk offenders, including domestic violence
offenders who are on home detention. Community Corrections also offers
electronic alcohol monitoring equipment. Offenders may be placed on any
combination of Home Detention, GPS, and Alcohol Monitoring. All
offenders under supervision have a variety of programming available.
Community Corrections utilizes the Indiana Risk Assessment System (IRAS)
to assess the risk of reoffending and services needed for all clients under
supervision. Based on overall risk score and identified criminogenic needs,
clients may be placed into the following evidence based programs presented
by trained facilitators: Parenting, Anger Management, Thinking For a
Change, Substance Abuse Treatment, as well as Job Readiness workshops
and GED/ABE. Mental health programming is also available for those
mentally ill offenders who might otherwise have been incarcerated at the
local or the state levels. MCCC has an Addictions Intervention Component
which focuses on addictions issues.

Work Release
In October 2007, the agency opened the Duvall Residential Center which
provides services for male work release offenders and has capacity for up to
350 persons. All residents of Duvall are eligible for the same programming
opportunities as electronic monitoring offenders.
Through contracts with service providers, we are able to serve offenders at 3
other locations. Volunteers of America (VOA) currently provides a total of
90 beds for male offenders split among General Population, Community
Transition Program, and the Mental Health Component at Brandon Hall.
VOA also operates the Theodora House, which is a residential facility for 60
female offenders. In addition, the Craine House provides the opportunity for
4 women with pre-school aged children to serve their sentence in the
community while living with their children

DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS
Introduction
The Indianapolis Department of Public Works (DPW) aims to improve residents’ quality of life through multi-modal connectivity, green space, capital
improvements, universal accessibility, and collaborative public and private partnerships. DPW builds and maintains public infrastructure, park land, manages solid
waste collection and the city’s entire fleet—striving always to provide effective, efficient customer service to citizens and visitors to Indianapolis, Marion County
and ensuring a healthy, safe, and natural environment.
Structure
Leadership:
DPW is led by a director appointed by the mayor. The director is supported
directly by a chief of staff. Under DPW leadership are several offices that
can be organized into four main divisions: Policy and Planning, Engineering,
Fleet Services, and Operations. These four divisions are not rigid: On a dayto-day basis, they merge to solve problems and increase livability across the
City and Marion County.
Policy and Planning
The Policy and Planning division works cooperatively to manage the
administration of the entire department, as directed by DPW leadership. This
division includes finance, the city-county council liaison, communications,
the Office of Sustainability, and the Office of Disability Affairs. While the
Office of Sustainability and the Office of Disability Affairs are housed within
DPW and report to the DPW director, they oversee livability and ADA issues
for the entire City and County. The offices within Policy and Planning work
closely with DPW leadership as well as deputy directors and administrators in
Engineering, Operations and Fleet Services to ensure policies are developed
and implemented with fidelity, efficiency and quality.
Operations:
The Operations division is responsible for solid waste collection and disposal;
maintenance of streets, traffic systems, levees, dams as well as park facilities
and grounds; forestry work; and snow and ice removal from City streets. This
division is comprised of both union and non-union employees. The work
performed in DPW’s Operations division requires highly skilled, dedicated
staff; for that reason, DPW safety and training are housed in this division, as
well.

Engineering Division
The Engineering division plans, designs, constructs, and maintains all streets,
sewers, roads, bridges, multi-modal paths, trails, parks, green spaces, and
thoroughfares. It is also responsible for access control, traffic control and
lights for these assets. Furthermore, the Engineering division manages the
development of studies, inventories, programs and projects—and manages all
contracts related to transportation and storm water infrastructure. In 2013,
DPW’s Engineering division welcomed staff from Indy Parks and now
oversees parks capital development and land stewardship activities.
Engineering—in collaboration with Operations and Fleet Services—works to
directly implement the vision of DPW and City leadership.
Fleet Services
The Fleet Services division is responsible for the maintenance, fueling,
monitoring and repair of all vehicles and other City-owned equipment—
including public safety vehicles—and the operation of a municipal garage.
Further, Fleet Services maintains and supplies fuel for vehicles and
equipment owned by several other governmental agencies on a contractual
basis. Like Operations, the Fleet Services division includes union and nonunion employees. \

OFFICE OF MINORITY & WOMEN BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT
Introduction
The Office of Minority &Women Business Development works to enhance
the City’s growth and economic stability through promotion of contracting
and procurement opportunities for MBE/WBE/VBE/DOBEs

Through community outreach, special events and programs such as startup
consulting and certification services, the DMWBD is an active partner to all
City of Indianapolis certified MBE/WBE/VBE/DOBEs.

Structure
Certification
MBE, WBE, VBE and DOBEs must be certified with the City through the
DMWBD. The DMWBD must verify that they meet the requirements of the
certification program. Recently implemented was the disability-owned
business enterprise program (DOBE). This program will be similar to the
MWBE certification process but the Office of Disability Affairs will process
the disability approval portion of the applicant and then the business entity
information will then be processed by the DMWBD.
Business Development
The DMWBD acts as a resource center for MBE, WBE, VBE and DOBEs
and provides programing that assist with growth and development of
companies, through outreach events, and educational workshops.
Compliance
DMWBD is responsible for reviewing all contracts, and the tracking of MBE,
WBE, VBE and DOBE participation on all contracts. DMWBD monitors
contracts to ensure the participation goals are being met.

Diversity Program
Recognize businesses and organizations that encourage, embrace, and
celebrate differences that foster a better place in which to live, work, and raise
a family.
The DMWBD is responsible for the Mayor’s Celebration of Diversity Award
luncheon, and working with the Indiana Black Expo on the Summer
Celebration, and the Circle City Classic event.
Budget change
Prior to the DMWBD budget being moved from the Mayor’s budget, we had
$8,000 in character three to be used for consulting services. Since that time
we have cut 2 FTE positions to meet budget cut requirements. These cuts
resulted in a significant decrease of business development and outreach to the
community, but resulted in savings of over $30k in character one for the
department. $22k, the remaining balance in character one from the FTE
position cuts was moved into character three for use in consulting services to
focus on contract compliance, and work force development. The total budget
line item is $30k.

MARION COUNTY ASSESSOR
Introduction
The Marion County Assessor’s main goal is to ensure the accuracy of property tax assessments. Each property owner pays a fair share of local government expenses
based on the value of the property owned. The County Assessor is responsible for determining the fair market value of each property in the county. In addition, the
County Assessor processes Inheritance Tax returns and determines whether taxpayers are entitled to inheritance tax returns and determines whether taxpayers are
entitled to charitable and non-profit property tax exemptions. Any time a taxpayer wishes to appeal an assessment decision, the appeal goes through the Property
Tax Assessment Board of Appeals (PTABOA) hearing process administered by the County Assessor.
Structure
Assessment Division
The Assessment Division assesses all real and business property throughout
the county. This division coordinates the efforts of field personnel, audit
staffs, and valuation experts to perform all phases of the assessment process
in accordance with International Association of Assessing Officers standards.
The division is further divided into functional areas separately covering
commercial, industrial, and residential properties, and reviewing taxpayers'
reports on business personal property. The division has four satellite offices
offering taxpayers a convenient place to obtain residential assessment
information and services.
Administration Division
The Administration Division is responsible for budget creation and
monitoring, payroll, human resources administration, facilities management,
procurement, education administration, process improvement, as well as
document management and retention. Further, it administers the hearing
process of the PTABOA and the review of property tax exemption
applications for charities and non-profits. Finally, this division also conducts
the auditing and processing of inheritance tax returns.

Data Analysis Division
The Data Analysis Division collects, manages, and analyzes the large
amounts of data needed for both efficient and modern assessment results. It
also creates satellite-coordinated mapping and connects assessment data to
each property geographically. Moreover, the division manages ownership
changes and records as well as maps changes in the property sizes. The
division is responsible for the sales disclosure process which collects,
reviews, and validates all property sales in the county. Finally, the division
organizes this enormous quantity of data into reports and statistics, which is
useful to the Assessment Division and to other government agencies, and is
available for dissemination to citizens over the Internet.

MARION COUNTY SURVEYOR
Introduction
Marion County Surveyor's Office was established by the Indiana Constitution in 1851. General Land Office surveys in what is now Marion County began in 1819.
Marion County is part of the rectangular survey system (Public Land System), which divides the land into sections that are one square mile. All real estate
boundaries in Marion County can be traced back to the Public Land System. Statute law requires the Surveyor to recheck at least five percent of the section corners
each year, there are over 2300 corners. The Marion County Surveyor’s Office maintains a Legal Survey Record Book and a Corner Record Book. No fee is charged
for surveying services provided to any city, county and other governmental agencies.
Structure
Surveying
In the field, the staff performs the precise measurements of Section Corners
and ties, per Indiana Code and replacing said monuments as necessary. We
monitor the Eagle Creek Dam for horizontal and vertical movement as well as
performing vital research within the office.
Information Technology
Information Technology supports the needs of the Surveyor’s Office. This
area compiles the data surveyors collect in the field by use of AutoCAD and
GIS software. Further, that data along with both the corner history and
drawing (which this department provides) is posted onto the county’s website.
We collect and quality check all measurements to ensure accurate, reliable
information is provided.
Having a greater reliance on new technology has helped the Surveyor’s office
to build a solid fiscal commitment to provide government and private sector
agencies and companies timely, accurate and useful information, while
helping us and these agencies and companies save taxpayers money and time.
Finally, these advancements in technology have enabled us to fulfill our legal
obligation for the completion of the Alcohol & Tobacco Commission’s
Verification of Business Location forms.

Preservation
Preservation is as much a part of the surveyor’s office as surveying and
technology. We believe in the importance of preserving our past for the
future generations. Understanding the necessity of creating legible electronic
copies of the records, maps, surveys and plats housed in the surveyor’s office
to ensure that they will be easily accessible for years to come. By
concentrating on this now we have been able to scan or have scanned already
deteriorating documents.

2014 Adopted Budget

DEBT SERVICE
The Consolidated City carries different types of debt associated with
various programs and services. This debt takes on two forms: (1)
general obligation debt, which is supported by a pledge of the full faith
and credit of the Consolidated City and is usually funded by tax
revenue, and (2) special revenue debt, which is supported by a pledge
of a specific revenue stream.

Special Revenue Debt
Special revenue debt is mostly associated with Tax Increment
Financing (TIF) districts throughout Marion County. This debt is
supported through property tax increment capture. This financing tool
is used to develop and grow various communities and neighborhoods
that otherwise would have little growth potential.

Generally, the revenue stream pledged for special revenue debt is a fee
or other non-tax revenue. In the case of debt funded by tax increment
financing (TIF), tax increment revenue captured is segregated from the
regular property tax revenue of the Consolidated City.

TIF funds, including debt service for TIF bonds, are not appropriated
by the City-County Council. In Marion County, the Metropolitan
Development Commission (MDC) serves as the fiscal body for TIF
funds.

The Consolidated City of Indianapolis, Marion County takes pride and
care in maintaining its AAA (stable) credit rating for its general
obligation debt.

Other special revenue debt includes economic development bonds
which are typically supported by a revenue stream generated by a
specific investment. An example would be a bond issued to finance a
parking garage with the parking fees pledged to pay the debt service.
Another example would be financing stormwater projects, undertaken
by the Consolidated City to address flood control problems, with
stormwater fees pledged to paying the debt service.

General Obligation Debt
Most of the Consolidated City’s general obligation debt is related to
transportation, parks, and emergency communications infrastructure.
Other general obligation debt is related to police and fire pension costs
as well as redevelopment efforts throughout the Consolidated City.
Debt service payments for general obligation debt are typically funded
entirely, or in part, with tax revenue. Only tax-supported debt service
is included in tables presented in this report.

TIF debt service and other special revenue debt service is not included
in tables presented in this report, but is available separately.

PENSION TRUST FUNDS
Police and Fire Pension Trust Funds account for the payment of pension benefits to police officers and firefighters hired prior to 1977. All associated
expenditures made from the Police and Fire Pension Trust Funds are reimbursed by the State.
The most recent pension plan, the 1977 Police and Firefighters Pension and Disability Fund pension plan, is administered by the Indiana Public
Retirement System (INPRS), which is appropriated and expensed as part of the Department of Public Safety’s (DPS’) Character One appropriations from
the IMPD and IFD General Funds for the respective divisions.
More information on PERF and Police and Fire pension plans can be found on pages 62-66 of the Notes to Financial Statements section of the December

2014 Proposed Budget

for the Consolidated City of Indianapolis, Marion County
Presented to the Indianapolis-Marion County City-County Council
8.19.13

To the Members of the Indianapolis City-County Council,
It is my distinct honor to present the 2014 Budget for the Consolidated City of Indianapolis, Marion County. In the pages that follow you will find a
budget that is balanced and honors our commitment to fund the critical functions of municipal government in the 13th largest city in the United
States. It is funded and fiscally responsible. It will ensure that Indianapolis remains one of only a handful of the largest cities in America that holds
AAA ratings from all three of the major ratings agencies.
Budgeting is an exercise in establishing priorities and laying the foundation for future growth through wise investments. This budget proposal
matches the priorities of this community. Funding for our public safety and criminal justice agencies represents 90% of City and County General
Fund appropriations. This budget increases funding for road and transportation capital projects. It contains no borrowing to support on-going
operations and no general tax increases.
This proposed budget recognizes the ongoing fiscal challenges faced by many cities due to a lagging national economic recovery. The budget
maintains Indianapolis’s strong fiscal position and preserves our position as an attractive, low-tax place for people to work, live, and raise a family.
I welcome your review, and I look forward to the forthcoming discussions about this budget.
Sincerely,

Gregory A. Ballard
Mayor

Executive Summary
The proposed 2014 budget for the Consolidated City of Indianapolis, Marion County is a balanced budget that signifies the goals and
priorities of the Administration while accurately accounting for revenues and expenditures for the upcoming fiscal year. Maintaining
positive fund balances, protecting the Fiscal Stability Fund and holding the line on spending were key focus points when developing the
2014 budget. Even while major revenue sources like income taxes are expected to increase for 2014, those funds must be used to support
current essential services and fund balances versus increases in spending.
The 2014 budget cannot be supported by increased income tax distributions alone. Reductions in operating and capital budgets to hold the
line on spending, along with changes in property tax policies, will keep tax supported fund balances stable for the long term and provide
for a financially strong city. This budget includes changes to the Police Special Service District boundaries, which will reduce the tax rate
by 70 percent in 2014 and provide an equitable distribution of the property tax to a majority of Marion County property owners. In
addition, to support public safety and the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department operations, the elimination of the Local Homestead
Credit will shift nearly $11.5 million of current income tax revenue away from an antiquated form of property tax relief directly to public
safety without increasing income taxes.
In the summer of 2013, the budget faced an operating shortfall and negative fund balances heading into fiscal year 2014. Based on these
projections, the Mayor’s Office and the City-County Council agreed to identify approximately $30 million of spending reductions or
revenue enhancements throughout the year. As of the publication of the 2014 budget, roughly $10 million has been identified as budget
reductions, budget reserves or enhanced revenue. The Mayor continues to urge city and county agencies to identify savings or revenue
options that will assist in reaching the $30 million goal. Even as city and county agencies continue to reduce spending or enhance revenue,
the Administration forecasted the 2014 budget would be difficult even with actions taken in 2013.
While difficult decisions have, and will be made, to close the operating deficit and maintain positive fund balances, the 2014 budget
continues investment in public safety, infrastructure, and neighborhood development.
Police and fire funding will be maintained in 2014, but both will continue to find efficiencies within their operations to maintain the level
of services currently provided. The budget supports the Mayor’s plan to provide additional officers to the street through improved
allocation of resources and a recruit class in 2014. The budget contemplates a reduction for the Indianapolis Fire Department by $1.0
million based on operational savings related to fire station consolidation, which will save on staffing and overtime needs. While the 2014
budget does not include funding for police and fire contractual raises starting January 1, 2014, the Administration is working diligently
with police and fire unions to identify opportunities to balance pay adjustments while maintaining a balanced budget. For both police and
fire staff that are assigned take-home vehicles, starting in 2014 there will be a vehicle surcharge fee, which will generate approximately

$1.4 million to support police and fire operations. Funding for criminal justice services such as the Public Defender, the Courts and the
Prosecutor will remain relatively flat by focusing on operational and functional changes that will potentially create savings or revenues that
can be reinvested within those agencies. The Administration continues to support spending reductions within the Marion County Sheriff’s
Office. By making reductions to the Sheriff’s budget for 2014, fund balances will remain positive and expenditures will match revenues.
Finally, the 2014 budget will fund the Crime Prevention Grant at $2 million, providing opportunities for not-for-profit groups that wish to
engage the community in ways to reduce crime and improve their neighborhoods.
Infrastructure improvements and upgrades continue to be a primary focus of the Administration and are reflected in the 2014 budget.
Support for the Rebuild Indy program will continue with an investment of nearly $37 million in 2014 from proceeds related to the sale of
water and waste water facilities to the Citizen’s Energy Group. In addition, the State of Indiana has increased funding allocated to local
units for roads, streets, curbs, sidewalks, bridges, etc. repairs and upgrades by $8 million for 2014. Finally, improvements and upgrades
related to storm water infrastructure will see increased funding in 2014, bringing total investment (cash and bonded) in the city and
county’s infrastructure to $110 million in 2014. Included in the budget is the management of capital investment in parks by the
Department of Public Works (DPW). DPW will oversee and manage capital planning, projects and maintenance of all parks starting in
2014.
Neighborhoods are one of the main reasons why Indianapolis and Marion County continues to be a city people want to live, work and be
part of now and in the future. Beyond funding police, fire, and infrastructure services, this budget continues to fund the important work
provided by the Department of Metropolitan Development (DMD), the Department of Code Enforcement (DCE) and the Department of
Parks and Recreation (DPR). The Administration, through the 2014 budget, continues to highlight the need for neighborhood planning and
development to ensure we are building a long term vision for the city and its residents. DMD is examining operational and functional
changes that will refocus the agency’s efforts and prioritize the goals of the Administration. The DCE, a self-sufficient operation,
continues to make a positive impact on the city through its regulatory efforts, enforcement of licensing and building ordinances and
ensuring a safe and productive living environment. Our parks continue to play a vital role in and around neighborhoods throughout the
city and county. Over the last few years, DPR has identified efficiency opportunities that have created savings or resulted in enhanced
revenue that have directly supported parks. DPR will continue to identify savings and revenue opportunities within its operations and
program for the 2014 budget. Finally, the Arts Grant will continue to be funded at $1 million as part of the 2014 budget.
Beyond specific agency changes, the budget includes enterprise-wide changes such as holding costs related to health insurance flat from
2013, examining options during 2014 related to retirement benefits for employees, evaluating current enterprise-wide contracts that could
be renegotiated and continuing the good work of the Strategic Hiring Committee. For 2014, the Information Services Agency (ISA) will
make capital investments of nearly $1.0 million to improve information technology infrastructure and operations. In addition, ISA will
invest in training programs and materials to ensure employees working in the enterprise resource planning tool, Peoplesoft, have the
appropriate knowledge and skills that will create operational efficiencies within agencies that provide enterprise-wide functions.

Expenditures are only one side of the equation when developing a balanced budget, thus revenue plays an equally, if not more important
role, to balancing the budget and funding public safety.
As noted earlier, this budget includes the expansion of the current Police Special Service District (PSSD) from the old city limits to most
of Marion County (excluding Speedway, Lawrence, Beech Grove and Southport). While all residents of Marion County contribute to
public safety through income taxes, not all residents contribute through property taxes based on the current PSSD boundaries. By
expanding the PSSD to all of Marion County (excluding Speedway, Lawrence, Beech Grove and Southport), residents will equally support
police operations throughout Marion County. Also, with the merger of police services completed several years ago, the current PSSD
boundaries are out-dated and do not match the current service area patrolled by the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department (IMPD).
The change in PSSD boundaries will reduce the 2013 property tax rate from $0.3649 to approximately $0.1141, a 70% reduction.
Through the reduction in the property tax rate for the PSSD, the impact of the circuit breaker to the city and county will be reduced by
approximately $3.0 million in 2014. Not only would the city and county benefit from this action, but other local units like Indianapolis
Public Schools and the Indianapolis Public Library would benefit as well.
In order to support the IMPD and create a positive fund balance for IMPD operations, this budget calls for the elimination of the Local
Homestead Credit (LHC) in 2014. The elimination of the LHC will shift current income tax revenue to the IMPD to support current
staffing and services vital to public safety in Indianapolis and Marion County. The current LHC is funded through income tax revenue
paid by Marion County residents, but not all residents benefit from the LHC. Eliminating the LHC will 1) align Marion County’s property
tax policies with the state and other surrounding counties, 2) no longer create a property tax subsidy that benefits some, not all residents,
and 3) use current income tax revenue rather than increase income tax rates to support IMPD. Of the nearly 221,000 property owners that
would be impacted by the elimination of the LHC, 25 percent would realize no impact to their property tax bills and the remaining
property tax payers would be impacted by less than $2 per month on average. The impact of this action will provide funding directly to
IMPD that if not made available would require dramatic changes in the police department.
Finally, as Indiana and Marion County slowly emerge from one of the worst financial crises in the last 80 years, we are seeing an increase
in the overall income tax revenue generated by Marion County residents. Despite a slight increase in personal income of Marion County
residents in recent years, distributions of income tax to the county by the state have been held flat due for three years, due to the state’s
over distribution of income tax in 2010. In 2013, the city and county received $221 million in income tax revenue distributions which
support public safety, criminal justice and public safety communications. For 2014, the state is expected to increase the income tax
revenue distribution by $17 million. While this increase is helpful, it certainly does not discharge the city and county from holding the line
on spending and improving our financial position.
The Administration is committed to keeping the tax supported fund balance at or above 10% of the annual expenditures from tax supported
funds, which is $77 million. Based on the 2014 proposed budget, the fund balance for tax supported funds will end at approximately $81
million. This figure does not include the $80 million that is held in the Fiscal Stability Fund nor other dedicated, federal or state funds. The

Office of Finance and Management (OFM) projects that if spending remains flat into 2015 and additional income tax revenue were
distributed by the state, fund balances could increase to $97 million by 2015.
The 2014 budget focuses on the goals of the Administration, continues to support vital services that make the Consolidated City of
Indianapolis, Marion County a great place to live, and maintains the Administration’s commitment to fiscal stability and long term
financial planning. This balanced budget has been accomplished through tough decisions regarding spending, finding innovate ways to
provide services, creating efficiencies where possible and identifying revenues that directly benefit public safety. While challenges lay
ahead, the financial plan presented in this budget continues to serve all citizens of Marion County and makes Indianapolis a great city to
live, work and raise a family.

Funds
The Indiana State Board of Accounts (SBOA) defines “fund” to
mean “cash or a group of accounts set aside for the purpose of
accounting for monies or other resources of general functions or
specific activities . . . in accordance with the system of accounts
prescribed by the State Board of Accounts or as required by statute”
(State Board of Accounts, Accounting and Uniform Compliance
Guidelines Manual for Cities and Towns, State of Indiana, reissued
2006).

Fund; Parks General Fund; Public Safety Income Tax Fund –
County; Public Safety Income Tax Fund – City; Personal Services
Contingency Fund – County; Personal Services Contingency Fund –
City; Guardian Ad Litem Fund; and Medical Care for Inmates Fund.
What all of these funds have in common is that they each will each
receive a substantial amount of flexible tax revenue. Thus, there is
the ability to reallocate the flexible revenue flowing to these funds
across many competing operational needs.

Funds that the SBOA prescribes for use by cities include but are not
limited to, general funds, special revenue funds, debt services funds,
capital projects funds, internal service funds, and agency funds.
Funds included in the 2014 Introduced Budget represent those that
require appropriation by the City-County Council. Appropriation is
the authorization of the City-County Council by ordinance to make
disbursements or to incur obligations for specific purposes.

Dedicated Funds
Dedicated funds, on the other hand, are funds which receive revenue
from taxes or non-tax sources that have very restricted legal uses. A
more apt of a dedicated fund description is a fund that receives little
or no revenue from flexible tax revenue sources. Some examples are
the Parking Meter Fund and the Permits Fund. These are both
dedicated funds because their revenue sources have strictly limited
legal uses.

General Funds
General funds are funds which receive a substantial share of their
revenue from taxes that have very broad flexibility. For example, the
1% County Option Income Tax (COIT) distributions and the County
General Fund property tax levy may legally be used to fund any
governmental purpose.

The Consolidated City also uses dedicated funds to account for the
proceeds of specific revenue sources (e.g., special revenue funds)
and/or for expenditures restricted to a specific purpose (e.g. debt
service funds; enterprise funds). Debt service funds (aka sinking
funds) are used to account for the accumulation of revenue for the
payment of long-term debt principal and interest.

The core general operating funds for the Consolidated City are:
County General Fund; Consolidated County General Fund (aka City
General Fund); Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department
(IMPD) General Fund; Indianapolis Fire Department (IFD) General

Grant Funds
Finally, the Consolidated City also employs grant funds to collect
revenues and track expenditures for grant monies received from
other units of government.

This report excludes TIF debt service, TIF capital and other capital project funds. Those funds are not annually appropriated by the City-County Council.
Debt service funds for other special revenue (i.e. non-tax) bonds are also not included in this report.

Revenues
State law requires adoption of a balanced budget, which shall include
all anticipated revenues and expenses of every organizational unit
(with the exception of utilities). As such, all appropriations adopted
by the City-County Council must be fully supported by (1) revenue
that is legally eligible to support proposed expenses, and/or (2) fund
balance (essentially prior year, unencumbered revenue) that is legally
eligible to support the proposed expense.

The Consolidated City relies primarily on property and income taxes
to fund its operations. However, a significant amount of revenue is
derived from Fees and Charges as well as from Federal and State
Grants. The following pages provide more detailed information
about property tax rates, levies and districts as well as the various
types of income taxes, tax rates as well as the available uses of such
funds.

Property Tax
Citizens of the Consolidated City are subject to several overlapping
property tax districts which levy taxes for city and county general
purpose funds, as well as specific services. Taxpayers residing in
overlapping districts would be subject to the tax rates of each
applicable district.
Certified Levy (Gross Levy)
The total property tax levy for a taxing unit before the property tax
cap is considered. Referred to as “certified” because it is approved
by the State Department of Local Government Finance (DLGF).
DLGF approval is required to ensure that the levy amount is within
maximum levy limitations set by State law.
Net Levy
The expected property tax levy after deducting the property tax
circuit breaker credits attributable to the property tax caps.
Gross Assessed Value
The assessed value of a property before applying any eligible
property tax deductions or abatements (which lower the property’s
taxable assessed value). The property tax caps are set based on each
parcel’s gross assessed value.
Net Assessed Value (Taxable Assessed Value)
The taxable value of property after all eligible property tax
deductions and abatements are applied.

Property Tax Cap (aka Circuit Breaker)
The property tax cap, also known as the “circuit breaker,” was
enacted by the Indiana General Assembly in 2008 and subsequently
amended into the Indiana Constitution. The cap guarantees that
property tax rates in overlapping districts cannot exceed a certain
capped percent of the parcel’s gross assessed value. The “circuit
breaker” amount represents property tax liability waived because it is
above the level allowed under the property tax caps. The property
tax caps are as follows:
1% - for Homestead property
2% - for other residential property and agricultural land
3% - for commercial and industrial property
Taxing Districts & Rates
The following pages show the taxing districts along with the Net
Assessed Values (NAV) of taxable property within those districts for
pay year 2014. The Tax Rate for a district is determined by the
following formula:

departments with the Indianapolis Fire Department (IFD), except
Pike, Wayne, and Decatur townships. The district also excludes the
cities of Lawrence, Beech Grove, Southport, and the towns of
Cumberland and Homecroft. Tax revenues generated from this
district are deposited into the IFD General Fund and the IFD

Tax Rate: $0.1141 on each $100 of net assessed value

This district includes predominantly Center Township with some
surrounding areas included. It matches the boundaries of the old city
limits, before UniGov consolidation. Tax revenues generated from this
district are deposited into the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police
Department (IMPD) General Fund, which provides funding for
operating expenses of the IMPD.

This district includes all taxable property within Marion County
borders, excluding the cities of Lawrence, Beech Grove, Southport,
and the town of Speedway. Tax revenues generated from the proposed
expansion of this district will continued to be deposited into the
Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department (IMPD) General Fund,
which provides funding for operating expenses of the IMPD.

Income Tax
State law allows Indiana counties to impose a local income tax on
the State adjusted gross income of county taxpayers.
Also, counties may choose between several income tax options and
combinations. Each type of local income tax option is regulated by
specific rules and rate restrictions. Residents of Marion County are
subject to three interrelated income taxes in the form of the County
Option Income Tax (COIT), the Levy Freeze Local Option Income
Tax (LOIT), and the Public Safety Income Tax (PST).
This local income tax is collected by the State Department of
Revenue then distributed to counties based on the amount due to
each county on State income tax returns processed.
County Income Tax Council (CITC)
Local income tax is imposed or modified in a county by the action of
the CITC. In Marion County, the CITC is composed of the CityCounty Council and the fiscal body of each city or town that lies
either partially or entirely within the county. The other members of
the CITC are the Lawrence City Council, the Beech Grove City
Council, the Southport City Council, and the Speedway Town
Council.
Voting representation on the CITC is based on each member unit’s
share of the total county population. In Marion County, the CityCounty Council holds over 90% of the voting representation on the
CITC.

County Option Income Tax (COIT)
Current Rate: 1.00% Maximum Rate: 1.00%

COIT revenue may be used for any lawful purpose of the
governmental unit.
Levy Freeze Local Option Income Tax (LOIT)
Current Rate: 0.27% Maximum Rate: 1.00%

An additional income tax rate may be imposed to generate revenue to
replace property tax levy growth. Thus, imposing this tax reflects a
policy choice to shift fiscal reliance from property tax to income tax,
not an overall tax increase.
Once imposed, this rate may neither be rescinded nor decreased.
Each year the CITC must hold at least one public meeting to discuss
whether or not Levy Freeze LOIT rate should be increased.
Public Safety Income Tax (PST)
Current Rate: 0.35% Maximum Rate: 0.50%

Because Marion County has imposed a Levy Freeze LOIT rate, State
law allows adoption of a PST rate. PST revenues may be used for
police and fire, including pensions, emergency services,
communications systems, jails and related facilities, and other items
related to public safety.

Expenditures
Expenditure Categories (Characters)
In addition to the restrictions imposed by agencies/departments
regarding funding sources, agency spending is further restricted by
limiting the total funds available to support various spending
categories or “characters”. The Consolidated City employs five
separate characters to segregate spending. Each is described as
follows:

Properties and Equipment (Character 4)
This category includes expenditures for the acquisition of, or
addition to assets such as land, infrastructure, buildings,
improvements other than buildings, as well as machinery and
equipment.

Internal Charges (Character 5)
Personal Services (Character 1)
This category includes expenditures for salaries, wages and related
employee benefits provided for all Consolidated City employees.
Employee benefits include employer contributions to group health
and life insurance, pension benefits, unemployment compensation,
uniform allowance and similar benefits.

This category includes internal charges such as expenditures for the
Mayor’s Action Center, the Office of Corporation Counsel and Fleet
Services.
If a department has a negative appropriation for Character 5, it
means that department is a provider of internal services and a net
recipient of internal charges.

Materials and Supplies (Character 2)
This category includes articles and commodities that are consumed
or materially altered when used. Supplies include office supplies,
operating supplies, repair and maintenance supplies and other similar
items.

Other Services and Charges (Character 3)
This category includes expenditures for services other than personal
services required by the Consolidated City either to carry out its
assigned functions or to fulfill moral or legal obligations. Other
Services and Charges includes professional services, communication
and transportation, printing and advertising, insurance (excluding
group health, life and self-insurance), utility expenditures, contracted
repairs and maintenance, rentals, debt service expenditures for
principal and interest payments as well as long-term debt.

This category exists for only City departments. Similar expenditures
from county agencies are reported as Character 3 instead. Since the
Information Services Agency (ISA) is a County agency, their
charges are not administered through Character 5. Both City
departments and County agencies pay ISA charges through
Character 3.

Agency Budget Summaries
The Agency Budget Summaries section:
1) provides an operational overview of each of the county agencies
and city departments;
2) details the funding sources that will fund each
agency/department; and
3) outlines how those agencies/departments intend to spend those
funds by expenditure category or “character”.

Sources
The “Sources” listed for each agency/department budget represents
either a single or a collection of funding sources available to an
agency/department (See the Funds section for further explanation).

Final vs. Adopted vs. Revised vs. Introduced
For the purpose of comparison, each summary shows recent
historical data for agency/department budgets. The following
explains the terminology used in these comparisons.
Budget Introduced shows the amounts budgeted for each
agency/department as determined by agency/department finance
officers and the Office of Finance and Management. This is the
budget introduced by the Mayor to the City-County Council for
amendment and eventual adoption.

Expenditures

Budget Adopted shows the amounts budgeted for each
agency/department as adopted by the City-County Council in
October of the preceding fiscal year.

Agencies and departments are restricted in how they can use the

.
Structure
The Department of Public Safety comprises five integrated divisions as well as the Citizens Police Complaint Office (CPCO) and the Mayor’s Office of Re-Entry.
The Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department, Indianapolis Fire Department, Division of Homeland Security, Animal Care and Control, and Public Safety
Communications operate within one department and share resources in innovative ways. This structure increases operational effectiveness by leveraging the
strengths of each division to provide public safety services to the City of Indianapolis/Marion County. Each of the divisions has their own operational goals and
unique personalities. The Department of Public Safety was created by Section 251 of the revised municipal code. CPCO, independent of the Indianapolis

DIVISION OF HOMELAND SECURITY
Introduction
The Division leads an integrated Department of Public Safety effort to secure, prevent, prepare, respond, investigate, and ensure resiliency from natural or humanmade threats and hazards to the city, and to sustain a confident public. The Division is also responsible for preparing plans and managing the safety and security of
special events when anticipated requirements exceed the capability of the concerned geographic area. The Division of Homeland Security was created by Section
251 of the revised Municipal Code.
Structure
The Division was formed to unify divisions within the Department of Public Safety to create the capacity to deal with terrorist attacks, major disasters, planning and
managing special events, and other emergencies. By embracing a single set of guiding principles, from the Director of Public Safety to the frontline employee, we
have created a single division working to secure the City of Indianapolis/Marion County.
The Division does not operate in a vacuum. Other Federal, State, and local institutions participate actively in the Division’s efforts to work within the intelligence
community, investigate, disrupt terrorist activities, pre-planning and managing special events, and in the preparation for and response to major disasters, as do our
private and non-profit sectors and international partners. We will continue to work cooperatively to ensure that all of the instruments of local power – including
leadership, specialized technical expertise, research, and development investments – are brought to bear on the challenges we face in a coordinated and unified
manner.

MARION COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT
Introduction
The Marion County Superior Court comprises 36 elected judges, 39 commissioners and magistrates, and over 690 staff employees. The Court is structured into 4
divisions - Civil, Criminal, Juvenile, and Probate. In addition, there are a number of departments within the Court, including Probation, Jury Pool, Juvenile
Detention Center, Information Technology, and Family Court.
The Court is structured internally with an Executive Committee consisting of four judges elected by all Superior Court judges for terms of two (2) years. The
Executive Committee oversees the general policy and management of the Court. The Criminal and Civil Terms select a Chair from within their respective judicial
members and each department/division has a Supervising Judge appointed by the Executive Committee
Structure
Court Division
The 36 courts of the Court Division handle more than 50,000 civil cases and
more than 40,000 criminal cases each year. Some courts are specialty and/or
problem solving courts such as domestic violence, drug, mental health,
community, environmental, and traffic. The Traffic Division in particular
handles over 120,000 cases each year. In addition, the courts manage
programs such as re-entry and community work crews.
Probation Department
The Probation Department comprises two divisions: adult and juvenile. Its
mission is to enhance community safety by enforcing court orders while
striving to change lives. Probation assists in relieving jail bed concerns
through both pre-trial and probation services. The Juvenile Division continues
to implement strategies endorsed by the Juvenile Detention Alternative
Initiative which has resulted in a substantial reduction in the number of
juveniles being detained in the Juvenile Detention Center.

Administrative Division
The Administrative Division manages and supports the overall operation of
the Courts including human resources, finance, payroll, facilities
management, procurement, information technology, fleet, and staff training.
Juvenile Detention Division
The Marion County Juvenile Detention Center (MCJDC) is a maximum
security holding facility for detained youth. The MCJDC maintains youth,
ages 11-18 years, in a safe and secure environment while allowing continuity
of services. Each youth detained within the MCJDC will attend school,
participate in mental health and basic health exercises, and increase healthy
social skill-building processes. The Marion Superior Court is committed to
providing a safe and secure Juvenile Detention Center while providing
practical, effective, and high-quality living and learning services to youth
within the MCJDC.

MARION COUNTY PROSECUTOR
Introduction
The Marion County Prosecutor’s Office seeks to place public safety as the number one priority and responsibility of government. We are dedicated to holding
criminals accountable for their actions, preserving the rights of victims and continually seeking justice, all while maintaining the highest of ethical standards.
Structure
Criminal Charging Division
Police agencies present cases to this division for criminal charging
determinations. Deputy prosecutors determine what charges are to be filed in
each case, or if additional investigation is necessary.

Special Victims Team
This area of the office includes cases involving sex crimes and domestic
violence. It also handles cases of child abuse and leads the office’s efforts
and collaboration with the Julian Center.

Major Case Division
The Major Case Division handles major felony cases, including homicides.
Victim Advocates are assigned to each of these courts to ensure that victims
are notified of actions taken by the court and that they receive guidance and
support throughout the criminal justice process. Within the Major Case
Division, a Special Crimes Team includes prosecutors dedicated to human
trafficking, arson and unemployment insurance fraud.

Community Prosecution Division
Community prosecutors are assigned to the police districts and special areas.
These prosecutors work closely with district commanders and detectives to
develop strategies to protect and defend the communities served by the
respective police districts. Community prosecutors also encourage
community participation in public safety and crime prevention, engaging
residents in problem solving and establishing and maintaining partnerships.

Grand Jury Division
For cases involving white collar crime, public corruption, tax evasion and
other long term investigations, the Prosecutor has a staff of investigators and
lawyers dedicated to the collection of evidence and prosecution of these
cases. If criminal activity is suspected, the evidence is presented to a Grand
Jury composed of six citizens of Marion County who are presented with the
evidence and determine if criminal charges are filed. Currently, investigators
assigned to the Grand Jury Division represent detectives from the
Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department, Marion County Sheriff’s
Department, and Indiana State Police.

Juvenile Division
This division is responsible for filing and prosecuting acts of delinquency by
children 17 years of age and younger, including truancy cases. In certain
cases, more serious crimes can be directly filed to the adult criminal courts.

Strike Team
This division is responsible for three (3) areas of crime – drugs, guns and
gangs. Vigorous prosecution of these crimes is essential to the safety of the
community. The Strike Team partners with various police departments
throughout the county to assist in investigations, arrests, charging decisions
and the presentation of the case to the court.

Correction Division
This division responds to all requests for post-conviction relief and for
sentence modifications. This division also handles all requests for
expungement of arrests and convictions and the sealing of criminal records.

D-Felony/Misdemeanor Division
This division handles the prosecution of misdemeanor and Class D Felony
criminal cases. Cases include operating a vehicle while intoxicated, moving
traffic violations, theft, shoplifting, battery, vandalism, and trespassing. This
division handles more criminal cases than all other divisions combined.

MARION COUNTY PROSECUTOR– CHILD SUPPORT DIVISION
Introduction
The Child Support Division of the Marion County Prosecutor’s Office provides a wide range of services to parents who need child support establishment,
enforcement, or modification. Services are provided and authorized through the federal Title IV-D program and through a cooperative agreement with the Indiana
Child Support Bureau. Services are provided at the downtown office, as well as branch offices located at Flanner House, Center Township Trustee’s Office, Wayne
Township Trustee’s Office, and the Morris Settles Township Center.
Structure
Legal
Deputy prosecutors are responsible for the review, approval, and maintenance
of the cases assigned to the Child Support Division. These cases include
paternity establishment, petitions for child support, contempt cases,
modifications, medical support, interstate cases, and many additional issues
related to child support. Deputy prosecutors are assigned to sixteen (16)
regular weekly dockets and are assigned to additional hearings as scheduled
by the courts. Deputy prosecutors are aided by an attorney assistant who
works with administrative issues and other tasks.
Paternity
Staff in this section prepare cases for court, including pleadings, exhibits, and
genetic testing. These cases often are based upon paternity affidavits
executed by the parents and sometimes include interstate cases.
Litigation
Staff provides support for deputy prosecutors, including preparing cases for
thirteen (13) dockets per week, as well as a number of additional court
hearings. Additional services are provided through this section, including

states. This section is responsible for coordinating communication and
services across state lines, including paternity establishment, medical support,
child support order establishment and enforcement, and modifications of
child support orders.

Intake
In-person interaction with parents is the primary function of this group. In
addition to seeing 100 appointments in an average week, staff meets with
another 90 parents per week as walk-ins. Primary duties include initial case
creation, document preparation, and preparing cases for attorney review.
Branch
Intake functions are also available in the community, allowing parents the
opportunity to obtain services without having to travel downtown. Duties at
the branch locations are substantially the same as the intake division
previously listed.
Internal Services
Staff assigned to this section provide support services to other Child Support
Division employees. These include maintenance of files, calculating balances
on child support accounts, sending income withholding orders, and working
special reports.

12,500 per month. Staff assigned to this division provide general
information, schedule appointments, assist in coordinating child support
services to callers.

MARION COUNTY COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS
Vision and Mission Statements
Vision
To provide the citizens of Marion County a safer community.

Mission
To enhance public safety by raising offender accountability through the use
of evidence based practices and interventions.

Structure
Home Detention
The electronic equipment used for client monitoring includes active radio
frequency for typical home detention clients as well as global positioning
satellite equipment for high risk offenders, including domestic violence
offenders who are on home detention. Community Corrections also offers
electronic alcohol monitoring equipment. Offenders may be placed on any
combination of Home Detention, GPS, and Alcohol Monitoring. All
offenders under supervision have a variety of programming available.
Community Corrections utilizes the Indiana Risk Assessment System (IRAS)
to assess the risk of reoffending and services needed for all clients under
supervision. Based on overall risk score and identified criminogenic needs,
clients may be placed into the following evidence based programs presented
by trained facilitators: Parenting, Anger Management, Thinking For a
Change, Substance Abuse Treatment, as well as Job Readiness workshops
and GED/ABE. Mental health programming is also available for those
mentally ill offenders who might otherwise have been incarcerated at the
local or the state levels. MCCC has an Addictions Intervention Component
which focuses on addictions issues.

Work Release
In October 2007, the agency opened the Duvall Residential Center which
provides services for male work release offenders and has capacity for up to
350 persons. All residents of Duvall are eligible for the same programming
opportunities as electronic monitoring offenders.
Through contracts with service providers, we are able to serve offenders at 3
other locations. Volunteers of America (VOA) currently provides a total of
90 beds for male offenders split among General Population, Community
Transition Program, and the Mental Health Component at Brandon Hall.
VOA also operates the Theodora House, which is a residential facility for 60
female offenders. In addition, the Craine House provides the opportunity for
4 women with pre-school aged children to serve their sentence in the
community while living with their children

DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS
Introduction
The Indianapolis Department of Public Works (DPW) aims to improve residents’ quality of life through multi-modal connectivity, green space, capital
improvements, universal accessibility, and collaborative public and private partnerships. DPW builds and maintains public infrastructure, park land, manages solid
waste collection and the city’s entire fleet—striving always to provide effective, efficient customer service to citizens and visitors to Indianapolis, Marion County
and ensuring a healthy, safe, and natural environment.
Structure
Leadership:
DPW is led by a director appointed by the mayor. The director is supported
directly by a chief of staff. Under DPW leadership are several offices that
can be organized into four main divisions: Policy and Planning, Engineering,
Fleet Services, and Operations. These four divisions are not rigid: On a dayto-day basis, they merge to solve problems and increase livability across the
City and Marion County.
Policy and Planning
The Policy and Planning division works cooperatively to manage the
administration of the entire department, as directed by DPW leadership. This
division includes finance, the city-county council liaison, communications,
the Office of Sustainability, and the Office of Disability Affairs. While the
Office of Sustainability and the Office of Disability Affairs are housed within
DPW and report to the DPW director, they oversee livability and ADA issues
for the entire City and County. The offices within Policy and Planning work
closely with DPW leadership as well as deputy directors and administrators in
Engineering, Operations and Fleet Services to ensure policies are developed
and implemented with fidelity, efficiency and quality.
Operations:
The Operations division is responsible for solid waste collection and disposal;
maintenance of streets, traffic systems, levees, dams as well as park facilities
and grounds; forestry work; and snow and ice removal from City streets. This
division is comprised of both union and non-union employees. The work
performed in DPW’s Operations division requires highly skilled, dedicated
staff; for that reason, DPW safety and training are housed in this division, as
well.

Engineering Division
The Engineering division plans, designs, constructs, and maintains all streets,
sewers, roads, bridges, multi-modal paths, trails, parks, green spaces, and
thoroughfares. It is also responsible for access control, traffic control and
lights for these assets. Furthermore, the Engineering division manages the
development of studies, inventories, programs and projects—and manages all
contracts related to transportation and storm water infrastructure. In 2013,
DPW’s Engineering division welcomed staff from Indy Parks and now
oversees parks capital development and land stewardship activities.
Engineering—in collaboration with Operations and Fleet Services—works to
directly implement the vision of DPW and City leadership.
Fleet Services
The Fleet Services division is responsible for the maintenance, fueling,
monitoring and repair of all vehicles and other City-owned equipment—
including public safety vehicles—and the operation of a municipal garage.
Further, Fleet Services maintains and supplies fuel for vehicles and
equipment owned by several other governmental agencies on a contractual
basis. Like Operations, the Fleet Services division includes union and nonunion employees. \

OFFICE OF MINORITY & WOMEN BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT
Introduction
The Office of Minority &Women Business Development works to enhance
the City’s growth and economic stability through promotion of contracting
and procurement opportunities for MBE/WBE/VBE/DOBEs

Through community outreach, special events and programs such as startup
consulting and certification services, the DMWBD is an active partner to all
City of Indianapolis certified MBE/WBE/VBE/DOBEs.

Structure
Certification
MBE, WBE, VBE and DOBEs must be certified with the City through the
DMWBD. The DMWBD must verify that they meet the requirements of the
certification program. Recently implemented was the disability-owned
business enterprise program (DOBE). This program will be similar to the
MWBE certification process but the Office of Disability Affairs will process
the disability approval portion of the applicant and then the business entity
information will then be processed by the DMWBD.
Business Development
The DMWBD acts as a resource center for MBE, WBE, VBE and DOBEs
and provides programing that assist with growth and development of
companies, through outreach events, and educational workshops.
Compliance
DMWBD is responsible for reviewing all contracts, and the tracking of MBE,
WBE, VBE and DOBE participation on all contracts. DMWBD monitors
contracts to ensure the participation goals are being met.

Diversity Program
Recognize businesses and organizations that encourage, embrace, and
celebrate differences that foster a better place in which to live, work, and raise
a family.
The DMWBD is responsible for the Mayor’s Celebration of Diversity Award
luncheon, and working with the Indiana Black Expo on the Summer
Celebration, and the Circle City Classic event.
Budget change
Prior to the DMWBD budget being moved from the Mayor’s budget, we had
$8,000 in character three to be used for consulting services. Since that time
we have cut 2 FTE positions to meet budget cut requirements. These cuts
resulted in a significant decrease of business development and outreach to the
community, but resulted in savings of over $30k in character one for the
department. $22k, the remaining balance in character one from the FTE
position cuts was moved into character three for use in consulting services to
focus on contract compliance, and work force development. The total budget
line item is $30k.

MARION COUNTY ASSESSOR
Introduction
The Marion County Assessor’s main goal is to ensure the accuracy of property tax assessments. Each property owner pays a fair share of local government expenses
based on the value of the property owned. The County Assessor is responsible for determining the fair market value of each property in the county. In addition, the
County Assessor processes Inheritance Tax returns and determines whether taxpayers are entitled to inheritance tax returns and determines whether taxpayers are
entitled to charitable and non-profit property tax exemptions. Any time a taxpayer wishes to appeal an assessment decision, the appeal goes through the Property
Tax Assessment Board of Appeals (PTABOA) hearing process administered by the County Assessor.
Structure
Assessment Division
The Assessment Division assesses all real and business property throughout
the county. This division coordinates the efforts of field personnel, audit
staffs, and valuation experts to perform all phases of the assessment process
in accordance with International Association of Assessing Officers standards.
The division is further divided into functional areas separately covering
commercial, industrial, and residential properties, and reviewing taxpayers'
reports on business personal property. The division has four satellite offices
offering taxpayers a convenient place to obtain residential assessment
information and services.
Administration Division
The Administration Division is responsible for budget creation and
monitoring, payroll, human resources administration, facilities management,
procurement, education administration, process improvement, as well as
document management and retention. Further, it administers the hearing
process of the PTABOA and the review of property tax exemption
applications for charities and non-profits. Finally, this division also conducts
the auditing and processing of inheritance tax returns.

Data Analysis Division
The Data Analysis Division collects, manages, and analyzes the large
amounts of data needed for both efficient and modern assessment results. It
also creates satellite-coordinated mapping and connects assessment data to
each property geographically. Moreover, the division manages ownership
changes and records as well as maps changes in the property sizes. The
division is responsible for the sales disclosure process which collects,
reviews, and validates all property sales in the county. Finally, the division
organizes this enormous quantity of data into reports and statistics, which is
useful to the Assessment Division and to other government agencies, and is
available for dissemination to citizens over the Internet.

MARION COUNTY SURVEYOR
Introduction
Marion County Surveyor's Office was established by the Indiana Constitution in 1851. General Land Office surveys in what is now Marion County began in 1819.
Marion County is part of the rectangular survey system (Public Land System), which divides the land into sections that are one square mile. All real estate
boundaries in Marion County can be traced back to the Public Land System. Statute law requires the Surveyor to recheck at least five percent of the section corners
each year, there are over 2300 corners. The Marion County Surveyor’s Office maintains a Legal Survey Record Book and a Corner Record Book. No fee is charged
for surveying services provided to any city, county and other governmental agencies.
Structure
Surveying
In the field, the staff performs the precise measurements of Section Corners
and ties, per Indiana Code and replacing said monuments as necessary. We
monitor the Eagle Creek Dam for horizontal and vertical movement as well as
performing vital research within the office.
Information Technology
Information Technology supports the needs of the Surveyor’s Office. This
area compiles the data surveyors collect in the field by use of AutoCAD and
GIS software. Further, that data along with both the corner history and
drawing (which this department provides) is posted onto the county’s website.
We collect and quality check all measurements to ensure accurate, reliable
information is provided.
Having a greater reliance on new technology has helped the Surveyor’s office
to build a solid fiscal commitment to provide government and private sector
agencies and companies timely, accurate and useful information, while
helping us and these agencies and companies save taxpayers money and time.
Finally, these advancements in technology have enabled us to fulfill our legal
obligation for the completion of the Alcohol & Tobacco Commission’s
Verification of Business Location forms.

Preservation
Preservation is as much a part of the surveyor’s office as surveying and
technology. We believe in the importance of preserving our past for the
future generations. Understanding the necessity of creating legible electronic
copies of the records, maps, surveys and plats housed in the surveyor’s office
to ensure that they will be easily accessible for years to come. By
concentrating on this now we have been able to scan or have scanned already
deteriorating documents.

Debt Service
The Consolidated City carries different types of debt associated with
various programs and services. This debt takes on two forms: (1)
general obligation debt, which is supported by a pledge of the full
faith and credit of the Consolidated City and is usually funded by tax
revenue, and (2) special revenue debt, which is supported by a
pledge of a specific revenue stream.

Special Revenue Debt
Special revenue debt is mostly associated with Tax Increment
Financing (TIF) districts throughout Marion County. This debt is
supported through property tax increment capture. This financing
tool is used to develop and grow various communities and
neighborhoods that otherwise would have little growth potential.

Generally, the revenue stream pledged for special revenue debt is a
fee or other non-tax revenue. In the case of debt funded by tax
increment financing (TIF), tax increment revenue captured is
segregated from the regular property tax revenue of the Consolidated
City.

TIF funds, including debt service for TIF bonds, are not appropriated
by the City-County Council. In Marion County, the Metropolitan
Development Commission (MDC) serves as the fiscal body for TIF
funds.

The Consolidated City of Indianapolis, Marion County takes pride
and care in maintaining its AAA (stable) credit rating for its general
obligation debt.
General Obligation Debt
Most of the Consolidated City’s general obligation debt is related to
transportation, parks, and emergency communications infrastructure.
Other general obligation debt is related to police and fire pension
costs as well as redevelopment efforts throughout the Consolidated
City.
Debt service payments for general obligation debt are typically
funded entirely, or in part, with tax revenue. Only tax-supported debt
service is included in tables presented in this report.

Other special revenue debt includes economic development bonds
which are typically supported by a revenue stream generated by a
specific investment. An example would be a bond issued to finance a
parking garage with the parking fees pledged to pay the debt service.
Another example would be financing stormwater projects,
undertaken by the Consolidated City to address flood control
problems, with stormwater fees pledged to paying the debt service.
TIF debt service and other special revenue debt service is not
included in tables presented in this report, but is available separately.

Pension Trust Funds
Police and Fire Pension Trust Funds account for the payment of
pension benefits to police officers and firefighters hired prior to 1977.
All associated expenditures made from the Police and Fire Pension
Trust Funds are reimbursed by the State.
The most recent pension plan, the 1977 Police and Firefighters
Pension and Disability Fund pension plan, is administered by the
Indiana Public Retirement System (INPRS), which is appropriated and
expensed as part of the Department of Public Safety’s (DPS’)
Character One appropriations from the IMPD and IFD General Funds
for the respective divisions.

More information on PERF and Police and Fire pension plans can be
found on pages 62-66 of the Notes to Financial Statements section of
the December 31, 2012 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report
(CAFR) for the City of Indianapolis.

Funds
The Indiana State Board of Accounts (SBOA) defines “fund” to
mean “cash or a group of accounts set aside for the purpose of
accounting for monies or other resources of general functions or
specific activities . . . in accordance with the system of accounts
prescribed by the State Board of Accounts or as required by statute”
(State Board of Accounts, Accounting and Uniform Compliance
Guidelines Manual for Cities and Towns, State of Indiana, reissued
2006).

Fund; Parks General Fund; Public Safety Income Tax Fund –
County; Public Safety Income Tax Fund – City; Personal Services
Contingency Fund – County; Personal Services Contingency Fund –
City; Guardian Ad Litem Fund; and Medical Care for Inmates Fund.
What all of these funds have in common is that they each will each
receive a substantial amount of flexible tax revenue. Thus, there is
the ability to reallocate the flexible revenue flowing to these funds
across many competing operational needs.

Funds that the SBOA prescribes for use by cities include but are not
limited to, general funds, special revenue funds, debt services funds,
capital projects funds, internal service funds, and agency funds.
Funds included in the 2017 Introduced Budget represent those that
require appropriation by the City-County Council. Appropriation is
the authorization of the City-County Council by ordinance to make
disbursements or to incur obligations for specific purposes.

Dedicated Funds
Dedicated funds, on the other hand, are funds which receive revenue
from taxes or non-tax sources that have very restricted legal uses. A
more apt of a dedicated fund description is a fund that receives little
or no revenue from flexible tax revenue sources. Some examples are
the Parking Meter Fund and the Permits Fund. These are both
dedicated funds because their revenue sources have strictly limited
legal uses.

General Funds
General funds are funds which receive a substantial share of their
revenue from taxes that have very broad flexibility. For example,
the County Option Income Tax (COIT) distributions and the County
General Fund property tax levy may legally be used to fund any
governmental purpose.

The Consolidated City also uses dedicated funds to account for the
proceeds of specific revenue sources (e.g., special revenue funds)
and/or for expenditures restricted to a specific purpose (e.g. debt
service funds; enterprise funds). Debt service funds (aka sinking
funds) are used to account for the accumulation of revenue for the
payment of long-term debt principal and interest.

The core general operating funds for the Consolidated City are:
County General Fund; Consolidated County General Fund (aka City
General Fund); Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department

Revenues
State law requires adoption of a balanced budget, which shall include
all anticipated revenues and expenses of every organizational unit
(with the exception of utilities). As such, all appropriations adopted
by the City-County Council must be fully supported by (1) revenue
that is legally eligible to support proposed expenses, and/or (2) fund
balance (essentially prior year, unencumbered revenue) that is legally
eligible to support the proposed expense.

The Consolidated City relies primarily on property and income taxes
to fund its operations. However, a significant amount of revenue is
derived from Fees and Charges as well as from Federal and State
Grants. The following pages provide more detailed information
about property tax rates, levies and districts as well as the various
types of income taxes, tax rates as well as the available uses of such
funds.

Property Tax
Citizens of the Consolidated City are subject to several overlapping
property tax districts which levy taxes for city and county general
purpose funds, as well as specific services. Taxpayers residing in
overlapping districts would be subject to the tax rates of each
applicable district.
Certified Levy (Gross Levy)
The total property tax levy for a taxing unit before the property tax
cap is considered. Referred to as “certified” because it is approved
by the State Department of Local Government Finance (DLGF).
DLGF approval is required to ensure that the levy amount is within
maximum levy limitations set by State law.
Net Levy
The expected property tax levy after deducting the property tax
circuit breaker credits attributable to the property tax caps.
Gross Assessed Value
The assessed value of a property before applying any eligible
property tax deductions or abatements (which lower the property’s
taxable assessed value). The property tax caps are set based on each
parcel’s gross assessed value.
Net Assessed Value (Taxable Assessed Value)
The taxable value of property after all eligible property tax
deductions and abatements are applied.

Property Tax Cap (aka Circuit Breaker)
The property tax cap, also known as the “circuit breaker,” was
enacted by the Indiana General Assembly in 2008 and subsequently
amended into the Indiana Constitution. The cap guarantees that
property tax rates in overlapping districts cannot exceed a certain
capped percent of the parcel’s gross assessed value. The “circuit
breaker” amount represents property tax liability waived because it is
above the level allowed under the property tax caps. The property
tax caps are as follows:
1% - for Homestead property
2% - for other residential property and agricultural land
3% - for commercial and industrial property
Taxing Districts & Rates
The following pages show the taxing districts along with the Net
Assessed Values (NAV) of taxable property within those districts
for pay year 2016. The Tax Rate for a district is determined by the
following formula:

Income Tax
State law allows Indiana counties to impose a local income tax on
the State adjusted gross income of county taxpayers.

Expenditure Rate (Maximum Rate of 2.75%)
•

CAGIT/COIT - Current Rate: .9493% Maximum Rate: 1.00%
o COIT revenue may be used for any lawful purpose of

the governmental unit.
Recent legislation provided a transition from the county adjusted
gross income tax (CAGIT), the county option income tax (COIT),
the county economic development income tax (CEDIT), and the
various local income taxes for special purposes and special projects
to a single expenditure local income tax with three rate components.
• Expenditure Rate
o COIT (County Option Income Tax)
o LOIT (Local Option Income Tax) for Levy Freeze
o PSIT (Public Safety Income Tax)
This local income tax is collected by the State Department of
Revenue then distributed to counties based on the amount due to
each county on State income tax returns processed.
County Income Tax Council (CITC)
Local income tax is imposed or modified in a county by the action of
the CITC. In Marion County, the CITC is composed of the CityCounty Council and the fiscal body of each city or town that lies
either partially or entirely within the county. The other members of
the CITC are the Lawrence City Council, the Beech Grove City
Council, the Southport City Council, and the Speedway Town
Council.
Voting representation on the CITC is based on each member unit’s
share of the total county population. In Marion County, the CityCounty Council holds over 90% of the voting representation on the
CITC.

•

Local Option Income Tax (LOIT) -Current Rate: 0.27%
Maximum Rate: 1.00%
o An additional income tax rate may be imposed to
generate revenue to replace property tax levy growth.
Thus, imposing this tax reflects a policy choice to
shift fiscal reliance from property tax to income tax,
not an overall tax increase.
Once imposed, this rate may neither be rescinded nor
decreased. Each year the CITC must hold at least one
public meeting to discuss whether or not Levy Freeze
LOIT rate should be increased.

•

Public Safety Income Tax (PSIT) - Current Rate: 0.50%
Maximum Rate: 0.50%

o

Because Marion County has imposed a Levy Freeze
LOIT rate, State law allows adoption of a PST rate.
PST revenues may be used for police and fire,
including pensions, emergency services,
communications systems, jails and related facilities,
and other items related to public safety.

Property Tax Relief Rate (Maximum Rate of 1.25%)
•

Homestead Credit Relief Rate – Current Rate: .0507%
o This credit “becomes” property tax revenue by virtue
of replacing portions of the property taxes that
residential taxpayers have to pay.

Expenditures
Expenditure Categories (Characters)
In addition to the restrictions imposed by agencies/departments
regarding funding sources, agency spending is further restricted by
limiting the total funds available to support various spending
categories or “characters”. The Consolidated City employs five
separate characters to segregate spending. Each is described as
follows:

Properties and Equipment (Character 4)
This category includes expenditures for the acquisition of, or
addition to assets such as land, infrastructure, buildings,
improvements other than buildings, as well as machinery and
equipment.

Internal Charges (Character 5)
Personal Services (Character 1)
This category includes expenditures for salaries, wages and related
employee benefits provided for all Consolidated City employees.
Employee benefits include employer contributions to group health
and life insurance, pension benefits, unemployment compensation,
uniform allowance and similar benefits.

This category includes internal charges such as expenditures for the
Mayor’s Action Center, the Office of Corporation Counsel and Fleet
Services.
If a department has a negative appropriation for Character 5, it
means that department is a provider of internal services and a net
recipient of internal charges.

Materials and Supplies (Character 2)
This category includes articles and commodities that are consumed
or materially altered when used. Supplies include office supplies,
operating supplies, repair and maintenance supplies and other similar
items.

Other Services and Charges (Character 3)
This category includes expenditures for services other than personal
services required by the Consolidated City either to carry out its
assigned functions or to fulfill moral or legal obligations. Other
Services and Charges includes professional services, communication
and transportation, printing and advertising, insurance (excluding
group health, life and self-insurance), utility expenditures, contracted
repairs and maintenance, rentals, debt service expenditures for
principal and interest payments as well as long-term debt.

This category exists for only City departments. Similar expenditures
from county agencies are reported as Character 3 instead. Since the
Information Services Agency (ISA) is a County agency, their
charges are not administered through Character 5. Both City
departments and County agencies pay ISA charges through
Character 3.

Agency Budget Summaries
The Agency Budget Summaries section:
1) provides an operational overview of each of the county agencies
and city departments;
2) details the funding sources that will fund each
agency/department; and
3) outlines how those agencies/departments intend to spend those
funds by expenditure category or “character”.

Sources
The “Sources” listed for each agency/department budget represents
either a single or a collection of funding sources available to an
agency/department (See the Funds section for further explanation).

Final vs. Adopted vs. Revised vs. Introduced
For the purpose of comparison, each summary shows recent
historical data for agency/department budgets. The following
explains the terminology used in these comparisons.
Budget Introduced shows the amounts budgeted for each
agency/department as determined by agency/department finance
officers and the Office of Finance and Management. This is the
budget introduced by the Mayor to the City-County Council for
amendment and eventual adoption.

Expenditures

Budget Adopted shows the amounts budgeted for each
agency/department as adopted by the City-County Council in
October of the preceding fiscal year.

Agencies and departments are restricted in how they can use the
funds available to them. The Consolidated City employs five
separate expenditure “Characters” to categorize these uses (See the
Expenditures section for explanation of these characters).

Budget Revised shows the budget as amended through fiscal
ordinances approved by the City-County Council throughout the
fiscal year
Actual Final shows the final expenditures and encumbrances for
each department and agency for the fiscal year.

INDIANAPOLIS METROPOLITAN POLICE DEPARTMENT
Introduction
The Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department (IMPD) is striving to become the premier law enforcement agency in the United States, attracting the most
professional and passionate officers and civilian employees. Our Vision is a law enforcement agency that works closely with the citizens of Indianapolis to produce
a safe environment and a higher quality of life for all those living in, and visiting, our city. IMPD is responsible for the consolidated City of Indianapolis and Marion
County, less the 4 excluded cities of Lawrence, Beech Grove, Speedway, and Southport. This equates to approximately 92% of the estimated consolidated
population of 939,000 and 403 square miles. IMPD was created by Section 279 of the revised municipal code.
Structure
Patrol Division
This division is responsible for the daily police operations of the city and
many specialized units, including Arson, Aviation, Canine, Domestic
Preparedness, Event Response Group, Explosive Ordinance Disposal,
Mounted Patrol, Negotiators, Park Rangers, Reserves, Special Events,
SWAT, and Traffic Enforcement.

Administrative Division
This division is responsible for all policies and procedures, human resources,
finance, procurement, fleet, identification and records, recruiting, training,
property room, and the Information and Intelligence Center.

Investigations Division
This division conducts major criminal investigations including homicide,
aggravated assaults, robbery, sex crimes, narcotics, gangs, and organized
crime. The division investigates these crimes, collects evidence, identifies the
perpetrators, and prepares these cases for successful prosecution. The
division also provides liaison units with the US Marshal, FBI, and the
Prosecutor's Office.

MARION COUNTY PROSECUTOR
Introduction
The Marion County Prosecutor’s Office seeks to place public safety as the number one priority and responsibility of government. We are dedicated to holding
criminals accountable for their actions, preserving the rights of victims and continually seeking justice, all while maintaining the highest of ethical standards.
Structure
Criminal Charging Division
Law enforcement agencies present cases to this division for criminal
charging determinations. Deputy prosecutors determine what charges, if
any, are to be filed in each case. The division also has a Crime Strategies
Unit that identifies persons and groups of persons who are generating a
disproportionate amount of criminal activity and appear to present
escalating violent behaviors. The Crime Strategies Unit also aids in
locating witnesses who may not otherwise attend court and other persons of
interest.
Major Case Division
The Major Case Division handles major felony cases, including homicides.
Victim Advocates are assigned to each of these courts to ensure that victims
are notified of actions taken by the court and that they receive guidance and
support throughout the criminal justice process. Within the Major Case
Division, a Special Crimes Team includes prosecutors dedicated to cases
involving human trafficking, arson and unemployment insurance fraud.
Grand Jury Division
Investigators assigned to the Marion County Prosecutor’s Office conduct
long-term investigations in cases involving white collar crime, public
corruption and tax evasion. If criminal activity is suspected, the evidence is
presented to a Grand Jury composed of six citizens of Marion County to
determine if criminal charges are filed.
Special Victims Team
The Special Victims Team prosecutes cases involving sex crimes, domestic
violence and child abuse. This team leads the office’s efforts and
collaboration with the Julian Center and Child Advocacy Center.
Strike Team
The Strike Team focuses on three (3) areas of crime – drugs, guns and
gangs. The Strike Team partners with various police departments and state
and federal agencies throughout the county to assist in investigations,
arrests, charging decisions and the presentation of the case to the court.

Community Prosecution Division
Community prosecutors are assigned to the police districts and special areas
within Marion County and work collaboratively with district commanders
and detectives to develop strategies tailored to the communities they serve.
Community prosecutors encourage community participation in public safety
and crime prevention, engaging residents in problem solving and
establishing and maintaining partnerships.
Juvenile Division
This division is responsible for filing and prosecuting acts of delinquency
by children 17 years of age and younger, including truancy cases. In cases
involving serious violent crimes, the Marion County Prosecutor’s Office
seeks to file the charges directly into the adult criminal courts.
Level 6 Felony/Misdemeanor Division
This division handles the prosecution of misdemeanor and Level 6 Felony
criminal cases. Cases include operating a vehicle while intoxicated, moving
traffic violations, theft, battery, resisting law enforcement, carrying a
handgun without a license and trespassing. This division handles more
criminal cases than all other divisions combined.
Forfeiture Division
Through partnerships with state and federal law enforcement agencies, the
Forfeiture Division strives to reduce the profitability of crime by seizing the
proceeds of criminal activity as allowed by state law. This goal is
accomplished by filing proceedings in civil courts whereby a judge may
determine that property owned by a defendant is subject to forfeiture
because it was used in the commission of a crime or is the profit of a
criminal activity.
Correction Division
This division responds to all requests for post-conviction relief and for
sentence modifications. This division also handles all requests for
expungement of arrests and convictions and the sealing of criminal records.

MARION COUNTY COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS
Vision and Mission Statements
Vision
To provide the citizens of Marion County a safer community.

Mission
To enhance public safety by raising offender accountability through the use of
evidence based practices and interventions.

Structure
Marion County Community Corrections (MCCCs’) serves approximately
2,500 offenders divided into two, distinct populations: (1) those awaiting trial
and (2) those serving an executed sentence. Rather than awaiting trial or
serving a sentence in jail or prison, a court may place a defendant with
MCCC for Pre-Trial Monitoring, or for sentencing via Electronic
Monitoring/Home Detention or Work Release.

Work Release
MCCC utilizes three facilities for both male and female offenders assigned to
work release. In October 2007 MCCC opened the Duvall Residential Center
(DRC). With a capacity of 350 beds, DRC provides housing and services for
male work release offenders. Because DRC is a work release center,
employment is strongly encouraged. However, if a resident is not employed,
MCCC works with the offender to find employment. All DRC residents are
also eligible for the same programming opportunities as those placed on EM.

Electronic Monitoring/Home Detention
Offenders and defendants assigned to Pre-Trial Monitoring (PTM), who are
placed on EM, are required to wear secured Global Positioning Satellite
(GPS) technology and transmitters to allow for continuous physical
monitoring. This technology allows offenders and defendants to be placed on
Home Detention, where, while on home confinement, they: (1) are not
permitted to leave the home except for medical emergency; OR (2) are
permitted to continue working (or searching for employment) and/or attend
religious services; OR (3) are placed on GPS monitoring only with no other
restriction. In addition to GPS technology, the Court may place a defendant or
an offender with MCCC for electronic alcohol monitoring.

To serve female offenders, MCCC contracts with Theodora House, operated
by Volunteers of America (VOA), which provides a capacity of 60 beds.
Finally, MCCC maintains its long-standing relationship with Craine House.
The Craine House provides the programming and work release opportunities
for up to 15 women with pre-school aged children.

In order to determine the appropriate level of supervision, MCCC must
determine each defendants or offender’s risk level, or likelihood to reoffend.
For this task, MCCC employs the Indiana Risk Assessment System (IRAS).
Based on overall risk score and identified criminogenic needs, offenders may
be placed into appropriate Evidence Based Programs (EBPs,) such as resume
and career planning; substance abuse treatment, conflict resolution; or
parenting and life skills.

DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS
Introduction
The Indianapolis Department of Public Works (DPW) aims to improve residents’ quality of life through multi-modal connectivity, green space, capital
improvements, universal accessibility, and collaborative public and private partnerships. DPW builds and maintains public infrastructure, park land, manages solid
waste collection and the city’s entire fleet—striving always to provide effective, efficient customer service to citizens and visitors to Indianapolis, Marion County
and ensuring a healthy, safe, and natural environment.
Structure
Leadership
DPW is led by a director appointed by the mayor. Under DPW leadership are
several offices that can be organized into four main divisions: Policy and
Planning, Engineering, Fleet Services, and Operations. These four divisions
are not rigid: On a day-to-day basis, they merge to solve problems and
increase livability across the City and Marion County.
Policy and Planning
The Policy and Planning division works cooperatively to manage the
administration of the entire department, as directed by DPW leadership. This
division includes finance, the city-county council liaison, communications,
the Office of Sustainability, and the Office of Disability Affairs. While the
Office of Sustainability and the Office of Disability Affairs are housed within
DPW and report to the DPW director, they oversee livability and ADA issues
for the entire City and County. The offices within Policy and Planning work
closely with DPW leadership as well as deputy directors and administrators in
Engineering, Operations, and Fleet Services to ensure policies are developed
and implemented with fidelity, efficiency, and quality.
Operations:
The Operations division is responsible for solid waste collection and disposal;
maintenance of streets, traffic systems, levees, dams, as well as park facilities
and grounds; forestry work; and snow and ice removal from City streets. This
division is comprised of both union and non-union employees. The work
performed in DPW’s Operations division requires highly skilled, dedicated
staff; for that reason, DPW safety and training are housed in this division, as
well.

Engineering Division
The Engineering division plans, designs, constructs, and maintains all streets,
storm water systems, roads, bridges, multi-modal paths, trails, parks, green
spaces, and thoroughfares. It is also responsible for access control, traffic
control, and lights for these assets. Furthermore, the Engineering division
manages the development of studies, inventories, programs, and projects—
and manages all contracts related to transportation and storm water
infrastructure. DPW’s Engineering division oversees parks capital
development and land stewardship activities as well. Engineering—in
collaboration with Operations and Fleet Services—works to directly
implement the vision of DPW and City leadership.
Fleet Services
The Fleet Services division is responsible for the maintenance, fueling,
monitoring, and repair of all vehicles and other City-owned equipment—
including public safety vehicles—and the operation of a municipal garage.
Further, Fleet Services maintains and supplies fuel for vehicles and
equipment owned by several other governmental agencies on a contractual
basis. Like Operations, the Fleet Services division includes union and nonunion employees.

MARION COUNTY SURVEYOR
Introduction
Marion County Surveyor's Office was established by the Indiana Constitution in 1851. General Land Office surveys in what is now Marion County began in
1819. Marion County is part of the rectangular survey system (Public Land System), which divides the land into sections that are one square mile. All real
estate boundaries in Marion County can be traced back to the Public Land System. Statute law requires the Surveyor to recheck at least five percent of the
section corners each year, there are nearly 2400 corners. The Marion County Surveyor’s Office maintains a Legal Survey Record Book and a Corner Record
Book. No fee is charged for surveying services provided to any city, county and other governmental agencies.
Structure
The Marion County Surveyor's Office has three areas of focus,
each with their own operational goals and activities while being
unified by a common vision.
Surveying
In the field, the staff performs the precise measurements of Section
Corners and ties, per Indiana Code and replacing said monuments as
necessary. We monitor the Eagle Creek Dam for horizontal and
vertical movement as well as performing vital research within the
office.
Information Technology
Information Technology supports the needs of the Surveyor’s Office.
This area compiles the data surveyors collect in the field by use of
AutoCAD and GIS software. Further, that data along with both the
corner history and drawing (which this department provides) is posted
onto the county’s website. We collect and quality-check all
measurements to ensure accurate, reliable information is provided.

Having a greater reliance on new technology has helped the Surveyor’s
office to build a solid fiscal commitment to provide government and
private sector agencies and companies timely, accurate and useful
information, while helping us and these agencies and companies save
taxpayers’ money and time. Finally, these advancements in technology
have enabled us to fulfill our legal obligation for the completion of the
Alcohol & Tobacco Commission’s Verification of Business Location
forms.
Preservation
Preservation is as much a part of the Surveyor’s Office as surveying
and technology. We believe in the importance of preserving our past
for the future generations. Understanding the necessity of creating
legible electronic copies of the records, maps, surveys and plats housed
in the Surveyor’s Office, we work to ensure that they will be easily
accessible for years to come. By concentrating on this now we have
been able to scan or have scanned already deteriorating documents.

Debt Service
The Consolidated City carries different types of debt associated with
various programs and services. This debt takes on two forms: (1)
general obligation debt, which is supported by a pledge of the full
faith and credit of the Consolidated City and is usually funded by tax
revenue, and (2) special revenue debt, which is supported by a
pledge of a specific revenue stream.

Special Revenue Debt
Special revenue debt is mostly associated with Tax Increment
Financing (TIF) districts throughout Marion County. This debt is
supported through property tax increment capture. This financing
tool is used to develop and grow various communities and
neighborhoods that otherwise would have little growth potential.

Generally, the revenue stream pledged for special revenue debt is a
fee or other non-tax revenue. In the case of debt funded by tax
increment financing (TIF), tax increment revenue captured is
segregated from the regular property tax revenue of the Consolidated
City.

TIF funds, including debt service for TIF bonds, are not appropriated
by the City-County Council. In Marion County, the Metropolitan
Development Commission (MDC) serves as the fiscal body for TIF
funds.

The Consolidated City of Indianapolis, Marion County takes pride
and care in maintaining its AAA (stable) credit rating for its general
obligation debt.
General Obligation Debt
Most of the Consolidated City’s general obligation debt is related to
transportation, parks, and emergency communications infrastructure.
Other general obligation debt is related to police and fire pension
costs as well as redevelopment efforts throughout the Consolidated
City.

Other special revenue debt includes economic development bonds
which are typically supported by a revenue stream generated by a
specific investment. An example would be a bond issued to finance a
parking garage with the parking fees pledged to pay the debt service.
Another example would be financing stormwater projects,
undertaken by the Consolidated City to address flood control
problems, with stormwater fees pledged to paying the debt service.
TIF debt service and other special revenue debt service is not
included in tables presented in this report, but is available separately.

Debt service payments for general obligation debt are typically
funded entirely, or in part, with tax revenue. Only tax-supported debt
service is included in tables presented in this report.

Executive Summary
FISCAL ENVIRONMENT
2012 Revenue Surprise
The fiscal position of the Consolidated City of Indianapolis, Marion County entering the 2013 budget cycle was substantially different than anticipated
when the 2012 budget was adopted due to two (2) significant revenue surprises ± a lower than expected property tax circuit breaker loss and a major
correction to local income tax distributions from the State.
Based on final 2012 property tax levies for all Marion County taxing units, as approved by the State Department of Local Government Finance
(DLGF), the property tax circuit breaker loss for all taxing units was 23% less than projected for the 2012 budget. This was due mainly to approved
2012 school district levies for debt service and capital projects being much lower than expected. As a result, the combined 2012 property tax collections
IRUWKH&RQVROLGDWHG&LW\¶V seven (7) property tax-supported operating funds are now estimated to be $9.7 million higher than budgeted.
As for local income tax revenue, a major revelation occurred in April 2012 when the State Office of Management & Budget (OMB) announced that
$207 million in local income tax collections, due to counties, had been mistakenly under-reported by the State Department of Revenue. As a result,
State distributions of local income tax to counties for all of 2011 and through April 2012 had been too low. For the Consolidated City, this error
corrections means that 2012 income tax revenue will be $46.6 million higher than budgeted ($17.7 million attributable to reporting errors that lowered
our 2011 actual revenue; $28.9M attributable to reporting errors affecting our 2012 expected revenue).
Together, these revenue surprises have re-established operating fund balances that were previously projected to be substantially depleted by the end of
2012. In fact, $30 million of the income tax error correction amount was deposited in our Rainy Day Fund. Furthermore, the income tax error
correction also revealed that our underlying local income base was a bit stronger than previously assumed. When adjusted for the error correction, the
Consolidated &LW\¶VQRUPDOL]HGORFDOLQFRPHWD[UHYHQXHGHFOLQHVLQFHWKH$281 million peak in 2010 is now $57 million (20% decline) instead of
an $85 million drop (31% decline) anticipated when the 2012 budget was adopted.
2013 Fiscal Conditions
Despite the good news of bolstered operating fund balances and a stronger income tax base, the Consolidated City still faces a very challenging fiscal
environment for 2013. Put in broader context, the $57 million drop in income tax revenue is equal to approximately 10% of our 2012 adopted general
operating fund budget of $568.6 million. Thus, we enter the 2013 budget season with an operating budget gap of $65 million (comparing 2013
projected base operating costs to 2013 projected baseline revenue).
Expectations for both property tax revenue and local income tax revenue are essentially flat for 2013. In fact, 2013 baseline revenue for both property
tax and local income tax are down slightly from the latest estimates for 2012 revenue (assuming no tax policy changes and after adjusting 2012 income
tax collections for the State reporting error correction). Baseline property tax revenue estimates are down because the reduced circuit breaker loss
surprise from 2012 is not expected to repeat. Baseline income tax revenue estimates are down because a balance in the Levy Freeze Local Income

1

Option Tax (LOIT) Stabilization Account (held by the County Treasurer for all government units in the county) will be exhausted in 2012. This means
distributions of Levy Freeze LOIT monies to all taxing units will be reduced in 2013. For the Consolidated City, the reduction will be $3.2 million.
Despite continued revenue weakness expected in 2013, there is reason for optimism that the Consolidated &LW\¶VILVFDOFRQGLWLRQZLOOcontinue to
improve in 2014 and beyond.
Future Revenue Outlook
The general outlook for growth in the Consolidated &LW\¶VWD[EDVHremains weak reflecting the sluggish state of the broader economy. In Indiana, there
is generally a two (2) year lag between economic events and the resulting impact on municipal income and property tax revenue. Thus, our tax revenue
for 2013 and 2014 will generally reflect local economic activity from 2011 and 2012.
This lag is due to structural DVSHFWVRI,QGLDQD¶VPXQLFLSDOILQDQFHODZV)RUSURSHUW\WD[UHYHQXHFKDQJHVLQWKHPDUNHWYDOXHRISURSHUW\WKDW
occurred in 2011 are captured in the tax assessments in 2012. Those 2012 tax assessments then define the property tax base for 2013 billings. For local
income tax revenue, earnings realized in 2011 are reported on tax returns filed with the State Department of Revenue in 2012. The 2012 income tax
filings then define the local income tax base for 2013 certified distributions to local government units.
Expectations for property tax revenue growth remain flat. Until broad based economic growth triggers an escalation in property values, we can expect
property tax revenue to remain stagnant. In the property tax cap era, when property value growth is stagnant, allowable levy growth authorized under
State law is offset by rising property tax circuit breaker credits.
However, there is one major bright spot for revenue. A unique and sharp uptick in our certified distribution of local income tax is expected in 2014,
approximately $20 million, unrelated to underlying economic activity. This uptick will be the result of resolving an income tax collection vs
distribution imbalance between the State and counties that occurred during the period of 2008 through 2010.
Over WKRVH\HDUVWKH6WDWH¶Vcertified income tax distributions to counties far exceeded the local income tax collections received by the State
Department of Revenue. This happened because the Great Recession produced a drop in income tax collections so sharp and rapid that the legal
mechanism in place for adjusting WKH6WDWH¶Vcertified distributions to counties could not keep pace. Thus, the State Treasury found itself in a position
where it was carrying a large negative balance in the clearing accounts used for processing local income tax collections and distributions to counties.
To correct this imbalance, in 2011 the State instituted a cap on local income tax distributions to counties. The cap holds the certified distribution to
each county level for 2012 and forward, until rising income tax collections offset WKHFRXQW\¶VQHJDWLYHFOHDULQJDFFRXQWEDODQFH
The subsequent local income tax reporting error and correction in 2011 and 2012, referenced above, certainly added an additional level of complexity
to process of determining the correct clearing account balances for each county. Those issues have now all been reconciled. We estimate that the
Marion County clearing account negative balance will be resolved in 2013; and thus, the cap on local income tax distributions lifted. This explains the
unusual $20 million uptick expected for the Consolidated &LW\¶VVKDUHof the 2014 certified local income distribution.

2

Beyond 2014, we expect local income tax revenue growth to return to a normal relationship to underlying economic activity, but lagged by two years as
explained above.

$20 million spend down of general operating reserves;
$25 million spend down of Rainy Day Fund reserves (leaving $5 million balance);
$10 million reimbursement from tax increment financing (TIF) district reserves for past City-paid infrastructure investments;
$5 million from suspension of scheduled 3% pay raise for police and firefighters;
$3 million savings for 2013 non-election year;
$1 million revenue from new vehicle personal use surcharge for Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department (IMPD) and Indianapolis Fire
Department (IFD); and
9 $1 million reduction in IMPD and IFD overtime

In addition to seeking a reimbursement from TIF reserves, the Consolidated City is also releasing approximately $1.4 billion of allowable tax increment
assessed value (AV) to the general tax base for 2013. This represents more than 25% the total allowable tax increment capture. This action will
generate the combined benefits of: a) lowering total property taxpayer liability by over $15 million; and b) reducing the revenue loss due to property tax
caps by nearly $20 million for all taxing units across the county. Of this $20 million revenue impact, the Consolidated City will realize $8.6 more in
net property tax revenue than it would have otherwise.
This budget plan will also enable the Consolidated City to continue its investments in core information systems to modernize internal operations and
financial controls. This is an investment necessary to both support productivity gains essential to navigating lean times and prepare the City to continue
to excel over the long term.

With the advent of the property tax caps, this property tax subsidy has lost its original impact. It has morphed from being a primary tool for protecting
homeowners from rising property tax burdens to an ineffective program that no longer achieves its intended purpose.

held in abeyance by the County Treasurer, awaiting future guidance on when and where it is to be allocated. The underlying rationale for this veto
action is that withholding this approximately $32 million in 2013 would make it available to address the approximately $35 million budget gap in 2014.
It must be noted that this veto action reduces funds available for County agencies by about 14% in 2013, if the funds are not eventually released. It is

through the end of the year and into 2013, if necessary.

Strategic Fiscal Actions
In August 2011, the Consolidated City closed a deal transferring of its water and wastewater utility assets and debt to Citizens Energy Group (CEG).
CEG is a local public trust originally created, in 1887, to RZQDQGRSHUDWHWKH&LW\¶VQDWXUDOJDVVXSSO\DQGGLVWULEXWLRQDVVHWV7KLVunique structure
was devised to protect the citizens of Indianapolis from the twin perceived threats that access to natural gas energy might fall prey to the price
inefficiency of a private monopoly or the political patronage exposure of a government run monopoly.
The deal generated over $450 million in cash proceeds, putting Indianapolis in the enviable position of being able to upgrade its physical infrastructure
while many other municipalities across the nation continue to struggle. These proceeds will fund improvements to roads, bridges, sidewalks, and the
demolition and deconstruction of abandoned properties through Mayor Ballard's RebuildIndy program.
Mayor Ballard is committed to protecting RebuildIndy funds. Thus, no RebuildIndy funds were used in the 2012 operating budget nor are any
proposed for use to support the 2013 operating budget for the Consolidated City. Furthermore, $80 million of the proceeds were set aside in a new

maintain our AAA rating; then, those funds must be transferred to the RebuildIndy Fund for future investment in infrastructure projects.
By year end, more than $270 million will have been invested to improve roads, bridges, sidewalks, or demolish abandoned properties in every part of
our city. In 2013 DQGEH\RQG0D\RU%DOODUG¶V5HEXLOG,QG\SURJUDPZLOOLQYHVWover $100 million dollars more in addressing remaining infrastructure
needs.
In a single stroke, this transaction positioned Indianapolis to be stronger both in physical assets and financial resilience. As a result, when a sustained
economic recovery does eventually take hold, Indianapolis will be poised to leap forward while many of our peers will have to first play catch up on
rebuilding their financial reserves and physical infrastructure base. However, we cannot be complacent because major issues still remain to align
permanent infrastructure funding with long-term reinvestment needs.

SPECIFIC BUDGET ELEMENTS
General Funds vs Dedicated Funds
The fund structure for municipal government is exceedingly complex. There are many, many distinct funds which comprise the overall fiscal structure
of the Consolidated City. In the face of this complexity, some simplifying assumptions are helpful to bring order and context to the fund inventory that
can appear overwhelming at first glance.
Most of the operating budget for the Consolidated City is funded by general tax revenue, both property tax and income tax. General funds are funds
which receive a substantial share of their revenue from taxes that have very broad flexibility.
Dedicated funds, on the other hand, are funds which receive revenue from taxes or non-tax sources that have very restricted legal uses. A more detailed
description of the fund structure of municipal government is provided elsewhere in this report.

100% Base Budget
SHWWLQJDVLGHWKHSRWHQWLDOHIIHFWVRIWKH0D\RU¶VYHWR action on County agency funds, the 2013 adopted budget sets funding for the general fund
supported County agencies and City departments at the proper level to fully support current operations (i.e. a 100% base budget). This means that
adjustments were made to the budget of each agency and department to: a) close known gaps between 2012 budgeted appropriations and current
operations, with a particular focus on public safety and criminal justice; and b) to fund rising fixed and semi-fixed costs (e.g. pension contributions;
health insurance; rent; internal service charges; multi-year contracts; fuel; etc). In total, the general tax-supported budgets for agencies and departments
were increased by $27 million (4.7%).
Key features of the adopted budget for public safety and criminal justice are:
9 6KHULII¶Vgeneral operating budget increased $7.6 million (8.4%) to close gaps in funding for their salaries and benefits, Jail II operating contract,
and arrestee medical costs;
9 IMPD general operating budget increased $9.8 million (5.5%) to close gaps in funding for rent, utilities, fuel/vehicle maintenance, and equipment
replacement;
9 IFD general operating budget increased $3.9 million (2.9%) to close gaps in funding for salaries and benefits;
9 funding for inmate and arrestee medical care and guardian ad litem services is consolidated into separate funds to highlight their significance and
isolate these expenses from the normal operating costs of the Sheriff and Superior Courts; and
9 the $2 million Crime Prevention Grant program will be continued.
Additional key features of the adopted budget for other general government functions are:
9 reduced Election Board budget by $2.6 million to reflect that 2013 is a non-election year;
9 increased Information Services Agency (ISA) internal charges by 16% to bring them into proper alignment with actual ISA costs (charges up by
$4.1 million while ISA budget is essentially flat);
9 continued capital investment in park grounds and facilities to further enhance these key public assets; and
9 the $1 million grant to the Indianapolis Arts Council will be continued.
Dedicated Fund Departments
There are four (4) City departments whose operations are funded completely or substantially from dedicated funds. The largest of these is the
Department of Public Works (DPW). The others are: Department of Metropolitan Development (DMD); Department of Code Enforcement (DCE); and
the Public Safety Communications (PSC) division within the Department of Public Safety (DPS). Because WKHVHGHSDUWPHQWVGRQ¶WUHFHLYHDQ\IOH[LEOH
income tax revenue, their budgets have generally not been directly impacted by the sharp downturn in income tax revenue since 2010 (with PSC as the
only exception). However, they each face other types of revenue challenges.
In this introduced budget, '3:¶V ability to deliver high quality snow and ice removal services this winter and necessary street and walkway repairs
next spring remains intact. Work will also continue, in earnest, on flood control improvements across the city in 2013. '3:¶Vroad and street

maintenance operations are heavily dependent on motor fuel tax and vehicle license fee revenue shared by the State. Both the economic downturn and
structural changes in the demand for motor fuel have caused this key revenue source to wane over the past decade. Thus, DPW must continue to strive
for savings and service level improvements in response to the weakness in this revenue stream. Fortunately, the RebuildIndy Fund has taken some
pressure RIIRI'3:¶Vtraditional dedicated transportation revenues. However, when the RebuildIndy Fund is exhausted, now projected for early in
2014, the pressure RQ'3:¶VGHGLFDWHGWUDQVSRUWDWLRQUHYHQXHVZLOOUHWXUQ
DMD is funded largely from federal grants and legally restricted tax and fee revenue. Though shielded from the sharp decline in local income tax,
DMD has suffered from a similarly dramatic tightening of federal grant funds, as the weak national economy and serious federal deficit concerns has
slowed the spigot of federal-aid support for local planning and economic development efforts. In response, the 2013 introduced budget includes a $1.5
million transfer from the City General Fund to maintain DMD at its current service level.
DCE will continue to operate at the level their dedicated, non-fungible revenue support. DCE charges fees only to those who use its service, freeing all
taxpayers of the burden of funding this department; so, its funding level depends more on the effectiveness of its operations than on the general tax
revenue climate of local government.
From a funding perspective, the PSC division is the most unique of the dedicated fund supported City departments. It does, in fact, receive a substantial
share of its revenue from the 1% COIT. While the PSC division is also eligible to receive E911 fee revenue, all of that revenue has been allocated to
IXQGWKH6KHULII¶Vemergency dispatch operations in 2013.
Because the method for allocating COIT revenue to PSC is uniquely prescribed by State law, this income tax revenue has legal characteristics more like
a dedicated funding source than a flexible, general funding source. Allocations RI&2,7UHYHQXHWR36&FRPH³RII-the-WRS´EHIRUHWKHUHPDLQLQJ
balance is distributed to all other HOLJLEOHJRYHUQPHQWDOXQLWVLQ0DULRQ&RXQW\7KXVWKH³RII-the-WRS´&2,7PRQLHVDOORFDWHGWR36&FDQQRWEH
shifted to other uses within the operating budget of the Consolidated City.
Because the PSC division is so dependent on local income tax revenue, its funding has suffered as a result of the sharp downturn in local income tax
distributions to Marion County since 2010. The 2013 adopted budget restores PSC funding to a more appropriate level. To accomplish this, the 2013
³RII-the-WRS´DOORcation was increased by 11% (nearly $1 million). This will enable the PSC division to proceed with an initiative to replace an aging
computer-aided dispatch (CAD) system.
Support for the Indianapolis/Marion County Public Library
Finally, the matter of funding for the Indianapolis/Marion County Public Library (IMCPL) has also been a growing concern over the past few years.
During the 2011 session of the Indiana General Assembly, municipal finance laws governing Marion County were changed to allow a portion of the
COIT revenue to be allocated to the IMCPL. The fact that local income tax revenue is currently stagnant makes the idea of adding new uses for these
scarce funds less appealing fiscally; however, with an eye on the long haul, adding the library to the COIT allocation formula is the right policy.

continued in the 2013 adopted budget, providing IMCPL with $169,016.

LOOKING FORWARD
The 2013 adopted budget for the Consolidated City once again sets forth a responsible fiscal plan by which agencies can continue serving all citizens of
Marion County, making Indianapolis a safe, livable city now and for decades to come. However, with the still unresolved structural deficit and the
0D\RU¶VYHWRDFWLRQPXFKXQFHUWDLQW\UHPDLQVA sharp $20 million rebound in local income tax revenues for the Consolidated City, anticipated in
2014, provides reason for optimism. However, serious fiscal challenges and decisions still lay ahead.
Based on the adopted budget, summarized in this report, the budget gap entering the 2014 budget cycle will potentially total $35 million. This estimate
recognizes that: a) a portion of the $65 million gap for 2013 is closed with the spend down of reserves; b) fixed and semi-fixed costs continue to rise;
and c) tax revenue growth will likely remain stagnant (aside from the unique $20 million income tax uptick in 2014).
To bridge this gap, it is imperative that we maintain some reserves and continue to find meaningful operational savings. The Office of Finance &
Management must seriously consider exercising its authority to invoke a management reserve requirement on department and agency budgets. Under
this authority, up to 5% (approximately $30 million) of the general fund appropriations may be withheld from budgets. Also, Mayor Ballad has tasked
the Office of Audit & Performance (OAP) to identify at least $15 million in savings from elimination of non-value added redundancies remaining
across the operations of all departments and agencies of the Consolidated City. For example, the Sheriff and the IMPD now engage separate vendors
for psychological testing of deputies and officers. Also, the Sheriff, Superior Courts, and County Prosecutor are exempted from working through the
central Human Resources Division of the Consolidated City.
Such work is the official charge of OAP by virtue of its authorizing code cite. Delivering on this savings goal will require the cooperation of all City
departments and County agencies, and is critical to managing the finances of the Consolidated City until a return of broad based economic growth starts
helping the local tax base recover.

Funds
The Indiana State Board of Accounts (SBOA) defines “fund” to
mean “cash or a group of accounts set aside for the purpose of
accounting for monies or other resources of general functions or
specific activities . . . in accordance with the system of accounts
prescribed by the State Board of Accounts or as required by statute”
(State Board of Accounts, Accounting and Uniform Compliance
Guidelines Manual for Cities and Towns, State of Indiana, reissued
2006).
Funds that the SBOA prescribes for use by cities include but are not
limited to, general funds, special revenue funds, debt services funds,
capital projects funds, internal service funds, and agency funds.
Funds included in the 2013 Adopted Budget represent those that
require appropriation by the City-County Council. Appropriation is
the authorization of the City-County Council by ordinance to make
disbursements or to incur obligations for specific purposes.
General Funds
General funds are funds which receive a substantial share of their
revenue from taxes that have very broad flexibility. For example, the
1% County Option Income Tax (COIT) distributions and the County
General Fund property tax levy may legally be used to fund any
governmental purpose.
The core general operating funds for the Consolidated City are:
County General Fund; Consolidated County General Fund (aka City
General Fund); Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department
(IMPD) General Fund; Indianapolis Fire Department (IFD) General
Fund; and Parks General Fund. Additionally, in 2013, there are six

(6) other funds that are also defined as general operating funds. They
are: Public Safety Income Tax Fund – County; Public Safety Income
Tax Fund – City; Personal Services Contingency Fund – County;
Personal Services Contingency Fund – City; Guardian Ad Litem
Fund; and Medical Care for Inmates Fund. What all of these funds
have in common is that they each will each receive a substantial
amount of flexible tax revenue in 2013. Thus, there is the ability to
reallocate the flexible revenue flowing to these funds across many
competing operational needs.
Dedicated Funds
Dedicated funds, on the other hand, are funds which receive revenue
from taxes or non-tax sources that have very restricted legal uses. A
more apt of a dedicated fund description is a fund that receives little
or no revenue from flexible tax revenue sources. Some examples are
the Parking Meter Fund and the Permits Fund. These are both
dedicated funds because their revenue sources have strictly limited
legal uses.
The Consolidated City also uses dedicated funds to account for the
proceeds of specific revenue sources (e.g., special revenue funds)
and/or for expenditures restricted to a specific purpose (e.g. debt
service funds; enterprise funds). Debt service funds (aka sinking
funds) are used to account for the accumulation of revenue for the
payment of long-term debt principal and interest.
Grant Funds
Finally, the Consolidated City also employs grant funds to collect
revenues and track expenditures for grant monies received from
other units of government.

Revenues
State law requires adoption of a balanced budget, which shall include
all anticipated revenues and expenses of every organizational unit
(with the exception of utilities). As such, all appropriations adopted
by the City-County Council must be fully supported by (1) revenue
that is legally eligible to support proposed expenses, and/or (2) fund
balance (essentially prior year, unencumbered revenue) that is legally
eligible to support the proposed expense.

The Consolidated City relies primarily on property and income taxes
to fund its operations. However, a significant amount of revenue is
derived from Fees and Charges as well as from Federal and State
Grants. The following pages provide more detailed information
about property tax rates, levies and districts as well as the various
types of income taxes, tax rates as well as the available uses of such
funds.

Property Tax
Citizens of the Consolidated City are subject to several overlapping
property tax districts which levy taxes for city and county general
purpose funds, as well as specific services. Taxpayer residing in
overlapping districts would be subject to the tax rates of each
applicable district.
Certified Levy (Gross Levy)
The total property tax levy for a taxing unit before the property tax
cap is considered. Referred to as “certified” because it is approved
by the State Department of Local Government Finance (DLGF).
DLGF approval is required to ensure that the levy amount is within
maximum levy limitations set by State law.
Net Levy
The expected property tax levy after deducting the property tax
circuit breaker credits attributable to the property tax caps.
Gross Assessed Value
The assessed value of a property before applying any eligible
property tax deductions or abatements (which lower the property’s
taxable assessed value). The property tax caps are set based on each
parcel’s gross assessed value.

Property Tax Cap (aka Circuit Breaker)
The property tax cap, also known as the “circuit breaker,” was
enacted by the Indiana General Assembly in 2008 and subsequently
amended into the Indiana Constitution. The cap guarantees that
property tax rates in overlapping districts cannot exceed a certain
capped percent of the parcel’s gross assessed value. The “circuit
breaker” amount represents property tax liability waived because it is
above the level allowed under the property tax caps. The property
tax caps are as follows:
1% - for Homestead property
2% - for other residential property and agricultural land
3% - for commercial and industrial property
Taxing Districts & Rates
The following pages show the taxing districts along with the Net
Assessed Values (NAV) of taxable property within those districts for
2013. The Tax Rate for a district is determined by the following
formula:
ܶܽ‫ ݁ݐܴܽݔ‬ൌ

‫ݕݒ݁ܮ݂݀݁݅݅ݐݎ݁ܥ‬
ܰ݁‫݁ݑ݈ܸܽ݀݁ݏݏ݁ݏݏܣݐ‬

Net Assessed Value (Taxable Assessed Value)
The taxable value of property after all eligible property tax
deductions and abatements are applied.

Property Taxes – Descriptions of Tax Districts
Marion County Tax District

Tax Rate (County): $0.3937 on each $100 of net assessed value
Tax Rate (Cons County): $0.1609 on each $100 of net assessed value

This district includes all taxable property within Marion County’s
borders. This is the tax district supporting the County General Fund,
the Property Reassessment Fund, the County Cumulative Capital
Fund, County Debt Service Funds, the Consolidated County Fund
(aka City General Fund), and some City General Obligation Debt
Service Funds. Revenues from this tax district support all of County
government and a portion of City government general operations and
debt service.
Indianapolis Consolidated City District

Tax Rate: $0.0792 on each $100 of net assessed value

This district includes all taxable property within Marion County
borders, excluding the cities of Lawrence, Beech Grove, Southport,
and the town of Speedway. This is the tax district supporting the
Redevelopment General Fund, the City Cumulative Capital Fund,
and most City General Obligation Debt Service Funds. Tax revenues
from this district support certain City government expenses for
which property owners in the excluded cities and town are not
required to contribute.

Indianapolis Fire Special Service District

Tax Rate: $0.3061 on each $100 of net assessed value

This taxing district includes most of the central and eastern portions
of the county with minimal western portions included. This
configuration reflects the consolidation of all township fire
departments with the Indianapolis Fire Department (IFD), except
Pike, Wayne, and Decatur townships. The district also excludes the
cities of Lawrence, Beech Grove, Southport, and the towns of
Cumberland and Homecroft. Tax revenues generated from this
district are deposited into the IFD General Fund and the IFD
Cumulative Fund, which provide funding for operating and capital
expenses of the IFD.
Indianapolis Solid Waste Special Service District
Tax Rate: $0.0870 on each $100 of net assessed value

This district includes all taxable property within Marion County
borders, excluding the cities of Lawrence, Beech Grove and the town
of Speedway. Tax revenues from this district are deposited into the
Solid Waste Collection Fund, which provides funding for the
Department of Public Works (DPW) to perform trash collection and
solid waste removal services.

Indianapolis Police Special Service District

Tax Rate: $0.3530 on each $100 of net assessed value

This district includes predominantly Center Township with some
surrounding areas included. It matches the boundaries of the old city
limits, before UniGov consolidation. Tax revenues generated from

Income Tax
State law allows Indiana counties to impose a local income tax on
the State adjusted gross income of county taxpayers.
Also, counties may choose between several income tax options and
combinations. Each type of local income tax option is regulated by
specific rules and rate restrictions. Residents of Marion County are
subject to three interrelated income taxes in the form of the County
Option Income Tax (COIT), the Levy Freeze Local Option Income
Tax (LOIT), and the Public Safety Income Tax (PST).
This local income tax is collected by the State Department of
Revenue then distributed to counties based on the amount due to
each county on State income tax returns processed.
County Income Tax Council (CITC)
Local income tax is imposed or modified in a county by the action of
the CITC. In Marion County, the CITC is composed of the CityCounty Council and the fiscal body of each city or town that lies
either partially or entirely within the county. The other members of
the CITC are the Lawrence City Council, the Beech Grove City
Council, the Southport City Council, and the Speedway Town
Council.

County Option Income Tax (COIT)

Current Rate: 1.00% Maximum Rate: 1.00%

COIT revenue may be used for any lawful purpose of the
governmental unit.
Levy Freeze Local Option Income Tax (LOIT)
Current Rate: 0.27% Maximum Rate: 1.00%

An additional income tax rate may be imposed to generate revenue to
replace property tax levy growth. Thus, imposing this tax reflects a
policy choice to shift fiscal reliance from property tax to income tax,
not an overall tax increase.
Once imposed, this rate may neither be rescinded nor decreased.
Each year the CITC must hold at least one public meeting to discuss
whether or not Levy Freeze LOIT rate should be increased.
Public Safety Income Tax (PST)

Current Rate: 0.35% Maximum Rate: 0.50%

Because Marion County has imposed a Levy Freeze LOIT rate, State
law allows adoption of a PST rate. PST revenues may be used for
police and fire, including pensions, emergency services,
communications systems, jails and related facilities, and other items
related to public safety.

Voting representation on the CITC is based on each member unit’s
share of the total county population. In Marion County, the CityCounty Council holds over 90% of the voting representation on the
CITC.

Expenditures
Expenditure Categories (Characters)
In addition to the restrictions imposed by agencies/departments
regarding funding sources, agency spending is further restricted by
limiting the total funds available to support various spending
categories or “characters”. The Consolidated City employs five
separate characters to segregate spending. Each is described as
follows:

Personal Services (Character 1)
This category includes expenditures for salaries, wages and related
employee benefits provided for all Consolidated City employees.
Employee benefits include employer contributions to group health
and life insurance, pension benefits, unemployment compensation,
uniform allowance and similar benefits.

Materials and Supplies (Character 2)
This category includes articles and commodities that are consumed
or materially altered when used. Supplies include office supplies,
operating supplies, repair and maintenance supplies and other similar
items.

Other Services and Charges (Character 3)

Properties and Equipment (Character 4)
This category includes expenditures for the acquisition of, or
addition to assets such as land, infrastructure, buildings,
improvements other than buildings, as well as machinery and
equipment.

Internal Charges (Character 5)
This category includes internal charges such as expenditures for the
Mayor’s Action Center, the Office of Corporation Counsel and Fleet
Services.
If a department has a negative appropriation for Character 5, it
means that department is a provider of internal services and a net
recipient of internal charges.
This category exists for only City departments. Similar expenditures
from county agencies are reported as Character 3 instead. Since the
Information Services Agency (ISA) is a County agency, their
charges are not administered through Character 5. Both City
departments and County agencies pay ISA charges through
Character 3.

This category includes expenditures for services other than personal
services required by the Consolidated City either to carry out its
assigned functions or to fulfill moral or legal obligations. Other
Services and Charges includes professional services, communication
and transportation, printing and advertising, insurance (excluding
group health, life and self-insurance), utility expenditures, contracted
repairs and maintenance, rentals, debt service expenditures for
principal and interest payments as well as long-term debt.

Agency Budget Summaries
The Agency Budget Summaries section:
1) provides an operational overview of each of the county agencies
and city departments;
2) details the funding sources that will fund each
agency/department; and
3) outlines how those agencies/departments intend to spend those
funds by expenditure category or “character”.

Sources
The “Sources” listed for each agency/department budget represents
either a single or a collection of funding sources available to an
agency/department (See the Funds section for further explanation).

Expenditures
Agencies and departments are restricted in how they can use the
funds available to them. The Consolidated City employs five
separate expenditure “Characters” to categorize these uses (See the
Expenditures section for explanation of these characters).

Final vs. Adopted vs. Introduced
For the purpose of comparison, each summary shows recent
historical data for agency/department budgets. The following
explains the terminology used in these comparisons.
Budget Introduced shows the amounts budgeted for each
agency/department as determined by agency/department finance
officers and the Office of Finance and Management. This is the
budget introduced by the Mayor to the City-County Council for
amendment and eventual adoption.
Budget Adopted shows the amounts budgeted for each
agency/department as adopted by the City-County Council in
October of the preceding fiscal year.
Actual Final shows the final expenditures and encumbrances for
each department and agency for the fiscal year.

DPS ADMINISTRATION
Introduction
The City of Indianapolis Department of Public Safety (DPS) will remain a
national model leveraging the unique strengths of the Police, Fire,
Homeland Security, Animal Care and Control, and Communications

Divisions as an integrated department. DPS will deliver the highest quality
of public safety services in a fiscally effective manner to secure the Greater
Indianapolis area by preventing, preparing for, responding to, and
recovering from routine emergencies and large-scales incidents. The
Administration unit of DPS provides coordination and leadership for the
agencies within DPS.

Structure
The Department of Public Safety comprises five integrated divisions as well
as the Citizens Police Complaint Office (CPCO). The Indianapolis
Metropolitan Police Department, Indianapolis Fire Department, Division of
Homeland Security, Animal Care and Control, and Public Safety
Communications operate within one department and share resources in
innovative ways. This structure increases operational effectiveness by
leveraging the strengths of each division to provide public safety services to
the City of Indianapolis/Marion County. Each of the divisions has their
own operational goals and unique personalities.

The Department of Public Safety was created by Section 251 of the revised
municipal code. CPCO, independent of the Indianapolis Metropolitan
Police Department, was created by city ordinance. The CPCO affords
citizens of the Consolidated City of Indianapolis Marion County who
believe they have been treated improperly by an IMPD officer the
opportunity to have his or her complaint(s) both heard and investigated.

HOMELAND SECURITY
Introduction
The Division leads an integrated Department of Public Safety effort to
secure, prevent, prepare, respond and ensure resiliency from natural or
human-made threats and hazards to the city, and to sustain a confident
public.

The Division is also responsible for preparing plans and managing the
safety and security of special events when anticipated requirements exceed
the capability of the concerned geographic area.
The Division of Homeland Security was created by Section 251 of the
revised Municipal Code.

Structure
The Division was formed to unify divisions within the Department of Public
Safety to create the capacity to deal with terrorist attacks, major disasters,
planning and managing special events, and other emergencies. By
embracing a single set of guiding principles, from the Director of Public
Safety to the frontline employee, we have created a single division working
to secure the City of Indianapolis/Marion County.

The Division does not operate in a vacuum. Other Federal, State, and local
institutions participate actively in the Division’s efforts to disrupt terrorist
activities, pre-planning and managing special events, and in the preparation
for and response to major disasters, as do our private and non-profit sectors
and international partners. We will continue to work cooperatively to ensure
that all of the instruments of local power – including leadership, specialized
technical expertise, research, and development investments – are brought to
bear on the challenges we face in a coordinated and unified manner.

MARION COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT
Introduction
The Marion County Superior Court comprises 36 elected judges, 40
commissioners and magistrates, and over 750 staff employees. The Court is
structured into 4 divisions - Civil, Criminal, Juvenile, and Probate. In
addition, there are a number of departments within the Court, including
Probation, Jury Pool, Juvenile Detention Center, Information Technology,
and Family Court.

The Court is structured internally with an Executive Committee of four
judges elected by all Superior Court judges for terms of two years that
oversees the general policy and management of the Court. The Criminal
and Civil Terms have a Chair and each department has a Supervising Judge
appointed by the Executive Committee.

Structure
Court Division
The 36 courts of the Courts Division handle more than 50,000 civil cases
and more than 40,000 criminal cases. Some courts are specialty courts such
as domestic violence, drug, mental health, environmental, and traffic. In
addition, the courts manage programs such as re-entry and community work
crews.
Probation Department
The Probation Department comprises two divisions: adult and juvenile. Its
mission is to enhance community safety by enforcing court orders while
striving to change lives. Probation assists in relieving jail bed concerns
through both pre-trial and probation services. The Juvenile Division
continues to implement strategies endorsed by the Juvenile Detention
Alternative Initiative which has resulted in a substantial reduction in the
number of juveniles having to be held in the Juvenile Detention Center.

Administrative Division
The Administrative Division manages the overall operation of the Courts
including human resources, finance, payroll, facilities management,
procurement, technology, fleet, and staff training.
Juvenile Detention Division
The Marion County Juvenile Detention Center (MCJDC) is a maximum
security holding facility for detained youth. The MCJDC maintains youth,
ages 11-18 years, in a safe and secure environment while allowing
continuity of services. Each youth detained within the MCJDC will
continue their education; continue their mental health and basic health
exercises; and increase healthy social skill-building processes. We are
committed to providing a safe and secure Juvenile Detention Center, while
providing practical, effective, and high-quality services to the youth within
the MCJDC.

MARION COUNTY PROSECUTOR
Introduction
The Marion County Prosecutor’s Office is dedicated to holding criminals
accountable for their actions, preserving the rights of victims and
continually seeking justice, all while maintaining the highest of ethical
standards.

Structure
Major Case
Handles major felony cases, including homicides. Victim Advocates are
assigned to each of these courts, who have the responsibility of notifying
victims of actions taken by the court, court appearances, plea agreements
and trials. The Major Case Division has units dedicated to the prosecution
of sexually based offenses, arson, vice and human trafficking.
Strike
This division is responsible for three (3) areas of crime – drugs, guns and
gangs. Vigorous prosecution of these crimes is essential to the safety of the
community. The Strike Team partners with various police teams to assist in
investigations, arrests, charging decisions and the ultimate presentation of
the case to the court.
Community Prosecution
Community prosecutors are assigned to the various police districts and
special areas. These prosecutors work closely with district commanders and
detectives to develop strategies to protect and defend the communities
served by the individual police districts. Community prosecutors engage in
community outreach programs to bring the criminal justice system to as
many Marion County residents as possible.
Juvenile
Files and prosecutes charges against children 17 years of age and younger.
There are exceptions for more serious crimes that are handled by the adult
courts. This division processes all cases from truancy to armed robbery.
Domestic Violence
Prosecutes all cases involving harmful physical contact, property damage,
threats and violation of court orders that occur between current or former
spouses, family members or those who have or previously had a significant
personal relationship.

D-Felony/Misdemeanor
Handles the prosecution of all misdemeanor and Class D felony criminal
cases. Typical cases include driving while intoxicated, theft, shoplifting,
battery, prostitution, vandalism, moving traffic violations and trespassing.
This division handles more criminal cases than all other divisions
combined.
Grand Jury
For cases involving white collar crime, public corruption, tax evasion and
other longer term investigations, the Prosecutor has a staff of investigators
and lawyers dedicated to the collection of evidence. If criminal activity is
suspected, the evidence is presented to a Grand Jury composed of six (6)
citizens of Marion County that listen to the evidence and determine if
criminal charges are filed.
Criminal Charging
Police agencies present cases to this division for review. Deputy
prosecutors determine what charges are to be brought and what additional
investigation is necessary. The Prosecutor has complete discretion to file
charges, not file charges and which charges are to be filed.
Special Assignments
Currently this division includes a forfeiture unit that seizes property used in
criminal enterprises, a prosecutor training unit that offers in-service training
to deputy prosecutors, a high tech unit that investigates the use of
technology to advance the prosecution mission, a post-conviction unit that
responds to requests for sentence modifications after a person is convicted
of a crime and a check deception unit that prosecutes cases of insufficient
funds checks.

MARION COUNTY PROSECUTOR– CHILD SUPPORT DIVISION
Introduction
The Child Support Division of the Marion County Prosecutor’s Office
provides a wide range of services to parents who need child support
establishment, enforcement, or modification.

Services are provided and authorized through the federal Title IV-D
program and through a cooperative agreement with the Indiana Child
Support Bureau. Services are provided at the downtown office, as well as
branch offices located at Flanner House, Center Township Trustee’s Office,
Wayne Township Trustee’s Office, and the Morris Settles Township Center.

Structure
Legal
Deputy prosecutors are responsible for the review, approval, and
maintenance of the cases assigned to the Child Support Division. These
cases include paternity establishment, petitions for child support, contempt
cases, modifications, medical support, interstate cases, and many additional
issues related to child support. Deputy prosecutors are assigned to sixteen
(16) regular weekly dockets and are assigned to additional hearings as
scheduled by the courts. Deputy prosecutors are aided by two attorney
assistants who work with administrative issues and many other tasks.
Paternity
Staff in this section prepare cases for court, including pleadings, exhibits,
and genetic testing. These cases often are based upon paternity affidavits
executed by the parents and sometimes include interstate cases.
Litigation
Staff provides support for deputy prosecutors, including preparing cases for
thirteen (13) dockets per week, as well as a number of additional court
hearings. Additional services are provided through this section, including
mediation services and the Parents That Work program.
Interstate
A significant number of cases involve parents and children living in other
states. This section is responsible for coordinating communication and
services across state lines, including paternity establishment, medical
support, child support order establishment and enforcement, and
modifications of child support orders.

Intake
In-person interaction with parents is the primary function of this group. In
addition to seeing 100 appointments in an average week, staff meets with
another 90 parents per week as walk-ins. Primary duties include initial case
creation, document preparation, and preparing cases for attorney review.
Branch
Intake functions are also available in the community, allowing parents the
opportunity to obtain services without having to travel downtown. Duties at
the branch locations are substantially the same as the intake division
previously listed.
Internal Services
Staff assigned to this section provide support services to other Child
Support Division employees. These include maintenance of files,
calculating balances on child support accounts, sending income withholding
orders, and working special reports.
Solution Center
Calls to the Child Support Division’s general access number average about
12,500 per month. Staff assigned to this division provide general
information, schedule appointments, assist in coordinating child support
services to callers.

MARION COUNTY COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS
Vision and Mission Statements
Vision
To provide the citizens of Marion County a safer community.

Mission
To enhance public safety by raising offender accountability through the use
of evidence based practices and interventions.

Structure
Home Detention
The electronic equipment used for client monitoring includes active radio
frequency for typical home detention clients as well as global positioning
satellite equipment for high risk offenders, including domestic violence
offenders who are on home detention. Community Corrections also offers
electronic alcohol monitoring equipment. Offenders may be placed on any
combination of Home Detention, GPS, and Alcohol Monitoring. All
offenders under supervision have a variety of programming available.
Community Corrections utilizes the Indiana Risk Assessment System
(IRAS) to assess the risk of reoffending and services needed for all clients
under supervision. Based on overall risk score and identified criminogenic
needs, clients may be placed into the following evidence based programs
presented by trained facilitators: Parenting, Anger Management, Thinking
For a Change, Substance Abuse Treatment, as well as Job Readiness
workshops and GED/ABE. Mental health programming is also available
for those mentally ill offenders who might otherwise have been incarcerated
at the local or the state levels. MCCC has an Addictions Intervention
Component which focuses on addictions issues.

Work Release
In October 2007, the agency opened the Duvall Residential Center which
provides services for male work release offenders and has capacity for up to
350 persons. All residents of Duvall are eligible for the same programming
opportunities as electronic monitoring offenders.
Through contracts with service providers, we are able to serve offenders at
3 other locations. Volunteers of America (VOA) currently provides a total
of 90 beds for male offenders split among General Population, Community
Transition Program, and the Mental Health Component at Brandon Hall.
VOA also operates the Theodora House, which is a residential facility for
60 female offenders. In addition, the Craine House provides the
opportunity for 4 women with pre-school aged children to serve their
sentence in the community while living with their children.

MARION COUNTY ASSESSOR
Introduction
The Marion County Assessor’s main goal is to ensure the accuracy of
property tax assessments. Each property owner pays a fair share of local
government expenses based on the value of the property owned. The
County Assessor is responsible for determining the fair market value of
each property in the county. In addition, the County Assessor processes

inheritance tax returns and determines whether taxpayers are entitled to
charitable and non-profit property tax exemptions. Any time a taxpayer
wishes to appeal an assessment decision, the appeal goes through the
Property Tax Assessment Board of Appeals (PTABOA) hearing process
administered by the County Assessor.

Structure

The Assessment Division assesses all real and business property throughout
the county. This division coordinates the efforts of field personnel, audit
staffs, and valuation experts to perform all phases of the assessment process
in accordance with International Association of Assessing Officers
standards. The division is further divided into functional areas separately
covering commercial, industrial, and residential properties, and reviewing
taxpayers' reports on business personal property. The division has four
satellite offices offering taxpayers a convenient place to obtain residential
assessment information and services.

Data Analysis Division
The Data Analysis Division collects, manages, and analyzes the large
amounts of data needed for both efficient and modern assessment results. It
also creates satellite-coordinated mapping and connects assessment data to
each property geographically. Moreover, the division manages ownership
changes and records as well as maps changes in the property sizes. The
division is responsible for the sales disclosure process which collects,
reviews, and validates all property sales in the county. Finally, the division
organizes this enormous quantity of data into reports and statistics, which is
useful to the Assessment Division and to other government agencies, and is
available for dissemination to citizens over the Internet.

Administration Division
The Administration Division is responsible for budget creation and
monitoring, payroll, human resources administration, facilities
management, procurement, education administration, process improvement,
as well as document management and retention. Further, it administers the
hearing process of the PTABOA and the review of property tax exemption
applications for charities and non-profits. Finally, this division also
conducts the auditing and processing of inheritance tax returns.

MARION COUNTY SURVEYOR
Introduction
Marion County Surveyor's Office was established by the Indiana
Constitution in 1851. General Land Office surveys in what is now Marion
County began in 1819. Marion County is part of the rectangular survey
system (Public Land System), which divides the land into sections that are
one square mile. All real estate boundaries in Marion County can be traced
back to the Public Land System. Statute law requires the Surveyor to

recheck at least five percent of the section corners each year, there are over
2000 corners. The Marion County Surveyor’s Office maintains a Legal
Survey Record Book and a Corner Record Book. No fee is charged for
surveying services provided to any city, county and other governmental
agencies.

Structure
Surveying
In the field, the staff performs the precise measurements of Section Corners
and ties, per Indiana Code and replacing said monuments as necessary. We
monitor the Eagle Creek Dam for horizontal and vertical movement as well
as performing vital research within the office.
Information Technology
Information Technology supports the needs of the Surveyor’s Office. This
area compiles the data surveyors collect in the field by use of AutoCAD and
GIS software. Further, that data along with both the corner history and
drawing (which this department provides) is posted onto the county’s
website. We collect and quality check all measurements to ensure accurate,
reliable information is provided.

Preservation
Preservation is as much a part of the surveyor’s office as surveying and
technology. We believe in the importance of preserving our past for the
future generations. Understanding the necessity of creating legible
electronic copies of the records, maps, surveys and plats housed in the
surveyor’s office to ensure that they will be easily accessible for years to
come. By concentrating on this now we have been able to scan or have
scanned already deteriorating documents.

Having a greater reliance on new technology has helped the Surveyor’s
office to build a solid fiscal commitment to provide government and private
sector agencies and companies timely, accurate and useful information,
while helping us and these agencies and companies save taxpayers money
and time. Finally, these advancements in technology have enabled us to
fulfill our legal obligation for the completion of the Alcohol & Tobacco
Commission’s Verification of Business Location forms.

Debt Service
The Consolidated City carries different types of debt associated with
various programs and services. This debt takes on two forms: (1)
general obligation debt, which is supported by a pledge of the full
faith and credit of the Consolidated City and is usually funded by tax
revenue, and (2) special revenue debt, which is supported by a
pledge of a specific revenue stream.

Special Revenue Debt
Special revenue debt is mostly associated with Tax Increment
Financing (TIF) districts throughout Marion County. This debt is
supported through property tax increment capture. This financing
tool is used to develop and grow various communities and
neighborhoods that otherwise would have little growth potential.

Generally, the revenue stream pledged for special revenue debt is a
fee or other non-tax revenue. In the case of debt funded by tax
increment financing (TIF), tax increment revenue captured is
segregated from the regular property tax revenue of the Consolidated
City.

TIF funds, including debt service for TIF bonds, are not appropriated
by the City-County Council. In Marion County, the Metropolitan
Development Commission (MDC) serves as the fiscal body for TIF
funds.

The Consolidated City of Indianapolis, Marion County takes pride
and care in maintaining its AAA (stable) credit rating for its general
obligation debt.
General Obligation Debt
Most of the Consolidated City’s general obligation debt is related to
transportation, parks, and emergency communications infrastructure.
Other general obligation debt is related to police and fire pension
costs as well as redevelopment efforts throughout the Consolidated
City.

Other special revenue debt includes economic development bonds
which are typically supported by a revenue stream generated by a
specific investment. An example would be a bond issued to finance a
parking garage with the parking fees pledged to pay the debt service.
Another example would be financing stormwater projects,
undertaken by the Consolidated City to address flood control
problems, with stormwater fees pledged to paying the debt service.
TIF debt service and other special revenue debt service is not
included in tables presented in this report, but is available separately.

Debt service payments for general obligation debt are typically
funded entirely, or in part, with tax revenue. Only tax-supported debt
service is included in tables presented in this report.

Pension and Disability Fund pension plan, is administered by the
Indiana Public Retirement System (INPRS), which is appropriated and
expensed as part of the Department of Public Safety’s (DPS’)
Character One appropriations from the IMPD and IFD General Funds
for the respective divisions.

Marion County
Presented to the

August 15, 2011

5

August 15, 2011
To the Members of the Indianapolis City County Council,
It is my distinct honor to present the 2012 Budget for the Consolidated City of Indianapolis, Marion County. This balanced budget proposal funds
the critical operations of government, protects taxpayers and sets Indianapolis on a strong fiscal course during uncertain economic times.
The budget presented within the following pages is a responsible plan that includes no tax increases, no borrowing, and is fully funded. It maintains
the strong fiscal position of Indianapolis and preserves our place as a low tax and attractive place for people to work, live, and raise a family.
Due to the effects of property tax caps, which I strongly support, and the national economic downturn, our tax revenue continues to decline. Thus, it
is imperative that city government continue to find savings and improve processes. This maintains the our commitment to public safety by holding
funding level for public safety and criminal justice functions while reducing spending by 6% percent for all other agencies. It calls for no layoffs in
the ranks of our police and firefighters and honors their contractual pay raise in 2012.
The world is watching as the weight of deficit spending exacts a heavy toll in Washington, D.C. and in capitols across Europe. Indianapolis will not
follow their lead. We will do as Hoosiers have always done and make the difficult choices to live within our means.
I welcome your review, and I look forward to fruitful discussions about this budget.
Sincerely,

Gregory A. Ballard
Mayor
City of Indianapolis

Executive Summary
Fiscal Circumstances
The 2012 budget for the Consolidated City of Indianapolis, Marion County poses an interesting challenge: how to navigate a sharp and sustained
downturn in revenues without derailing the City from the path of progress upon which it is set. This proposed budget arrives at the confluence of
three daunting fiscal challenges facing our City and municipalities across the State and the nation. Our 2012 revenues will reflect the depths of the
Great Recession of 2010. State laws defining both the distribution of local income taxes and calculation of local property taxes result in a two year
lag between economic events and municipal government revenue impacts. Consequently, projected 2012 income tax revenues for the Consolidated
City are down $85 million from their peak in 2010 (a drop of more than 30%).
This sharp income tax decline, which hit heavily in 2011, depleted the operating reserves the City had thoughtfully built up in 2008, 2009, and
2010. This contributes further to our 2012 fiscal challenges.
The upward trajectory of fixed costs such as contractual raises, health insurance coverage, municipal pension benefits, and fuel completes a triad
of fiscal factors converging in 2012. Together these three factors, along with some essential non-recurring additional costs, define a $64 million
fiscal challenge for the City of Indianapolis in 2012. Yet despite similar circumstances undermining the desires and goals of municipalities across
the country, there remains much reason for optimism here.
Key Financial Features
This 2012 proposed budget offers a roadmap through a difficult fiscal time, without putting at risk the key foundational principles upon which the
City’s continued success is based. It leaves the City poised to excel, regionally and nationally, in the post-recession environment that will
inevitably come.
This budget’s four key features are: 1) it does not increase the tax burden on a recovering local economy; 2) is does not increase the City’s general
debt burden which would mitigate the opportunities for future investments; 3) it does make generational investments in repairing the City’s critical
physical infrastructure; and 4) it does maintain high level commitments to protecting the public’s safety.
Beyond these core features, the 2012 budget will allow the City to continue its aggressive and successful efforts in new business development and
attraction; to elevate its international stature; and to innovate in education to make Indianapolis a city of choice for young families.

1

To navigate this path successfully, we must thoughtfully use the limited resources provided by the City’s taxpayers. To keep the City on track, the
2012 budget plan is built on these key financial features:
9 seeking a reimbursement of not more than $40 million from the Downtown tax increment financing district (TIF) for past city infrastructure
improvements expenses benefiting the Downtown TIF;
9 seeking a reimbursement of up to $4 million from the Indianapolis Capital Improvements Board (CIB) for extraordinary public safety costs
related to the 2012 Super Bowl; and,
9 requiring all non-public safety and criminal justice departments and agencies to spend grudgingly and find cost saving process improvements
to yield $20M in base budget savings.
In addition to seeking reimbursement from the Downtown TIF, this budget also releases approximately $170 million of tax increment assessed
value (AV) to the general tax base for 2012. This action will benefit all taxing units across the county.
This financial plan will also enable the City to continue its investments in core information systems to modernize internal operations and financial
controls. This is an investment necessary to both support productivity gains essential to navigating lean times and prepare the City to continue to
excel over the long term.
Notably, the $425 million in cash proceeds provided by the transfer of the water and wastewater utilities to Citizens Energy Group puts the City in
the enviable position of being able to invest in its physical infrastructure while many other municipalities across the nation continue to struggle.
The proceeds from the transfer will fund improvements to roads, bridges, sidewalks, and the demolition and deconstruction of abandoned
properties through Mayor Ballard's RebuildIndy program.
Mayor Ballard is protecting RebuildIndy funds from being used for general government programs. Thus, no RebuildIndy funds are being used in
2012 operating budget. Additionally, $80 million is set aside for a new Fiscal Stability Fund to maintain the City’s AAA credit rating. This $80
million will not be spent for any purpose until they are no longer necessary to maintain our AAA rating; then, those funds will be returned to the
RebuildIndy Fund for investment in infrastructure projects.
To date, more than $140 million has been invested to improve roads, bridges, and sidewalks in every part of our City. By year-end, another $40
million will be invested for these purposes and the demolition and deconstruction of hundreds of abandoned properties. In 2012 and beyond,
Mayor Ballard’s RebuildIndy program will invest more than $200 million dollars over the next few years.
Specific Budget Elements
With this budget the City’s ability to deliver high quality snow and ice removal services this winter and required street and walkway repairs next
spring remains intact. Work will also continue, in earnest, on flood control improvements across the City in 2012. Curbside recycling is being
added to the standard trash removal services, in selected neighborhoods, with a goal of expanding it countywide. Because the Department of

2

Public Works (DPW) is not funded with income taxes, their 2012 budget need not be adjusted in response to the downturn in that revenue stream.
That said, the City will continue to strive for savings and service level improvements within DPW.
The same is true for the Department of Code Enforcement (DCE). It will continue to operate at the level their dedicated, non-fungible revenues
support. DCE charges fees only to those who use its service, freeing all taxpayers of the burden of funding this department; so, its funding level
depends more on the effectiveness of its operations than on the general tax revenue climate of local government.
For the general tax-supported County agencies and City departments, this budget demands active and effective management. The core public
safety and criminal justices agencies, which account for about 85% of the general fund budget, are each funded at or near 100% of their 2011
appropriation level. This can be accomplished only because of an affirmative decision to focus additional resources received from the Downtown
TIF and the CIB on the City’s core public safety and criminal justice responsibilities. The agencies and departments in this group are: the
Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department (IMPD); the Indianapolis Fire Department (IFD); Department of Homeland Security (DHS); Animal
Care & Control (ACC); the Marion County Sheriff Department (MCSD); the Superior & Circuit Courts; the Marion County Prosecutor Office
(MCPO); the Public Defender Agency; Forensic Services; and Community Corrections.
Additional key features of the proposed funding for public safety and criminal justice are:
9 1% contractual salary increases for police officers, firefighters, park rangers, and public safety officers will be honored; and
9 the City’s $2 million Crime Prevention Grant program will be continued.
For the other tax-supported general government functions, 2012 funding is about 94% of 2011 appropriation levels. The proposed budgets for
these other departments and agencies fully reflect the impact of the downturn in tax revenues. The City departments in this group are: the Mayor’s
Office; the City-County Council Office; the Public Safety Director’s Office; the Parks Department; Channel 16; and the other administrative
functions of city government. The County agencies in the group are: the Auditor’s Office; the Assessor’s Office, the Clerk’s Office and Election
Board/Voter Registration, the Coroner’s Office; ; the Recorder’s Office, the Surveyor’s Office, the Treasurer’s Office; and Cooperative Extension
Services.
Additional key features of the proposed funding for these other general government functions are:
9 continued capital investment in park grounds and facilities to further enhance these key public assets; and
9 the City’s $1 million grant to the Indianapolis Arts Council will be continued.
Finally, the matter of funding for the Indianapolis/Marion County Public Library (IMCPL) has also been a growing concern over the past few
years. During the recently concluded 2011 session of the Indiana General Assembly, municipal finance laws governing Marion County were
changed to allow a portion of the County Option Income Tax (COIT) to be allocated to the IMCPL. The fact that COIT revenues are currently in
decline makes the idea of adding new uses for these scarce funds less appealing fiscally in 2012; however, with an eye on the long haul, adding the

3

library to the COIT is the right policy. This budget sets an allocation of COIT for IMCPL at 1/10% of the county total or $149,702 in 2012. If
adopted, this will position the IMCPL to share in the future economic growth of the City in ways that their property tax levy does not provide.

The Budget Process
Even in tight times, the typical budgeting process in government is focused on the allocation of incremental resources (i.e. seeking highest and best
use for the additional funds available). Given the fiscal circumstances outlined above, the budget development process for 2012 followed an
atypical path. Though for the past three years, it could be said that the City’s budget process has been in an atypical cycle. Appropriation
reductions have been demanded each cycle to address a projected deficit inherited in 2008 and then in response to the new property tax caps that
reduced property tax revenues sharply beginning in 2009.
With tax revenues continuing a downward trajectory in 2012, the budget instructions issued in May directed all agencies and departments to assess
the impacts of executing their missions in 2012 with 5% less funding than provided in 2011. This was done in preparation for tax revenue
estimates that were not to be finalized until early August. Thus, agency and department budget submissions did not represent an unfettered
estimate of their 2012 operational funding requests. Rather, they were a tool to require early assessments of continued operational changes that
might be necessary in 2012 with less funding. After a decision to seek reimbursement from the Downtown TIF was settled on, only then were
final funding levels able to be set for each agency and department.
The process of setting agency and department budgets was much more than an exercise in reducing appropriations proportionally to match
available funds. Not only was the decision made to set differential funding levels for public safety and criminal justice operations, but a serious
effort was made to account for the unique effects of fixed operating cost increases on individual agency and department budgets. Finally, nonrecurring unusual costs for 2012 were factored in where appropriate. As a result, many budgets may not appear to fit neatly into either the 100%
funding or the 94% funding category at first glance. Changes to the allocation of internal chargebacks for information technology and legal
services play a large role in these adjustments. To accommodate all of this, base budgets were calculated for each agency and department.
Reductions in response to declining revenues were made to the base budgets, then some funding was restored to each budget to reflect individual
changes in fixed costs and internal chargebacks. Thus, shifts in internal cost allocations, corrections of past budget errors, and non-recurring items
were all accounted for appropriately.
Looking Ahead
Despite challenging financial times, the 2012 budget for the City and County once again sets forth a responsible plan by which agencies can
continue serving all citizens of Marion County, making Indianapolis a safe, livable city now and for decades to come. With a sharp rebound in
local income tax revenues anticipated in 2014, positioning the City for continued success from that point forward was paramount to the budget
decisions made in 2012.

FY 2012 Introduced Budget - Agency Summary

Marion County Surveyor
Introduction to the Marion County Surveyor’s Office
Marion County Surveyor's Office was established by the Indiana Constitution in 1851. Marion County is part of the rectangular survey
system (Public Land System), which divides the land into sections that are one square mile. All real estate boundaries in Marion County
can be traced back to the Public Land System. Statutory law requires the Surveyor to recheck at least five percent of the section corners
each year, there are over 2000 corners. The Marion County Surveyor’s Office maintains a Legal Survey Record Book and a Corner
Record Book. No fee is charged for the services provided to any city, county and other governmental agencies.

Department/Agency Structure
The Marion County Surveyor's Office has three areas of focus, each with their own operational goals and activities while being unified
by a common vision.

Surveying
The Surveying Division performs the measurements of
Section Corners, and ties. This division collects that data
from the field measurements along with the history of said
corner. The division also provides data for right-of-way
surveys, drainage surveys, building locations,
improvements with regard to zoning violations, and
prepares plans for ditches, drains, and streams. Finally, the
Surveying Division monitors the Eagle Creek Dam for
horizontal and vertical movement and replaces Harrison
Monuments, which mark some of the section corners.

Information Technology
The Information Technology Division can now support the
volume level required of the Surveyor’s Office. This division
compiles the data that the Surveying Division collects in the field
by use of AutoCAD. Further, this division posts that data along
with both the history and drawing, which this department
provides, onto the county’s website. Finally, the Information
Technology Division collects and quality checks all
measurements to ensure accurate, reliable information is
provided.

Customer Service
The Customer Service Division provides a knowledgeable
customer service for the citizens and professionals that call or
visit the Surveyor's Office for copies of maps, surveys, or
subdivision plats.

FY 2012 Introduced Budget - Agency Summary

Consolidated City and County Debt Service
Introduction to Debt Service
The Consolidated City of Indianapolis, Marion County carries different types of debt associated with different programs and services affecting
many agencies and departments. The Consolidated City and County has general obligation debt supported by taxpayer revenues, as well as
revenue debt supported with fees and non-taxpayer supported revenues. The Consolidated City of Indianapolis, Marion County enjoys a AAA
(stable) credit rating.
General obligation debt is related to transportation, parks and emergency communications infrastructure. In addition, other general obligation
debt is related to police and fire pension costs and redevelopment efforts throughout the Consolidated City and County.

Revenue debt is mostly associated with Tax Increment Finance (TIF) districts throughout Marion County. Most of this debt is supported
through tax increment which is used to develop and grow various communities and neighborhoods that otherwise would have little to no
growth potential. Other revenue debt includes costs related to the sanitation liquid/sewer projects being started or in construction in order for
the Consolidated City and County to meet its requirements of the EPA Consent Decree.

Funds
The Indiana State Board of Accounts (SBOA) defines “fund” to
mean “cash or a group of accounts set aside for the purpose of
accounting for monies or other resources of general functions or
specific activities . . . in accordance with the system of accounts
prescribed by the State Board of Accounts or as required by statute”
(State Board of Accounts, Accounting and Uniform Compliance
Guidelines Manual for Cities and Towns, State of Indiana, reissued
2006).

Fund; Parks General Fund; Public Safety Income Tax Fund –
County; Public Safety Income Tax Fund – City; Personal Services
Contingency Fund – County; Personal Services Contingency Fund –
City; Guardian Ad Litem Fund; and Medical Care for Inmates Fund.
What all of these funds have in common is that they each will each
receive a substantial amount of flexible tax revenue. Thus, there is
the ability to reallocate the flexible revenue flowing to these funds
across many competing operational needs.

Funds that the SBOA prescribes for use by cities include but are not
limited to, general funds, special revenue funds, debt services funds,
capital projects funds, internal service funds, and agency funds.
Funds included in the 2016 Introduced Budget represent those that
require appropriation by the City-County Council. Appropriation is
the authorization of the City-County Council by ordinance to make
disbursements or to incur obligations for specific purposes.

Dedicated Funds
Dedicated funds, on the other hand, are funds which receive revenue
from taxes or non-tax sources that have very restricted legal uses. A
more apt of a dedicated fund description is a fund that receives little
or no revenue from flexible tax revenue sources. Some examples are
the Parking Meter Fund and the Permits Fund. These are both
dedicated funds because their revenue sources have strictly limited
legal uses.

General Funds
General funds are funds which receive a substantial share of their
revenue from taxes that have very broad flexibility. For example, the
1% County Option Income Tax (COIT) distributions and the County
General Fund property tax levy may legally be used to fund any
governmental purpose.

The Consolidated City also uses dedicated funds to account for the
proceeds of specific revenue sources (e.g., special revenue funds)
and/or for expenditures restricted to a specific purpose (e.g. debt
service funds; enterprise funds). Debt service funds (aka sinking
funds) are used to account for the accumulation of revenue for the
payment of long-term debt principal and interest.

The core general operating funds for the Consolidated City are:
County General Fund; Consolidated County General Fund (aka City
General Fund); Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department
(IMPD) General Fund; Indianapolis Fire Department (IFD) General

Grant Funds
Finally, the Consolidated City also employs grant funds to collect
revenues and track expenditures for grant monies received from
other units of government.

Revenues
State law requires adoption of a balanced budget, which shall include
all anticipated revenues and expenses of every organizational unit
(with the exception of utilities). As such, all appropriations adopted
by the City-County Council must be fully supported by (1) revenue
that is legally eligible to support proposed expenses, and/or (2) fund
balance (essentially prior year, unencumbered revenue) that is legally
eligible to support the proposed expense.

The Consolidated City relies primarily on property and income taxes
to fund its operations. However, a significant amount of revenue is
derived from Fees and Charges as well as from Federal and State
Grants. The following pages provide more detailed information
about property tax rates, levies and districts as well as the various
types of income taxes, tax rates as well as the available uses of such
funds.

Property Tax
Citizens of the Consolidated City are subject to several overlapping
property tax districts which levy taxes for city and county general
purpose funds, as well as specific services. Taxpayers residing in
overlapping districts would be subject to the tax rates of each
applicable district.
Certified Levy (Gross Levy)
The total property tax levy for a taxing unit before the property tax
cap is considered. Referred to as “certified” because it is approved
by the State Department of Local Government Finance (DLGF).
DLGF approval is required to ensure that the levy amount is within
maximum levy limitations set by State law.
Net Levy
The expected property tax levy after deducting the property tax
circuit breaker credits attributable to the property tax caps.
Gross Assessed Value
The assessed value of a property before applying any eligible
property tax deductions or abatements (which lower the property’s
taxable assessed value). The property tax caps are set based on each
parcel’s gross assessed value.
Net Assessed Value (Taxable Assessed Value)
The taxable value of property after all eligible property tax
deductions and abatements are applied.

Property Tax Cap (aka Circuit Breaker)
The property tax cap, also known as the “circuit breaker,” was
enacted by the Indiana General Assembly in 2008 and subsequently
amended into the Indiana Constitution. The cap guarantees that
property tax rates in overlapping districts cannot exceed a certain
capped percent of the parcel’s gross assessed value. The “circuit
breaker” amount represents property tax liability waived because it is
above the level allowed under the property tax caps. The property
tax caps are as follows:
1% - for Homestead property
2% - for other residential property and agricultural land
3% - for commercial and industrial property
Taxing Districts & Rates
The following pages show the taxing districts along with the Net
Assessed Values (NAV) of taxable property within those districts
for pay year 2016. The Tax Rate for a district is determined by the
following formula:

Income Tax
State law allows Indiana counties to impose a local income tax on
the State adjusted gross income of county taxpayers.
Also, counties may choose between several income tax options and
combinations. Each type of local income tax option is regulated by
specific rules and rate restrictions. Residents of Marion County are
subject to three interrelated income taxes in the form of the County
Option Income Tax (COIT), the Levy Freeze Local Option Income
Tax (LOIT), and the Public Safety Income Tax (PST).
This local income tax is collected by the State Department of
Revenue then distributed to counties based on the amount due to
each county on State income tax returns processed.
County Income Tax Council (CITC)
Local income tax is imposed or modified in a county by the action of
the CITC. In Marion County, the CITC is composed of the CityCounty Council and the fiscal body of each city or town that lies
either partially or entirely within the county. The other members of
the CITC are the Lawrence City Council, the Beech Grove City
Council, the Southport City Council, and the Speedway Town
Council.
Voting representation on the CITC is based on each member unit’s
share of the total county population. In Marion County, the CityCounty Council holds over 90% of the voting representation on the
CITC.

County Option Income Tax (COIT)
Current Rate: 1.00% Maximum Rate: 1.00%

COIT revenue may be used for any lawful purpose of the
governmental unit.
Levy Freeze Local Option Income Tax (LOIT)
Current Rate: 0.27% Maximum Rate: 1.00%

An additional income tax rate may be imposed to generate revenue to
replace property tax levy growth. Thus, imposing this tax reflects a
policy choice to shift fiscal reliance from property tax to income tax,
not an overall tax increase.
Once imposed, this rate may neither be rescinded nor decreased.
Each year the CITC must hold at least one public meeting to discuss
whether or not Levy Freeze LOIT rate should be increased.
Public Safety Income Tax (PST)
Current Rate: 0.50% Maximum Rate: 0.50%

Because Marion County has imposed a Levy Freeze LOIT rate, State
law allows adoption of a PST rate. PST revenues may be used for
police and fire, including pensions, emergency services,
communications systems, jails and related facilities, and other items
related to public safety.

THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK

Expenditures
Expenditure Categories (Characters)
In addition to the restrictions imposed by agencies/departments
regarding funding sources, agency spending is further restricted by
limiting the total funds available to support various spending
categories or “characters”. The Consolidated City employs five
separate characters to segregate spending. Each is described as
follows:

Properties and Equipment (Character 4)
This category includes expenditures for the acquisition of, or
addition to assets such as land, infrastructure, buildings,
improvements other than buildings, as well as machinery and
equipment.

Internal Charges (Character 5)
Personal Services (Character 1)
This category includes expenditures for salaries, wages and related
employee benefits provided for all Consolidated City employees.
Employee benefits include employer contributions to group health
and life insurance, pension benefits, unemployment compensation,
uniform allowance and similar benefits.

This category includes internal charges such as expenditures for the
Mayor’s Action Center, the Office of Corporation Counsel and Fleet
Services.
If a department has a negative appropriation for Character 5, it
means that department is a provider of internal services and a net
recipient of internal charges.

Materials and Supplies (Character 2)
This category includes articles and commodities that are consumed
or materially altered when used. Supplies include office supplies,
operating supplies, repair and maintenance supplies and other similar
items.

Other Services and Charges (Character 3)

This category exists for only City departments. Similar expenditures
from county agencies are reported as Character 3 instead. Since the
Information Services Agency (ISA) is a County agency, their
charges are not administered through Character 5. Both City
departments and County agencies pay ISA charges through
Character 3.

This category includes expenditures for services other than personal
services required by the Consolidated City either to carry out its
assigned functions or to fulfill moral or legal obligations. Other
Services and Charges includes professional services, communication
and transportation, printing and advertising, insurance (excluding
group health, life and self-insurance), utility expenditures, contracted
repairs and maintenance, rentals, debt service expenditures for
principal and interest payments as well as long-term debt.

The Agency Budget Summaries section:
1) provides an operational overview of each of the county agencies
and city departments;
2) details the funding sources that will fund each
agency/department; and
3) outlines how those agencies/departments intend to spend those
funds by expenditure category or “character”.

Sources
The “Sources” listed for each agency/department budget represents
either a single or a collection of funding sources available to an
agency/department (See the Funds section for further explanation).

Final vs. Adopted vs. Revised vs. Introduced
For the purpose of comparison, each summary shows recent
historical data for agency/department budgets. The following
explains the terminology used in these comparisons.
Budget Introduced shows the amounts budgeted for each
agency/department as determined by agency/department finance
officers and the Office of Finance and Management. This is the
budget introduced by the Mayor to the City-County Council for
amendment and eventual adoption.

agency/department as adopted by the City-County Council in

separate expenditure “Characters” to categorize these uses (See the
Expenditures section for explanation of these characters).

Budget Revised shows the budget as amended through fiscal
ordinances approved by the City-County Council throughout the
fiscal year

DPS ADMINISTRATION
Introduction
The City of Indianapolis Department of Public Safety (DPS) will remain a national model leveraging the unique strengths of the Police, Fire, Homeland Security,
Animal Care and Control, and Communications Divisions as an integrated department. DPS will deliver the highest quality of public safety services in a fiscally
effective manner to secure the Greater Indianapolis area by preventing, preparing for, responding to, and recovering from routine emergencies and large-scales
incidents. The Administration unit of DPS provides coordination and leadership for the agencies within DPS.
Structure
The Department of Public Safety comprises five integrated divisions as well as the Citizens Police Complaint Office (CPCO) and the Mayor’s Office of Re-Entry.
The Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department, Indianapolis Fire Department, Division of Homeland Security, Animal Care and Control, and Public Safety
Communications operate within one department and share resources in innovative ways. This structure increases operational effectiveness by leveraging the
strengths of each division to provide public safety services to the City of Indianapolis/Marion County. Each of the divisions has their own operational goals and
unique personalities. The Department of Public Safety was created by Section 251 of the revised municipal code. CPCO, independent of the Indianapolis
Metropolitan Police Department, was created by city ordinance. The CPCO affords citizens of the Consolidated City of Indianapolis Marion County who believe
they have been treated improperly by an IMPD officer the opportunity to have his or her complaint(s) both heard and investigated. Mayor Gregory Ballard
established the Office of Re-Entry to develop collaborative partnerships among government, businesses, faith-based organizations, and community members to
leverage resources, to ensure sustainability by enhancing crime prevention strategies, and evaluating outcomes based on data collection and quality of life
enhancement, for ex-offenders and the community.

DIVISION OF HOMELAND SECURITY
Introduction
The Division leads an integrated Department of Public Safety effort to secure, prevent, prepare, respond, investigate, and ensure resiliency from natural or humanmade threats and hazards to the city, and to sustain a confident public. The Division is also responsible for preparing plans and managing the safety and security of
special events when anticipated requirements exceed the capability of the concerned geographic area. The Division of Homeland Security was created by Section
251 of the revised Municipal Code.
Structure
The Division was formed to unify divisions within the Department of Public Safety to create the capacity to deal with terrorist attacks, major disasters, planning and
managing special events, and other emergencies. By embracing a single set of guiding principles, from the Director of Public Safety to the frontline employee, we
have created a single division working to secure the City of Indianapolis/Marion County.
The Division does not operate in a vacuum. Other Federal, State, and local institutions participate actively in the Division’s efforts to work within the intelligence
community, investigate, disrupt terrorist activities, pre-planning and managing special events, and in the preparation for and response to major disasters, as do our
private and non-profit sectors and international partners. We will continue to work cooperatively to ensure that all of the instruments of local power – including
leadership, specialized technical expertise, research, and development investments – are brought to bear on the challenges we face in a coordinated and unified
manner.

MARION COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT
Introduction
The Marion County Superior Court is comprised of 36 elected judges, 39 commissioners and magistrates and over 700 employees. The Court is structured into four
divisions; Civil, Criminal, Juvenile, and Probate. Additionally, Probation, Juvenile Detention Center, and Court Administration all function as independent
departments/divisions under the purview of the court.
The Court is structured internally with an Executive Committee consisting of four judges elected by all Superior Court judges for two year terms. The Executive
Committee oversees the general policy and management of the Court. The Criminal and Civil Terms each have a chair who is appointed by the Executive
Committee to serve a two-year term. Specific departments also have Advisory Judges who provide policy input regarding the respective department.

Structure
Court
The 36 courts of the Court Division handle more than 45,000 civil cases and
more than 50,000 criminal cases each year. Some courts are specialty and/or
problem solving courts such as domestic violence, drug, mental health, and
traffic. The Traffic Division handles over 70,000 cases each year.
Probation Department
The Probation Department is comprised of two divisions: adult and juvenile.
Its mission is to enhance community safety by enforcing court orders while
striving to change lives. Probation assists in relieving jail bed concerns
through both pre-trial and post-adjudication services. The Juvenile Division
continues to implement strategies endorsed by the Juvenile Detention
Alternative Initiative which has resulted in a substantial reduction in the
number of juveniles being detained in the Juvenile Detention Center.

Court Administration
Court Administration manages and supports the overall operation of the
Courts including human resources, finance, payroll, facilities management,
procurement, information technology, fleet, and staff training.
Juvenile Detention
The Marion County Juvenile Detention Center (MCJDC) is a secured
detention facility for detained youth. The MCJDC maintains youth, ages 1118 years, in a safe and secure environment while allowing continuity of
services. Each youth detained within the MCJDC attends school, receives
medical and dental care, participates in mental health and basic health
exercises and learns basic life skills. The Marion Superior Court is
committed to providing a safe and secure Juvenile Detention Center while
providing practical, effective, and high-quality living and learning services
for the detained youth.

MARION COUNTY PROSECUTOR
Introduction
The Marion County Prosecutor’s Office seeks to place public safety as the number one priority and responsibility of government. We are dedicated to holding
criminals accountable for their actions, preserving the rights of victims and continually seeking justice, all while maintaining the highest of ethical standards.

Structure
Criminal Charging Division
Law enforcement agencies present cases to this division for criminal
charging determinations. Deputy prosecutors determine what charges are to
be filed in each case, or if additional investigation is necessary.

Special Victims Team
This division of the office includes cases involving sex crimes, domestic
violence and child abuse. It also collaborates with the Julian Center and
Child Advocacy Center.

Major Case Division
The Major Case Division handles major felony cases, including homicides.
Victim Advocates are assigned to each of these courts to ensure that victims
are notified of actions taken by the court and that they receive guidance and
support throughout the criminal justice process. Within the Major Case
Division, a Special Crimes Team includes prosecutors dedicated to human
trafficking, arson and unemployment insurance fraud.

Community Prosecution Division
Community prosecutors are assigned to police districts and special areas.
These prosecutors work closely with district commanders and detectives to
develop strategies tailored to the communities they serve. Community
prosecutors encourage community participation in public safety and crime
prevention, engaging residents in problem solving and establishing and
maintaining partnerships.

Grand Jury Division
Investigators assigned to the MCPO conduct long-term investigations in
cases involving white collar crime, public corruption and tax evasion. If
criminal activity is suspected, the evidence is presented to a Grand Jury
composed of six citizens of Marion County to determine if criminal charges
are filed.

Juvenile Division
This division is responsible for filing and prosecuting acts of delinquency
by children 17 years of age and younger, including truancy cases. In certain
cases, more serious crimes can be directly filed to the adult criminal court.

Strike Team
The Strike Team focuses on three (3) areas of crime – drugs, guns and
gangs. The Strike Team partners with various police departments and state
and federal agencies throughout the county to assist in investigations,
arrests, charging decisions and the presentation of the case to the court.
Forfeiture Division
Through partnerships with state and federal law enforcement agencies, the
Forfeiture Division strives to reduce the profitability of crime by seizing the
proceeds of criminal activity as allowed by state law. This goal is
accomplished by filing proceedings in civil courts whereby a judge may
determine that property owned by a defendant is subject to forfeiture.

Level 6 Felony/Misdemeanor Division
This division handles the prosecution of misdemeanor and Level 6 Felony
criminal cases. Cases include operating a vehicle while intoxicated, moving
traffic violations, theft, battery, resisting law enforcement, carrying a
handgun without a license and trespassing. This division handles more
criminal cases than all other divisions combined.
Correction Division
This division responds to all requests for post-conviction relief and for
sentence modifications. This division also handles all requests for
expungement of arrests and convictions and the sealing of criminal records.

MARION COUNTY COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS
Vision and Mission Statements
Vision
To provide the citizens of Marion County a safer community.

Mission
To enhance public safety by raising offender accountability through the use
of evidence based practices and interventions.

Structure
Home Detention
The electronic equipment used for client monitoring includes active radio
frequency for typical home detention clients as well as global positioning
satellite equipment for high risk offenders, including domestic violence
offenders who are on home detention. Community Corrections also offers
electronic alcohol monitoring equipment. Offenders may be placed on any
combination of Home Detention, GPS and Alcohol Monitoring. All offenders
under supervision have a variety of programming available.
Community Corrections utilizes the Indiana Risk Assessment System (IRAS)
to assess the risk of reoffending and services needed for all clients under
supervision. Based on overall risk score and identified criminogenic needs,
clients may be placed into the following evidence based programs presented
by trained facilitators: Parenting, Anger Management, Thinking For a
Change, Substance Abuse Treatment, as well as Job Readiness workshops
and GED/ABE. Mental health programs are also available for mentally ill
offenders who might otherwise have been incarcerated at the local or the state
levels.

In October 2007, the agency opened the Duvall Residential Center which
provides services for male work release offenders and has capacity for up to
350 persons. All residents of Duvall are eligible for the same programming
opportunities as electronic monitoring offenders.

DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS
Introduction
The Indianapolis Department of Public Works (DPW) aims to improve residents’ quality of life through multi-modal connectivity, green space, capital improvements,
universal accessibility, and collaborative public and private partnerships. DPW builds and maintains public infrastructure, park land, manages solid waste collection and
the city’s entire fleet—striving always to provide effective, efficient customer service to citizens and visitors to Indianapolis, Marion County and ensuring a healthy,
safe, and natural environment.

Structure
Leadership
DPW is led by a director appointed by the mayor. The director is supported
directly by a chief of staff. Under DPW leadership are several offices that can
be organized into four main divisions: Policy and Planning, Engineering, Fleet
Services, and Operations. These four divisions are not rigid: On a day-to-day
basis, they merge to solve problems and increase livability across the City and
Marion County.
Policy and Planning
The Policy and Planning division works cooperatively to manage the
administration of the entire department, as directed by DPW leadership. This
division includes finance, the city-county council liaison, communications, the
Office of Sustainability, and the Office of Disability Affairs. While the Office of
Sustainability and the Office of Disability Affairs are housed within DPW and
report to the DPW director, they oversee livability and ADA issues for the entire
City and County. The offices within Policy and Planning work closely with
DPW leadership as well as deputy directors and administrators in Engineering,
Operations, and Fleet Services to ensure policies are developed and
implemented with fidelity, efficiency, and quality.
Operations:
The Operations division is responsible for solid waste collection and disposal;
maintenance of streets, traffic systems, levees, dams, as well as park facilities
and grounds; forestry work; and snow and ice removal from City streets. This
division is comprised of both union and non-union employees. The work
performed in DPW’s Operations division requires highly skilled, dedicated staff;
for that reason, DPW safety and training are housed in this division, as well.

Engineering Division
The Engineering division plans, designs, constructs, and maintains all streets,
storm water systems, roads, bridges, multi-modal paths, trails, parks, green
spaces, and thoroughfares. It is also responsible for access control, traffic
control, and lights for these assets. Furthermore, the Engineering division
manages the development of studies, inventories, programs, and projects—and
manages all contracts related to transportation and storm water infrastructure.
DPW’s Engineering division oversees parks capital development and land
stewardship activities as well. Engineering—in collaboration with Operations
and Fleet Services—works to directly implement the vision of DPW and City
leadership.
Fleet Services
The Fleet Services division is responsible for the maintenance, fueling,
monitoring, and repair of all vehicles and other City-owned equipment—
including public safety vehicles—and the operation of a municipal garage.
Further, Fleet Services maintains and supplies fuel for vehicles and equipment
owned by several other governmental agencies on a contractual basis. Like
Operations, the Fleet Services division includes union and non-union
employees.

Office of Audit and Performance
Introduction
The overall mission of the City-County Office of Audit and Performance is to assure the Mayor, the Marion County elected officials, the City-County
Council, and the citizens of the Consolidated City of Indianapolis, Marion County that operations within city departments and county agencies have effective
accounting and administrative controls. The Office of Audit and Performance operates independently to appraise and to report the effectiveness of the
management and of the financial controls of all city departments and county agencies. Furthermore, the Office of Audit and Performance conducts
performance audits, process improvement projects, follow-up reviews and other special projects as well as responds to management requests.
Structure
The Office of Audit and Performance comprises three functioning areas, each with their own operational goals and activities by a common vision.
Financial Audit
The Financial Audit area assists the Controller’s Office with the
Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) as well as providing
financial audit assistance to other City-County agencies. The Office of
Audit and Performance conducts financial maintenance on monetary
transactions and provides assistance to external auditors in their
examinations of City and of County financial statements and of federal
program administration.

Performance Audit
This area audits various process and program functions within City and
County agencies. Performance audits can vary between department and
agencies, but the goal is to provide objective analysis of processes and
programs to ensure they are functioning properly and efficiently as well
as to identify fraud and abuse.

LEAN Six Sigma
This area is the core Six Sigma group within the Consolidated City of
Indianapolis, Marion County local government. Audit and Performance
staff members are Lean Six Sigma certified and have conducted various
process improvement projects. The staff also conducts Lean Six Sigma
training for the enterprise. In addition, the Office of Audit and Performance
manages IndyStat performance measures.

Budget Justification
1.) The Office of Audit and Performance is maintaining its 2015 approved budget limits for 2016. There has been a slight increase in character one, due partly to
the anticipated 8% increase in health insurance cost for the enterprise.
2.) The majority of OAP’s expenses is in character one, which covers taxes, health insurance and wellness.
3.) We must maintain a reserve in Character 3 for the pursuit of outside consulting to investigate fraud, when needed. We also must obtain essential advanced
training for our Auditors and Sigma professionals. OAP takes advantage of local/online free Continuing Professional Education (CPE) training. The nature of our
role in the enterprise depends on the staff maintaining a high level of proficiency in auditing and process improvement skills. Furthering the staff’s knowledge of
new skills, market trends and best practices increases the value to the organization and is a critical expenditure to the Office of Audit and Performance’s budget.

MARION COUNTY AUDITOR
Introduction
The Office of the Marion County Auditor is established by the Indiana State Constitution, and strict adherence to the laws of the State of Indiana is of prime importance. The
Auditor is responsible for processing all tax deductions, abatements, and tax sale functions; for processing payroll for all City and County employees; for administering all
accounts payable and accounts receivable functions for all City and County agencies and departments; for providing information for the annual financial report; for monitoring
County grants; and for distributing over one billion dollars per year to the various taxing units of the City of Indianapolis and Marion County.

Structure
Administration Division
The Division of Administration provides customer service direction; executes
contracts; handles purchasing and procurement; develops and monitors budgets;
drafts and comments on legislation affecting Marion County; and certifies
documents in accordance with State law.

Payroll Division
The Payroll Division processes payroll; updates employee information on the
payroll and benefits systems; adheres to the Indiana new hiring reporting
requirements; processes payroll deductions; provides support and direction to
agency payroll clerks; and ensures adherence to State and local laws regarding
payroll for all City and County agencies and departments.

Settlement Division
The Settlement Division provides advances and semi-annual distribution of
collected taxes to all Marion County taxing units; validates tax distribution, tax levy,
and capital projects documents requiring Auditor certification; and serves as a
"check & balance" between Controller and Treasurer.

County-Wide Programs (formerly County Administrator)
The Marion County Auditor also manages various county-wide insurance programs,
including automobile, fire and property, money and security, and workers’
compensation. In this capacity, the Auditor serves as a fiscal agent and administers
funds for various entities throughout Marion County, including Noble of Indiana,
the Indiana State Fair Board and State-certified community mental health centers.
Further, adult safekeeping and State institutional expenses for County residents also
are paid out of the Auditor's budget.

Accounting Division
The Accounting Division provides accounts payable, accounts receivable and other
accounting functions; monitors payments for budget and policy compliance;
provides information for the annual financial report; and provides financial direction
for all City and County entities. The Division also synchronizes activities with the
Office of Finance and Management.

Real Estate Division
The Real Estate Division provides customer service for Marion County residents,
processing all tax deductions, abatements, tax bill corrections, and refunds. The
Division administers all noticing requirements, redemptions and refunds for the tax
sale, as well as investigates homestead deduction fraud. The Division also
synchronizes activities with the Assessor’s, Recorder’s and Treasurer’s Office.

Budget Justification
The Marion County Auditor’s offices will reduce the impact to the general fund by moving certain real estate-related personnel expenses (character one) and tax sale–related
costs to the ineligible deduction fund (homestead verification fund), beginning in 2015 and again in the 2016 expense budget, for a total shift in funding sources of more than
$1.3M. The ineligible deduction fund will be additionally replenished in 2016 by transferring duties currently performed under a multi-million dollar service contract back inhouse and eliminating the associated collection fees. The Auditor’s office will incur an increase in postage expense as the federal postage rate increased in July of 2015. However,
the Auditor will be focusing on savings through a paperless environment by scanning deduction forms and reducing the expense of storage. Further saving will be accomplished
by allowing all deduction forms to be completed, received and stored digitally. We will further realize a significant change in all department expenses by reorganization of
duties, installing scanning equipment and software, streamlining processes, as well as digitizing documents office-wide.

MARION COUNTY ASSESSOR
Introduction
The Marion County Assessor’s main goal is to ensure the accuracy of property tax assessments. Each property owner pays a fair share of local government expenses
based on the value of the property owned. The County Assessor is responsible for determining the fair market value of each property in the county. In addition, the
County Assessor processes Inheritance Tax returns and determines whether taxpayers are entitled to inheritance tax returns and charitable and non-profit property tax
exemptions. Any time a taxpayer wishes to appeal an assessment decision, the appeal goes through the Property Tax Assessment Board of Appeals (PTABOA)
hearing process administered by the County Assessor.
Structure
Assessment Division
The Assessment Division assesses all real and business property throughout
the county. This division coordinates the efforts of field personnel, audit
staffs and valuation experts to perform all phases of the assessment process in
accordance with International Association of Assessing Officers standards.
The division is further divided into functional areas separately covering
commercial, industrial, and residential properties, and reviewing taxpayers'
reports on business personal property. The division has three satellite offices
offering taxpayers convenient places to obtain residential assessment
information and services.
Administration Division
The Administration Division is responsible for budget creation and
monitoring, payroll, human resources administration, facilities management,
procurement, education administration, process improvement, as well as
document management and retention. Further, it administers the hearing
process of the PTABOA and the review of property tax exemption
applications for charities and non-profits. Finally, this division also conducts
the auditing and processing of inheritance tax returns.

Data Analysis Division
The Data Analysis Division collects, manages and analyzes the large amounts
of data needed for both efficient and modern assessment results. It also
creates satellite-coordinated mapping and connects assessment data to each
property geographically. Moreover, the division manages ownership changes
and records as well as parcel map changes. The division is responsible for the
sales disclosure process which collects, reviews and validates all property
sales in the county. Finally, the division organizes this enormous quantity of
data into reports and statistics, which is useful to the Assessment Division and
to other government agencies, and is available for dissemination to citizens
over the Internet.

MARION COUNTY RECORDER
Introduction
The Marion County Recorder’s Office maintains permanent public records involving a wide variety of instruments, including documents related to real estate,
personal property, mortgages, liens, leases, subdivision plats, military discharges, and personal bonds. Generally, these instruments are recorded either for giving
legal public notice of their existence or for safekeeping and future reference.
Structure
The Recorder’s Office reorganized its staff in June 2015 to provide more efficient and effective customer service.

Recording and Records Management
The Recorder’s Office accepts documents in person, by mail or electronically;
examines, records, scans, indexes, and makes accessible to the public
important real estate documents.
The office continues to seek innovative and technological advances to
enhance service delivery and reduce costs. Electronic recording continues to
increase with nearly 50% of all documents submitted as such. Later this year,
an electronic document router will be implemented to supplement the
electronic recording process and provide customers the ability to receive an
electronic copy of their recorded documents.

The Recorder’s Office manages and maintains records dating from 1822.
Copies of recorded documents are available to the public using paper copies,
microfilm and digital images. Recorded documents are accessible within the
office using public service terminals or online through subscription and free
single-use search engines.
Records from March 1964 through the present are maintained both digitally
and on microfilm. The office is undertaking a project to replace deteriorating
microfilm and digitize records prior to 1964. When completed, all of the
records held by the Recorder’s Office will be available and searchable online,
allowing greater access for the public.

MARION COUNTY SURVEYOR
Introduction
The Marion County Surveyor's Office was established by the Indiana Constitution in 1851. General Land Office surveys in what is now Marion County began in
1819. Marion County is part of the rectangular survey system (Public Land System), which divides the land into sections that are one square mile. All real estate
boundaries in Marion County can be traced back to the Public Land System. Statute law requires the Surveyor to recheck at least five percent of the section corners
each year, there are nearly 2400 corners. The Marion County Surveyor’s Office maintains a Legal Survey Record Book and a Corner Record Book. No fee is
charged for surveying services provided to any city, county and other governmental agencies.
Structure
The Marion County Surveyor's Office has three areas of focus, each with their own operational goals and activities while being unified by a common vision.
Surveying
In the field, the staff performs the precise measurements of Section Corners
and ties, per Indiana Code and replacing said monuments as necessary. We
monitor the Eagle Creek Dam for horizontal and vertical movement as well as
performing vital research within the office.
Information Technology
Information Technology supports the needs of the Surveyor’s Office. This
area compiles the data surveyors collect in the field by use of AutoCAD and
GIS software. Further, that data along with both the corner history and
drawing (which this department provides) is posted onto the county’s website.
We collect and quality-check all measurements to ensure accurate, reliable
information is provided.
Having a greater reliance on new technology has helped the Surveyor’s office
to build a solid fiscal commitment to provide government and private sector
agencies and companies timely, accurate and useful information, while
helping us and these agencies and companies save taxpayers’ money and
time. Finally, these advancements in technology have enabled us to fulfill
our legal obligation for the completion of the Alcohol & Tobacco
Commission’s Verification of Business Location forms.

Preservation
Preservation is as much a part of the Surveyor’s Office as surveying and
technology. We believe in the importance of preserving our past for the
future generations. Understanding the necessity of creating legible electronic
copies of the records, maps, surveys and plats housed in the Surveyor’s
Office, we work to ensure that they will be easily accessible for years to
come. By concentrating on this now we have been able to scan or have
scanned already deteriorating documents.
Copies of recorded documents are available to the public using paper copies,
microfilm and digital images. Recorded documents are accessible within the
office using public service terminals or online through subscription and free
single-use search engines.
Records from March 1964 through the present are maintained both digitally
and on microfilm. The office is undertaking a project to replace deteriorating
microfilm and digitize records prior to 1964. When completed, all of the
records held by the Recorder’s Office will be available and searchable online,
allowing greater access for the public.

Debt Service
The Consolidated City carries different types of debt associated with
various programs and services. This debt takes on two forms: (1)
general obligation debt, which is supported by a pledge of the full
faith and credit of the Consolidated City and is usually funded by tax
revenue, and (2) special revenue debt, which is supported by a
pledge of a specific revenue stream.

Special Revenue Debt
Special revenue debt is mostly associated with Tax Increment
Financing (TIF) districts throughout Marion County. This debt is
supported through property tax increment capture. This financing
tool is used to develop and grow various communities and
neighborhoods that otherwise would have little growth potential.

Generally, the revenue stream pledged for special revenue debt is a
fee or other non-tax revenue. In the case of debt funded by tax
increment financing (TIF), tax increment revenue captured is
segregated from the regular property tax revenue of the Consolidated
City.

TIF funds, including debt service for TIF bonds, are not appropriated
by the City-County Council. In Marion County, the Metropolitan
Development Commission (MDC) serves as the fiscal body for TIF
funds.

The Consolidated City of Indianapolis, Marion County takes pride
and care in maintaining its AAA (stable) credit rating for its general
obligation debt.
General Obligation Debt
Most of the Consolidated City’s general obligation debt is related to
transportation, parks, and emergency communications infrastructure.
Other general obligation debt is related to police and fire pension
costs as well as redevelopment efforts throughout the Consolidated
City.
Debt service payments for general obligation debt are typically
funded entirely, or in part, with tax revenue. Only tax-supported debt
service is included in tables presented in this report.

Other special revenue debt includes economic development bonds
which are typically supported by a revenue stream generated by a
specific investment. An example would be a bond issued to finance a
parking garage with the parking fees pledged to pay the debt service.
Another example would be financing stormwater projects,
undertaken by the Consolidated City to address flood control
problems, with stormwater fees pledged to paying the debt service.
TIF debt service and other special revenue debt service is not
included in tables presented in this report, but is available separately.

pension benefits to police officers and firefighters hired prior to 1977.
All associated expenditures made from the Police and Fire Pension
Trust Funds are reimbursed by the State.
The most recent pension plan, the 1977 Police and Firefighters
Pension and Disability Fund pension plan, is administered by the
Indiana Public Retirement System (INPRS), which is appropriated and
expensed as part of the Department of Public Safety’s (DPS’)
Character One appropriations from the IMPD and IFD General Funds
for the respective divisions.

Gregory A. Ballard, Mayor

2015 Proposed Budget

Presented to the Indianapolis-Marion County City County Council 8.18.2014

for the Consolidated City of Indianapolis, Marion County

s

To the Members of the Indianapolis City-County Council,
It is my distinct honor to present the 2015 Budget for the Consolidated City of Indianapolis, Marion County. In the pages that follow you will find a
budget that is balanced and honors our commitment to fund the critical functions of municipal government in the 12th largest city in the United
States. It is funded and fiscally responsible. It will ensure that Indianapolis remains one of the largest cities in America that holds a AAA rating
from the major ratings agencies.
During my announcement on July 30, 2014, I laid out a comprehensive plan to support early education opportunities for at-risk children, increase
support to our men and women of the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department through additional officers over the next 4 years, and fund
criminal justice services that will engage in reducing crime in Indianapolis. While the budget proposal included in this document is a “maintenance”
budget, I encourage the Council to act on the elimination of the local homestead credit and to increase the public safety income tax to create the
funding for the programs listed above and allocate those funds during the 2015 fiscal year in a transparent and effective manner.
This proposed budget recognizes the ongoing fiscal challenges faced by many cities due to a lagging national economic recovery. The budget
maintains Indianapolis’s strong fiscal position and contains a holistic approach to making Indianapolis a safer place to live, work, and raise a family.
I welcome your review, and I look forward to the forthcoming discussions about this budget.
Sincerely,

Gregory A. Ballard
Mayor

Executive Summary
The proposed 2015 budget for the Consolidated City of Indianapolis, Marion County is a balanced budget that signifies the goals and
priorities of the Administration while accurately accounting for revenues and expenditures for the upcoming fiscal year. Maintaining
positive fund balances, protecting the Fiscal Stability Fund, and holding the line on spending were key focus points when developing the
2015 budget. Even while major revenue sources like income taxes and property taxes are expected to increase for 2015, those funds must
be used to support current essential services and maintain healthy fund balances rather than drive increases in spending.
On July 30, 2014 Mayor Ballard presented his Early Education and Public Safety Initiative which focuses on improving early education
access in Indianapolis for at-risk youth, hiring an additional 280 police officers over 4 years, and increasing financial support for the
criminal justice system. Specifically the Initiative calls for $5 million per year in public matching funds to expand early education
programs for at-risk youth, $4 million for 40 additional police officers beyond the 50 new officers planned for 2015, and up to $10 million
for criminal justice agencies and departments. Funding for these programs and additional officers comes from the elimination of the local
homestead credit and an increase in the public safety income tax.
The 2015 Proposed Budget is a “maintenance” budget that provides for minimal increases in spending; specifically adjustments for state
mandated pay increases, contractual pay increases, information technology, and legal costs. While the Mayor’s plan calls for increased
revenue to support the early education expansion, more police officers, and greater investment in criminal justice services, this budget does
not reflect those changes at this time. As the vote to eliminate the local homestead credit and increase the public safety tax will occur after
the presentation of the 2015 Proposed Budget, including those expenditures would be premature. However, the Mayor urges the Council
to pass a 2015 “Base Plus” budget in October of this year, and then allocate those funds in 2015 in a transparent manner that will provide
for public input and focused discussions.
At the start of 2014, the budget faced an operating shortfall of $37 million within the city and county’s tax supported funds. Based on these
projections, the Office of Finance and Management (OFM) adopted a 3.5% management reserve on all funds to set aside resources in the
event overall revenues fluctuated during the year. OFM is pleased to report that all city and county agencies, departments, separately
elected officials and separate branches of government participated in the management reserve exercise.
Of the total management reserve, roughly $23 million was set aside in the city and county’s tax supported funds. Through 2014, income
taxes have remained stable and will continue on target for the remainder of the year. For property taxes, the city and county expect
additional revenue due to the elimination of nearly 35,000 local homestead deductions from fraudulent homestead deduction filings. This
action could result in approximately $30 million of additional one-time property tax revenues in 2014 for operating funds.

OFM projects that a large portion of the management reserve will be released along with some additional appropriations based on
discussions with city and county agencies, departments, separately elected officials, and separate branches of government. In addition,
miscellaneous revenues for the tax supported funds are projected to fall below budget by $2 million. However, with additional one-time
property tax revenue of $30 million and some management reserve held back, OFM projects the city and county’s tax supported funds will
end 2014 with approximately $83.5 million in fund balance.
While difficult decisions have, and will be made, to close the operating deficit and maintain positive fund balances, the 2015 budget
continues investment in public safety, infrastructure, and neighborhood development.
Police and fire funding will be increased in 2015 to account for contractual pay increases recently negotiated with the police and fire
unions. Both police and fire departments will continue to find efficiencies within their operations to maintain the level of services
currently provided. The budget continues to support the Mayor’s plan to provide additional officers on the street through improved
allocation of resources and a recruit class in 2015. The budget includes funding for police and fire operations related to contractual pay
increases from 2014 and for 2015. The IMPD General Fund budget will increase by $4.6 million in 2015 to support 50 new recruits to
replace retiring officers in 2015, 80 officers hired in 2014, and contractual pay increases from 2014 and 2015. For IFD, the IFD General
Fund budget will increase by $6.9 million which includes a new recruit class of 20 firefighters to reduce high overtime costs and supports
contractual pay increases from 2014 and 2015. IFD will continue to examine its operations and opportunities for consolidation in order to
create savings in the future.
Funding for criminal justice services such as the Public Defender, the Marion County Superior Courts, the Prosecutor, and other agencies
will remain relatively flat from 2014 to 2015. An increase of $3 million from the County General and Public Safety Income Tax fund is
included for state mandated pay increases for probation officers and public defenders, contractual pay increases for Sheriff’s Deputies, and
contractual costs related to 911 emergency dispatch operations. The city and county are aware of the recent changes by the Indiana
General Assembly with regards to House Enrolled Act 1006-2013 (HEA-1006) and how it may impact the Marion County criminal justice
system. While the full impact of HEA-1006 has not been realized, adjusting budgets in the future to address the impact may be necessary.
For Community Corrections, the budget funds 4 additional caseworkers to address home visitation requirements and remain in compliance
with the Indiana Department of Corrections. Finally, the 2015 budget will fund the Crime Prevention Grant at $2 million, providing
opportunities for not-for-profit groups that wish to engage the community in ways to reduce crime and improve their neighborhoods.
Infrastructure improvements and upgrades continue to be a primary focus of the Administration and are reflected in the 2015 budget.
Support for the Rebuild Indy program will continue with an investment of $7.3 million in 2015 from proceeds related to the sale of water
and waste water facilities to the Citizen’s Energy Group. The $7.3 million figure represents the final amount of funds available from the
RebuildIndy Fund. The budget will utilize the Parking Meter fund in 2015 to make infrastructure and capital improvements in the amount
of $6 million in and around parking meter areas. For 2015, the Transportation General fund will provide a loan repayment to the Fiscal

2

3
Stability Fund of $8 million as part of an agreement with the City-County Council. In order to pay the loan and maintain a positive fund
balance, a reduction of $8 million in Transportation General capital projects is necessary.
The City will continue its investment in park facilities and maintenance during 2015, ensuring parks are well maintained and capital
improvements are made throughout the year. Finally, continued improvements and upgrades related to storm water infrastructure will
maintain funding in 2015 compared to 2014, bringing total investment (local and federal support) in the city and county’s infrastructure to
$51 million in 2015.
Neighborhoods are one of the main reasons why Indianapolis and Marion County continues to be a city people want to live, work, and be
part of now and in the future. Beyond funding police, fire, and infrastructure services, this budget continues to fund the important work
provided by the Department of Metropolitan Development (DMD), the Department of Code Enforcement (DCE), and the Department of
Parks and Recreation (DPR). The Administration, through the 2015 budget, continues to highlight the need for neighborhood planning and
development to ensure we are building a long term vision for the city and its residents. Additional funding is provided in the 2015 budget
for DMD to manage and operate city owned assets, increase redevelopment efforts, and update and manage zoning changes made in 2014.
The DCE, a self-sufficient operation, will increase funding in 2015 to support a new illegal dumping program and the shift of managing
the Unsafe Building Program from DMD. Our parks continue to play a vital role in and around neighborhoods throughout the city and
county. This budget continues to fund park operations, maintenance, and capital investment in park’s facilities. In addition, Parks will
fund increases for lifeguards to ensure pools continue to stay open in 2015 during the summer time period. Finally, the Arts Grant will
continue to be funded at $1 million as part of the 2015 budget.
Beyond specific agency changes, the budget includes changes to the city and county sponsored health insurance by moving to a full
Consumer Driven Health Plan for 2015. While the city’s share of health insurance costs will rise in 2015, the long term impact of moving
to an all Consumer Driven Health Plan will allow for lower cost adjustments in future years. Potential health insurance costs in the future
could increase from 7% to 10% annually, hence the need to invest in a long term approach to health insurance plans. Agencies and
departments continue to evaluate contracts that could be renegotiated and OFM continues to hold Strategic Hiring Committee meeting to
manage headcount. For 2015, the Information Services Agency (ISA) will make capital investments of nearly $2.4 million to improve
information technology infrastructure and operations. In addition, ISA will invest in training programs and materials to ensure employees
working in the enterprise resource planning tool, Peoplesoft, have the appropriate knowledge and skills that will create operational
efficiencies within agencies that provide enterprise-wide functions.
Expenditures are only one side of the equation when developing a balanced budget, thus revenue plays an equally, if not more important
role, to balancing the budget and funding public safety.
As noted earlier, this budget includes the impact of eliminating nearly 35,000 fraudulent homestead deductions, which will increase the
assessed value of Marion County property by an estimated $2 billion. The homestead deduction verification program allowed not only the

city and county to benefit, but all Marion County taxing units by providing more property tax income in 2014 than originally anticipated.
Even while the amount of property tax revenue will be significantly higher in 2014 than originally budgeted, 2015 estimated property tax
revenue will provide for higher property tax revenue than originally budgeted in 2014. This is due to a higher assessed value in 2015
resulting in lower property tax rates and thus lowering the impact of the property tax caps (less circuit breaker impact). For 2014, the city
and county adopted $306 million in total property tax funds; however due to the homestead deduction verification program, the projected
property tax revenues for the city and county are $318 million, an increase of approximately $12 million in 2015.
Due to higher fund balances in some of the debt service funds; the budget reduces the amount of property tax levy necessary to fund debt
service payments. In 2014, the city and county budgeted nearly $30 million in property tax revenue to support debt service payments. For
2015, the amount of property tax revenue necessary to support debt service payments is $24 million, a reduction of $6 million in property
taxes paid to support debt service.
Finally, as Indiana and Marion County slowly emerge from one of the worst financial crises in the last 80 years, we are seeing an increase
in the overall income tax revenue generated by Marion County residents. In 2014, the city and county received $238 million in income tax
revenue distributions which support public safety, criminal justice, and public safety communications. For 2015, the state is expected to
increase the income tax revenue distribution by $17 million. While this increase is helpful, it certainly does not discharge the city and
county from holding the line on spending and improving our financial position.
The Administration’s goal is to keep the tax supported fund balance at or above 10% of the annual expenditures from tax supported funds,
which is $78 million in 2015. Based on the 2015 proposed budget, the fund balance for tax supported funds will end at approximately $55
million. This figure does not include the $73 million that is held in the Fiscal Stability Fund nor other dedicated, federal, or state funds.
The Office of Finance and Management (OFM) projects that if normal underspending occurs in 2014 and property tax collections are
100% in 2014 and 2015, the $55 million projected balance will increase.
The 2015 budget focuses on the goals of the Administration, continues to support vital services that make the Consolidated City of
Indianapolis, Marion County a great place to live, and maintains the Administration’s commitment to fiscal stability and long term
financial planning. This balanced budget has been accomplished through tough decisions regarding spending, finding innovate ways to
provide services, creating efficiencies where possible, and identifying revenues that directly benefit public safety. While challenges lay
ahead, the financial plan presented in this budget continues to serve all citizens of Marion County and makes Indianapolis a great city to
live, work, and raise a family.

Funds
The Indiana State Board of Accounts (SBOA) defines “fund” to
mean “cash or a group of accounts set aside for the purpose of
accounting for monies or other resources of general functions or
specific activities . . . in accordance with the system of accounts
prescribed by the State Board of Accounts or as required by statute”
(State Board of Accounts, Accounting and Uniform Compliance
Guidelines Manual for Cities and Towns, State of Indiana, reissued
2006).

Fund; Parks General Fund; Public Safety Income Tax Fund –
County; Public Safety Income Tax Fund – City; Personal Services
Contingency Fund – County; Personal Services Contingency Fund –
City; Guardian Ad Litem Fund; and Medical Care for Inmates Fund.
What all of these funds have in common is that they each will each
receive a substantial amount of flexible tax revenue. Thus, there is
the ability to reallocate the flexible revenue flowing to these funds
across many competing operational needs.

Funds that the SBOA prescribes for use by cities include but are not
limited to, general funds, special revenue funds, debt services funds,
capital projects funds, internal service funds, and agency funds.
Funds included in the 2015 Introduced Budget represent those that
require appropriation by the City-County Council. Appropriation is
the authorization of the City-County Council by ordinance to make
disbursements or to incur obligations for specific purposes.

Dedicated Funds
Dedicated funds, on the other hand, are funds which receive revenue
from taxes or non-tax sources that have very restricted legal uses. A
more apt of a dedicated fund description is a fund that receives little
or no revenue from flexible tax revenue sources. Some examples are
the Parking Meter Fund and the Permits Fund. These are both
dedicated funds because their revenue sources have strictly limited
legal uses.

General Funds
General funds are funds which receive a substantial share of their
revenue from taxes that have very broad flexibility. For example, the
1% County Option Income Tax (COIT) distributions and the County
General Fund property tax levy may legally be used to fund any
governmental purpose.

The Consolidated City also uses dedicated funds to account for the
proceeds of specific revenue sources (e.g., special revenue funds)
and/or for expenditures restricted to a specific purpose (e.g. debt
service funds; enterprise funds). Debt service funds (aka sinking
funds) are used to account for the accumulation of revenue for the
payment of long-term debt principal and interest.

The core general operating funds for the Consolidated City are:
County General Fund; Consolidated County General Fund (aka City
General Fund); Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department
(IMPD) General Fund; Indianapolis Fire Department (IFD) General

Grant Funds
Finally, the Consolidated City also employs grant funds to collect
revenues and track expenditures for grant monies received from
other units of government.

Revenues
State law requires adoption of a balanced budget, which shall include
all anticipated revenues and expenses of every organizational unit
(with the exception of utilities). As such, all appropriations adopted
by the City-County Council must be fully supported by (1) revenue
that is legally eligible to support proposed expenses, and/or (2) fund
balance (essentially prior year, unencumbered revenue) that is legally
eligible to support the proposed expense.

The Consolidated City relies primarily on property and income taxes
to fund its operations. However, a significant amount of revenue is
derived from Fees and Charges as well as from Federal and State
Grants. The following pages provide more detailed information
about property tax rates, levies and districts as well as the various
types of income taxes, tax rates as well as the available uses of such
funds.

Property Tax
Citizens of the Consolidated City are subject to several overlapping
property tax districts which levy taxes for city and county general
purpose funds, as well as specific services. Taxpayers residing in
overlapping districts would be subject to the tax rates of each
applicable district.
Certified Levy (Gross Levy)
The total property tax levy for a taxing unit before the property tax
cap is considered. Referred to as “certified” because it is approved
by the State Department of Local Government Finance (DLGF).
DLGF approval is required to ensure that the levy amount is within
maximum levy limitations set by State law.
Net Levy
The expected property tax levy after deducting the property tax
circuit breaker credits attributable to the property tax caps.
Gross Assessed Value
The assessed value of a property before applying any eligible
property tax deductions or abatements (which lower the property’s
taxable assessed value). The property tax caps are set based on each
parcel’s gross assessed value.
Net Assessed Value (Taxable Assessed Value)
The taxable value of property after all eligible property tax
deductions and abatements are applied.

Property Tax Cap (aka Circuit Breaker)
The property tax cap, also known as the “circuit breaker,” was
enacted by the Indiana General Assembly in 2008 and subsequently
amended into the Indiana Constitution. The cap guarantees that
property tax rates in overlapping districts cannot exceed a certain
capped percent of the parcel’s gross assessed value. The “circuit
breaker” amount represents property tax liability waived because it is
above the level allowed under the property tax caps. The property
tax caps are as follows:
1% - for Homestead property
2% - for other residential property and agricultural land
3% - for commercial and industrial property
Taxing Districts & Rates
The following pages show the taxing districts along with the Net
Assessed Values (NAV) of taxable property within those districts for
pay year 2015. The Tax Rate for a district is determined by the
following formula:

Income Tax
State law allows Indiana counties to impose a local income tax on
the State adjusted gross income of county taxpayers.
Also, counties may choose between several income tax options and
combinations. Each type of local income tax option is regulated by
specific rules and rate restrictions. Residents of Marion County are
subject to three interrelated income taxes in the form of the County
Option Income Tax (COIT), the Levy Freeze Local Option Income
Tax (LOIT), and the Public Safety Income Tax (PST).
This local income tax is collected by the State Department of
Revenue then distributed to counties based on the amount due to
each county on State income tax returns processed.
County Income Tax Council (CITC)
Local income tax is imposed or modified in a county by the action of
the CITC. In Marion County, the CITC is composed of the CityCounty Council and the fiscal body of each city or town that lies
either partially or entirely within the county. The other members of
the CITC are the Lawrence City Council, the Beech Grove City
Council, the Southport City Council, and the Speedway Town
Council.
Voting representation on the CITC is based on each member unit’s
share of the total county population. In Marion County, the CityCounty Council holds over 90% of the voting representation on the
CITC.

County Option Income Tax (COIT)
Current Rate: 1.00% Maximum Rate: 1.00%

COIT revenue may be used for any lawful purpose of the
governmental unit.
Levy Freeze Local Option Income Tax (LOIT)
Current Rate: 0.27% Maximum Rate: 1.00%

An additional income tax rate may be imposed to generate revenue to
replace property tax levy growth. Thus, imposing this tax reflects a
policy choice to shift fiscal reliance from property tax to income tax,
not an overall tax increase.
Once imposed, this rate may neither be rescinded nor decreased.
Each year the CITC must hold at least one public meeting to discuss
whether or not Levy Freeze LOIT rate should be increased.
Public Safety Income Tax (PST)
Current Rate: 0.35% Maximum Rate: 0.50%

Because Marion County has imposed a Levy Freeze LOIT rate, State
law allows adoption of a PST rate. PST revenues may be used for
police and fire, including pensions, emergency services,
communications systems, jails and related facilities, and other items
related to public safety.

Expenditures
Expenditure Categories (Characters)
In addition to the restrictions imposed by agencies/departments
regarding funding sources, agency spending is further restricted by
limiting the total funds available to support various spending
categories or “characters”. The Consolidated City employs five
separate characters to segregate spending. Each is described as
follows:

Properties and Equipment (Character 4)
This category includes expenditures for the acquisition of, or
addition to assets such as land, infrastructure, buildings,
improvements other than buildings, as well as machinery and
equipment.

Internal Charges (Character 5)
Personal Services (Character 1)
This category includes expenditures for salaries, wages and related
employee benefits provided for all Consolidated City employees.
Employee benefits include employer contributions to group health
and life insurance, pension benefits, unemployment compensation,
uniform allowance and similar benefits.

This category includes internal charges such as expenditures for the
Mayor’s Action Center, the Office of Corporation Counsel and Fleet
Services.
If a department has a negative appropriation for Character 5, it
means that department is a provider of internal services and a net
recipient of internal charges.

Materials and Supplies (Character 2)
This category includes articles and commodities that are consumed
or materially altered when used. Supplies include office supplies,
operating supplies, repair and maintenance supplies and other similar
items.

Other Services and Charges (Character 3)
This category includes expenditures for services other than personal
services required by the Consolidated City either to carry out its
assigned functions or to fulfill moral or legal obligations. Other
Services and Charges includes professional services, communication
and transportation, printing and advertising, insurance (excluding
group health, life and self-insurance), utility expenditures, contracted
repairs and maintenance, rentals, debt service expenditures for
principal and interest payments as well as long-term debt.

This category exists for only City departments. Similar expenditures
from county agencies are reported as Character 3 instead. Since the
Information Services Agency (ISA) is a County agency, their
charges are not administered through Character 5. Both City
departments and County agencies pay ISA charges through
Character 3.

DPS ADMINISTRATION
Introduction
The City of Indianapolis Department of Public Safety (DPS) will remain a national model leveraging the unique strengths of the Police, Fire, Homeland Security,
Animal Care and Control, and Communications Divisions as an integrated department. DPS will deliver the highest quality of public safety services in a fiscally
effective manner to secure the Greater Indianapolis area by preventing, preparing for, responding to, and recovering from routine emergencies and large-scales
incidents. The Administration unit of DPS provides coordination and leadership for the agencies within DPS.
Structure
The Department of Public Safety comprises five integrated divisions as well as the Citizens Police Complaint Office (CPCO) and the Mayor’s Office of Re-Entry.
The Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department, Indianapolis Fire Department, Division of Homeland Security, Animal Care and Control, and Public Safety
Communications operate within one department and share resources in innovative ways. This structure increases operational effectiveness by leveraging the
strengths of each division to provide public safety services to the City of Indianapolis/Marion County. Each of the divisions has their own operational goals and
unique personalities. The Department of Public Safety was created by Section 251 of the revised municipal code. CPCO, independent of the Indianapolis
Metropolitan Police Department, was created by city ordinance. The CPCO affords citizens of the Consolidated City of Indianapolis Marion County who believe
they have been treated improperly by an IMPD officer the opportunity to have his or her complaint(s) both heard and investigated. Mayor Gregory Ballard
established the Office of Re-Entry to develop collaborative partnerships among government, businesses, faith-based organizations, and community members to
leverage resources, to ensure sustainability by enhancing crime prevention strategies, and evaluating outcomes based on data collection and quality of life
enhancement, for ex-offenders and the community.

managing special events, and other emergencies. By embracing a single set of guiding principles, from the Director of Public Safety to the frontline employee, we
have created a single division working to secure the City of Indianapolis/Marion County.
The Division does not operate in a vacuum. Other Federal, State, and local institutions participate actively in the Division’s efforts to work within the intelligence
community, investigate, disrupt terrorist activities, pre-planning and managing special events, and in the preparation for and response to major disasters, as do our
private and non-profit sectors and international partners. We will continue to work cooperatively to ensure that all of the instruments of local power – including
leadership, specialized technical expertise, research, and development investments – are brought to bear on the challenges we face in a coordinated and unified
manner.

MARION COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT
Introduction
The Marion County Superior Court is comprised of thirty-six elected judges, thirty-nine commissioners and magistrates, and over 690 staff employees within four
divisions - Civil, Criminal, Juvenile, and Probate. Additionally, Probation, Juvenile Detention Center, and Court Administration all function as independent
departments/divisions under the purview of the Court. The Court is governed by an Executive Committee consisting of four judges elected by their peers for terms
of two years. The Executive Committee oversees the general policy and management of the Court.
Structure
Court Division
The thirty-six courts of the Court Division handle more than 50,000 civil
cases and more than 40,000 criminal cases each year. Some courts are
designated problem solving courts such as domestic violence, drug,
community, and traffic. In addition, the Traffic Division handles over
120,000 cases each year.
The Criminal and Civil Term Committees select a Chair bi-annually from
within their respective judicial members to address issues specific to their
respective courts. The General Term meets monthly to provide a forum for
review of issues.
Probation Department
The Probation Department is comprised of the adult and juvenile divisions.
Its mission is to enhance community safety through enforcement of court
orders while striving to empower individuals and change lives. Probation
assists in relieving jail bed concerns through both pre-trial and probation
services. More than 11,000 adults and 2,000 juveniles were serviced by the
probation department in 2013. The department has embraced the role of
evidenced based practices in their daily operations focused on the initiatives
that are proven through research to impact recidivism. The Juvenile Division
continues to implement strategies endorsed by the Juvenile Detention
Alternative Initiative resulting in a substantial reduction in the number of
juveniles being detained in the Juvenile Detention Center. A presiding judge
for Probation is appointed by the Executive Committee every two years.

Court Administration
Court Administration manages and supports the overall operation of the Court
including human resources, finance, payroll, facilities management, juror
services, procurement, information technology, fleet, and staff training.
Juvenile Detention Division
The Marion County Juvenile Detention Center (MCJDC) is a maximum
security holding facility for detained youth. The MCJDC maintains youth,
ages 11-18 years, in a safe and secure environment while allowing continuity
of services. Each youth detained attends school, participates in mental health
and basic health exercises, and increases healthy social skill-building
processes. The Marion Superior Court is committed to providing a safe and
secure Juvenile Detention Center while providing practical, effective, and
high-quality living and learning services to youth. A presiding judge for
Detention is appointed by the Executive Committee every two years.

MARION COUNTY PROSECUTOR
Introduction
The Marion County Prosecutor’s Office seeks to place public safety as the number one priority and responsibility of government. We are dedicated to holding
criminals accountable for their actions, preserving the rights of victims and continually seeking justice, all while maintaining the highest of ethical standards.
Structure
Criminal Charging Division
Police agencies present cases to this division for criminal charging
determinations. Deputy prosecutors determine what charges are to be filed in
each case, or if additional investigation is necessary.

Special Victims Team
This area of the office includes cases involving sex crimes and domestic
violence. It also handles cases of child abuse and leads the office’s efforts
and collaboration with the Julian Center.

Major Case Division
The Major Case Division handles major felony cases, including homicides.
Victim Advocates are assigned to each of these courts to ensure that victims
are notified of actions taken by the court and that they receive guidance and
support throughout the criminal justice process. Within the Major Case
Division, a Special Crimes Team includes prosecutors dedicated to human
trafficking, arson and unemployment insurance fraud.

Community Prosecution Division
Community prosecutors are assigned to the police districts and special areas.
These prosecutors work closely with district commanders and detectives to
develop strategies to protect and defend the communities served by the
respective police districts. Community prosecutors also encourage
community participation in public safety and crime prevention, engaging
residents in problem solving and establishing and maintaining partnerships.

Grand Jury Division
For cases involving white collar crime, public corruption, tax evasion and
other long term investigations, the Prosecutor has a staff of investigators and
lawyers dedicated to the collection of evidence and prosecution of these
cases. If criminal activity is suspected, the evidence is presented to a Grand
Jury composed of six citizens of Marion County who are presented with the
evidence and determine if criminal charges are filed. Currently, investigators
assigned to the Grand Jury Division represent detectives from the
Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department, Marion County Sheriff’s
Department, and Indiana State Police.

Juvenile Division
This division is responsible for filing and prosecuting acts of delinquency by
children 17 years of age and younger, including truancy cases. In certain
cases, more serious crimes can be directly filed to the adult criminal courts.

Strike Team
This division is responsible for three (3) areas of crime – drugs, guns and
gangs. Vigorous prosecution of these crimes is essential to the safety of the
community. The Strike Team partners with various police departments
throughout the county to assist in investigations, arrests, charging decisions
and the presentation of the case to the court.

Correction Division
This division responds to all requests for post-conviction relief and for
sentence modifications. This division also handles all requests for
expungement of arrests and convictions and the sealing of criminal records.

D-Felony/Misdemeanor Division
This division handles the prosecution of misdemeanor and Class D Felony
criminal cases. Cases include operating a vehicle while intoxicated, moving
traffic violations, theft, shoplifting, battery, vandalism, and trespassing. This
division handles more criminal cases than all other divisions combined.

MARION COUNTY COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS
Vision and Mission Statements
Vision
To provide the citizens of Marion County a safer community.

Mission
To enhance public safety by raising offender accountability through the use
of evidence based practices and interventions.

Structure
Home Detention
The electronic equipment used for client monitoring includes active radio
frequency for typical home detention clients as well as global positioning
satellite equipment for high risk offenders, including domestic violence
offenders who are on home detention. Community Corrections also offers
electronic alcohol monitoring equipment. Offenders may be placed on any
combination of Home Detention, GPS, and Alcohol Monitoring. All
offenders under supervision have a variety of programming available.
Community Corrections utilizes the Indiana Risk Assessment System (IRAS)
to assess the risk of reoffending and services needed for all clients under
supervision. Based on overall risk score and identified criminogenic needs,
clients may be placed into the following evidence based programs presented
by trained facilitators: Parenting, Anger Management, Thinking For a
Change, Substance Abuse Treatment, as well as Job Readiness workshops
and GED/ABE. Mental health programming is also available for those
mentally ill offenders who might otherwise have been incarcerated at the
local or the state levels. MCCC has an Addictions Intervention Component
which focuses on addictions issues.

Work Release
In October 2007, the agency opened the Duvall Residential Center which
provides services for male work release offenders and has capacity for up to
350 residents. All residents of Duvall are eligible for the same programming
opportunities as electronic monitoring offenders.
Through contracts with service providers, we are able to serve offenders at 3
other locations. Volunteers of America (VOA) currently provides a total of
60 beds for female offenders split among General Population, Community
Transition Program, and the Mental Health Component at Theodora House.

DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS
Introduction
The Indianapolis Department of Public Works (DPW) aims to improve residents’ quality of life through multi-modal connectivity, green space, capital
improvements, universal accessibility, and collaborative public and private partnerships. DPW builds and maintains public infrastructure, park land, manages solid
waste collection and the city’s entire fleet—striving always to provide effective, efficient customer service to citizens and visitors to Indianapolis, Marion County
and ensuring a healthy, safe, and natural environment.
Structure
Leadership:
DPW is led by a director appointed by the mayor. The director is supported
directly by a chief of staff. Under DPW leadership are several offices that
can be organized into four main divisions: Policy and Planning, Engineering,
Fleet Services, and Operations. These four divisions are not rigid: On a dayto-day basis, they merge to solve problems and increase livability across the
City and Marion County.
Policy and Planning
The Policy and Planning division works cooperatively to manage the
administration of the entire department, as directed by DPW leadership. This
division includes finance, the city-county council liaison, communications,
the Office of Sustainability, and the Office of Disability Affairs. While the
Office of Sustainability and the Office of Disability Affairs are housed within
DPW and report to the DPW director, they oversee livability and ADA issues
for the entire City and County. The offices within Policy and Planning work
closely with DPW leadership as well as deputy directors and administrators in
Engineering, Operations, and Fleet Services to ensure policies are developed
and implemented with fidelity, efficiency, and quality.
Operations:
The Operations division is responsible for solid waste collection and disposal;
maintenance of streets, traffic systems, levees, dams, as well as park facilities
and grounds; forestry work; and snow and ice removal from City streets. This
division is comprised of both union and non-union employees. The work
performed in DPW’s Operations division requires highly skilled, dedicated
staff; for that reason, DPW safety and training are housed in this division, as
well.

Engineering Division
The Engineering division plans, designs, constructs, and maintains all streets,
sewers, roads, bridges, multi-modal paths, trails, parks, green spaces, and
thoroughfares. It is also responsible for access control, traffic control, and
lights for these assets. Furthermore, the Engineering division manages the
development of studies, inventories, programs, and projects—and manages all
contracts related to transportation and storm water infrastructure. In 2013,
DPW’s Engineering division welcomed staff from Indy Parks and now
oversees parks capital development and land stewardship activities.
Engineering—in collaboration with Operations and Fleet Services—works to
directly implement the vision of DPW and City leadership.
Fleet Services
The Fleet Services division is responsible for the maintenance, fueling,
monitoring and repair of all vehicles and other City-owned equipment—
including public safety vehicles—and the operation of a municipal garage.
Further, Fleet Services maintains and supplies fuel for vehicles and
equipment owned by several other governmental agencies on a contractual
basis. Like Operations, the Fleet Services division includes union and nonunion employees.

OFFICE OF MINORITY & WOMEN BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT
Introduction
The Office of Minority &Women Business Development works to enhance
the City’s growth and economic stability through promotion of contracting
and procurement opportunities for MBE/WBE/VBE/DOBEs

Through community outreach, special events and programs such as startup
consulting and certification services, the DMWBD is an active partner to all
City of Indianapolis certified MBE/WBE/VBE/DOBEs.

Structure
Certification
MBE, WBE, VBE and DOBEs must be certified with the City through the
DMWBD. The DMWBD must verify that they meet the requirements of the
certification program. Recently implemented was the disability-owned
business enterprise program (DOBE). This program will be similar to the
MWBE certification process but the Office of Disability Affairs will process
the disability approval portion of the applicant and then the business entity
information will then be processed by the DMWBD.
Business Development
The DMWBD acts as a resource center for MBE, WBE, VBE and DOBEs
and provides programing that assist with growth and development of
companies, through outreach events, and educational workshops.
Compliance
DMWBD is responsible for reviewing all contracts, and the tracking of MBE,
WBE, VBE and DOBE participation on all contracts. DMWBD monitors
contracts to ensure the participation goals are being met.

Diversity Program
Recognize businesses and organizations that encourage, embrace, and
celebrate differences that foster a better place in which to live, work, and raise
a family.
The DMWBD is responsible for the Mayor’s Celebration of Diversity Award
luncheon, and working with the Indiana Black Expo on the Summer
Celebration, and the Circle City Classic event.
Budget change
Prior to the DMWBD budget being moved from the Mayor’s budget, we had
$8,000 in character three to be used for consulting services. Since that time
we have cut 2 FTE positions to meet budget cut requirements. These cuts
resulted in a significant decrease of business development and outreach to the
community, but resulted in savings of over $30k in character one for the
department. $22k, the remaining balance in character one from the FTE
position cuts was moved into character three for use in consulting services to
focus on contract compliance, and work force development. The total budget
line item is $30k.

MARION COUNTY ASSESSOR
Introduction
The Marion County Assessor’s main goal is to ensure the accuracy of property tax assessments. Each property owner pays a fair share of local government expenses
based on the value of the property owned. The County Assessor is responsible for determining the fair market value of each property in the county. In addition, the
County Assessor processes Inheritance Tax returns and determines whether taxpayers are entitled to inheritance tax returns and determines whether taxpayers are
entitled to charitable and non-profit property tax exemptions. Any time a taxpayer wishes to appeal an assessment decision, the appeal goes through the Property
Tax Assessment Board of Appeals (PTABOA) hearing process administered by the County Assessor.
Structure
Assessment Division
The Assessment Division assesses all real and business property throughout
the county. This division coordinates the efforts of field personnel, audit
staffs, and valuation experts to perform all phases of the assessment process
in accordance with International Association of Assessing Officers standards.
The division is further divided into functional areas separately covering
commercial, industrial, and residential properties, and reviewing taxpayers'
reports on business personal property. The division has four satellite offices
offering taxpayers a convenient place to obtain residential assessment
information and services.
Administration Division
The Administration Division is responsible for budget creation and
monitoring, payroll, human resources administration, facilities management,
procurement, education administration, process improvement, as well as
document management and retention. Further, it administers the hearing
process of the PTABOA and the review of property tax exemption
applications for charities and non-profits. Finally, this division also conducts
the auditing and processing of inheritance tax returns.

Data Analysis Division
The Data Analysis Division collects, manages, and analyzes the large
amounts of data needed for both efficient and modern assessment results. It
also creates satellite-coordinated mapping and connects assessment data to
each property geographically. Moreover, the division manages ownership
changes and records as well as maps changes in the property sizes. The
division is responsible for the sales disclosure process which collects,
reviews, and validates all property sales in the county. Finally, the division
organizes this enormous quantity of data into reports and statistics, which is
useful to the Assessment Division and to other government agencies, and is
available for dissemination to citizens over the Internet.

MARION COUNTY SURVEYOR
Introduction
Marion County Surveyor's Office was established by the Indiana Constitution in 1851. General Land Office surveys in what is now Marion County began in 1819.
Marion County is part of the rectangular survey system (Public Land System), which divides the land into sections that are one square mile. All real estate
boundaries in Marion County can be traced back to the Public Land System. Statute law requires the Surveyor to recheck at least five percent of the section corners
each year, there are over 2300 corners. The Marion County Surveyor’s Office maintains a Legal Survey Record Book and a Corner Record Book. No fee is charged
for surveying services provided to any city, county and other governmental agencies.
Structure
The Marion County Surveyor's Office has three areas of focus, each with their own operational goals and activities while being unified by a common vision.
Surveying
In the field, the staff performs the precise measurements of Section Corners
and ties, per Indiana Code and replacing said monuments as necessary. We
monitor the Eagle Creek Dam for horizontal and vertical movement as well as
performing vital research within the office.
Information Technology
Information Technology supports the needs of the Surveyor’s Office. This
area compiles the data surveyors collect in the field by use of AutoCAD and
GIS software. Further, that data along with both the corner history and
drawing (which this department provides) is posted onto the county’s website.
We collect and quality check all measurements to ensure accurate, reliable
information is provided.
Having a greater reliance on new technology has helped the Surveyor’s
Office to build a solid fiscal commitment to provide government and private
sector agencies and companies timely, accurate and useful information, while
helping us and these agencies and companies save taxpayers money and time.
Finally, these advancements in technology have enabled us to fulfill our legal
obligation for the completion of the Alcohol & Tobacco Commission’s
Verification of Business Location forms.

Preservation
Preservation is as much a part of the Surveyor’s Office as surveying and
technology. We believe in the importance of preserving our past for the
future generations. Understanding the necessity of creating legible electronic
copies of the records, maps, surveys and plats housed in the Surveyor’s
Office to ensure that they will be easily accessible for years to come. By
concentrating on this now we have been able to scan or have scanned already
deteriorating documents.

Debt Service
The Consolidated City carries different types of debt associated with
various programs and services. This debt takes on two forms: (1)
general obligation debt, which is supported by a pledge of the full
faith and credit of the Consolidated City and is usually funded by tax
revenue, and (2) special revenue debt, which is supported by a
pledge of a specific revenue stream.

Special Revenue Debt
Special revenue debt is mostly associated with Tax Increment
Financing (TIF) districts throughout Marion County. This debt is
supported through property tax increment capture. This financing
tool is used to develop and grow various communities and
neighborhoods that otherwise would have little growth potential.

Generally, the revenue stream pledged for special revenue debt is a
fee or other non-tax revenue. In the case of debt funded by tax
increment financing (TIF), tax increment revenue captured is
segregated from the regular property tax revenue of the Consolidated
City.

TIF funds, including debt service for TIF bonds, are not appropriated
by the City-County Council. In Marion County, the Metropolitan
Development Commission (MDC) serves as the fiscal body for TIF
funds.

The Consolidated City of Indianapolis, Marion County takes pride
and care in maintaining its AAA (stable) credit rating for its general
obligation debt.
General Obligation Debt
Most of the Consolidated City’s general obligation debt is related to
transportation, parks, and emergency communications infrastructure.
Other general obligation debt is related to police and fire pension
costs as well as redevelopment efforts throughout the Consolidated
City.
Debt service payments for general obligation debt are typically
funded entirely, or in part, with tax revenue. Only tax-supported debt
service is included in tables presented in this report.

Other special revenue debt includes economic development bonds
which are typically supported by a revenue stream generated by a
specific investment. An example would be a bond issued to finance a
parking garage with the parking fees pledged to pay the debt service.
Another example would be financing stormwater projects,
undertaken by the Consolidated City to address flood control
problems, with stormwater fees pledged to paying the debt service.
TIF debt service and other special revenue debt service is not
included in tables presented in this report, but is available separately.

Presented to the Indianapolis-Marion County City County Council 8.17.2015

2016 Proposed Budget

for the Consolidated City of Indianapolis, Marion County

To the Members of the Indianapolis City-County Council,
It is my distinct honor to present the 2016 Budget for the Consolidated City of Indianapolis, Marion County. In the pages that follow you will find a
budget that honors our commitment to fund the critical functions of municipal government in the 12th largest city in the United States. Combined
with our successful efforts to pay down 60% of the City’s general obligation debt and convert $680 million from variable rate debt to fixed rate debt,
this budget will ensure that Indianapolis remains one of the largest cities in America to hold a AAA rating from the major ratings agencies.
As this will be the last budget I will present to you, I am proposing a flexible “maintenance” budget that funds essential services while continuing
investment in early childhood education, public safety, and infrastructure.
This proposed 2016 budget maintains our city’s strong fiscal position and also supports a holistic approach to making Indianapolis a safer place to
live, work and raise a family.
I welcome your review, and I look forward to the forthcoming discussions about this budget.
Sincerely,

Gregory A. Ballard
Mayor

Executive Summary
The proposed 2016 budget for the Consolidated City of Indianapolis, Marion County is a balanced budget that continues to address critical
needs while accurately accounting for revenues and expenditures for the upcoming fiscal year. Maintaining positive fund balances,
protecting the Fiscal Stability Fund and holding the line on spending were key focus points when developing the 2016 budget.
Notwithstanding revenue enhancements that became effective in 2015, growth in major revenue sources such as property taxes and income
taxes is expected to be nominal in 2016, and fiscal restraint must continue to be exercised in the face of stagnant revenues.
The 2016 Introduced Budget is a “Maintenance” budget that provides for minimal increases in spending; specifically, an additional 70 new
officers as laid out by Mayor Ballard’s Public Safety Plan, contractual pay increases, Guardian ad Litem services, storm water
infrastructure, adjustments for information technology, etc. The 2016 Introduced Budget calls for a one year moratorium on the local
homestead credit that would generate an additional $6 million dollars in revenue. The additional revenue is not budgeted however, and it
remains in fund balance.
At the start of 2015, the budget faced an operating deficit of $26 million within the city and county’s tax supported funds; this increased to
$34 million due to an $8 million shortfall in property tax collections at the end of 2014. The City and County are also faced with an
additional pay cycle for non-uniform police and firefighters employees in 2015, estimated to cost an additional $8 million. Based on these
projections, the Office of Finance and Management (OFM) used $7 million of the additional public safety income tax revenue received to
address a portion of the projected structural deficit. In addition, OFM adopted a management reserve of $41 million on all funds to set
aside resources in the event overall revenues fluctuated during the year and to help address the additional pay cycle. OFM is pleased to
report that all city and county agencies, departments, separately elected officials and separate branches of government participated in the
management reserve exercise.
Of the total management reserve, roughly $27 million was set aside in the city and county’s tax supported funds. Through 2015, income
taxes have remained stable and are on target for the remainder of the year. Due to the number of refunds, appeals, and homestead
deductions that were previously removed and are now being reapplied, property taxes are $5.6 million less than what was forecasted at the
time the 2015 budget was adopted.
OFM projects that a portion of the management reserve will be released along with some additional appropriations based on discussions
with city and county agencies, departments, separately elected officials and separate branches of government. However, with some
management reserve held back, OFM projects the city and county’s tax supported funds will end 2015 with approximately $58.2 million in
fund balance.

While difficult decisions have, and will be made, to close the operating deficit and maintain positive fund balances, the 2016 budget
continues investment in public safety, infrastructure, and neighborhood development.
Police and fire funding will be increased in 2016 to account for contractual pay increases negotiated with the police and fire unions. Both
police and fire departments will continue to find efficiencies within their operations to maintain the level of services currently provided.
The budget continues to support the Mayor’s plan to provide additional officers on the street through improved allocation of resources
and a recruit class in 2016. The budget includes funding for police and fire operations related to contractual pay increases from 2015.
IMPD will receive $9.8 million in additional funding in 2016 to account for the addition of 120 officers in 2015 and to support 70 new
recruits in 2016. IFD will receive additional funding of $5.4 million to support contractual pay increases from 2015. IFD will continue to
examine its operations and opportunities for consolidation in order to create savings in the future.
Additional funding for criminal justice services such as the Public Defender, the Marion County Superior Courts, the Prosecutor and other
agencies was provided in 2015, but overall growth from 2015 to 2016 will remain flat. An increase of $2 million from the County General
Fund is included for the state mandated Guardian ad Litem program with $1 million to support contractual increases for 911 emergency
dispatch operations. The city and county are aware of the changes by the Indiana General Assembly with regards to House Enrolled Act
1006-2013 (HEA-1006) and how it may impact the Marion County criminal justice system. While the full impact of HEA-1006 has not
been realized, adjusting budgets in the future to address the impact may be necessary. Finally, the 2016 budget will fund the Crime
Prevention Grant at $2 million, providing opportunities for not-for-profit groups that wish to engage the community in ways to reduce
crime and improve their neighborhoods.
Infrastructure improvements and upgrades continue to be a primary focus of the Administration and are reflected in the 2016 budget.
Support for the Rebuild Indy program will continue with an investment of $2.9 million in 2016 from proceeds related to the sale of water
and waste water facilities to the Citizen’s Energy Group. The $2.9 million figure represents the final amount of funds available from the
RebuildIndy Fund. Investment in roads and streets and other capital improvements will continue in 2016 with funding of $9.7 million
from the Transportation General Fund. The budget will continue to utilize the Parking Meter fund in 2016 to make infrastructure and
capital improvements in the amount of $3.8 million in and around parking meter areas.
In 2014, the City County Council approved a storm water rate increase that became effective in July 2015 which is estimated to generate
an additional $9 million annually. The increase in revenue will provide for infrastructure investment of $8 million in 2016. Finally, the
City will increase its investment in park facilities by $1.2 million in 2016, ensuring parks are well maintained and capital improvements
are made throughout the year, bringing total investment (local and federal support) in the city and county’s infrastructure to $59 million in
2016.
Neighborhoods are one of the main reasons why Indianapolis and Marion County continues to be a city people want to live, work and be
part of now and in the future. Beyond funding police, fire, and infrastructure services, this budget continues to fund the important work

provided by the Department of Metropolitan Development (DMD), the Department of Code Enforcement (DCE) and the Department of
Parks and Recreation (DPR). The Administration, through the 2016 budget, continues to highlight the need for neighborhood planning and
development to ensure we are building a long term vision for the city and its residents. Additional funding is provided in the 2016 budget
for DMD to manage and operate city owned assets. The DCE, a self-sufficient operation, will increase funding in 2016 to support
contractual increases. Our parks continue to play a vital role in and around neighborhoods throughout the city and county. This budget
continues to fund park operations, maintenance and capital investment in park’s facilities. Finally, the Arts Grant will continue to be
funded at $1 million as part of the 2015 budget.
Beyond specific agency changes, agencies and departments continue to evaluate contracts that could be renegotiated and OFM continues to
hold Strategic Hiring Committee meeting to manage headcount. For 2016, the Information Services Agency (ISA) will make capital
investments of nearly $1.6 million to improve information technology infrastructure and operations. In addition, ISA will invest in
training programs and materials to ensure employees working in the enterprise resource planning tool, PeopleSoft, have the appropriate
knowledge and skills that will create operational efficiencies within agencies that provide enterprise-wide functions.
Expenditures are only one side of the equation when developing a balanced budget, thus revenue plays an equally, if not more important
role, to balancing the budget and funding public safety.
In 2015, the city and county received $284 million in income tax revenue distributions, which support public safety, criminal justice,
public safety communications, and other city and county agencies and departments. Income tax revenue is forecasted to be $298 million in
2016, an increase of approximately $13 million. When normalized for the one year moratorium on the local homestead credit, organic
growth is a nominal 1.4% or approximately $4.4 million. While this increase is helpful, it does not fully support the additional costs
associated with contractual increases, personnel, state mandated programs, and the overall cost of doing business.
For 2015, property tax revenue is forecasted to be $313 million, which represents a $5 million decrease from the budgeted amount of $318
million. This decrease places additional pressure on tax supported funds. For 2016, property tax revenue is expected to remain flat at
$313 million. Decreased property tax revenue in 2015 coupled with no growth in 2016 requires the city and county to be even more
judicious in its spending for the remainder of 2015 and 2016.
As noted earlier, this budget proposes a one year moratorium on the local homestead credit. This would generate an additional $6 million
in revenue in 2016. The amount generated is not budgeted and is being used to support fund balance. The Administration’s goal is to
keep the tax supported fund balance at or above 10% of the annual expenditures from tax supported funds, which is $82 million in 2016.
Based on the 2016 proposed budget, the fund balance for tax supported funds will end at approximately $50 million. This figure does not
include the $78 million that is held in the Fiscal Stability Fund nor other dedicated, federal or state funds. The Office of Finance and
Management (OFM) projects that if normal underspending occurs in 2015 and property tax collections are 100% in 2015 and 2016, the
$50 million projected balance will increase.

The 2016 budget continues to support vital services that make the Consolidated City of Indianapolis, Marion County a great place to live,
and maintains the Administration’s commitment to fiscal stability and long term financial planning. This balanced budget has been
accomplished through tough decisions regarding spending, finding innovate ways to provide services, creating efficiencies where possible,
and identifying revenues that directly benefit public safety. While challenges lay ahead, the financial plan presented in this budget
continues to serve all citizens of Marion County and makes Indianapolis a great city to live, work and raise a family.

Funds
The Indiana State Board of Accounts (SBOA) defines “fund” to
mean “cash or a group of accounts set aside for the purpose of
accounting for monies or other resources of general functions or
specific activities . . . in accordance with the system of accounts
prescribed by the State Board of Accounts or as required by statute”
(State Board of Accounts, Accounting and Uniform Compliance
Guidelines Manual for Cities and Towns, State of Indiana, reissued
2006).

Fund; Parks General Fund; Public Safety Income Tax Fund –
County; Public Safety Income Tax Fund – City; Personal Services
Contingency Fund – County; Personal Services Contingency Fund –
City; Guardian Ad Litem Fund; and Medical Care for Inmates Fund.
What all of these funds have in common is that they each will each
receive a substantial amount of flexible tax revenue. Thus, there is
the ability to reallocate the flexible revenue flowing to these funds
across many competing operational needs.

Funds that the SBOA prescribes for use by cities include but are not
limited to, general funds, special revenue funds, debt services funds,
capital projects funds, internal service funds, and agency funds.
Funds included in the 2016 Introduced Budget represent those that
require appropriation by the City-County Council. Appropriation is
the authorization of the City-County Council by ordinance to make
disbursements or to incur obligations for specific purposes.

Dedicated Funds
Dedicated funds, on the other hand, are funds which receive revenue
from taxes or non-tax sources that have very restricted legal uses. A
more apt of a dedicated fund description is a fund that receives little
or no revenue from flexible tax revenue sources. Some examples are
the Parking Meter Fund and the Permits Fund. These are both
dedicated funds because their revenue sources have strictly limited
legal uses.

General Funds
General funds are funds which receive a substantial share of their
revenue from taxes that have very broad flexibility. For example, the
1% County Option Income Tax (COIT) distributions and the County
General Fund property tax levy may legally be used to fund any
governmental purpose.

The Consolidated City also uses dedicated funds to account for the
proceeds of specific revenue sources (e.g., special revenue funds)
and/or for expenditures restricted to a specific purpose (e.g. debt
service funds; enterprise funds). Debt service funds (aka sinking
funds) are used to account for the accumulation of revenue for the
payment of long-term debt principal and interest.

The core general operating funds for the Consolidated City are:
County General Fund; Consolidated County General Fund (aka City
General Fund); Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department
(IMPD) General Fund; Indianapolis Fire Department (IFD) General

Grant Funds
Finally, the Consolidated City also employs grant funds to collect
revenues and track expenditures for grant monies received from
other units of government.

Revenues
State law requires adoption of a balanced budget, which shall include
all anticipated revenues and expenses of every organizational unit
(with the exception of utilities). As such, all appropriations adopted
by the City-County Council must be fully supported by (1) revenue
that is legally eligible to support proposed expenses, and/or (2) fund
balance (essentially prior year, unencumbered revenue) that is legally
eligible to support the proposed expense.

The Consolidated City relies primarily on property and income taxes
to fund its operations. However, a significant amount of revenue is
derived from Fees and Charges as well as from Federal and State
Grants. The following pages provide more detailed information
about property tax rates, levies and districts as well as the various
types of income taxes, tax rates as well as the available uses of such
funds.

Property Tax
Citizens of the Consolidated City are subject to several overlapping
property tax districts which levy taxes for city and county general
purpose funds, as well as specific services. Taxpayers residing in
overlapping districts would be subject to the tax rates of each
applicable district.
Certified Levy (Gross Levy)
The total property tax levy for a taxing unit before the property tax
cap is considered. Referred to as “certified” because it is approved
by the State Department of Local Government Finance (DLGF).
DLGF approval is required to ensure that the levy amount is within
maximum levy limitations set by State law.
Net Levy
The expected property tax levy after deducting the property tax
circuit breaker credits attributable to the property tax caps.
Gross Assessed Value
The assessed value of a property before applying any eligible
property tax deductions or abatements (which lower the property’s
taxable assessed value). The property tax caps are set based on each
parcel’s gross assessed value.
Net Assessed Value (Taxable Assessed Value)
The taxable value of property after all eligible property tax
deductions and abatements are applied.

Property Tax Cap (aka Circuit Breaker)
The property tax cap, also known as the “circuit breaker,” was
enacted by the Indiana General Assembly in 2008 and subsequently
amended into the Indiana Constitution. The cap guarantees that
property tax rates in overlapping districts cannot exceed a certain
capped percent of the parcel’s gross assessed value. The “circuit
breaker” amount represents property tax liability waived because it is
above the level allowed under the property tax caps. The property
tax caps are as follows:
1% - for Homestead property
2% - for other residential property and agricultural land
3% - for commercial and industrial property
Taxing Districts & Rates
The following pages show the taxing districts along with the Net
Assessed Values (NAV) of taxable property within those districts
for pay year 2016. The Tax Rate for a district is determined by the
following formula:

Income Tax
State law allows Indiana counties to impose a local income tax on
the State adjusted gross income of county taxpayers.
Also, counties may choose between several income tax options and
combinations. Each type of local income tax option is regulated by
specific rules and rate restrictions. Residents of Marion County are
subject to three interrelated income taxes in the form of the County
Option Income Tax (COIT), the Levy Freeze Local Option Income
Tax (LOIT), and the Public Safety Income Tax (PST).
This local income tax is collected by the State Department of
Revenue then distributed to counties based on the amount due to
each county on State income tax returns processed.
County Income Tax Council (CITC)
Local income tax is imposed or modified in a county by the action of
the CITC. In Marion County, the CITC is composed of the CityCounty Council and the fiscal body of each city or town that lies
either partially or entirely within the county. The other members of
the CITC are the Lawrence City Council, the Beech Grove City
Council, the Southport City Council, and the Speedway Town
Council.
Voting representation on the CITC is based on each member unit’s
share of the total county population. In Marion County, the CityCounty Council holds over 90% of the voting representation on the
CITC.

County Option Income Tax (COIT)
Current Rate: 1.00% Maximum Rate: 1.00%

COIT revenue may be used for any lawful purpose of the
governmental unit.
Levy Freeze Local Option Income Tax (LOIT)
Current Rate: 0.27% Maximum Rate: 1.00%

An additional income tax rate may be imposed to generate revenue to
replace property tax levy growth. Thus, imposing this tax reflects a
policy choice to shift fiscal reliance from property tax to income tax,
not an overall tax increase.
Once imposed, this rate may neither be rescinded nor decreased.
Each year the CITC must hold at least one public meeting to discuss
whether or not Levy Freeze LOIT rate should be increased.
Public Safety Income Tax (PST)
Current Rate: 0.50% Maximum Rate: 0.50%

Because Marion County has imposed a Levy Freeze LOIT rate, State
law allows adoption of a PST rate. PST revenues may be used for
police and fire, including pensions, emergency services,
communications systems, jails and related facilities, and other items
related to public safety.

Expenditures
Expenditure Categories (Characters)
In addition to the restrictions imposed by agencies/departments
regarding funding sources, agency spending is further restricted by
limiting the total funds available to support various spending
categories or “characters”. The Consolidated City employs five
separate characters to segregate spending. Each is described as
follows:

Properties and Equipment (Character 4)
This category includes expenditures for the acquisition of, or
addition to assets such as land, infrastructure, buildings,
improvements other than buildings, as well as machinery and
equipment.

Internal Charges (Character 5)
Personal Services (Character 1)
This category includes expenditures for salaries, wages and related
employee benefits provided for all Consolidated City employees.
Employee benefits include employer contributions to group health
and life insurance, pension benefits, unemployment compensation,
uniform allowance and similar benefits.

This category includes internal charges such as expenditures for the
Mayor’s Action Center, the Office of Corporation Counsel and Fleet
Services.
If a department has a negative appropriation for Character 5, it
means that department is a provider of internal services and a net
recipient of internal charges.

Materials and Supplies (Character 2)

DPS ADMINISTRATION
Introduction
The City of Indianapolis Department of Public Safety (DPS) will remain a national model leveraging the unique strengths of the Police, Fire, Homeland Security,
Animal Care and Control, and Communications Divisions as an integrated department. DPS will deliver the highest quality of public safety services in a fiscally
effective manner to secure the Greater Indianapolis area by preventing, preparing for, responding to, and recovering from routine emergencies and large-scales
incidents. The Administration unit of DPS provides coordination and leadership for the agencies within DPS.
Structure
The Department of Public Safety comprises five integrated divisions as well as the Citizens Police Complaint Office (CPCO) and the Mayor’s Office of Re-Entry.
The Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department, Indianapolis Fire Department, Division of Homeland Security, Animal Care and Control, and Public Safety
Communications operate within one department and share resources in innovative ways. This structure increases operational effectiveness by leveraging the
strengths of each division to provide public safety services to the City of Indianapolis/Marion County. Each of the divisions has their own operational goals and
unique personalities. The Department of Public Safety was created by Section 251 of the revised municipal code. CPCO, independent of the Indianapolis
Metropolitan Police Department, was created by city ordinance. The CPCO affords citizens of the Consolidated City of Indianapolis Marion County who believe
they have been treated improperly by an IMPD officer the opportunity to have his or her complaint(s) both heard and investigated. Mayor Gregory Ballard
established the Office of Re-Entry to develop collaborative partnerships among government, businesses, faith-based organizations, and community members to
leverage resources, to ensure sustainability by enhancing crime prevention strategies, and evaluating outcomes based on data collection and quality of life
enhancement, for ex-offenders and the community.

DIVISION OF HOMELAND SECURITY
Introduction
The Division leads an integrated Department of Public Safety effort to secure, prevent, prepare, respond, investigate, and ensure resiliency from natural or humanmade threats and hazards to the city, and to sustain a confident public. The Division is also responsible for preparing plans and managing the safety and security of
special events when anticipated requirements exceed the capability of the concerned geographic area. The Division of Homeland Security was created by Section
251 of the revised Municipal Code.
Structure
The Division was formed to unify divisions within the Department of Public Safety to create the capacity to deal with terrorist attacks, major disasters, planning and
managing special events, and other emergencies. By embracing a single set of guiding principles, from the Director of Public Safety to the frontline employee, we
have created a single division working to secure the City of Indianapolis/Marion County.
The Division does not operate in a vacuum. Other Federal, State, and local institutions participate actively in the Division’s efforts to work within the intelligence
community, investigate, disrupt terrorist activities, pre-planning and managing special events, and in the preparation for and response to major disasters, as do our
private and non-profit sectors and international partners. We will continue to work cooperatively to ensure that all of the instruments of local power – including
leadership, specialized technical expertise, research, and development investments – are brought to bear on the challenges we face in a coordinated and unified
manner.

MARION COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT
Introduction
The Marion County Superior Court is comprised of 36 elected judges, 39 commissioners and magistrates and over 700 employees. The Court is structured into four
divisions; Civil, Criminal, Juvenile, and Probate. Additionally, Probation, Juvenile Detention Center, and Court Administration all function as independent
departments/divisions under the purview of the court.
The Court is structured internally with an Executive Committee consisting of four judges elected by all Superior Court judges for two year terms. The Executive
Committee oversees the general policy and management of the Court. The Criminal and Civil Terms each have a chair who is appointed by the Executive
Committee to serve a two-year term. Specific departments also have Advisory Judges who provide policy input regarding the respective department.

Structure
Court
The 36 courts of the Court Division handle more than 45,000 civil cases and
more than 50,000 criminal cases each year. Some courts are specialty and/or
problem solving courts such as domestic violence, drug, mental health, and
traffic. The Traffic Division handles over 70,000 cases each year.
Probation Department
The Probation Department is comprised of two divisions: adult and juvenile.
Its mission is to enhance community safety by enforcing court orders while
striving to change lives. Probation assists in relieving jail bed concerns
through both pre-trial and post-adjudication services. The Juvenile Division
continues to implement strategies endorsed by the Juvenile Detention
Alternative Initiative which has resulted in a substantial reduction in the
number of juveniles being detained in the Juvenile Detention Center.

Court Administration
Court Administration manages and supports the overall operation of the
Courts including human resources, finance, payroll, facilities management,
procurement, information technology, fleet, and staff training.
Juvenile Detention
The Marion County Juvenile Detention Center (MCJDC) is a secured
detention facility for detained youth. The MCJDC maintains youth, ages 1118 years, in a safe and secure environment while allowing continuity of
services. Each youth detained within the MCJDC attends school, receives
medical and dental care, participates in mental health and basic health
exercises and learns basic life skills. The Marion Superior Court is
committed to providing a safe and secure Juvenile Detention Center while
providing practical, effective, and high-quality living and learning services
for the detained youth.

MARION COUNTY PROSECUTOR
Introduction
The Marion County Prosecutor’s Office seeks to place public safety as the number one priority and responsibility of government. We are dedicated to holding
criminals accountable for their actions, preserving the rights of victims and continually seeking justice, all while maintaining the highest of ethical standards.

Structure
Criminal Charging Division
Law enforcement agencies present cases to this division for criminal
charging determinations. Deputy prosecutors determine what charges are to
be filed in each case, or if additional investigation is necessary.

Special Victims Team
This division of the office includes cases involving sex crimes, domestic
violence and child abuse. It also collaborates with the Julian Center and
Child Advocacy Center.

Major Case Division
The Major Case Division handles major felony cases, including homicides.
Victim Advocates are assigned to each of these courts to ensure that victims
are notified of actions taken by the court and that they receive guidance and
support throughout the criminal justice process. Within the Major Case
Division, a Special Crimes Team includes prosecutors dedicated to human
trafficking, arson and unemployment insurance fraud.

Community Prosecution Division
Community prosecutors are assigned to police districts and special areas.
These prosecutors work closely with district commanders and detectives to
develop strategies tailored to the communities they serve. Community
prosecutors encourage community participation in public safety and crime
prevention, engaging residents in problem solving and establishing and
maintaining partnerships.

Grand Jury Division
Investigators assigned to the MCPO conduct long-term investigations in
cases involving white collar crime, public corruption and tax evasion. If
criminal activity is suspected, the evidence is presented to a Grand Jury
composed of six citizens of Marion County to determine if criminal charges
are filed.

Juvenile Division
This division is responsible for filing and prosecuting acts of delinquency
by children 17 years of age and younger, including truancy cases. In certain
cases, more serious crimes can be directly filed to the adult criminal court.

Strike Team
The Strike Team focuses on three (3) areas of crime – drugs, guns and
gangs. The Strike Team partners with various police departments and state
and federal agencies throughout the county to assist in investigations,
arrests, charging decisions and the presentation of the case to the court.
Forfeiture Division
Through partnerships with state and federal law enforcement agencies, the
Forfeiture Division strives to reduce the profitability of crime by seizing the
proceeds of criminal activity as allowed by state law. This goal is
accomplished by filing proceedings in civil courts whereby a judge may
determine that property owned by a defendant is subject to forfeiture.

Level 6 Felony/Misdemeanor Division
This division handles the prosecution of misdemeanor and Level 6 Felony
criminal cases. Cases include operating a vehicle while intoxicated, moving
traffic violations, theft, battery, resisting law enforcement, carrying a
handgun without a license and trespassing. This division handles more
criminal cases than all other divisions combined.
Correction Division
This division responds to all requests for post-conviction relief and for
sentence modifications. This division also handles all requests for
expungement of arrests and convictions and the sealing of criminal records.

MARION COUNTY COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS
Vision and Mission Statements
Vision
To provide the citizens of Marion County a safer community.

Mission
To enhance public safety by raising offender accountability through the use
of evidence based practices and interventions.

Structure
Home Detention
The electronic equipment used for client monitoring includes active radio
frequency for typical home detention clients as well as global positioning
satellite equipment for high risk offenders, including domestic violence
offenders who are on home detention. Community Corrections also offers
electronic alcohol monitoring equipment. Offenders may be placed on any
combination of Home Detention, GPS and Alcohol Monitoring. All offenders
under supervision have a variety of programming available.
Community Corrections utilizes the Indiana Risk Assessment System (IRAS)
to assess the risk of reoffending and services needed for all clients under
supervision. Based on overall risk score and identified criminogenic needs,
clients may be placed into the following evidence based programs presented
by trained facilitators: Parenting, Anger Management, Thinking For a
Change, Substance Abuse Treatment, as well as Job Readiness workshops
and GED/ABE. Mental health programs are also available for mentally ill
offenders who might otherwise have been incarcerated at the local or the state
levels.

Work Release
In October 2007, the agency opened the Duvall Residential Center which
provides services for male work release offenders and has capacity for up to
350 persons. All residents of Duvall are eligible for the same programming
opportunities as electronic monitoring offenders.

MARION COUNTY CORONER
Introduction
The Marion County Coroner's Office serves the needs of the families of those who die in Marion County as well as the needs of other agencies involved in the
investigation of unusual, unexpected and unexplained deaths. The office provides an accurate completion of the Coroner's Verdict and Death Certificates. With
regard to all such matters, the Coroner’s Office provides public education, support, compassion and confidentiality. All personnel strive to maintain the highest level
of integrity while serving the needs of Marion County citizens.
Structure
Administrative Division
Under the direct supervision of the Chief Deputy, the Administrative Division
works with the families, law enforcement agencies and the public to ensure
that public information is shared and general inquiries are addressed in a
timely manner.
Pathology Division
The Pathology Division comprises a contracted Forensic Pathology group, an
Indiana University School of Medicine Forensic Fellow and county-employed
Forensic Autopsy Assistants. Forensic Autopsies are performed by board
certified Forensic Pathologists, in accordance with the National Association
of Medical Examiner (NAME) Standards. These standards are used as a
guide to determine the cause and manner of death following the initial
investigation.

Investigations Division
Under direct supervision of the Chief Deputy Coroner, appointed Deputy
Coroners conduct various death investigations. About 3,000 deaths are
reported to the Marion County Coroner's Office annually, each of which is
examined by the Deputy Coroners to determine which warrant further
investigation. In over a thousand of these cases, the bodies of the decedents
are transported into the facility for forensic examination. Deputy Coroners are
certified by the Indiana State Coroner's Training Board. All investigators
who have been employed for more than one year become certified Medicolegal Death investigators, a designation recognized by the State of Indiana.

DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS
Introduction
The Indianapolis Department of Public Works (DPW) aims to improve residents’ quality of life through multi-modal connectivity, green space, capital improvements,
universal accessibility, and collaborative public and private partnerships. DPW builds and maintains public infrastructure, park land, manages solid waste collection and
the city’s entire fleet—striving always to provide effective, efficient customer service to citizens and visitors to Indianapolis, Marion County and ensuring a healthy,
safe, and natural environment.

Structure
Leadership
DPW is led by a director appointed by the mayor. The director is supported
directly by a chief of staff. Under DPW leadership are several offices that can
be organized into four main divisions: Policy and Planning, Engineering, Fleet
Services, and Operations. These four divisions are not rigid: On a day-to-day
basis, they merge to solve problems and increase livability across the City and
Marion County.
Policy and Planning
The Policy and Planning division works cooperatively to manage the
administration of the entire department, as directed by DPW leadership. This
division includes finance, the city-county council liaison, communications, the
Office of Sustainability, and the Office of Disability Affairs. While the Office of
Sustainability and the Office of Disability Affairs are housed within DPW and
report to the DPW director, they oversee livability and ADA issues for the entire
City and County. The offices within Policy and Planning work closely with
DPW leadership as well as deputy directors and administrators in Engineering,
Operations, and Fleet Services to ensure policies are developed and
implemented with fidelity, efficiency, and quality.
Operations:
The Operations division is responsible for solid waste collection and disposal;
maintenance of streets, traffic systems, levees, dams, as well as park facilities
and grounds; forestry work; and snow and ice removal from City streets. This
division is comprised of both union and non-union employees. The work
performed in DPW’s Operations division requires highly skilled, dedicated staff;
for that reason, DPW safety and training are housed in this division, as well.

Engineering Division
The Engineering division plans, designs, constructs, and maintains all streets,
storm water systems, roads, bridges, multi-modal paths, trails, parks, green
spaces, and thoroughfares. It is also responsible for access control, traffic
control, and lights for these assets. Furthermore, the Engineering division
manages the development of studies, inventories, programs, and projects—and
manages all contracts related to transportation and storm water infrastructure.
DPW’s Engineering division oversees parks capital development and land
stewardship activities as well. Engineering—in collaboration with Operations
and Fleet Services—works to directly implement the vision of DPW and City
leadership.
Fleet Services
The Fleet Services division is responsible for the maintenance, fueling,
monitoring, and repair of all vehicles and other City-owned equipment—
including public safety vehicles—and the operation of a municipal garage.
Further, Fleet Services maintains and supplies fuel for vehicles and equipment
owned by several other governmental agencies on a contractual basis. Like
Operations, the Fleet Services division includes union and non-union
employees.

OFFICE OF MINORITY & WOMEN BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT
Introduction
The Office of Minority &Women Business Development (OMWBD) works to enhance the City’s growth and economic stability through promotion of contracting

Through community outreach, special events and programs such as startup consulting and certification services, the Office of Minority & Women Business
Development is an active partner to all City of Indianapolis certified MBE/WBE/VBE/DOBEs.
Structure
Certification
MBE, WBE, VBE and DOBEs must be certified with the City through the
OMWBD. The OMWBD must verify that they meet the requirements of the
certification program. Recently implemented was the enforcement of the
vendor registration process through the Purchasing Department. This process
allows the streamlining of the certification process so that the office now has
better calculated M/W/V/DOBE participation reports for City and County
agencies.
Business Development
The OMWBD acts as a resource center for MBE, WBE, VBE and DOBEs
and provides programing that assists with the growth and development of
companies, through outreach events, and educational workshops.

Compliance
OMWBD is responsible for reviewing all contracts, and the tracking of MBE,
WBE, VBE and DOBE participation on all contracts. DMWBD monitors
contracts to ensure the participation goals are being met.
Diversity Program
Recognize businesses and organizations that encourage, embrace, and
celebrate differences that foster a better place in which to live, work and raise
a family.
The Office of Minority & Women Business Development is responsible for
the Mayor’s Celebration of Diversity Awards luncheon, the Martin Luther
King Holiday Celebration, Major Taylor “Your Life Matters” Bike Ride and
the “Your Life Matters” Campaign; and working with the Indiana Black Expo

Office of Audit and Performance
Introduction
The overall mission of the City-County Office of Audit and Performance is to assure the Mayor, the Marion County elected officials, the City-County
Council, and the citizens of the Consolidated City of Indianapolis, Marion County that operations within city departments and county agencies have effective
accounting and administrative controls. The Office of Audit and Performance operates independently to appraise and to report the effectiveness of the
management and of the financial controls of all city departments and county agencies. Furthermore, the Office of Audit and Performance conducts
performance audits, process improvement projects, follow-up reviews and other special projects as well as responds to management requests.
Structure
The Office of Audit and Performance comprises three functioning areas, each with their own operational goals and activities by a common vision.
Financial Audit
The Financial Audit area assists the Controller’s Office with the
Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) as well as providing
financial audit assistance to other City-County agencies. The Office of
Audit and Performance conducts financial maintenance on monetary
transactions and provides assistance to external auditors in their
examinations of City and of County financial statements and of federal
program administration.

Performance Audit
This area audits various process and program functions within City and
County agencies. Performance audits can vary between department and
agencies, but the goal is to provide objective analysis of processes and
programs to ensure they are functioning properly and efficiently as well
as to identify fraud and abuse.

LEAN Six Sigma
This area is the core Six Sigma group within the Consolidated City of
Indianapolis, Marion County local government. Audit and Performance
staff members are Lean Six Sigma certified and have conducted various
process improvement projects. The staff also conducts Lean Six Sigma
training for the enterprise. In addition, the Office of Audit and Performance
manages IndyStat performance measures.

Budget Justification
1.) The Office of Audit and Performance is maintaining its 2015 approved budget limits for 2016. There has been a slight increase in character one, due partly to
the anticipated 8% increase in health insurance cost for the enterprise.
2.) The majority of OAP’s expenses is in character one, which covers taxes, health insurance and wellness.
3.) We must maintain a reserve in Character 3 for the pursuit of outside consulting to investigate fraud, when needed. We also must obtain essential advanced
training for our Auditors and Sigma professionals. OAP takes advantage of local/online free Continuing Professional Education (CPE) training. The nature of our
role in the enterprise depends on the staff maintaining a high level of proficiency in auditing and process improvement skills. Furthering the staff’s knowledge of
new skills, market trends and best practices increases the value to the organization and is a critical expenditure to the Office of Audit and Performance’s budget.

compensation. In this capacity, the Auditor serves as a fiscal agent and administers
funds for various entities throughout Marion County, including Noble of Indiana,
the Indiana State Fair Board and State-certified community mental health centers.
Further, adult safekeeping and State institutional expenses for County residents also
are paid out of the Auditor's budget.

Accounting Division
The Accounting Division provides accounts payable, accounts receivable and other
accounting functions; monitors payments for budget and policy compliance;
provides information for the annual financial report; and provides financial direction
for all City and County entities. The Division also synchronizes activities with the
Office of Finance and Management.

Real Estate Division
The Real Estate Division provides customer service for Marion County residents,
processing all tax deductions, abatements, tax bill corrections, and refunds. The
Division administers all noticing requirements, redemptions and refunds for the tax
sale, as well as investigates homestead deduction fraud. The Division also
synchronizes activities with the Assessor’s, Recorder’s and Treasurer’s Office.

Budget Justification
The Marion County Auditor’s offices will reduce the impact to the general fund by moving certain real estate-related personnel expenses (character one) and tax sale–related
costs to the ineligible deduction fund (homestead verification fund), beginning in 2015 and again in the 2016 expense budget, for a total shift in funding sources of more than
$1.3M. The ineligible deduction fund will be additionally replenished in 2016 by transferring duties currently performed under a multi-million dollar service contract back inhouse and eliminating the associated collection fees. The Auditor’s office will incur an increase in postage expense as the federal postage rate increased in July of 2015. However,
the Auditor will be focusing on savings through a paperless environment by scanning deduction forms and reducing the expense of storage. Further saving will be accomplished
by allowing all deduction forms to be completed, received and stored digitally. We will further realize a significant change in all department expenses by reorganization of
duties, installing scanning equipment and software, streamlining processes, as well as digitizing documents office-wide.

MARION COUNTY ASSESSOR
Introduction
The Marion County Assessor’s main goal is to ensure the accuracy of property tax assessments. Each property owner pays a fair share of local government expenses
based on the value of the property owned. The County Assessor is responsible for determining the fair market value of each property in the county. In addition, the
County Assessor processes Inheritance Tax returns and determines whether taxpayers are entitled to inheritance tax returns and charitable and non-profit property tax
exemptions. Any time a taxpayer wishes to appeal an assessment decision, the appeal goes through the Property Tax Assessment Board of Appeals (PTABOA)
hearing process administered by the County Assessor.
Structure
Assessment Division
The Assessment Division assesses all real and business property throughout
the county. This division coordinates the efforts of field personnel, audit
staffs and valuation experts to perform all phases of the assessment process in
accordance with International Association of Assessing Officers standards.
The division is further divided into functional areas separately covering
commercial, industrial, and residential properties, and reviewing taxpayers'
reports on business personal property. The division has three satellite offices
offering taxpayers convenient places to obtain residential assessment
information and services.
Administration Division
The Administration Division is responsible for budget creation and
monitoring, payroll, human resources administration, facilities management,
procurement, education administration, process improvement, as well as
document management and retention. Further, it administers the hearing
process of the PTABOA and the review of property tax exemption
applications for charities and non-profits. Finally, this division also conducts
the auditing and processing of inheritance tax returns.

Data Analysis Division
The Data Analysis Division collects, manages and analyzes the large amounts
of data needed for both efficient and modern assessment results. It also
creates satellite-coordinated mapping and connects assessment data to each
property geographically. Moreover, the division manages ownership changes
and records as well as parcel map changes. The division is responsible for the
sales disclosure process which collects, reviews and validates all property
sales in the county. Finally, the division organizes this enormous quantity of
data into reports and statistics, which is useful to the Assessment Division and
to other government agencies, and is available for dissemination to citizens
over the Internet.

MARION COUNTY RECORDER
Introduction
The Marion County Recorder’s Office maintains permanent public records involving a wide variety of instruments, including documents related to real estate,
personal property, mortgages, liens, leases, subdivision plats, military discharges, and personal bonds. Generally, these instruments are recorded either for giving
legal public notice of their existence or for safekeeping and future reference.
Structure
The Recorder’s Office reorganized its staff in June 2015 to provide more efficient and effective customer service.

Recording and Records Management
The Recorder’s Office accepts documents in person, by mail or electronically;
examines, records, scans, indexes, and makes accessible to the public
important real estate documents.
The office continues to seek innovative and technological advances to
enhance service delivery and reduce costs. Electronic recording continues to
increase with nearly 50% of all documents submitted as such. Later this year,
an electronic document router will be implemented to supplement the
electronic recording process and provide customers the ability to receive an
electronic copy of their recorded documents.

The Recorder’s Office manages and maintains records dating from 1822.
Copies of recorded documents are available to the public using paper copies,
microfilm and digital images. Recorded documents are accessible within the
office using public service terminals or online through subscription and free
single-use search engines.
Records from March 1964 through the present are maintained both digitally
and on microfilm. The office is undertaking a project to replace deteriorating
microfilm and digitize records prior to 1964. When completed, all of the
records held by the Recorder’s Office will be available and searchable online,
allowing greater access for the public.

MARION COUNTY SURVEYOR
Introduction
The Marion County Surveyor's Office was established by the Indiana Constitution in 1851. General Land Office surveys in what is now Marion County began in
1819. Marion County is part of the rectangular survey system (Public Land System), which divides the land into sections that are one square mile. All real estate
boundaries in Marion County can be traced back to the Public Land System. Statute law requires the Surveyor to recheck at least five percent of the section corners
each year, there are nearly 2400 corners. The Marion County Surveyor’s Office maintains a Legal Survey Record Book and a Corner Record Book. No fee is
charged for surveying services provided to any city, county and other governmental agencies.
Structure
The Marion County Surveyor's Office has three areas of focus, each with their own operational goals and activities while being unified by a common vision.
Surveying
In the field, the staff performs the precise measurements of Section Corners
and ties, per Indiana Code and replacing said monuments as necessary. We
monitor the Eagle Creek Dam for horizontal and vertical movement as well as
performing vital research within the office.
Information Technology
Information Technology supports the needs of the Surveyor’s Office. This
area compiles the data surveyors collect in the field by use of AutoCAD and
GIS software. Further, that data along with both the corner history and
drawing (which this department provides) is posted onto the county’s website.
We collect and quality-check all measurements to ensure accurate, reliable
information is provided.
Having a greater reliance on new technology has helped the Surveyor’s office
to build a solid fiscal commitment to provide government and private sector
agencies and companies timely, accurate and useful information, while
helping us and these agencies and companies save taxpayers’ money and
time. Finally, these advancements in technology have enabled us to fulfill
our legal obligation for the completion of the Alcohol & Tobacco
Commission’s Verification of Business Location forms.

Preservation
Preservation is as much a part of the Surveyor’s Office as surveying and
technology. We believe in the importance of preserving our past for the
future generations. Understanding the necessity of creating legible electronic
copies of the records, maps, surveys and plats housed in the Surveyor’s
Office, we work to ensure that they will be easily accessible for years to
come. By concentrating on this now we have been able to scan or have
scanned already deteriorating documents.
Copies of recorded documents are available to the public using paper copies,
microfilm and digital images. Recorded documents are accessible within the
office using public service terminals or online through subscription and free
single-use search engines.
Records from March 1964 through the present are maintained both digitally

Debt Service
The Consolidated City carries different types of debt associated with
various programs and services. This debt takes on two forms: (1)
general obligation debt, which is supported by a pledge of the full
faith and credit of the Consolidated City and is usually funded by tax
revenue, and (2) special revenue debt, which is supported by a
pledge of a specific revenue stream.

Special Revenue Debt
Special revenue debt is mostly associated with Tax Increment
Financing (TIF) districts throughout Marion County. This debt is
supported through property tax increment capture. This financing
tool is used to develop and grow various communities and
neighborhoods that otherwise would have little growth potential.

Generally, the revenue stream pledged for special revenue debt is a
fee or other non-tax revenue. In the case of debt funded by tax
increment financing (TIF), tax increment revenue captured is
segregated from the regular property tax revenue of the Consolidated
City.

TIF funds, including debt service for TIF bonds, are not appropriated
by the City-County Council. In Marion County, the Metropolitan
Development Commission (MDC) serves as the fiscal body for TIF
funds.

The Consolidated City of Indianapolis, Marion County takes pride
and care in maintaining its AAA (stable) credit rating for its general
obligation debt.
General Obligation Debt
Most of the Consolidated City’s general obligation debt is related to
transportation, parks, and emergency communications infrastructure.
Other general obligation debt is related to police and fire pension
costs as well as redevelopment efforts throughout the Consolidated
City.
Debt service payments for general obligation debt are typically
funded entirely, or in part, with tax revenue. Only tax-supported debt
service is included in tables presented in this report.

Other special revenue debt includes economic development bonds
which are typically supported by a revenue stream generated by a
specific investment. An example would be a bond issued to finance a
parking garage with the parking fees pledged to pay the debt service.
Another example would be financing stormwater projects,
undertaken by the Consolidated City to address flood control
problems, with stormwater fees pledged to paying the debt service.
TIF debt service and other special revenue debt service is not
included in tables presented in this report, but is available separately.
