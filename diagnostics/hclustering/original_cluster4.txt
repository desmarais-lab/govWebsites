****** GROUNDBREAKING CEREMONY SET FOR NEW CO-OP HOUSING DEVELOPMENT ******

Neighborhood Development Associates, South Bend Heritage Foundation, and Justus
Property Management will hold a groundbreaking ceremony for South Bend Mutual
Homes, a new residential development in South Bend‚Äôs Lincoln Park
Neighborhood on Thursday, August 20 at 10 am in the 900 block of Fuerbringer
Street.
The Lincoln Park neighborhood will be revitalized with a new cooperative
housing development featuring 24 single-family homes on vacant lots in an area
that has been a focus the city‚Äôs Vacant and Abandoned House initiative. Each
new home will have two to four bedrooms, a full basement, and a garage. Costs
to residents are expected to range from $253 to $632 per month, plus
utilities.¬ 
‚ÄúPooling the members‚Äô resources leads to lower costs,‚Äù says Anne Mannix
of Neighborhood Development Associates, ‚Äúand that cooperative structure makes
member ownership accessible to more residents.‚Äù
Funding for the project includes $479,996 per year for 10 years in tax credits
from the Indiana Housing and Community Development Authority¬ and a $400,000
grant from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis. 1st Source is the local
sponsoring bank for the grant. The initiative is also funded through the City
of South Bend HOME funds and low-income housing tax-credit equity.
‚ÄúThis project has been recognized as one of most innovative in the state,‚Äù
says Mayor Pete Buttigieg. ‚ÄúThis quality, new affordable housing is a great
example how empty lots can be transformed into a healthy neighborhood again.‚Äù
Bridges Out of Poverty, a¬ nationally recognized program to move people out of
poverty, will provide support for residents and researchers from Indiana
University South Bend will study the effects of cooperative housing on the
neighborhood.¬ 
‚ÄúMutual Homes will help working families take charge of their own housing
destiny,‚Äù says Marco Mariani,¬ Executive Director of the South Bend Heritage
Foundation. ‚ÄúAnd those families will be the catalyst in the neighborhood
revitalization.‚Äù
For additional information, contact Anne Mannix, Neighborhood Development
Associates at 574-288-4369 or Marco Mariani, South Bend Heritage Foundation at

****** NOTICE OF PUBLIC MEETING TO DISCUSS LONG TERM CONTROL PLAN ******

Notice is hereby given, the City of South Bend will host a citizen advisory
committee meeting on Wednesday, July 8 from 5:30 to 7¬ pm at the Morris Bistro,
211 N. Michigan St., to discuss the reassessment of the CSO Long Term Control
Plan. Community members are invited to this public meeting.
The City is in the process of reassessing its federally-mandated LTCP. This
relook involves a more technical approach with an emphasis on saving taxpayer
money¬ and protecting the environment through increased efficiency. The purpose
of the meeting is to provide an opportunity for public participation and
guidance to the City. ¬ 
South Bend developed a LTCP to reduce sewer overflows into local waterways. In
line with the Clean Water Act, the plan is mandated by the Environmental
Protection Agency and Department of Justice and is intended to reduce combined
sewer overflows to the St. Joseph River.

RESOLUTION NO. 2016-10 A RESOLUTION OF THE COMMON
COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF JASPER, INDIANA, APPROVING THE
ISSUANCE OF ONE OR MORE SERIES OF BONDS TO BE ISSUED BY
OR ON BEHALF OF JASPER PUBLIC LIBRARY
This resolution approves the issuance of bonds to be issued by the Jasper Public
Library for a library building.
A motion was made by Council member Earl Schmitt and seconded by Council
member Nancy Eckerle to consider the resolution for one reading only. Motion
carried 6-0 and 1 abstention by Council member Dean Vonderheide. Thereafter, a
motion was made by Council member David Hurst and seconded by Council
member Earl Schmitt to read the resolution by title only. Motion carried 6-0 and
1 abstention by Council member Dean Vonderheide. The city attorney so read the
resolution. Thereafter, a motion was made by Council member Nancy Eckerle
and seconded by Council member John Bell to pass and adopt Resolution No.
2016-10. Motion carried 6-0 and 1 abstention by Council member Dean
Vonderheide. Vonderheide said he was abstaining from voting on this matter
because he is a member of the library board.
Under discussion, Bill Shaneyfelt, the attorney representing the Jasper Public
Library, said the resolution is self-explanatory. Because the library board is an
appointed board, it needs approval from a fiscal body before it can issue bonds.
Shaneyfelt said by approving this resolution, the City in no way becomes
obligated to repay the bonds of the Library nor do such bonds count against the
City's constitutional debt limit.

UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE/
ORDINANCE NO. 2016-30 AN ORDINANCE ESTABLISHING
A UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE FOR THE CITY OF
JASPER, INDIANA AND ITS JURISDICTIONAL AREA AND
PROVIDING FOR THE ADMINISTRATION, ENFORCEMENT, AND
AMENDMENT THEREOF, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS
OF STATE LAW AND FOR THE REPEAL OF ORDINANCE NO. 1993-17,
ALL AMENDMENTS THERETO AND ALL ORDINANCES AND
SECTIONS OF THE MUNICIPAL CODE OF JASPER, INDIANA, IN
CONFLICT THEREWITH OR ANY SECTION THEREOF
Mayor Seitz said the council needs to consider the unified development ordinance
[UDO]. The options are to: [1]accept, [2]reject, [3]amend, or [4]not act on the
ordinance. If adopted, the ordinance will be referenced Ordinance No. 2016-30
A Notice of Intent to Consider Ordinance was sent to the news media and was
posted at city hall.
City Attorney Renee Kabrick said the City is repealing the existing subdivision
control ordinance and zoning map and replacing it with the proposed unified
development ordinance. The council currently has the recommended text and
zoning map and has one of the four options listed above to consider. The council
has the opportunity to approve the UDO text and send back to the plan
commission to approve the original zone map.
Council member John Bell suggested sending the map back to the plan
commission thereby certain property owners would have to make rezoning
requests thus giving the adjoining property owners time to be heard.
After some discussion, the council wanted to approve the UDO language and
amend the map from the recommended map to the map that was originally
proposed thus sending it back to the plan commission for consideration.
Before approving the ordinance, Council member John Bell said he would like a
presentation or a summary of the changes. The ordinance is over 200 pages and
he wants to better understand what is being changed.

5

Director of Community Development and Planning Darla Blazey responded by
saying she felt she has communicated the changes along the way. She would be
happy to explain the changes to anyone but the City needs to move forward with
the UDO. She said there is no way one can take the current ordinance and show
the changes because the UDO is a complete re-write. Blazey said she will
provide Bell with the power point presentation that was developed by the
consultant.
Council member Nancy Eckerle commented that the City needs to put the
ordinance into action to see what does and does not work.
Thereafter, a motion was made by Council member Gregory Schnarr and
seconded by Council member John Bell to amend exhibit A and adopt the
ordinance and amend the map from the plan commission recommended map to
the first proposed map. Motion carried 7-0.
Kabrick said the amendment will now go to the plan commission for final
approval. If approved, the ordinance will take effect January 1, 2017.
ORDINANCE NO. 2016 ‚Äì 31 AN ORDINANCE ESTABLISHING
REVISED FLOOD HAZARD AREA REGULATIONS FOR THE CITY OF
JASPER, INDIANA AND ITS PLANNING JURISDICTION AND
PROVIDING FOR THE ADMINISTRATION, ENFORCEMENT, AND
AMENDMENT THEREOF, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS

This ordinance re-establishes the language regarding Flood District(s) and Flood
Damage Prevention contained within Title 16 in its entirety.

Council member John Bell to consider the ordinance for one reading only.
Motion carried 7-0. Thereafter, a motion was made by Council member Earl
Schmitt and seconded by Council member David Hurst to read the ordinance by
title only. Motion carried 7-0. The city attorney so read the ordinance.

request for approval for a planned unit development [PUD] district for the River
Centre. He said he is only presenting information tonight. The council will
consider the ordinance at a special meeting scheduled for December 9, 2016. City
Attorney Renee Kabrick said this matter will be treated as a rezone. The area

****** SOUTH BEND SAVES MILLIONS WITH BOND REFINANCING ******

The City of South Bend refinanced bonds this week that will save taxpayers more
than $2 million.
‚ÄúThanks to efforts to decrease our debt through smart fiscal planning, South
Bend has created a more secure financial future,‚Äù Mayor Pete Buttigieg says.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs taken much work and tough choices, but our financial fundamentals are
strong.‚Äù
Refinancing of the $27.4 million Sewage Works Revenue Bonds at a low interest
rate will also lower future increases to residents‚Äô monthly sewer bills.
‚ÄúThe City has a good bond rating because we do not have a high amount of
indebtedness, and we have shown fiscal responsibility,‚Äù City Controller John
Murphy says. ‚ÄúFollowing years of declining tax revenue, refinancing is
essential¬ to maintaining South Bend‚Äôs fiscal health.‚Äù
Standard &amp; Poor‚Äôs recently reaffirmed South Bend‚Äôs AA rating. The
ratings company defines¬ an AA rating as a ‚Äúvery strong capacity to meet
financial commitments.‚Äù South Bend is tied with Fishers for the highest
rating of any second class city in Indiana, which the state¬ defines as cities
with a population between 35,000 and 600,000.
It‚Äôs not the first time refinancing has been used to save taxpayers‚Äô money.
The City was able to take advantage of low interest rates in 2012, 2013, and
2014 to refinance bonds. Under the Buttigieg administration, refinancings have
saved South Bend taxpayers almost $9 million.

They are each charged with the following:
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢

Felony Murder (two counts)
Conspiracy to Commit Arson, Class A Felony (one count)
Arson, Class A Felony (12 counts)
Arson, Class B Felony (33 counts)

Both Mark Leonard and Monserrate Shirley are each charged with an additional
count of Conspiracy to Commit Arson, a Class B Felony.
‚ÄúA year ago at this time, seven-year-old Kyleigh Crane and her uncle Jeremy Crane
were shot and killed here in Marion County. In recent months, we have filed
charges in deaths of three-year-old Carmen Ellis and three-month-old Phillip Robey.
And now we are here today to discuss a thoroughly senseless act which resulted in
the death of two young adults in the prime of their life,‚Äù said Prosecutor Curry
during the press conference.
‚ÄúWe have to acknowledge that we are helpless to alleviate the pain and anguish of
such innocent victims and their families,‚Äù Prosecutor Curry continued. ‚ÄúHowever,
what we as a public safety community can do and must do is devote our best
efforts to see that justice is served on behalf of those victims. As with any matter
filed by our office, we are absolutely committed to see that justice is done on behalf
of all who have been victimized by the Richmond Hill explosion.‚Äù

As set forth in the probable cause affidavit, the explosion also caused injuries to 12
individuals who lived in Richmond Hill. According to the probable cause affidavit,
the city‚Äôs Department of Code enforcement estimates approximately $4 million in
residential damages. This figure has not been confirmed by professional appraisers
and does not include personal items and belongings.
Joining Prosecutor Curry at the press conference were Public Safety Director Troy
Riggs, Division of Homeland Security Chief Gary Coons, IMPD Chief Rick Hite, IFD
Chief Brian Sanford, and Pat Hand with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms
and Explosives.
While an initial hearing date has not been set, the cases have been assigned to
Criminal Court 3.

***** Combined_Sewer_Overflow_-_CSO [1] *****

What is CSO?
**** Why Our Sewers Overflow When It Rains ****
More than 100 years ago, South Bend and many other cities across the country,
built storm sewers to carry rainwater and melting snow away from homes,
businesses and¬ streets. In those horse-and-buggy days, these cities didn't
have sewage treatment or even indoor plumbing. When indoor plumbing came later,
homeowners and business owners hooked their sewage lines to the existing storm
sewers, combining storm water and raw sewage into one pipe. The pipes emptied
directly into the river, until the 1950's when sewage treatment plants were
built. This was common practice in many U.S. cities, especially in the
Northeast¬ and Midwest.
During dry weather, a "combined" sewer system works much like a separated sewer
-- carrying all sewage to the treatment plant for treatment; however, when it
rains or snow melts, the sewers can be overloaded with incoming stormwater.
When this happens, the sewers_are_designed [2] to flow over internal dams in
the underground pipes and into nearby streams and rivers. This is referred to
as a Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) system. Without this release valve, raw
sewage would back up into people's basements and streets.
Millions of gallons of untreated sewage and rainwater enter the St. Joseph
River each year. State and federal regulations require cities to develop long
term plans to reduce these overflows. The City of South Bend is just one of
almost 800 CSO communities across the country dealing with Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) mandated CSO Long Term Control Plans (LTCP) that are
costly and pose multiple social and economic impacts to our residents. Our
motivation is driven by the fact that South Bend has 36 CSOs which typically
overflow 60-70 times each year, resulting in approximately 1 billion gallons of
overflows into the St. Joseph River. In addition, when the CSO system‚Äôs
capacity is exceeded, basement backups can occur.
**** What is a Long Term Control Plan and Consent Decree? ****
Historically, the City invested in wastewater infrastructure to reduce CSOs
prior to the formalization of a LTCP or signing of the consent decree. During
the period between 1990 and 2004, the City spent over $87M on CSO
infrastructure improvements in order to reduce overflows, increase system
capacity, and improve efficiencies; thus, the City began implementation of its
LTCP prior to 2011, when the consent decree was signed.
Motivated by the idea of doing more with less, and focusing on getting as much
capacity from the current collection and wastewater system as possible, the
City deployed approximately 140 real-time monitoring sensors throughout the
sewer collection system in 2007. This was done in order to answer the question:
Is the City making the most of the existing infrastructure? In other words, the
City desired to know if there was unused capacity within the existing
collection system, such as within the sewers and at the Wastewater Treatment
Plant (WWTP), and then develop solutions to use the existing system to its full
capacity and identify areas to prioritize improvements.
In December 2011, the US EPA approved the City of South Bend‚Äôs Long_Term
Control_Plan [3] document, which was created in an effort to record the
historical context of the evolution of the plan. After a considerable amount of
negotiations, the City of South Bend, Indiana and the U.S. Department of
Justice entered into a Consent_Decree [4] relating to the Clean Water Act CSO
Control_Policy [5] in early 2012.
The 2012 consent decree requires the City to spend approximately $600M (2012
Dollars) on wastewater_treatment_plant_(WWTP)_upgrades [6] and CSO control
methods, separated into two phases of work within the sewer collection system,
to reduce both the volume and number of overflows to the river. Phase 1,
includes source control technologies to prevent storm water from entering the
collection system both upstream [7] and downstream [8] of the river. Phase_2
[9] consists of the ultimate conveyance of excess flows from the existing CSOs
to nine separate storage facilities.
As allowed for in the consent decree language, the City has continued to look
for ways to improve upon and reduce LTCP costs. The City recently investigated
the feasibility and potential cost savings of using a combination of low impact
development, real time control, and conventional methods for CSO control. The
resultant Optimatics_Study [10] was a feasibility and planning document that
provided useful insight for optimization of the 2012 LTCP.
In addition, since 2010 several improvements have been made to the collection
system as a result of real-time monitoring and remote throttle activation by
CSONet [11]. Improvements included reducing the total amount of combined sewer
area via separation projects, raising weir heights, and throttling more flow to
the main interceptor sewer to reduce overflows.
**** Reassessment of the LTCP ****
In 2014, the City initiated a reassessment of the 2012 LTCP in order to find
additional cost savings. The reassessment of the 2012 LTCP will review system
optimization and evaluate several options based on real-time technology. For
example, a preliminary review of real-time data has identified that potential
trunk line interconnections throughout the collection system may move flows
from satellite areas of the system to the WTTP, eliminating the need for
possible storage as planned in the 2012 LTCP. Opportunities for inline storage
and regulating flows at other CSOs to the interceptor will also be evaluated.
The reassessment of the LTCP will follow a comprehensive approach to include
integrated and cost-effective solutions that also consider elements of green
infrastructure solutions (GSI).
Throughout the process, the City will provide updates on the reassessment of
the LTCP. In order to provide multiple opportunities for public involvement,
the City has established an Advisory Committee that meets regularly to discuss
the reassessment progress as well as to gain input from the public. In
addition, the Common Council Utilities Committee will hold meetings to provide
similar updates on the LTCP reassessment. All meetings are open to the public.

Disconnect Downspouts
Why it Matters
The¬ Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) system that captures waste water from homes
and businesses¬ also¬ contains¬ storm water captured from street sewers and
gutter downspouts from homes. When large rainfall events overwhelm the system,
the CSO overflows, sending raw sewage into the St. Joseph River.

METROPOLITAN DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE

The Metropolitan Development Committee of the City-County Council met on Monday,
November 16, 2009. Chairman Kent Smith called the meeting to order at 5:35 p.m. with
the following members present: Jeff Cardwell, Brian Mahern, Dane Mahern, Janice
McHenry, Jackie Nytes and Lincoln Plowman. Jose Evans arrived shortly thereafter.
Ginny Cain was absent.
Chairman Smith asked the Committee members to introduce themselves and indicate
which portion of the County they represent.
PROPOSAL NO. 410, 2009 - approves the amounts, locations and programmatic
operation of certain projects to be funded from the Community Development Grant
Funds in 2010
Jennie Fults, Administrator, Community Economic Development Division of the
Department of Metropolitan Development (DMD), introduced Erica Aquila, Assistant
Administrator, and various staff members who participate in the action plan process.
She gave a brief powerpoint presentation (attached as Exhibit A) regarding the
Consolidated Plan, which is developed through a community process and provides an
analysis of housing and community development needs, and sets forth a plan for the
type of activities needed to meet these needs. She said that this plan also serves as
the application for federal entitlement grant programs. She outlined the steps to the
Consolidated Plan and said that two public meetings were held, surveys were sent out
to the neighborhood organizations, and consultations took place with over 95
stakeholders to determine needs and priorities. She explained the goals and strategies
for 2010 to 2014, which are as follows:
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢

Encourage economic development activities and efforts in the community..
Stabilize distressed neighborhoods through targeted development.
Support housing stabilization efforts throughout Marion County.
Prevent homelessness through the support and operations of programs that
serve very low-income residents.
Decrease homelessness through support of homeless programs and housing
projects.
Support the needs of persons living with HIV/AIDS and their families (specifically
related to the Housing Opportunities for Persons with Aids/HOPWA grant).

[Clerk‚Äôs Note: Councillor Evans arrived at 5:43 p.m.]

Ms. Fults stated that the Consolidated Plan is available on the department‚Äôs website.
She said that the Annual Action Plan then updates the Consolidated Plan and allocates
program dollars to projects that will assist in achieving the objectives set forth in that
plan. She said that there are four main grant programs covered in the action plan:
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢

Community Development Block Grant (CDBG),
Home Investment Partnership (HOME),
Emergency Shelter Grant (ESG), and
Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA).

Ms. Fults stated that they received input from citizens through public meetings, surveys
through the jury pool and published surveys on the city‚Äôs website. The department
received 426 surveys and then formulated its top five housing related issues, top three
service related issues, and top three homeless service needs. She said that requests
totaled $27.1 million, with only $13 million to distribute. She said that they had over $10
million more in requests than last year.
Councillor B. Mahern asked from what areas the extra $10 million in requests came.
Ms. Fults said that it was across the board, but major increases were seen in job
placement, affordable rental opportunities and public service programs.
Ms. Fults explained the scoring and evaluation criteria and stated that all applicants are
made aware of the scoring and evaluation criteria throughout every step of the approval
process.
Councillor D. Mahern asked about IndyGo providing bus tickets to homeless shelters,
and asked if all these shelters are on or near a bus route. Ms. Fults answered in the
affirmative. Councillor D. Mahern asked how the brownfields, unsafe buildings and
demolition program allotments compare to other years. Ms. Fults said that they are all
the exact same funding amount as previous years. Councillor D. Mahern asked about
the reference to grants for HOPWA monies going to a hospital in Bloomington, and how
that benefits Marion County residents. Ms. Fults said that the HOPWA grant is different
from the others in that it covers Marion County and eight surrounding counties. This
particular Bloomington facility serves portions of Brown County, which is included in this
grant‚Äôs region. She said that all of the other grant programs from the Department of
Housing and Urban Development (HUD) require that the funds be used in Marion
County. However, HUD defines the service area for the HOPWA grants to include the
contiguous surrounding counties and Brown County. This hospital, or service provider,
serves Brown County. Councillor D. Mahern asked if this is the only provider that falls
into this category. Ms. Fults said that it is based on region, and they are required to
serve all of Region 7, and that is the only instance that she can recall. Councillor D.
Mahern asked if a map can be provided to committee members of Region 7 so that they
can explain this to constituents if asked.

Councillor Nytes asked about the process for documenting actual results. Ms. Fults
said that organizations that receive funding from the city through DMD are required to
report quarterly, and they track progress in that way. They also provide, at minimum,
one on-site visit of all recipients, and are required to do an annual report to HUD in
March of each year. This report includes performance evaluations of all individual
recipients, as well as progress toward meeting the action plan goals and benchmarks.
Councillor McHenry asked how they know people are indeed 80% below median
income to receive housing benefits. Ms. Fults said that the recipient organizations have
specific documentation they are required to use, prescribed by HUD, with prior year tax
documents, current check stubs, etc. required to confirm income levels. She said that
these are primarily community-based organizations and they work closely with the
clients to establish a relationship, as well as procuring the required documentation.
Councillor McHenry asked if home visits are conducted. Ms. Fults said that all of those
receiving downpayment or mortgage assistance are put through the normal rigorous
standard mortgage approval process with all due diligence. Organizations that provide
money for home repairs do make on-site physical inspections. She said that the city
also has three inspectors within DMD who review all work before it is done to insure that
they are meeting all applicable codes and providing quality work.
Councillor D. Mahern asked if the committee can receive a list of applicants who
received funding last year that are not receiving it this year, and those who are new on
the list this year. He said that this will help to show citizens that it is a rigorous process
and not everyone gets funding every year. Ms. Fults agreed to provide these lists.
Councillor D. Mahern asked when the 2011 process will begin. Ms. Fults said that the
application will be released to the public in late June, and will be available on the
website and published in the newspaper. She said that up until that application is
released, organizations that wish to apply for these grants who need technical
assistance can contact Ms. Aquila at 327-5444.
Chairman Smith called for public testimony at 6:06 p.m.
Michael Osborne, president of the Near North Development Corporation and
representative of the Indianapolis Coalition for Neighborhood Development (ICND),
stated that ICND is a delivery mechanism for almost 60% of the HOME funds and 45%
of the CDBG funds, and they appreciate the city‚Äôs partnership and support the
committee moving forward with this proposal.
Katie Brett, Indy East Asset Development Corporation, thanked the DMD staff for
working with them to create affordable housing opportunities and urged the committee
to support the proposal.
Councillor Nytes said that she wold like to vote on this issue, because she appreciates
all the work put into the process. However, she asked for consent to abstain to avoid a

Metropolitan Development Committee

Page 4
possible conflict of interest because of her involvement in one of the organizations
receiving some of these grant dollars. Consent was given.
Councillor B. Mahern moved, seconded by Councillor Plowman, to send Proposal No.
410, 2009 to the full Council with a ‚ÄúDo Pass‚Äù recommendation. The motion carried by
a vote of 7-0-1, with Councillor Nytes abstaining.
There being no further business, and upon motion duly made, the meeting was
adjourned at 6:12 p.m.
Respectfully Submitted,

Kent Smith, Chairman

PR-15 Citizen Participation

Summary of citizen participation process/Efforts made to broaden citizen participation
Summarize citizen participation process and how it impacted goal-setting
Analysis to Impediments
Prior to beginning the 2015- 2019 Consolidated Plan process, the City of Evansville
contracted with the Indiana Association of Community and Economic Development
(IACED). The city contracted with IACED in order to prepare the 2015-2019 Analysis of
Impediments to Fair Housing Choice. IACED obtained public input by conducting
interviews with various agencies, holding a public meeting to discuss fair housing
issues, and meeting with Evansville Housing Authority voucher residents.
Public Notice was posted in the Evansville Courier that the City of Evansville would be
holding two Public Forums concerning the 2015-2019 Analysis of Impediments to Fair
Housing Choice (AI), on Wednesday, January 22, 2014. The main goal at the forum
was to encourage public participation and suggest ways which the various players in the
housing industry in Evansville may improve access to safe, decent, affordable housing
for all Evansville residents over the next five years.
The meetings were held at Central Library, 200 SE Martin Luther King Dr. at the
following times: 1:00-3:00 p.m., in Browning Room B and 7:00-8:00 p.m., in Browning
Room A. All interested parties were encouraged to attend one of the two meetings to
address community concerns involving fair housing choice. Surveys were available at
the meetings and online at https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/LFYSJPK to confidentially
identify some of the concerns. All information about the Analysis of Impediments to Fair
Housing was published in El Informador Latino and a blog post.
The AI revealed findings and recommended strategies that are intended to consolidate
the barriers to fair housing. Stakeholders and citizens alike agreed that the lack of
affordable housing was still the major impediment in Evansville. Substandard housing
and a lack of low-income housing in certain areas were also mentioned frequently. With
increased collaboration among the various service providers in Evansville, the City of
Evansville could ensure that funds are being allocated more efficiently to meet direct
needs.
Some of the comments raised during the public comment period, and during the public
hearing, were not addressed in the final analysis of impediments to fair housing. Several
of those comments are provided below. They illustrate that there are certain classes of
people in Evansville that feel like their housing rights have been violated but that filing a
complaint would make very little difference. All comments were communicated to
relevant agencies and organizations involved in housing activities in the city:

‚ÄúIt should be noted that the definition of ‚Äúfamily‚Äù in the code should be changed or
eliminated all-together because zoning law has no place in describing persons‚Äô
relationships or living arrangements.‚Äù
‚ÄúThere should be a job component for minorities and local residents tied to new projects
like the convention hotel.‚Äù
‚ÄúEvansville needs to convene a group to work on housing ex-offenders.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt is good that the government tries to communicate with the Latino population in
Evansville, but many people abuse us when we rent an apartment here.‚Äù
‚ÄúAll underrepresented populations in this area need someone to listen to us at the
government level. The government needs to know when people are mistreated.‚Äù
‚ÄúDiscrimination complaints are not taken seriously, they‚Äôre not investigated, by the
Evansville Housing Authority.‚Äù
Citizens Participation Process
A description of the citizen participation process and the efforts to broaden public
participation is described in the sections below. The City of Evansville held six
advertised public meetings specifically focused on the Consolidated Plan and made the
plan available for public comment. All meetings were advertised in minority newspapers,
including HOLA and Our Times. The meetings were also advertised in the Evansville
Courier and Press. All meetings were held in an ADA-accessible meeting space.
Citizen participation was achieved through several methods during the consolidated
planning process. Most of the elements in the plan are designed to benefit low and
moderate income populations in the City of Evansville. However, the Consolidate
Planning process also affords the City an opportunity to strengthen its partnership with
other governmental and private sector entities. The goal is to provide a plan that helps
establish and maintain a suitable living environment for, and extend economic
opportunities to, all residents.
The City encouraged participation in the planning process from all residents. Most all
participants at our meetings were low and moderate income people. Residents of slum
and blighted areas had the chance to participate through the Blight Elimination
Program. Other low income residents of targeted revitalization areas also contributed
during the AI process. Based on comments during those meetings, the Evansville
Housing Authority now distributes flyers instructing citizens how to file fair housing
complaints.

The City meets with agencies regularly, summons requests for proposals (RFP‚Äôs) from
those agencies, and conducts open meetings for citizens to gather and comment. The
planning process began with notification to these agencies, and other interested parties
in the local newspaper in April 2014. Ten (10) days after the consolidated plan survey
became available online at www.evansville.in.gov, the City held the first of six public
meetings to obtain citizen input. The following questions and comments from citizens
who attended the planning meetings illustrate how engaged local Evansville residents
have become:
‚ÄúHow is the info obtained from the online survey used in the consolidated plan?‚Äù
‚ÄúWill the Con Plan explain how to qualify for CDBG funds?‚Äù
‚ÄúWe have a growing need for placement of incarcerated individuals. Will the Con Plan
address that need?‚Äù
‚ÄúPlease explain the HUD income guidelines.‚Äù
‚ÄúWill the Con Plan address the needs of the Latino residents in Evansville?‚Äù
Throughout the planning process, it became obvious that the residents of Evansville are
heavily invested in the way the City allocates tax dollars over the next 5 years. Part of
the City‚Äôs job is to ensure the residents don‚Äôt have misperceptions about what the City
can and cannot accomplish. Given that there will be a 15% decrease in the 2015 CDBG
funds to the City of Evansville, some agency representatives and local residents were
dismayed at these public meetings. And given that the reduction in funding would
translate to reduced outreach, the City understands these concerns. Some residents
had the following negative feedback to share:
‚ÄúWhy aren‚Äôt all neighborhoods a part of the revitalization process? It seems like the City
chooses only certain favorites.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe need more job fairs. We need a way to create jobs immediately.‚Äù
‚ÄúBlight owners are not maintaining their properties.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe arts district needs trolleys.‚Äù
‚ÄúDoes the Con Plan address discrimination against transgender individuals who aren‚Äôt a
protected class?‚Äù
In order to boost community participation further and to educate all local citizens, the
mayor of Evansville currently holds a series of town hall meetings called, ‚Äúcommunity
conversations‚Äù. During these meetings, residents have the opportunity to speak with the
mayor and voice their concerns. There have been six community conversations; one for

each ward in Evansville. The June 25, 2014 town hall was devoted entirely to the
consolidated planning process. All public meetings are held in places that allow for easy
access for individuals with disabilities. Participation has been overwhelming.
Citizens Advisory Council
Citizen participation also occurs in public service allocations. To this end, the Mayor
appoints a Citizen Advisory Committee (CAC). The goal of the committee is to ensure
that the funded programs represent the needs of the community. There are nine
members on the council. The Mayor appoints two members. Another two members are
representatives of the United Way Allocations Committee. The remaining five members
are neighborhood representatives.
The allocation process is complex and begins when DMD issues a request for proposal
(RFP) from various agencies. Notification is given through advertisement in local
newspapers and direct mailings to public service agencies and other interested parties.
During this time, DMD Development staff meets with all applicants to ensure eligibility.
Once the RFP process closes, proposals are accepted, printed, and bound for
distribution.
Next, the CAC is appointed. Public hearings are held where applicants may present
their proposals. At this time, CAC makes their funding recommendation at a public
meeting open to all the public. These recommendations are sent to the Mayor who then
makes his own recommendation on funding. City Council members receive both the
Mayor‚Äôs recommendation and the CAC‚Äôs recommendation on funding. A separate
hearing is held to allow applicant agencies to address council members and present
their proposals. During the final stage of the process, council allocates CDBG, ESG,
and HOME funds.
Comment Period
The City provided a thirty (30) day comment period in which citizens were able to
provide their comments and views on the consolidated plan. The public comment period
ended on October 22, 2014. Citizens were encouraged to provide input on the
community development and housing priority needs by taking an online survey located
on the city website www.evansville.in.gov. Questions and concerns were directed to
executive director, Kelley Coures. Technical assistance was provided to all groups with
disadvantages.
