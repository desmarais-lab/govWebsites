To: Industrial User
On July 24, 1990, the U.S. EPA promulgated the Domestic Sewage Study (DDS) Rule,
an amendment to the General Pretreatment Regulations (40CFR 403) that became
effective on August 23, 1990. This rule contains two provisions requiring industries to
report the substances that they discharge to the POTW if the substances would otherwise
be hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261.
Please complete the enclosed Hazardous Waste Notification form and sign the
appropriate certification statement at the bottom of the form. The completed and signed
form may be faxed to (765) 962-2669, attention Pretreatment Coordinator, or mailed to
address listed at the bottom on the form. You will need to use additional sheets of paper
if you discharge more than one hazardous waste.
To assist in the understanding of the Rule and the reporting requirements, I have enclosed
a copy of the 1991 Guidance to Indiana Industries for Reporting Discharges of Hazardous
Waste To Publicly-Owned Treatment Works (POTWs) and a separate document titled
Hazardous Waste Notification Requirement.
This form must be returned to be kept on file with the Richmond Sanitary District.
Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.
Sincerely,

Steve Swoveland
Pretreatment Coordinator

HAZARDOUS WASTE NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS
On July 24, 1990, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgated
changes to the general pretreatment regulations (55 FR 30082). The changes affect both
Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTWs) and industrial users (IUs) of POTWs. One
of the changes requires IUs to submit notification of hazardous wastes discharged to
sewers. The following information provides a brief description of this requirement.
Who must notify: All IUs that discharge listed or characteristics RCRA hazardous waste
to the Richmond Sanitary District’s POTW (except as described below). Listed and
characteristic wastes under RCRA are described in the Code of Federal Regulations (40
CFR part 261). Additionally, the Richmond Sanitary District requires that sections I, II
a., and IV of the Hazardous Waste Notification form be completed even if no hazardous
wastes are discharged to the sewer system.
Hazardous Waste Notification must be sent to:
• Local Sewerage Authority (Richmond Sanitary District)
• EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and
• State Hazardous Waste Authority
Waste covered by the notification
• Any discharge to the POTW of >15kg per calendar month of a RCRA hazardous
waste, or a discharge of any quantity of acutely hazardous waste identified in 40
CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), must be reported once.
• Any discharge to the POTW of <15kg of a RCRA hazardous waste during a
calendar month need not be reported, except for the acutely hazardous waste
identified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), must be reported once. A
subsequent discharge of >15kg per calendar month or of any quantity of an
acutely hazardous waste, must be reported once.
• Pollutants already reported under 40 CFR 403.12(b) and (e) (reporting
requirements for categorical users) are not subject to this notification
requirement.
Notification must contain:
• This notification must contain the following information
o Name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR part 261
o EPA hazardous waste number
o Type of discharge to the sewer (continuous, batch, or both)
o A certification that the IU has a program in place to reduce the volume
and toxicity of hazardous waste generated to the degree it has
determined to be economically practical.

•

If the IU discharges > 100 kg of hazardous waste per calendar month to the
POTW, the one time notification must contain the following items of
information, to the extent such information is known and readily available to the
IU.
o An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the
hazardous wastes.
o An estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the
waste stream discharged during the calendar month in which the onetime report is made.
o An estimate of the mass of constituents in the waste stream expected to
be discharged during the 12 months following the notification.

How to count the volume of Hazardous Waste discharged: If a hazardous waste is
mixed with non-hazardous process or non-process waste stream and the entire mixture is
then discharged to the sewer, the volume of the entire waste stream containing hazardous
waste is considered according to the RCRA “mixture rule” in 40 CFR part
261.3(a)(2)(iii). The effect of this rule is summarized as follows:
• Characteristics wastes: These wastes are classified as hazardous because they
exhibit one of the hazardous characteristics identified in 40 CFR 261.20-261.24
(i.e. they are ignitable, corrosive, reactive, or toxic). If these wastes are mixed
with non-hazardous materials and the mixture is then discharged to the sewer,
the notification must be submitted only if the entire mixture actually
discharged is > 15kg per calendar month and if the entire mixture discharged
still exhibits the characteristic(s).
• Listed wastes: These are wastes that are classified as hazardous pursuant to
being listed in 40 CFR 261.30-33. If these listed wastes are mixed with nonhazardous materials and then discharged to the sewer, the entire wastestream
is considered hazardous and a notification must be submitted. Thus only if the
entire waste stream containing the hazardous waste amounted to < 15kg per
calendar month, would the exemption discussed apply.
• Questionable wastes: If an IU has any doubt about whether a mixture
discharged to the sewer is hazardous, or if the user does not wish to perform
any calculations which may be necessary under the mixture rule, 40 CFR
261.3(a)(2)(iii), the user should submit the one-time notification.
When the Notification must be submitted:

•
•
•

•

•

The notification must be submitted within 180 days of August 23, 1990 (i.e., no
later than February 23, 1991).
IUs who commence discharging after August 23, 1990, must submit the
notification no later than 180 days after the discharge of a hazardous waste.
In the case of regulations under §3001 of RCRA new hazardous wastes, the
notification must be submitted within 90 days of the effective date of such
regulations.
The notification need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste
discharge, except when there will be a substantial change in the volume or
character of the hazardous waste discharged (general because of a planned
change to the user’s facility or operations). In case of such a change, the user
should notify the POTW in advance.
The Richmond Sanitary District requires a one-time notification even if no
hazardous waste is discharged to the sewer system.

For further information: General questions about the notification requirement should
be directed to the Richmond Sanitary District’s pretreatment office. Specific questions
about determining if a waste is hazardous should be directed to the EPA RCRA Hotline
at 800-424-9346.

****** Combined Sewer Overflow - CSO ******

What is CSO?
**** Why Our Sewers Overflow When It Rains ****
More than 100 years ago, South Bend and many other cities across the country,
built storm sewers to carry rainwater and melting snow away from homes,
businesses and streets. In those horse-and-buggy days, these cities didn't
have sewage treatment or even indoor plumbing. When indoor plumbing came later,
homeowners and business owners hooked their sewage lines to the existing storm
sewers, combining storm water and raw sewage into one pipe. The pipes emptied
directly into the river, until the 1950's when sewage treatment plants were
built. This was common practice in many U.S. cities, especially in the
Northeast and Midwest.
During dry weather, a "combined" sewer system works much like a separated sewer
-- carrying all sewage to the treatment plant for treatment; however, when it
rains or snow melts, the sewers can be overloaded with incoming stormwater.
When this happens, the sewers_are_designed to flow over internal dams in the
underground pipes and into nearby streams and rivers. This is referred to as a
Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) system. Without this release valve, raw sewage
would back up into people's basements and streets.
Millions of gallons of untreated sewage and rainwater enter the St. Joseph
River each year. State and federal regulations require cities to develop long
term plans to reduce these overflows. The City of South Bend is just one of
almost 800 CSO communities across the country dealing with Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) mandated CSO Long Term Control Plans (LTCP) that are
costly and pose multiple social and economic impacts to our residents. Our
motivation is driven by the fact that South Bend has 36 CSOs which typically
overflow 60-70 times each year, resulting in approximately 1 billion gallons of
overflows into the St. Joseph River. In addition, when the CSO system’s
capacity is exceeded, basement backups can occur.
**** What is a Long Term Control Plan and Consent Decree? ****
Historically, the City invested in wastewater infrastructure to reduce CSOs
prior to the formalization of a LTCP or signing of the consent decree. During
the period between 1990 and 2004, the City spent over $87M on CSO
infrastructure improvements in order to reduce overflows, increase system
capacity, and improve efficiencies; thus, the City began implementation of its
LTCP prior to 2011, when the consent decree was signed.
Motivated by the idea of doing more with less, and focusing on getting as much
capacity from the current collection and wastewater system as possible, the
City deployed approximately 140 real-time monitoring sensors throughout the
sewer collection system in 2007. This was done in order to answer the question:
Is the City making the most of the existing infrastructure? In other words, the
City desired to know if there was unused capacity within the existing
collection system, such as within the sewers and at the Wastewater Treatment
Plant (WWTP), and then develop solutions to use the existing system to its full
capacity and identify areas to prioritize improvements.
In December 2011, the US EPA approved the City of South Bend’s Long_Term
Control_Plan document, which was created in an effort to record the historical
context of the evolution of the plan. After a considerable amount of
negotiations, the City of South Bend, Indiana and the U.S. Department of
Justice entered into a Consent_Decree relating to the Clean Water Act CSO
Control_Policy in early 2012.
The 2012 consent decree requires the City to spend approximately $600M (2012
Dollars) on wastewater_treatment_plant_(WWTP)_upgrades and CSO control methods,
separated into two phases of work within the sewer collection system, to reduce
both the volume and number of overflows to the river. Phase 1, includes source
control technologies to prevent storm water from entering the collection system
both upstream and downstream of the river. Phase_2 consists of the ultimate
conveyance of excess flows from the existing CSOs to nine separate storage
facilities.
As allowed for in the consent decree language, the City has continued to look
for ways to improve upon and reduce LTCP costs. The City recently investigated
the feasibility and potential cost savings of using a combination of low impact
development, real time control, and conventional methods for CSO control. The
resultant Optimatics_Study was a feasibility and planning document that
provided useful insight for optimization of the 2012 LTCP.
In addition, since 2010 several improvements have been made to the collection
system as a result of real-time monitoring and remote throttle activation by
CSONet. Improvements included reducing the total amount of combined sewer area
via separation projects, raising weir heights, and throttling more flow to the
main interceptor sewer to reduce overflows.
**** Reassessment of the LTCP ****
In 2014, the City initiated a reassessment of the 2012 LTCP in order to find
additional cost savings. The reassessment of the 2012 LTCP will review system
optimization and evaluate several options based on real-time technology. For
example, a preliminary review of real-time data has identified that potential
trunk line interconnections throughout the collection system may move flows
from satellite areas of the system to the WTTP, eliminating the need for
possible storage as planned in the 2012 LTCP. Opportunities for inline storage
and regulating flows at other CSOs to the interceptor will also be evaluated.
The reassessment of the LTCP will follow a comprehensive approach to include
integrated and cost-effective solutions that also consider elements of green
infrastructure solutions (GSI).
Throughout the process, the City will provide updates on the reassessment of
the LTCP. In order to provide multiple opportunities for public involvement,
the City has established an Advisory Committee that meets regularly to discuss
the reassessment progress as well as to gain input from the public. In
addition, the Common Council Utilities Committee will hold meetings to provide
similar updates on the LTCP reassessment. All meetings are open to the public.

Disconnect Downspouts
Why it Matters
The Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) system that captures waste water from homes
and businesses also contains storm water captured from street sewers and
gutter downspouts from homes. When large rainfall events overwhelm the system,
the CSO overflows, sending raw sewage into the St. Joseph River.

2015 Storm Water Credit
Manual
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS
June 2015

Agenda
⦁ Background
⦁ 2003 Storm Water Credits
⦁ 2015 Storm Water Credits

⦁ Storm Water Credits and Summary of Changes
- Review Process
- Example Credits

Background
• When it rains, water runs off impervious surfaces into
our storm water drainage system
• Rooftops
• Parking lots
• City streets
• Driveways
• Compacted gravel
• Once it reaches our storm water system, the water is
released directly into our waterways.

The Storm Water Asset
• Serves all of Marion County
• Valued at approximately
$1.1 billion
• 1,300 miles of pipe
• More than 100,000
structures
• 2 dams
• 35 miles of levee
• 3,700 miles of public
roadway

Problem Areas
• Currently over 380 problem
areas indentified
• Covers all Townships

Customers and Complaints
• 300,000 customers
served
• Average thousands
of complaints per
year
• Customers drive
the program

Background
Storm Water Fee Structure
•

Historic - Storm water fees for
residential and non-residential
property owners are calculated
differently.
– Residential properties: Flat fee for
all—regardless of how much
impervious surface area.
– Non-residential properties: Charged
based on how much impervious
surface area exists on property.

•

July 1, 2015 - Storm water fees for
residential and non-residential
property owners will be calculated
the same.
– Residential properties will be
assessed to determine the amount of
impervious surface area and charged
based on that assessment—just as
non-residential users are today.

Storm Water Credits
• The Department of Public Works has
developed a system of credits for residential
and non-residential property owners who
have storm water control facilities in place to
manage and reduce the impact on the
