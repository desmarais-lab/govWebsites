[Water_Treatment_Facility_Photo]Infrastructure is key for attracting and
retaining businesses and industries.  Along with roads, and drinking water;
wastewater conveyance and treatment completes the trilogy of City provided
infrastructure components.  In addition, reliable and effective wastewater
treatment is vital for protecting the Tippecanoe River and Lake Freeman.

The Wastewater Utility maintains and operates over 36 miles of storm and
sanitary sewers, multiple pump stations, and a Class III wastewater treatment
plant that is in the process of its third major upgrade since it was originally
built in 1950.  The treatment plant&rsquo;s latest upgrade increases its
capacity from an average daily flow of 1.1 million gallons per day (MGD) to 1.6
MGD and increases its peak hydraulic capacity from 2.4 to 3.6 MGD.  The updated
treatment process is a state of the art system consisting of fine screening,
grit removal, a modified, activated sludge system capable of enhanced
biological phosphorus removal and total-nitrogen reduction in addition to
conventional reductions of oxygen demanding substances and ammonia.  Resource
recovery is a high priority at the utility with an emphasis placed on energy
reduction and nutrient reclamation land application of biosolids that are
removed from the wastewater, thoroughly processed and tested at the facility,
and then used as soil amendments and fertilizer supplementation on local
agricultural grounds.

The City of Monticello is one of many Indiana communities that has a Combined
Sewer System that overflows during heavy rain and snow melt events.  These
overflows are known as Combined Sewer Overflows (CSOs) and the City is
aggressively working to reduce and eliminate these CSOs thorough its Agreed
Order with the Indiana Department of Environmental Management and the continued
implementation of its Long Term Control Plan (LTCP).  The current upgrade at
the treatment plant is Project III of V of the LTCP.

Common Issues &amp; Questions:  Click at a question below to review the answer.
**** 1. I am a customer of the Twin Lakes Regional Sewer District, am I in the
right place? ****
No, the City of Monticello operates the wastewater system that is generally
within the corporate boundaries of the City.  If you have a question or problem
with your system and are a customer of the Sewer District, please contact them
at: 574.583.5649
**** 2. I believe I have sewage backing up into my basement or coming out of
the cleanout in my yard; what should I do? ****
The City takes backups and overflows very seriously, if you believe you are
experiencing a backup of overflow:
   1. If during business hours, contact the billing office at: 574.583.5443  
   2. If outside of business hours, contact the NON-EMERGENCY line for the
      Monticello Police Department at 574.583.2256
Please be prepared to give your name, the service address, a phone number you
can be contacted at, and a description of the problem and any observations.

What happens then?

City personnel will respond to investigate the problem as soon as possible and
attempt to determine whether the problem is under the jurisdiction of the
City.  If the problem is with the City sewers, City personnel will attempt to
correct the issue quickly and with the minimum amount of hassle possible.  If
the City owned sewers are verified to be clear, the problem is considered to be
the responsibility of the home owner and a local plumber may need to be
consulted.  The City cannot give recommendations regarding plumbing services.
**** 3. What determines CITY responsibility vs. HOME OWNER responsibility? ****
In general, the owner is responsible for the sewer lateral as it exits the home
or building all the way to the point at which it connects to the sewer main,
regardless that the sewer main is typically located in the street and within
the Right-of-Way; as such, it can generally be said that if wastewater is
freely flowing at the up- and downstream manholes, any issues are with the
owner&rsquo;s system.  Please contact the Wastewater Utility before attempting
to repair private laterals located within the City Right-of-Way, while the City
cannot repair all issues with privately owned sewers, exceptions are made on a
case-by-case basis within the Right-of-Way in order to minimize the overall
cost to the community.
**** 4. I have other complaints, who should I contact? ****
General questions and complaints should be sent to
This e-mail address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript
enabled to view it
 or directed to the treatment plant at 574.583.4651 during regular business
hours.
**** 5. I would like to learn more about CSOs and what the City is doing about
them, who should I contact? ****
General questions and complaints should be sent to
This e-mail address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript
enabled to view it
 or directed to the treatment plant at 574.583.4651 during regular business
hours.
**** 6. What are the operating hours of the Utility? ****
Billing Office hours are Monday through Friday, 8:00 A.M. to 4:00 P.M. except
on City recognized holidays.  The treatment plant operates on a 24-hour basis
but plant operators are often not readily near the telephone and able to answer
general calls.
**** 7. As a contractor or developer, how can I get information as to City
Construction Standards? ****
Construction Standards for the design and construction of sewers, watermains,
and streets are available at the following link:(2/2017 - To Be Announced. 
Please return at a later date for new information)  It is the developer&rsquo;s
responsibility to conform design and construction to the latest revisions of
these standards.
**** 8. As a contractor or developer, how should I begin the process to get my
designs approved and permitted? ****
Plans and specifications for your project are required to be submitted for
review and approval through (2/2017 To Be Announced.  Please return at a later
date for updated information.) and will then be forwarded to the City for
review.  Please keep in mind that any sanitary sewer extensions or pump
stations that will be turned over to the City of ownership and maintenance may
require permitting through the Indiana Department of Environmental Management. 
Please contact the utility at
This e-mail address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript
enabled to view it
 if you have questions regarding these requirements.
**** 9. I am ready to have my constructed project inspected, who should I
contact and when? ****
Inspection requests should be submitted to
This e-mail address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript
enabled to view it
 no less than 48-hours prior to the desired inspection time and may or may not
require delays of up to seven (7) business days depending on City personnel
schedules.  It is the Owner&rsquo;s responsibility to contact the Utility as
early as possible and maintain a schedule that will allow for City inspection. 
Failure to allow inspection may result in rejection of work completed and
require additional work to expose existing installations or complete
reinstallation of the work at the Owner&rsquo;s cost.  In general, the City
will inspect projects continuously during the work but with limited staff,
immediate response to projects is not always possible.

BEHAVIOR
SERIES

Using Aversives to Modify
Your Dog‚Äôs Behavior

I

F THERE‚ÄôS ANY TRUTH TO THE SAYING ‚Äúidle hands are the Devil‚Äôs
playground,‚Äù then the same can certainly be said for idle paws. If you‚Äôre
afraid to leave your dog alone for more than a few minutes for fear
of what you‚Äôll return to, try using devices called ‚Äúaversives‚Äù to discourage
your dog from taking a particular action or entering an area that‚Äôs off-limits.

Aversives are tools and techniques that can be used to
keep dogs away from particular places or to stop them
from engaging in certain behaviors. Finding the right
aversive for the objective at hand is often a case of
trial and error, as some dogs are immune to a little
soaking from a squirt bottle, and others might think
that by shaking a can full of pennies, you‚Äôre telling
them it‚Äôs treat time.
And remember that even after you‚Äôve found the best
method to discourage a dog from a particular action
or place, the approach will seldom work effectively
unless you offer a positive alternative that is both
convenient and rewarding.
What are some typical aversives used by dog caregivers?
Here‚Äôs a rundown of some common deterrents, each of
which will have varying degrees of success depending
on the objective and the dog.

Textures
One great way to keep your dog away from certain areas
is to surround (or cover) the area with materials that
make your dog‚Äôs paws uncomfortable.
Indoors, try shelf paper (sticky side up) or double-sided
carpet tape. Heavy plastic carpet runner (pointed side up)
can also be used effectively in some situations. You may

need to weight the material firmly or tape it down
to ensure it stays put. To protect furniture or floor
finishes from sticky substances, attach the aversive
to a piece of foil or heavy plastic and secure that
with weights or light tape.
Outdoors, try irregularly shaped rocks, or chicken wire
firmly set into the ground, sharp edges rolled under.
These tools are more effective for puppies, small dogs,
and low-energy dogs than for those who won‚Äôt let a little
obstacle stand in their way.

Tastes
Because most dogs do much of their investigative work
(and much of their damage) with their mouths, anything
displeasing to the tastebuds will often work quite well.
Some of the following substances may damage furniture
or floor finishes, however, so be sure to test them in
a hidden location before widespread use.
‚ñ† Bitter Apple¬Æ or similar sprays and gels marketed
specifically for taste aversion
‚ñ† Insect repellents, especially those containing citronella
or citrus odors (check for toxicity‚Äîif it‚Äôs safe for young
children, it‚Äôs generally safe for pets)
‚ñ† Some muscle rubs
continued on reverse side

‚ñ†
‚ñ†

Citrus, such as from concentrated juices or fresh peels
Aloe gel

Human-Controlled Aversives
Some items can be used to distract your dog and thereby
interrupt his unwanted behavior. Such devices are not meant
to terrify your dog, but to provide a brief distraction. It‚Äôs best
if your dog does not perceive the distraction as coming from
you. In the instant your dog‚Äôs attention is focused on the
distracting action, redirect his behavior to an appropriate
object, and then give him lots of praise. Some effective
aversives that you control include:
‚ñ† Spray bottle or squirt gun filled with water or a
combination of water and vinegar (NOTE: Avoid highpowered water guns that have a very forceful spray)
‚ñ† Loud air horn
‚ñ† Whistle
‚ñ† Shaker can (soda can filled with nails, pennies,
beans, or pebbles‚Äîthen securely taped shut)

When using aversives, remember that they offer the
advantage of modifying certain canine behaviors in ways that
distance the ‚Äúcorrection‚Äù from you, the caregiver. Experiment
with different types of aversives and try to match the aversive
to the dog. For example, using a surprise technique on a
fearful dog should be a last resort.
Above all, be patient and give your canine frequent play
sessions and attention as well as appropriate objects for
him to play with. That way, your dog‚Äôs antics will amuse
you instead of annoy you, and the special bond between
both of you will continue to grow.

behaviorists at the Dumb Friends League, Denver, Colorado.

Surprise! Remote-Controlled Aversives
Sometimes the best approach for teaching an animal is
to work from a distance. If every aversive is delivered
when you‚Äôre in the room, your dog may quickly learn
to refrain from engaging in undesirable behaviors when
you‚Äôre around, but engage in those behaviors as soon as
you walk out the door. A few good approaches include:
‚ñ† Motion detectors that react with a startling sound
‚ñ† Snappy trainer (an upside-down mouse trap that‚Äôs
securely taped under paper to avoid injury)
‚ñ† Aluminum pie plate containing water, beans, or pebbles‚Äî
preferably balanced precariously in a restricted area
‚ñ† ScatMat¬Æ (which delivers a very slight electrical shock)
WARNING: For fearful dogs, try everything else before trying
surprise techniques, especially those using noises!
