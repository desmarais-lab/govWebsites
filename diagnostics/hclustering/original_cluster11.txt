How to Use
a Head Halter

BEHAVIOR
SERIES

“W

HOA, ROVER, WHOA!” Sound familiar? If that’s what it’s like
when you take your dog for a walk, you may want to consider
getting a head halter.

A head halter is a special kind of collar designed for dogs
who like to pull their people when they walk. It consists
of a strap that goes around your dog’s nose and another
strap that goes around his neck, just behind his ears.
The leash fastens to the halter under the dog’s chin to
a ring that’s also attached to the nose strap. When your
dog begins to pull, the design of the head halter causes
his nose to be turned down and back toward you, which
makes it physically difficult for him to continue pulling.

nosepiece should be adjusted so that when your dog’s
mouth is closed, the nosepiece can slide down to where
the skin begins on his nose—but not so loose that it
can slide off the end of his nose. The nosepiece will
sit naturally, just below your dog’s eyes. Make sure
that the metal ring to which the leash attaches is
underneath his chin.

The head halter is a humane method of restraint because
it doesn’t cause any pain. It works much better to stop
a dog from pulling than a choke chain or prong collar.
Some brand names of head halters include “Gentle
Leader,” “Promise Collar,” and “Halti.”

Most dogs will resist a head halter at first. The amount
of resistance varies for each dog. When you first put the
head halter on, your dog may try to get it off by pawing
at his nose or rubbing his nose on the ground, on you,
or on anything he can get close to. The best strategy is to
keep his head up and keep him moving by using positive
verbal reinforcement and treats. Most dogs eventually
accept head halters. When your dog associates the halter
with going for a walk, he’ll begin to react positively to
it, and soon both you and your dog will enjoy taking
walks together!

How Should It Fit?
The head halter must be fitted properly to be effective and
comfortable for your dog. The neck strap should be as
high up on your dog’s neck as you can get it, just behind
his ears. The strap should be just tight enough for you
to fit one finger between it and your dog’s neck. The

Things to Remember

■
■

■
■
■

Make sure the head halter is fitted properly.
Fit the halter so that it is snug around your dog’s neck
and high behind his ears, but loose enough around
his nose so that the nose strap can slide easily down
to the fleshy part of his nose.
Don’t confuse the head halter with a muzzle.
Keep in mind that a dog wearing a head halter can
still eat, drink, pant, bark, and bite, if he chooses.
Never use a hard jerk with the head halter.
Never use the head halter with a retractable lead.
Be sure your dog doesn’t run quickly to the end of
the lead; if he does, he may give himself a hard jerk.

■

■

■

Outfit your dog with the head halter only during
on-leash walks with you or when you’re directly
supervising him.
Don’t allow your dog to wear the head halter around
the house; he’ll have plenty of time to work at getting
it off and will eventually succeed.
Read the information sheet that comes with your
head halter.

The Carmel Police Department is comprised of 112 sworn officers and
24 civilian support personnel. As an internationally accredited law
enforcement agency, the department meets the challenge of providing

Again, thank you for your interest. If there is anything that our
department can assist you with in the future, please do not hesitate to
contact either myself or any member of our staff.

Lighting

Broadly speaking, lighting serves four primary purposes in downtown settings. First and foremost, lighting creates a perception of safety. Simply put, people are likely to avoid dark urban
areas. Lighting also establishes an identity for the place or street where it is used. Fluted poles
and acorn fixtures immediately bring to mind historic themes. Sleek modern fixtures may
suggest that the future is more important to a community than the past, while some designs
may bridge those extremes through their timeless composition of elements. Lighting can be
used to heighten the drama of an urban setting by focusing attention on unique architectural
features. Lastly, lighting serves to illuminate signage, thereby improving the wayfinding capacity of a district. In the Redevelopment Area, the goal of the lighting design is to balance these
sometimes conflicting functions.

Lighting Types
Lighting

Lighting Types
Light has a color?
Metal halide
Metal halide produces a “white light” and is thought
to most accurately show the color of an object.
Metal halide is the preferred light source for illuminating sidewalks, parking lots and public spaces in the
Redevelopment Area. Because it provides the most accurate “rendering” of color, it is easier to find cars in
parking lots, it is easier to recognize faces of those you
know, and will portray the colors of paint and signage
as they were intended to be seen. An exception to this
is light that is intended to illuminate trees. In this
case, mercury vapor is preferred.

City of Evansville Downtown Development & Design Guidelines

Although many people do not consciously recognize
the fact, different sources of light have different
colors. The color of artificial light affects how we
perceive the color of objects that are illuminated by
that light source. The three most common light
sources used for exterior lighting in the Redevelopment Area are metal halide, mercury vapor and
high-pressure sodium.

Lighting Types
Lighting

High Pressure Sodium

Mercury vapor produces light with a blue cast and will
alter the color of an object. Some colors will be enhanced when illuminated with a mercury vapor source.
For example, mercury vapor is often considered a good
light source for landscape lighting because it intensifies green. In the photo above, the mercury vapor light
casts a blue tint over the pavement and car.

High pressure sodium produces a yellow light that will
also alter the way we perceive the color of an object.
For example, red will appear more gray. This light
source is most commonly used to light roadways because it is very efficient. As a result, bulbs do not need
to be changed as often. The quality of the light, however, is usually not considered very comforting. Notice
how everything in the photo above has a yellow cast.

Style
Lighting

Style
The style of lighting plays a substantial role in the
establishment of an overall theme. One of the purposes of the public input process used to shape these
guidelines was to determine whether Evansville desired a specific theme in the Redevelopment Area.
The process revealed there was a concern that lighting and site furnishings on future projects not be
too suggestive of a Victorian era ideal. This attitude
is consistent with the National Trust for Historic Preservation, which discourages the installation of period lighting in an effort to suggest a particular period of time.
Many communities fall into the trap of selecting
lighting and furnishings that look old for their downtown areas without considering other alternatives.
In one sense, this is admirable because there is recognition in these communities that a standard
INDOT cobra-head style fixture on a 35 foot pole is
not acceptable in areas where a more pedestrian-oriented approach is sought.

Qualities to consider when selecting
a lighting style

The scale.
Lighting for sidewalks and public spaces should
range in height from 12 to 15 feet.
The craftsmanship.
Poles and luminaries should be durable and made
specifically for use in public places.
The amount of detail.
One of the things that makes period style pieces
attractive is the level of detail in the design of the
luminaire and the pole. Similar levels of detail can
be found in contemporary poles and fixtures.

City of Evansville Downtown Development & Design Guidelines

Rather than defaulting to period lighting, however,
the Guidelines urge that those who specify lighting
consider the qualities that make period lighting desirable and then select poles and fixtures that are
evocative of those qualities, yet reflect the time in
which they were installed.

126

Lighting Buildings
Many communities wash the facades of buildings
with ground mounted lighting. This can be very
dramatic. In Evansville, we would like to limit facade lighting to culturally or historically significant
buildings only. Examples might be the Old Post Office, the Old Courthouse and the Soldiers and Sailors Coliseum. This guideline is in place because we
want to limit the amount of light that is projected
into the sky. See page 130 for more information about
“light pollution.” When placing facade lighting in
front of a historic facade, be sure not to place pedestrians between the light source and the facade. These
fixtures are extremely bright and would be uncomfortable to walk in front of.

In Evansville, facade lighting should be limited to historic or
culturally significant buildings.

Style
Lighting

When large areas are required to be illuminated, a simple pole
mounted cut-off fixture like this can be used in combination with a
smaller, more pedestrain oriented fixture like the one at upper right.

A timeless fixture that references the past without
being tied to it.

A good example of a style that is considered too “Victorian” for the
Redevelopment Area.

A specific style of lighting is not mandated by these guidelines.
These images are intended to help illustrate the idea of “timelessness”
and the preferred appearance of exterior lighting in the
Redevelopment Area.

City of Evansville Downtown Development & Design Guidelines

Timeless fixtures combine simplicity with just the right
amount of detail.

127

Function
Lighting

Function
The goal of sidewalk lighting in downtown areas is not to evenly illuminate
every square foot of walking surface. Doing so would not only be prohibitively
expensive to install and maintain, it would have another undesirable effect.

City of Evansville Downtown Development & Design Guidelines

Urban areas become exciting at night when light from the interior of stores and
businesses illuminates the people, activities, art, furnishings and products within
the building. When too much light is used on the sidewalk in front of a building, however, it can “wash out” this effect.

128

Retailers in the Redevelopment Area are also encouraged to keep the first floor
lights on at night, or as long as it is reasonable to expect that pedestrian activity
will occur in front of the store or business. If most or all first floors are illuminated well into the night, the Redevelopment Area will feel safer and ambient
light from the storefronts will decrease the need for sidewalk lighting.

©2003 RATIO Architects, Inc.

Cut-Off Fixtures
StreetFurnishings

Cut-off fixtures project the light downward.

Post top fixtures can often be fitted with louvers that direct light
downward.

©2003 RATIO Architects, Inc.

Globe fixtures throw light in all directions. Lights that focus the light
downward where it is needed are more efficient and desirable in the
Redevelopment Area.

City of Evansville Downtown Development & Design Guidelines

Cut-Off Fixtures
What’s a cut-off fixture? These are lamp housings that reduce or completely
eliminate the glare produced by staring directly at a light bulb. The projection
of the light is “cut-off” at the edge of the housing and creates a defined pool of
light below. Some fixtures do this by placing the bulb high enough into the
housing that you would have to stand directly below the fixture and look straight
up to see the lamp. Other fixtures are available with glare shields that cast the
light downward.

129

Cut-Off Fixtures
Lighting

Light Pollution
Why worry about light output? On an intimate level, glaring lights are uncomfortable to look at and distract attention from illuminated storefronts where the
real show should be. The jarring effect of looking at intense light decreases the
quality of the visual environment. On a large scale, the production of too much
light is a huge problem - not just in Evansville, but also on a national level.

City of Evansville Downtown Development & Design Guidelines

The cumulative effect of disregarding light pollution can be
appreciated in this satellite photo of the United States.

130

The amount of light produced by most communities is literally bright enough to
wash out the view of the stars in the night sky. This problem is so pervasive that
the lighting industry has created a program called the “Dark Skies Initiative”
and a new term: Light pollution. The Dark Skies Initiative and the attention
given the light pollution issue underscore the fact that the night sky is as much
a natural resource as our rivers and forests. Sensitive lighting design has also
been identified by the U.S. Green Building Council as a critical factor in creating
sustainable communities.
Cut-off fixtures are strongly encouraged in the Redevelopment Area.

EVIDENCE SUBMISSION GUIDELINE #2
BLOOD SAMPLES FOR FORENSIC ALCOHOL ANALYSIS

In accordance with Motor Vehicle Laws 345, IC 9-11-4-6, the I-MCFSA has adopted uniform standards for
withdrawal, handling and preservation of blood samples prior to analysis. The standards are outlined below:

A. Blood samples obtained from persons involved in traffic accidents or traffic violations shall be collected,
handled and preserved as required by Section 345, IC 9-11-4-6, of the Indiana Motor Vehicle Laws.

Blood samples should be collected by venipuncture from living individuals as soon as feasible after the
alleged offense, and only by persons protected by Section 345, IC 9-11-4-6, of the Indiana Motor Vehicle
Laws (physician, or person under the direction of a physician).

Alcohol or other volatile organic disinfectants MUST NOT BE USED to clean the skin where a specimen is to
be collected. Only aqueous benzalkonium chloride (“Zephiran”), aqueous merthiolate, aqueous mercuric
chloride or povidone-iodine (“Betadine”) disinfectants are used to disinfect the skin before venipuncture.

Sterile, dry hypodermic needles and syringes or clean, dry vacuum-type containers with sterile needles must
be used. No reusable equipment can be used. The blood sample drawn must be deposited into a clean, dry
container such as a Vacutainer®. Gray top tubes are recommended for the collection of blood as they contain
an anticoagulant (potassium oxalate) and a preservative (sodium fluoride).

The MINIMUM quantity for blood required to perform duplicate determinations by the laboratory and still
provide sufficient quantity for referee analysis by the defendant is 5mI. (approximately two teaspoons).
However, please try to fill the vacutainer tube completely, if possible.

Blood sample containers which the I-MCFSA Laboratory prefers for quality assurance and non-interference
testing in order of most to least favorable are:

1. Gray stoppered evacuated tubes containing a preservative and anticoagulant (e.g. B-D 10mI Vacutainer,
25mg sodium fluoride and 20mg potassium oxalate)

2. Violet stoppered evacuated tubes containing an anticoagulant (e.g. B-D 10 ml vacutainer, EDTA)

3. Green stoppered evacuated tubes containing an anticoagulant (e.g. B-D 10mI Vacutainer, lithium salt of
heparin)
4. Red stoppered evacuated additives (e.g. B-D 10mI vacutainer, no additive)

Note: Please do not let hospital personnel spin down or separate blood into plasma and red blood cells.

B. Maintenance of Identity and Integrity of the Sample

1. Label for tube or vial

a. A label for the blood vial or tube may be used and may contain the following
information:
(1)

Full name of subject

(2)

Date blood drawn

(3)

Initials of person drawing blood

(4)

Initials of witnessing officer. The blood sample tube or vial should be sealed in a container with
tape and initialed across the seal.

b. The blood sample container label may include at least the following
information:
(1)

Full name of subject.

(2)

Submitting agency.

(3)

Geographical location where blood sample was drawn (i.e. name and/or address of hospital, jail
or other facility)

(4)

Name of person drawing blood sample

(5)

Date blood sample drawn

(6)

Time blood sample drawn

(7)

Signature of witnessing officer

(8) A form for establishing the chain of possession for all persons handling the evidence (It is
recommended that the officer collecting the blood sample document the chain of possession for
all persons handling the evidence.)

c. Other information such as agency or laboratory number, offense charged, anatomical location from
which blood sample was drawn, or any special instructions may be added.
d. The blood sample tube or vial should be sealed in a container with tape and initialed across the seal.

2. Fill out an I-MCFSA Request for Examination form completely. Submit the request with the blood sample
container to the IMPD property room.

C. Procedure for Obtaining Blood Samples

1. The requesting officer should witness the withdrawal of the sample. When the officer witnesses the actual
withdrawal of the blood, it may preclude the person drawing the blood from appearing as a witness at the
time of the trial.

2. The person drawing the blood (e.g., nurse, doctor, paramedic) may fill out and initial a label and affix it
firmly to the tube or vial. The sample should then be given to the officer who, in turn, may initial the label
and place the sample in the prescribed envelope or other container. The officer should immediately
complete the required information on the envelope or other container label and seal container securely.

3. Appropriate steps to insure integrity of sample shall be taken:

a. Once the envelope or other container is sealed, it must not be opened except for analysis in the
laboratory.
b. Each person having possession of the sealed sample should sign his name in the space provided for
recording the ‘‘chain of possession."

D.

Drug Analysis Specimens:

All questions should be directed to the Indiana State Department of Toxicology
(317) 921-5000

Blood specimens collected for drug analysis should be sent or delivered to the Indiana State Department of
Toxicology directly at the following address:
Forensic Toxicology Laboratory
Indiana State Department of Toxicology
550 West Sixteenth Street
Indianapolis, IN 46202
Drop offs can be made at the DOCK area.
For further information you may wish to consult with the I-MCFSA Laboratory. The laboratory number is:
317-327-3670.

Departments moving back into renovated iconic building in stages
Frankfort, Ind. –Frankfort’s Building Services team has moved back into Old
Stoney and as of 8:00 a.m. today is officially open for business back in the
newly renovated structure, so anyone needing City building permits should visit
Old Stoney from this point forward.
According to Board of Public Works and Safety Member and project leader for the
Old Stoney rehabilitation project Jim Siegfried, the remaining departments
previously housed in the building will move back in stages to ensure a smooth
transition.
The Clinton County Area Plan Commission and Veterans Affairs offices still are
operating at 51 West Clinton Street (former United Way building), with both
departments scheduled to move back into Old Stoney next week.
     “We anticipate the Mayor’s Office and Clerk-Treasurer’s Office
     staff moving back into Old Stoney in early November.
     “All City meetings will take place back in Old Stoney beginning
     November 1. The City Council, Board of Works and all other regular
     City meetings will take place in their original locations where they
     happened before the move, with most happening in the Council Chambers
     in the basement,” Siegfried said.
Area IV and the Clinton County Chapter of the American Red Cross will move back
in a timing of their choosing and will notify Siegfried of when the move works
best for them.
     “The parking lot at Old Stoney is open for parking, but it has not
     been striped yet, so we urge visitors to be careful and use caution
     when parking. We appreciate everyone’s patience while department
     staffs transition back into the building,” Siegfried explained.
     “If anyone has questions about the timing of which departments are
     back in and which are not, they can call the Mayor’s office at 765-
     654-7332.”
Stay tuned for additional updates on next week’s departmental moves back to
Old Stoney.

Frankfort, Ind. –Wrapping up the City’s fourth Neighborhood Connection
Program, Mayor Chris McBarnes and the leaders of the City’s Police, Fire,
Building Services, Parks and Street Departments will host an informal meeting
for residents in Frankfort’s northeast quadrant at East Side Park (Lawrence
Ferrell Park) Thursday, July 21 from 6:00 – 7:00 p.m.
Neighbors who visit East Side Park that evening can check out the Fire
Department’s equipment, visit with the Mayor and department heads, sign up
for various free City programs including Safer Seniors (free home safety
inspections for senior citizens) and Neighbors Helping Neighbors (available for
any senior citizens or physically challenged residents who need help with yard
and exterior home repairs).
According to the Mayor, each Neighborhood Connection Program has three main
parts, beginning with a public safety focus with the Fire Department conducting
Smoke Detector Blitzes and the Police Department hosting a community meeting
for area residents, this time in May of this year.
     “The second phase of each Program is a blitz of City services in
     the selected section of the City, including street sweeping and alley
     clean-up by Street Department crews, saturation patrols and extra
     community intervention (talking with neighbors) by Frankfort police,
     property clean up by Building Services staff and park clean up by
     Parks Department crews.
     “We wrap up each program with a Neighborhood Connection meeting
     with area residents to share the progress made in their neighborhoods
     and have informal conversations between area residents and department
     heads and myself to answer questions and hear suggestions and
     concerns about the need for additional improvements,” McBarnes
     said.
Launched in 2014 in the northwest quadrant of the City, the Neighborhood
Connection Program provides extra attention to infrastructure needs, safety and
quality of life problem areas. Any Frankfort resident is welcome to attend the
July 21 event, but information shared by City leaders will be specific to the
northeast quadrant.
The Neighborhood Connection Program is a part of three of the
administration’s four cornerstones: Neighborhood Revitalization,
Communications and Citizen Voice.
East Side Park is located near Fudge Avenue and North Maish Road.

Washington Street to close Wednesday until further notice
Frankfort, Ind. –With the Dorner building façade removal scheduled for
Wednesday, February 3, Washington Street from Jackson Street to Sycamore Street
will be closed until further notice out of an abundance of caution for the
public’s safety.
According to Street Superintendent Jason Forsythe, vehicles off Washington
Avenue will be able to use Sycamore Street and turn west on Clinton Street to
reach Jackson Street.
     “Indiana Packers’ trucks and others will use State Road 28 East
     to Maish Road and go north to Washington Avenue.  INDOT is handling
     the detour for us,” Forsythe said. “We notified the Clinton
     County Courthouse staff, so those employees are aware they will need
     to use Clinton Street to enter and exit their parking area.”
Wampler’s Disposal Service and Recycling and Coomer and Sons Sawmill, Inc.
have been advised of the detour as well.
     “We will reopen the eastbound lane as soon as it’s safe to do
     so,” Forsythe said.
Frankfort’s Building Services and Street Departments are partnering on the
logistics of this demolition project.

City departments’ stats point in right direction at conclusion of last 200-
Day Plan for 2015
Frankfort, Ind. –At the conclusion of the McBarnes administration’s fifth
200-Day Plan, drug arrests are up, structure fires are down, handling of
property maintenance complaints are up and trash and recycling collection
amounts have increased while major crimes of theft, burglary and robbery have
decreased.
McBarnes and City department heads credit residents and business owners’
partnership with their various departments’ initiatives for statistics on all
major fronts moving in a positive direction.
     “With four years of hard work under our belts, the statistics we
     are sharing would not be possible without the participation from
     those we serve,” McBarnes said. “Our residents and business
     owners are the ones who recycle, who practice crime and fire
     prevention to make their homes and companies safer and more secure
     and who care about their neighborhoods enough to report code
     violators.
     “None of the trends we are experiencing that make Frankfort a
     stronger, more appealing community happen in a vacuum. They are
     accomplished by everyone working together.”
One of the most striking statistics resulted from the Fire Department’s Smoke
Detector Blitz that started in May where firefighters, Clinton County Red Cross
Chapter volunteers and fire cadets went door-to-door throughout the community
this spring, summer and fall distributing and installing smoke detectors and
changing batteries for anyone who needed them.
Clinton County leads the way in Indiana with 602 in-home visits, 1,327 smoke
detectors installed and 94 batteries replaced. Of those numbers, Frankfort
accounts for 546 visits, 1,201 detectors installed and 87 batteries replaced.
Statewide, 1,492 visits happened, 2,479 smoke detectors were installed and 228
batteries were replaced in 14 counties this year.
The following department statistics compare numbers four years ago in 2011
prior to the McBarnes administration with current numbers as of the end of
September and beginning of October 2015.

 Third program concludes McBarnes administration’s current 200-Day Plan
Frankfort, Ind. –Wrapping up the City’s third Neighborhood Connection
Program, Mayor Chris McBarnes and the leaders of the City’s Police, Fire,
Building Services, Parks and Street Departments will host an informal meeting
for residents in Frankfort’s northwest quadrant at Circle Park October 8 from
6:00 – 7:00 p.m.
This event also bookmarks the conclusion of the McBarnes administration’s
current 200-Day Plan as it is the last day of the Plan’s time period.
Neighbors who visit Circle Park that evening can check out the Fire
Department’s equipment, visit with the Mayor, department heads and Recycle
Man, sign up for various free City programs, including Safer Seniors (free home
safety inspections for senior citizens) and Neighbors Helping Neighbors
(available for any senior citizens or physically challenged residents who need
help with yard and exterior home repairs). Information on recycling, bicycle
registrations and the Property Watch Program will be available as well.
According to the Mayor, the Neighborhood Connection Program has three main
parts, beginning with a public safety focus with the Fire Department conducting
Smoke Detector Blitzes and the Police Department hosting a community meeting
for area residents.
     “The second phase of each Program is a blitz of City services in
     the selected section of the City, including street sweeping and alley
     clean-up by Street Department crews, saturation patrols and extra
     community intervention (talking with neighbors) by Frankfort police,
     property clean up by Building Services staff and park clean up by
     Parks Department crews.
     “We wrap up each program with a Neighborhood Connection meeting
     with area residents to share the progress made in their neighborhoods
     and have informal conversations between area residents and department
     heads and myself to answer questions and hear suggestions and
     concerns about the need for additional improvements,” McBarnes
     said.
Launched last fall in the northwest quadrant of the City, the Neighborhood
Connection Program provides extra attention to infrastructure needs, safety and
quality of life problem areas. Due to the need for continued improvements in
this section of the community, City officials returned their focus to this
area, having held the spring/summer Neighborhood Connection initiative in the
southwest quadrant.
Any Frankfort resident is welcome to attend the October 8 event, but
information shared by City leaders will be specific to the northwest quadrant.
The Neighborhood Connection Program is a part of three of the
administration’s four cornerstones: Neighborhood Revitalization,
Communications and Citizen Voice.
Circle Park is located at 1355 West Kyger Street.

Frankfort’s Neighbors Helping Neighbors:
Just a note of thanks. The work you did here at 501 S. First St. is so much
appreciated. Also your help with finding Craig Rutledge lawn care.
Mr. Dean’s Tree Service will take the tree down that we talked about when he
can get to it, they are busy now with trees still needing removal from the
storm’s damages. His representative, part of their family, said her husband
would come look at the deteriorated garage door and she believed that he would
board that up for me. Something else to be thankful for.
I am beginning to realize how much people mean to each other, so taken for
granted in my youthful independent days.
Such must be the way God plans eternal life and that will bring Him the
pleasure that brought about our creation.
I also sent a letter of gratitude to the Presbyterian Neighbors Helping
Neighbors volunteers.
May God bless you all as we manage to make it through these ever changing times
and rely on His grace.
Sincerely,
Rozella Niehaus

Event kicks off third Neighborhood Connection Program
Frankfort, Ind. –Kicking off the City’s third Neighborhood Connection
Program, Frankfort Police will hold their next community meeting on Tuesday,
August 11 from 6 – 7 p.m. in Circle Park at 1355 West Kyger Street.
Area residents are encouraged to attend to learn about the Police
Department’s work in this specific section of the community and share their
questions, concerns and ideas for improved safety and security in the northwest
quadrant of the City defined as the area north of West Clinton Street and west
of North Main Street.
In particular, residents are asked to report any vacant houses they are aware
of in their neighborhood so the Building Services team and police officers can
check on those properties. If it is raining that evening, the community meeting
will be postponed and rescheduled.
The Neighborhood Connection Program was launched last fall in the northwest

In a perfect example of how Frankfort’s Neighbors Helping Neighbors Program
is designed, volunteers led by Doyle Bell from the Handyman’s Guild with the
First Presbyterian Church are partnering with City officials to help a resident
with exterior home improvements in the 500 block of South First Street this
Saturday.
According to Frankfort Building Inspector Sam Payne and Street Superintendent
Jason Forsythe, this resident reached out to them requesting help from the
program.
“We are looking forward to assisting this very deserving resident with weed
removal and exterior door improvements. Due to an attempted break-in, we are
not releasing this resident’s identity to help protect the homeowner’s
safety.
“We are grateful to Doyle and the many caring volunteers from First
Presbyterian who plugged themselves into our program with their generous, kind
spirit. These valuable volunteers will be instrumental in making a big impact
in one afternoon,” Payne said.
“In addition to the exterior work the volunteers will be handling,
firefighters installed a smoke detector for this resident during the Fire
Department’s recent Smoke Detector Blitz,” Forsythe explained. “With
teamwork, the work is divided up and the results are maximized. That’s what
Neighbors Helping Neighbors is all about – working together, giving time,
energy and effort to make life a bit easier for our neighbors.”

BEHAVIOR
SERIES

Understanding
Your Talkative Cat

W

HILE WE HUMANS MAY NOT YET BE ADEPT at holding
conversations in cat-speak, cats nonetheless use their language
to communicate with us and other animals. Some cats “talk”
more than others, but most cats do make noise some of the time,
and they expect us to know what they’re saying.

We’re all familiar with the meaning of hissing and
growling, but there are many other sounds your cat is
capable of making, and a variety of reasons for vocalizing.

Medical Reasons
If your cat’s behavior changes suddenly, the first thing you
should do is take her to your veterinarian for a thorough
health examination. Cats often hide symptoms of illness
until they’re seriously ill; any change in behavior may be
an early indication of a medical problem. A new vocalizing
behavior, in particular, may indicate physical discomfort
stemming from an urgent need for medical attention.
A normally vocal cat who stops talking is also in need
of a medical checkup.

Breed Tendency
Asian breeds, such as the Siamese, are known to be very
vocal. If your cat has a pointed face and a long, lean body,
chances are she has some Asian heritage, so “talking” may
be a part of her character. If your cat’s chatter bothers you,
then avoid giving her any attention when she is vocal
because this will only encourage the vocal behavior.
Instead, give her attention when she is quiet.

Attention-Seeking Behavior
Some cats “talk” because they know they’ll get a
reaction. People may talk back, put out some food,
pick up and soothe the cat, or even pick the animal
up and temporarily “lock” her in another room. All of
these responses will encourage an attention-seeking
cat. To discourage this behavior, simply ignore your
cat when she does this, and when she is quiet, pour
on the love, feed her, or give her some treats. This
will teach your cat which behaviors you would like
her to continue.

Your Cat Wants to Go Outside
If your cat was previously an outdoor cat and you plan to
keep her safely inside, then good for you! The following
are some suggestions to help make the transition easier
on both of you:
■ Spay or Neuter Your Cat. Spaying or neutering will
rid your cat of those hormonal urges to go out and
seek a mate. This will result in a calmer, friendlier cat.
■ Create a Play Schedule. Schedule play times during
the times your cat would normally be outside. This
will distract her from her normal routine and
establish another, safer routine.

Provide a Window Seat. Be sure your cat has a view of
the outdoors and a sunny place to lie. Cats like to watch
birds, so putting a bird feeder outside a window is likely
to make the window a favorite spot for your cat.
Run a Scavenger Hunt. Give your cat a game to play by
hiding bits of dry food around the house. Hide the food in
paper bags, boxes, and behind open doors. This will give
her exercise and keep her busy so she doesn’t think of
going outside. This is especially good to do right before
the family leaves the house for the day.
Pay Attention. Try to give your cat extra love and attention
during this difficult transition.
Try Aversives. If your cat still won’t give up meowing
by the door, try an “aversive.” For example, leave a strong
citrus scent by the door to help make the area undesirable
to your cat. Totally ignore her vocalizations. Whenever she
is quiet, give her a food treat and encourage her to play
or cuddle.

Grief
After the death or departure of a person or animal in your
cat’s life, she may vocalize to express her grief. This can be
a normal part of the grieving process. The best thing you can
do for her is keep her schedule the same (or as close to it as
possible) and spend some extra time cuddling and playing
with her. With time, this problem should take care of itself.
If your cat does not return to her normal self, consult your
veterinarian.

Transition
If your cat is new to your home or has just gone through
a change—such as a person or other animal moving into
or out of the home—and she has just started her talkative
behavior, be patient. This may be happening due to the
transition and will stop on its own if the behavior is not
encouraged. Remember, even scolding can be perceived
by your cat as attention, and thus encourage the behavior.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The American with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 is a Federal Civil Rights Legislation, which
mandates non-discrimination to persons with disabilities. The U.S. Congress signed the ADA in
1990, and it went into effect in 1992. The ADA is a civil rights law that prohibits discrimination
against individuals with disabilities in access to jobs, public accommodations, and governmental
services and programs, public transportation, and telecommunications. Section 504 of the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973:
“No otherwise qualified [disabled] individual in the United States shall, solely by reason of
[disability], be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to
discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.”
The City of Madison recognizes that it is important for its facilities, programs, and services to be
available to all of its citizens and the general public. The City of Madison further understands that
some of its existing facilities, programs and services may have met accessibility requirements
previously, but may not now, or may not in the future, as standards are revised or new standards
developed. Therefore, in order to fulfill its commitment to endeavor to provide equal access to all of
its public programs, services, facilities for citizens with disabilities, and in compliance with the ADA,
the City of Madison has developed an American with Disabilities Act Transition Plan (ADA
Transition Plan). To develop this plan, the City of Madison completed a self-evaluation of its
facilities, programs, services and public right-of-way to determine what types of access barriers
exist for individuals with disabilities. This information was used to develop the City of Madison ADA
Transition Plan. This plan will be used to guide future planning and implementation of accessibility
improvements.
The City of Madison ADA Transition Plan is intended to help determine whether issues of
accessibility could be addressed through changes in the way such programs and services are
provided. The City will attempt to remove physical barriers or provide alternative solutions to
accessibility when program changes cannot insure access to services, programs, and activities in
existing facilities.
Realizing that structural changes generally require time and expense, the Department of Justice
Regulations, Federal Register 28 CFR Part 35 state that "in the event that structural changes to
facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, a public entity that employs 50 or more
persons shall develop a Transition Plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such
changes". Additionally, "if a public entity has responsibility or authority over streets, roads, or
walkways, its Transition Plan shall include a schedule for providing curb ramps or other sloped
areas where pedestrian walks cross curbs, giving priority to walkways serving entities covered by
the Act". The schedule for compliance the City of Madison has adopted is “As soon as possible,
administratively, physically and financially”.
The City of Madison’s Transition Plan includes provisions to require specifications on upcoming
design projects and programs, to comply with ADA requirements. The City of Madison plans to
progressively remove physical barriers to accessibility when facilities, programs, services, and
activities do not provide access to persons with special needs. Work toward reducing accessibility
barriers within City owned facilities, City infrastructure, and City programming, is to be guided by
public and/or employee request, and/or initial or revised prioritization of the Transition Plan items;
giving priority to the highest utilized programs or facilities. Additionally, the City will strive to include
annual budgetary allotments to remove accessibility barriers that will eventually make the various
Madison ADA Transition Plan

facilities and programs as accessible as is reasonably possible. Where access cannot be provided,
alternate means to provide the same opportunities to persons with disabilities will be attempted.

II.

Public Notice

28 CFR PART 35, Section 35.106 of the Title II Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires a
public entity to disseminate sufficient information to applicants, participants, beneficiaries, and other
interested persons to inform them of the rights and protections afforded by the ADA and this
regulation. Methods of providing this information include, for example, the publication of information
in handbooks, manuals, and pamphlets that are distributed to the public to describe a public entity's
programs and activities; the display of informative posters in service centers and other public
places; or the broadcast of information by television or radio. In providing the notice, a public entity
must comply with the requirements for effective communication in {35.160. The preamble to that
section gives guidance on how to effectively communicate with individuals with disabilities. The
current version of the City of Madison ADA Transition Plan will be posted on the City’s Website and
will also be made available in the Clerk-Treasurer’s Office. Key stakeholder groups and the general
public were personally invited to review and provide input at public meetings/comment sessions,
and also via request to review facilities and provide input after the public meetings were conducted.
The Public will continue to be able to view and make comments about the ADA Transition Plan on a
perpetual basis, as this plan is considered to be part of a continuous improvement process. The City
will update the plan and its associated improvement project lists annually to reflect completed
improvement projects, barrier removals, or additions or changes suggested by the public, as
appropriate. The City of Madison provided a public meeting for the public to express concerns and
comments regarding this ADA Transition Plan. The meeting was held on September 3, 2013 during
a Board of Works meeting. The City of Madison provided for the public, the proposed ADA
Transition plan on the City’s Website, and in the city Clerk-Treasurer’s office. They were also
available at the Public Meeting. The meeting was fully accessible.

III.

Responsible Official

An ADA Coordinator has been designated by the City of Madison as the person responsible for the
development and implementation of the ADA Transition Plan. The Madison Special Projects
Manager has been designated the ADA Coordinator, and is in charge of overall compliance with the
ADA.

SELF-EVALUATION of PROGRAMS, SERVICES, and ACTIVITIES

The purpose of the self-evaluation for the City of Madison was to identify all the physical barriers
that exist currently in the city in order to create a schedule and priority list for removing the barriers.
The second purpose was creating a record of our areas that were compliant. Therefore, if the ADA
rules were to change we can determine which items or areas may be affected and re-evaluate those
items or areas to determine if they would become non-compliant based on new laws.
The City compiled a list of all of its public programs, services, activities, facilities, sidewalk and
probable/existing curb ramp locations to ensure that people with disabilities have equal access to
said public programs, services, activities, facilities, sidewalk and probable/existing curb ramps
locations. Many City departments felt that they currently provided full and equal access to all its
public programs, services, activities, and facilities, but acknowledged that there are a few segments
of sidewalk and a number of probable/existing curb ramp locations that may be considered barriers
for people with disabilities.

VII.

Ongoing Quality Control

The City, through its ADA Coordinator, will provide all employees with annual reminders about the
ADA requirements with links to instructional information, and any pertinent information regarding
any changes to the ADA law since the initial plan or the previous year. Additionally, the ADA
Coordinator will annually update the report to list items not previously reported and items that have
been resolved. A list of requests for reasonable accommodations and a list of grievances will also
be included in the transition plan on a continuous basis, but grouped by year reported.
The following is a summary of the city-wide improvements that are recommended by this transition
plan.
1. Telephone
The City of Madison proposes to have at least one TTY text telephone.
2. Walk-In Service
At most of the City of Madison buildings, where the public is assisted, there are clear pathways,
clear of temporary or permanent barriers. Improvements will be considered continuously as
comments, requests for accommodation and/or grievances are received.
3. Public Meetings, Hearings, & Events
a. The City provides public meetings, hearings, or other events that are open and accessible to all
citizens, regardless of disability.
b. All departments that host public meetings, hearings, or other public events, provide
accommodations for people with disabilities.
4. Printed Materials
The City provides a variety of informational and promotional materials for public use, including
forms, brochures, fact sheets, reports, plans, proposals, agendas, ordinances, and resolutions. The
City will provide printed materials in alternate formats, as requested.
5. Website
The City provides accessible documents for the City’s website. The City will continue to improve
accessibility through the City’s website.
Madison ADA Transition Plan

6. Contracting and Purchasing
The City’s current processes do not discriminate based on disability when selecting contractors,
consultants or vendors for City Projects, or services.
7. Employment
The City of Madison does not discriminate on the basis of disability in its hiring or employment
practices and always attempts to comply with all regulations promulgated by the U.S. Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission under Title I of the ADA.

VIII. Facilities and Programs
The City of Madison The City recently completed an inventory of its facilities (inventory in Appendix
D) for all city-owned buildings and structures. This data was used to create a list of self-identified
barriers. Any identified barriers will be targeted for improvements. The City of Madison will make all
reasonable modifications to policies and programs to ensure that people with disabilities have equal
opportunity to enjoy all of its programs, services, and activities. Priorities are as listed on the
following pages.

Targeted Barrier Removal Projects for Facilities and Programs
The City of Madison has identified the above barriers for targeted improvements. The amount of the
prioritized projects is projected to be approximately $1,267,625. There are numerous low cost
improvements that the City will likely undertake while funding is sought for higher cost items.
New or Reconstruction of Existing Facility
New or reconstruction projects will include sidewalks, drives and ADA ramps in conformance with
current design standards. Where practical, this will include full intersection ADA ramps where
projects only involve a single approach.
Maintenance or Repair
As maintenance and/or repair work is done to existing facilities, replacement work will meet current
ADA standards to the degree possible.

IX.

Public Right-of-Way

Public Streets - This assessment of ADA compliance for public streets in Madison is based on the
2011 Proposed Accessibility Guidelines for Pedestrian Facilities in the Public Right-of-Way
(PROWAG), published by the United States Access Board. The PROWAG document has not been
adopted or approved, but it is recognized as a best practice and has been recommended for use by
the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). Compliance or non-compliance as noted herein, is in
reference to PROWAG, assuming it is the standard by which we should be measured. The City of
Madison does not endorse or dispute the validity of PROWAG.
The City of Madison has over 62 miles of public streets, and over 200 public street intersections;
including Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) intersections. The City of Madison has 8
signalized interactions, and there are 19 signalized intersections within the Madison corporate limits
that are owned and maintained by INDOT. It has been and continues to be a priority for the City to
improve accessibility for pedestrians through the expansion of an accessible sidewalk network. The
City has replaced sidewalk and curb ramps in an attempt to make the City more traversable for all of
its citizens and visitors. Additionally, the City requires that all new developments and site
expansions or improvements include accessible facilities in the public rights-of-way; reviews all
transportation capital projects for pedestrian access and compliance with the current ADA design
standards and guidelines; considers constructing new and/or replacing non-compliant existing curb
ramps adjacent to road reconstruction, overlay or improvement projects; and replaces deteriorated
and non-compliant sidewalks as budget allows.
Curb Ramps - The City recently completed an inventory of curb ramps (inventory in Appendix F,
exhibit map in Appendix I, and full size map in back binder pocket) for all streets in the city limits.
This data was used to create a list of missing curb ramps and a list of existing curb ramps
determined to be out of compliance. In the Right-of-Way, 575 sidewalk corners were identified
where it would be reasonable to expect that a curb ramp could exist. Of the 575 identified locations,
67 locations did not have an existing curb ramp. Of the remaining locations, 471 had ramps that
may not meet current standards, and 37 appear to meet current standards.
The following criteria are used to help prioritize projects:
1. Locations where street improvements or repaving is taking place.
2. Locations requested by the public.
3. Locations of higher density pedestrian traffic (as delineated on the City Pedestrian
Madison ADA Transition Plan

25

Generator Map; map exhibit in Appendix I and full size map in back binder pocket);
4. Proximity to government facilities, medical facilities, parks, and schools.
5. All public street intersections in the City.
6. Locations where crosswalks exist without curb ramps
7. Locations without current ramps without crosswalks
8. Locations with ramps that do not appear to meet current standards.
Curb Ramp Cost
With over 500 curb ramps in the City that may be necessary to construct new or replace, the
estimated construction cost to upgrade is approximately $600,000.
See Priority list beginning on next page.

Curb Ramp Funding
The City does not budget funding directly to curb ramps. The costs of curb ramps are included in
each construction or maintenance project. The City also makes repairs or constructs new ramps
with its own forces as budget allows. Additionally, the City continually looks for funding to improve
sidewalks and curb ramps from other sources, including grants from local, state, and federal
programs.
Sidewalks – In the Right-of-Way, approximately 3.5 miles of sidewalk was identified throughout the
City, between corners identified as locations where a curb ramp could exist. The highest priority is
where crosswalks exist adjacent to a reported barrier. The next highest priority is locations without
current sidewalks for connectivity between existing ramps. The next priority is new segments for
connectivity to improve the overall sidewalk network. The list may be reprioritized to accommodate
requests or complaints received.
The overall condition of sidewalks within the right-of-way appears to be good, with few exceptions.
Sidewalk Cost
In the Right-of-Way, the City completed a cursory review of all public sidewalks for all streets in the
city limits. This data will be used to designate sidewalks in need of repair adjacent to curb ramp
locations scheduled for improvements. The overall condition of existing sidewalks within the right-ofway appears to be generally traversable.
The following criteria are used to help prioritize sidewalk projects:
1. Locations where curb ramp improvements are taking place.
2. Locations requested by the public.
3. Locations of higher density pedestrian traffic (as delineated on the City Pedestrian
Generator Map; map exhibit in Appendix I and full size map in back binder pocket);
4. Proximity to government facilities, medical facilities, parks, and schools.
5. Locations that do not appear to meet current standards.
Sidewalk Cost
The estimated construction cost to upgrade approximately 3.5 miles of walkway (rehabilitated or
new sidewalk/path) desired for the City is approximately $410,000. Added to the curb ramp
repair/improvement estimate, there is approximately $1,000,000 of work necessary to bring the
City’s sidewalk and curb ramp network into substantial compliance.

Targeted Barrier Removal Projects for Sidewalks and Curb Ramps
The City of Madison has identified barriers for targeted improvements. Improvements will be made
as budget allows. The priorities listed are a guide only, as any specific location requested to be
improved, whether currently on the list or not, may move that specific location up in priority. Also,
any location where adjacent work is to be completed may include improving a lower priority item. As
maintenance and/or repair work is done to existing sidewalks, all replacement work will attempt to
meet current ADA standards. If such work involves ADA ramps on one corner of an intersection, the
receiving corner will be considered to be included in such work if it is not in compliance. Barrier
removal is based on the field inventory conducted. As needs may arise, through either complaints
from the public or by the City's own review, select specific locations may be addressed.
New or Reconstruction of Existing Walks and Ramps
New or reconstruction projects will include sidewalks, drives and ADA ramps in conformance with
current design standards. Where practical, this will include full intersection ADA ramps where
projects only involve a single approach.
Maintenance or Repair
As maintenance and/or repair work is done to existing sidewalks, all replacement work will meet
current ADA standards where possible. Where practical, if such work involves ADA ramps on one
corner of an intersection, the receiving corner will be included in such work if it is not in compliance.
New Construction or Reconstruction of Existing Private Facility
All permits for new construction or reconstruction of sidewalk, drives or intersection corners will be
reviewed and required to be in compliance with current ADA standards.
Undue Burden and Funding Availability
The ADA does not require the City to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a
fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity, would create a hazardous condition for
other people, or would represent an undue financial or administrative burden. This determination
can only be made by the ADA Coordinator, department head, or designee and must be
accompanied by a statement citing the reasons for reaching that conclusion. The determination that
an undue financial or administrative burden would result will be based on an evaluation of all
resources available for use in a program. For example, if a barrier removal action is judged unduly
burdensome, the City must consider other options for providing access that would attempt to
provide individuals with disabilities the benefits and services of the program and activity. Dependent
upon funding availability, the City of Madison will continue to implement a barrier removal program
within the right-of-way and its facilities. Accessibility improvements that can be made through
general maintenance of City facilities (e.g. signage, clear pathways, relocation of restroom fixtures,
etc. ), or as part of the regular administrative duties of department staff (e.g. providing documents in
alternate forms, training, website improvements, etc.) will typically be completed first; with larger
capital improvements projects being completed when necessary funding is available. Standards
currently implemented by the City of Madison, when undergoing new or improvement road projects,
adhere to those ADA laws. The program is based on the inventory conducted by the City of
Madison and it constitutes the Transition Plan of accessibility and upgrades.
TRAFFIC SIGNALS

The City of Madison has 8 signalized intersections that it controls. These signals will be upgraded to
remove barriers as and meet current standards as adjacent projects are completed, requests for
accommodation or grievances are filed and as funding allows. INDOT has 19 signalized
Madison ADA Transition Plan

41

intersections within the City of Madison corporate limits. The City of Madison will alert INDOT to any
requests for accommodation or grievances filed with the City of Madison, that are associated with
INDOT signals.
Financial Plan and Schedule

The City of Madison will endeavor to provide funding annually in services, materials or contract
replacement of deficiencies. In addition, the City will actively look for grants and other sources of
funds from various programs available.

The City of Madison held a public meeting to get input on their proposed ADA Transition Plan. The
meeting was advertised in the local newspaper; the advertisement was placed on the city’s website,
the meeting date was listed on the agenda for a city council meeting and announced at that
meeting. The City ADA Coordinator and the City’s Consultant were the only two that attended the
meeting. During the meeting the ADA Coordinator attempted to contact a local resident known to
have special needs, hoping they could attend the meeting. Review all of the City sidewalks and
ramps for barriers. He completed that assessment and it was utilized in developing this document.

well, and the led to a lot of discussion with the children."  Kathy Masri -

"Thank you! This video was very helpful! The kids loved it. I asked how many of
my first graders had already been bitten by a dog and at least 85% of them said
yes :( Hopefully this will help them so it won't happen again!" Chris Smith -

Fort Wayne Animal Care &amp; Control routinely works cases where dogs have
escaped their yards and attacked causing harm.  Some situations involve
children being injured, while others involve bites to other animals and adults.
Dog owners are given a summons to appear in court when the attack occurs off of
the owner's property.
As schools close and more children are outdoors playing, we often see a
dramatic increase in dog bite injuries.  These attacks can be prevented by dog
owners using good judgment and proper confinement.  
Fort Wayne Animal Care &amp; Control is dedicated to promoting animal bite
prevention through education to the general public and to our most vulnerabe
population - children.
Each year, 800,000 Americans seek medical attention for dog bites; half of
these are children. Of those injured, 386,000 require treatment in an emergency
department and about a dozen die. 
Although national statistics show that the rate of dog bite-related injuries is
highest for children ages 5 to 9 years, with the rate decreasing as children
age, in Fort Wayne we find adults to be the most likely victim.  In fact,
adults were the victims in 63% of Fort Wayne animal bite cases, while children
under the age of 18 were the victims in 37% of animal bite cases.  The reverse
statistic in Fort Wayne is attributed to the pro-active animal bite education
targeting children in Fort Wayne.

*** [bethsmall] ***
The third week of May is celebrated as National Dog Bite Prevention week and a
good time to review dog bite prevention tips with family members.
To avoid being bitten, educate yourself and your children to follow these
safety tips:
Never approach an unfamiliar dog, particularly one that is confined or
restrained.
Don't pet a dog, including your own, without letting the dog see and sniff you
first.
Never play rough or aggressive games, like tug-of-war, with your dog.
Avoid screaming at or running past a dog, turning your back on a dog and
running away. A dog's natural instinct is to chase and catch fleeing pray.
Don't disturb a dog that is sleeping, eating, or caring for puppies.
Use caution with strange dogs. Always assume that a strange dog may see you as
an intruder or a threat.  If approached, be &ldquo;still like a tree&rdquo;.
Try to remain motionless until the dog has left the area, and then back away
slowly.
Avoid direct eye contact with a dog. Staring into a dog's eyes is perceived
by the dog as an act of aggression and dominance and will only challenge the
dog to attack. If a dog should try to attack, &ldquo;feed&rdquo; the dog your
jacket, purse, book bag, or anything that can come between you and the dog.
If you fall or are knocked down, curl into a ball and put your hands over your
ears. Try not to scream or roll around.
Follow These Tips If You Are Bitten
Children should tell an adult right away. Tell children not to be afraid of
getting into trouble. It's important that they tell what happened and get help.
Wash the wound with soap and water and immediately consult a doctor. Serious
bites can cause scarring, so ask for a plastic surgeon certified by the
American Board of Plastic Surgery.
Report the bite to Fort Wayne Animal Care &amp; Control or the County Animal
Control Officer. Provide as much information about the dog as possible and what
the dog looked like, where you saw the dog, and if you know where the dog
lives.  Animal Control will try to locate the dog as quickly as possible.
To Reduce The Chance of Your Dog Biting:
Have your dog spayed or neutered.  Sterilization reduces aggression, and a
dog's tendency to roam. Sterilization will not reduce a dog's protective
nature.
Take your dog through obedience training classes so he will learn to be a
trustworthy member of your family and community.
Avoid chaining your dog for extended periods of time.  Chaining increases
aggression and isolates your dog from learning the normal sounds, smells, and
behaviors of children and adults.
Keep your dog secured in a fenced yard or on a leash when outside the yard.
Never allow your dog to run loose through neighborhoods and city parks.
Keep gates secured or locked to keep children from entering your yard uninvited
while your dog is outside.
If you have any doubts about your dogs behavior with people coming to your
home, put your dog in another area before opening the door to a visitor.

Stellar Quarterly Update

HUNTINGBURG, INDIANA

City of Huntingburg, Indiana
April 15, 2016
Greetings!
Take a look around! As we welcome our partners from the State of Indiana to our quarterly update, you can see that the physical work that will transform Huntingburg as part of the Stellar
Communities program is well underway.
Our Stellar projects are experiencing some bumps in the road, some literally and some as part of the process. In the downtown, we are preparing for the replacement of the major water line
which has created some physical bumps. Other projects that are still in planning have encountered other bumps, but through the partnerships we have established, we expect those to be
smoothed out, allowing progress to continue.
The bottom line is this. Huntingburg is continuing to make great strides. The report before you will reflect that. The project map continues to evolve as projects move from the planning phase to
progress. And as has been the case from the start, Huntingburg is engaging the public and receiving feedback from the community to assure the vision we have matches the desires of the
people we are serving.
Welcome once again to our Stellar City Like No Other!

Sincerely,

Mayor Denny Spinner

HUNTINGBURG, INDIANA

City of Huntingburg, Indiana
August 12, 2016
Greetings!
It was two years ago this week that the State of Indiana designated Huntingburg as a Stellar Community. As you will see in the report before you today, we have embraced that designation and
have aggressively worked to not only be a Stellar Community, but a Steller Community LIKE NO OTHER!
Since our last time together, two of the most significant projects have been completed, and others are deep into the planning stages.
The excitement generated in August 2014 is still present in our community. Our staff has worked tirelessly to meet the demands the designation brings, and the partners we have selected
continue to see the vision that only a Stellar Designation can bring to a community.
We again welcome our partners from the State of Indiana to our city. Your trip here may have been detoured our slowed by the work that is going on, but “Pardon our Progress….We Are
Building a Stellar Community.”

Sincerely,

Mayor Denny Spinner
