D. Treasurer, Finance Report and Finance Committee – Jean Blanton, Chair,
Micah Prellwitz, Michelle Quinn, Aaron Wilson, and Angela Freel.

1.

This committee serves as the Audit Committee. Micah Prellwitz will visit
the office more than once a year and without advance notice to review
internal controls.

2.

Micah Prellwitz offered to assist Sue in determining if it would be wise to
invest the proceeds of the money market account in treasury or bond
funds.

3.

RFPs for the audits and tax preparation for business years 2011, 2012,
and 2013 were sent to the following ten firms:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Harding, Shymanski, & Co., PSC.
BKD, LLP.
Kruse, Dicus, & Associates, LLP.
Stevens & Company, LLC.
Michele Bennett Accounting Services
Kenneth Brock, CPA
Umbach & Associates, LLP.
Timothy J. Otte, CPA, PC.
Kemper CPA Group
Brown, Smith, & Settle

The deadline for response is 5:00 p.m. on October 4, 2011. To date,
Kenneth Brock has declined bidding. Greg Elpers from Harding &
Schymanski said they would have to bid $7,500 so call him back if bids
were coming in that high. Tim Otte has indicated he will bid in September.
Greg Newman from Kemper CPA Group also intends to submit a bid. The
board members had no suggestions on additional firms to send RFPs.
4.

The EBA still plans to do some type of fundraiser for LAS and VLP, but
after the EBA held a strategic planning meeting we are unsure when that
might occur or what it might look like. The EBA listed as a priority
presenting a united front of support for VLP, LAS, and ILS, but only Scott,
Sue, and Karen Heard joined that committee. New and strong leadership
needs to come forward.

5.

Sue has asked Kevin to write a small grant to the Junior League for bus
tokens and Association of Family and Conciliation Court fliers. The grant
is due in November. When Angela Freel asked Kevin for a report on his
progress he had no comment.

6.

The men of Legal Aid spent 15 hours detailing Magistrate Marcrum’s car
for the Car Care Package she won at the Law Day silent auction for $120
dollars. That translates to $8 per hour!

7.

Final county budget hearings will occur September 22nd and 28th. Sue is
out September 28th and Garvin will accompany Vicki to that final meeting
when final cuts are made. The United Way training session for the grant
submission is that same day. Laura will cover that and Kevin will attend
with her as soon as his court is over.

8.

According to the Courier and Press, Tom Shetler of the county council is
suggesting a $10,000 deductible on county employee health insurance.

According to the consolidation document, which is on the County
Commissioner’s website, after consolidation LAS would have six members
appointed by the EBA and six members appointed by the Mayor. Ted
Ziemer reported that consolidation would approve and accept all existing
contracts including includes the LAS interlocal operating agreement.

2.

The County Council did approve a part time position for a receptionist for
$10 per hour for 25 hours a week. We advertised the position in Our
Times magazine, the HOLA and Juan Diego newsletters, mass e-mail to
all Civic Center e-mail users, the Evansville Bar Association, Craigslist,
WorkOne, and we reviewed the applications on file at the Evansville Bar
Association. The deadline for submitting an application was noon Friday,
September 2, 2011. The County application must be used. A drug test on
the new employee will be done. After review of the applications, most of
which wanted full time work with benefits, we chose to offer the position to
Amy Goebel, who worked part time for Tim Dodd prior to his death and
works part time for VLP. She has accepted and passed her drug test. The
earliest day she can begin work is October 3. We have told her we have
2011 funding but will not know until September 28 how we are funded for
2012.

3.

Sue will be in Chicago Monday through Friday, September 29 to October
2, 2011 for a FEMA class paid for by the local EMA office.

F. Public Relations and Fund Raising Committee – Scott Wylie, chair, Ted
Barron, Andrea Baltzell, and Angela Freel.
There is no report at this time.
G. Succession Planning Committee – Wylie, Barron, Harris, Vidal, Freel,
Martin.
The committee will meet on Wednesday November 9 at noon at Riverview by
Firefly, after the election but prior to the board meeting.
H. Executive Director – Sue Ann Hartig
1.

Talk-To-A-Lawyer is the first Thursday of each month from 4:30 to 7:00
p.m. The new phone number is (812) 618-4845. LAS covers six months
a year and ILS covers the remaining six months, along with private
attorneys.

2.

The Day of Caring date was Friday, September 9th, 2011. We had six
volunteers to (1) write the closing date on outside of closed files and set
aside the adoption files to keep forever, (2) alphabetize our open and
closed and advice only files, and (3) pick up and deliver fliers from other
agencies. We provided lunch for the volunteers. One volunteer will come
back and continue to work on project 1 and 2, as her workplace provides
her 3 days per year for community volunteering. Sue also asked Angela
Watson to keep us in mind if an educated person who understands
confidentiality would need community service on a criminal matter to
complete the project. Two additional volunteers were to have worked on

creating an online application form so applications would be paperless.
Support staff made it clear they were unwilling to work on this project right
now. Sue indicated it will have to be done in the near future.
3.

This year is Sue’s 25th anniversary at Legal Aid.

4.

Judge Wayne Trockman has been appointed to the Pro Bono Commission
by the Indiana Bar Foundation. When Sue’s term ends June 2012 (she
was appointed by the Supreme Court) we will still have Evansville
representation, but if asked, Sue would like to recommend Kevin or Garvin
or an attorney board member for the position.

5.

Sue will attend the Pro Bono Commission meeting in Indianapolis on
September 20, 2011 and did attend a southern regional meeting by
telephone conference call. Funds are down substantially this year, the
Supreme Court and Bar Foundation have allowed the use of 33% of the
remaining reserves, and districts have no reserves at all. Our District 13
has gained two new counties, Vigo and Sullivan, so our district expands to
Terre Haute.

6.

Sue would like to step down from the Volunteer Lawyers Program of
Southwestern Indiana Board on which she has served since before it was
incorporated in 1999. She was an incorporator. Kevin or Garvin would
need to replace her. There are four quarterly evening dinner meetings
somewhere in the district and four executive committee meetings in
Evansville. Sue has been either the Secretary or the Treasurer each year.
Sue told Garvin and Kevin this fact weeks prior to the board meeting.
Neither responded when asked to serve and Garvin indicated they would
flip a coin. The meetings one of them needs to attend in 2011 are Monday
October 10 at 4 pm at the VLP or EBA office for the executive committee
and Tuesday November 15 in the evening somewhere to be announced in
the district for the board meeting.

7.

Juvenile Court has adopted a rule Sue suggested which has been in place
in divorce court for some time stating an attorney is considered withdrawn
from a case once completed after 30 days have passed. This means LAS
will not have to formally withdraw by certified mail in each juvenile case
or have the client sign a voluntary withdrawal.

8.

In most cases the Prosecutor IV D no longer will meet in person with
mothers or alleged fathers and file new paternity actions. Paternity is
established by the alleged father and biological mother signing a paternity
affidavit. The affidavit says mother has physical custody and father has
parenting time pursuant to the parenting time guidelines. If the parents
sign another portion of the affidavit and obtain DNA within 60 days they
may have joint legal custody over decision making. Thus the Prosecutor

IV D is only filing petitions for a support order and not mentioning custody,
parenting time, the notice of relocation law, the law that says both parents
have equal rights to school and medical records. LAS anticipates this will
increase the number and type of applicants.
This comes on top of the change in handling CHINS (Child in Need of
Services cases). Previously the 60+caseworkers, 3 department attorneys,
and 3 public defenders would handle CHINS cases and provide services
to the parents until the children were reunified with the parents or it was
determined reunification was not possible. Then those actors in the
CHINS court would litigate who would have custody of the children. Now,
due to lack of funds, the caseworkers are not providing services and not
making a decision on where the child should be placed, but leaving it up to
private non-CHINS attorneys to litigate that issue in divorce or paternity
court. Formerly LAS was not a part of this. Most CHINS parents qualify
for our services, so we are getting more applications for contested custody
cases we cannot handle properly because we have no funds to purchase
medical records, pay for the testimony of doctors and counselors, or get
information from caseworkers who now have no opinion.
LAS will attempt to keep statistics on these two kinds of applications and
cases to see the impact.
There was discussion at the Family Law EBA section about creating an
informational video for parents of newborns to view before signing the
paternity affidavit. The new law requires hospital staff to advise the
parents of their legal rights, separately, and allow them the opportunity to
talk with whomever they choose before signing. The hospitals and their
lawyers should be happy to pay for the production of such a video.
9.

LAS has attended the EBA Family Law Section meetings and Probate
Section meetings to help Judge Niemeier institute new rules to ease the
extremely large and growing docket. Sue is one of several family law
attorneys who volunteered to pro tem for half a day during the two month
period when the Magistrate who helps in Juvenile Court on Monday
afternoon is out. She is doing this on her day off.

10.

Our wait time for an appointment is back up to 7 weeks. Vacation
time and holidays make it worse. Between her caseload, updating all
pleadings, and creating a policies and procedures manual, Sue is
following up on applicants with appointments to catch those who no longer
need us, those with bad phone numbers and addresses, etc, to free up a
most effectively use appointment time.

AGREEMENT
Revised 2011
1. I promise to give the Legal Aid Society of Evansville, Inc. (LAS) complete and
correct information. I will not lie or mislead LAS. I will tell LAS about all of my income
and all of the income of all persons in my household. I will tell LAS if anyone is helping
me pay my bills or if I own any real estate.
2. I understand that LAS may act as my lawyer in this matter only, and not in any
other matter. I understand that if I want LAS to represent me in any other legal matter, I
must file a separate application and discuss that matter separately with the staff and
attorney and sign a different agreement for representation in that case.
3. I understand that LAS cannot do any appeals of cases. If I want to appeal, I
will need to act very quickly and get a different attorney.
4. I promise to cooperate with my LAS attorney and the staff. I promise to stay
in touch with LAS on a regular basis, to call and come in for appointments when LAS
asks me to, and to provide any information LAS requests from me. I understand that
LAS cannot help me if they cannot reach me and if I am not willing to help myself with
this case. I understand that LAS cannot act on or settle my case without contacting me
and getting my prior approval. I understand that I must appear in court for my court
hearings and that if I do not appear in court, LAS cannot act on my behalf and will not
enter its appearance on my behalf. I understand that LAS attorneys have lots of clients
and no investigators, and it will be up to me to provide information about my case,
including names and addresses of witnesses, dates of birth and social security numbers
of parties, contracts and written evidence, court orders and cause numbers, and bills
and receipts.
5. I promise to tell LAS the same day if my address, telephone number,
message number, living situation, income, benefits, or any other matter changes for me
or anyone in my household.

6. I understand LAS cannot help me if I move from Vanderburgh County or if my
income increases above their limits. I agree to LAS’ withdrawal from my case if this
happens.
7. I understand LAS must withdraw from my case and not continue as my
attorney if I go to jail or the SAFE House during my case. I agree to LAS’ withdrawal
from my case if this happens.
8. I understand LAS generally will not charge me for representation. However, I
promise to pay LAS what a private attorney would charge me for work LAS did for me if
I lied about my income, living situation, or other matter while LAS represented me. I
may have to pay publication costs, service costs, court costs, or costs to get medical
records, a home study, or a guardian ad litem report.
9. I understand that if I do not cooperate with LAS, LAS has the right to withdraw
as my attorney and not help me in the future. I agree to LAS’ withdrawal from my case if
this happens. Also, I can tell LAS to stop representing me whenever I want, but I must
sign court papers to do this.
10. I agree that LAS may contact others to verify the information I gave on my
application for services.
11. I understand that LAS will discuss possible outcomes of my case and various
things the Court may consider in my case with me. I understand that LAS cannot guess
and tell me exactly how my case might come out, nor can LAS make any guarantees
about the outcome of my case.
12. I promise not to talk to the other party’s lawyer.
13. I understand LAS must disclose information about its cases to funders,
auditors, and monitors.
14. I understand LAS will only keep my case file for six (6) years after my case is
closed. After six years, my file will be destroyed. I was given a copy of this agreement
and the LAS grievance procedure. I read both and understand them.

MINUTES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS MEETING
OF THE LEGAL AID SOCIETY OF EVANSVILLE, INC.
REGULAR MEETING
YWCA
118 VINE STREET
EVANSVILLE, INDIANA
MONDAY, NOVEMBER 14, 11:45 A.M.
I.

CALL TO ORDER
The regular bimonthly meeting was called to order at 12:00 p.m. by president Kelly Lonnberg.

II.

ROLL CALL
Present were President Kelly Lonnberg, Treasurer Karen Heard, members, Sheila Corcoran, Alan Jones,
Brian Goebel, JD Strouth, and Mike Devoy. Vice President David Guerrettaz, Secretary Cathy Nestrick,
members, Gregg Baker, David Kent, and Linda Williams were excused. Also present were Executive
Director Sue Ann Hartig, staff attorney Kevin Gibson, senior secretary Karen Paulin, junior secretary
Vicki Boerner and junior secretary Sonia Keepes. Staff attorney Garvin Senn was excused.

III.

OLD BUSINESS
A.

The following items were provided and distributed to the board members:
1. Folder from WorkOne seminar, complete with handouts from all talks and a goodie bag from
the seminar.
2. Laws of Aging Magazine.
3. Focus on Service by Garvin Senn.
4. Legal Services Organization handout on representation of low income persons.

B.

Salary Stipend: Board members Lonnberg, Guerrettaz, and Nestrick met over lunch at the end of
September to discuss the salary stipend, which was turned down at the final County budget
hearing. After discussion, a motion was made by Sheila Corcoran to request that United Way
allocate $5,000 of the United Way annual allocation for an executive director stipend in 2006 and
forward. J. D. Strouth seconded the motion, which passed unanimously.
There was still confusion that the funds being requested were county funds, which they were not,
and that since they were not new United Way dollars it would cause the county to take on the
funding of $5,000 of expenses the county had not previously borne.

Sue called to determine when an additional appropriation could be filed and was told once a
salary request was denied there was a six month waiting period.

IV.

C.

Board members Lonnberg, Nestrick, and Executive Director Hartig met with Judge Pigman to
discuss upcoming plans for Legal Aid Society to move into the vacated jail space. The Legal Aid
Society staff has met and discussed needs for the new office space, including a conference room if
one is not available close by. Cathy Nestrick was to follow up with Bill Nix, county commissioner, but was not present to give her report. It is thought we will have 500 square feet more than
we currently do. The elevator and stair ingress and egress to the office is a concern. We do not
want to create a barrier to clients by the perception that our office is entered by going through the
police department.

D.

Board member Lonnberg discussed the four bids that were submitted for audits for the years 2005 2007. Bids were received from Kemper CPA Group, LLP, Rick Goelz, John Friend & Company
PC, and Gaither Rutherford & Company, LLP. Karen Heard moved to accept the bid from Rick
Goelz, CPA. JD Strouth seconded the motion. Brian Goebel voiced concern that the bid did not
include preparation of tax forms. Motion was unanimously passed with the condition that bid
included preparation of tax forms. The RFP did include preparation of the Form 990, Form 2758,
and Form IT-35AR.

A copy of the Focus on Service from Garvin Senn was passed out to board members in Garvin’s
absence.
Sue Hartig shared a story about a client who called daily, a very needy client. She worked full time
and the adverse party wanted custody. The client called Sue to let her know she figured out how to
resolve their issues. Since they “couldn’t agree on anything”, the client decided since she was
pregnant to marry the adverse party and buy a house with him. Despite Sue’s advice, the client did
just that and moved to another county.

United Way will meet on March 22, 2006, and set the allocations. We will receive written
notice at that time. If United Way responds positively, we will file again before the County
Council for an additional appropriation. The filing deadline is Friday April 14, 2006, for the
Wednesday, April 26th finance meeting and the Wednesday, May 3rd council meeting. Council
meetings are now held at 8:30 a.m. instead of 3:30 p.m. If this occurs, board attendance will be
vital on April 26 and May 3 at 8:30 a.m., as will be contacting the council persons before that

C.

Future move of office to vacated jail space
Kelly Lonnberg reported that she, David Guerrettaz, Cathy Nestrick and Sue Hartig met with
David Rector, General Manager of the Evansville Building Authority on February 15, 2006, in
regard to Legal Aid’s eventual relocation to the vacated jail space. Kelly felt it was important
that a meeting took place on a face-to-face basis and stated that those present told Mr. Rector that
Legal Aid has wished to have input as to the proposed floor plan. A copy of the floor plan
proposed by staff was distributed to the board members. The floor plan included 2,688 square
feet, including a larger lobby, secretarial area, a combination intern/conference room, and a
storage area. Sue expressed concern that all areas be ADA accessible. Sue Hartig reminded the
board that the 2001 Courthouse Action Plan indicated that Legal Aid needed twice its current
space of 1330 square feet. Sue Hartig said the new floor plan allows adequate storage space for
those files now stored in the basement that date back to 1986. Our office manual calls for files to
be destroyed after 21 years. Beginning in 2007, some files may be destroyed. Sue Hartig said a
bond issue may be done in two parts. The first phase of the bond issue would be the gutting of
the old jail and the second phase would be the renovating of the old jail space. Gregg Baker
made a motion to approve the layout for submission to David Rector. Alan Jones seconded the
motion. The motion passed unanimously. The floor plan will be sent to Mr. Rector with a cover
letter signed by David, Kelly, and Cathy.

as a Cubs or Cardinals game.
4. David asked that board members let him know what other information they would like from
staff and what marketing ideas they would like to see in place.

G.

Focus on Service - Sue Ann Hartig
Sue gave her focus on serving in writing and discussed a grandma she had helped get guardianship over a grandson. Mom had been in jail. Mom got out of jail and was high on meth when
she went to get her child. Police were involved. LAS had not gotten into court yet, but the mom
was so high the officer left the child with grandma. Once the guardianship was granted, mom
would come to see grandma under the guise of visiting, but when grandma left the room mom
would steal valuables or cash and leave. Grandma tried to adopt the child, but mom, who had
always said the father was unknown, named a father. Unfortunately, it was not the same man
who was with mom at the birth and signed a paternity affidavit, something we have to check in
each adoption. A home study is part of every adoption. This home study was not favorable
because it revealed she had several old substantiated child neglect and child abuse incidents in
Kentucky. Grandma dropped the adoption, but came back for a divorce. Her current “husband”
is not a citizen. To begin the process of citizenship, they were asked to produce birth certificates.
Grandma was asked to produce prior divorce decrees. She gave her first husband money to
handle the divorce, but he never did. So we may have to divorce her from her second husband as
well as her first husband so she can remarry her second husband and be legal.

H.

Executive Director - Sue Ann Hartig
1. Sue Hartig reported that the numbers are down for the monthly Talk to A Lawyer Program.
She gave out the phone program telephone number, 434-4836, to the board to distribute to the
public.
2. Sue Hartig said she and the staff recently proofread the Legal Aid Society of Evansville, Inc.
website. Please check it out at www.vanderburghgov.org/LAS and see what you think.
3. A board self-evaluation form was handed out to all board members. Please read over this and
answer it and be prepared to discuss it next time.
4. The new United Way funding criteria and the new agency agreement were handed out to all
board members.
5. Outcome measures
•
Value of services calculated annually ( annually)
•
Financial report distributed quarterly ( quarterly)
•
Satisfaction twice a year ( surveys to clients in March and August)
•
Judicial survey ( every four years) were just distributed.
•
Annual reports (annually)
There was some discussion regarding the hourly rate that is used to calculate the value of
services. It was thought that the rate used this year was One Hundred Seventy Five Dollars
($175) per hour; the rate used was actually One Hundred Ninety Dollars ($190). There was
discussion about using the average of board member rates as a factor when calculating the hourly
rate. Brian Goebel inquired as to the reason for this statistic. Sue Hartig said it is used for the
purpose of public relations and that there are no standard formulas used.
6. Each board member was given an appendix of attachments that each board member should
have in their folder for review. This appendix contains copies of:

7. A motion was made by Gregg Baker allowing Sue Hartig to attend a Management Information
Exchange training session to be held in Birmingham, Alabama, on April 26-28, 2006, entitled
Supervising Legal Work Training. The motion was seconded by Alan Jones. The cost of
registration only for the three day training session is Three Hundred Ninety Five Dollars ($395).
Hotel, parking, per diem, and mileage will all be requested under county policy. The motion was
carried by unanimous vote.
8. There was discussion regarding the security of client files and attorney client confidentiality
when Sue Hartig inquired as to the attorneys’ methods of securing files at the end of the day.
IV. NEW BUSINESS
Sue Hartig was asked by the board president to leave the meeting momentarily. During her
absence, a motion was made by David Guerrettaz to adopt and approve a one-time honorarium to
the executive director in recognition of her twenty years of service and leadership, money to be
taken from the Indiana Civil Legal Aid Fund in the amount of One Thousand Dollars ($1,000).
The motion was seconded by Sheila Corcoran. The motion passed.
When Sue Hartig returned to the meeting, she was surprised with an ice cream cake, a glass clock
with an engraved message, and the honorarium all in appreciation for her leadership efforts in
completing twenty years as Executive Director of the Legal Aid Society.

were unanimously approved after motion by Jean Blanton and second by Ted
Barron.
D. Treasurer, Finance Report and Finance Committee – Jean Blanton, Chair,
Micah Prellwitz, Michelle Quinn, Aaron Wilson, and Angela Freel.
1. This committee serves as the Audit Committee. Micah Prellwitz did make an
unannounced visit on October 13, 2011, to review internal controls.
2. Board members are encouraged to attend the United Way allocations meeting
and contact the members of our allocations committee before and after that
meeting. We need to restore funding to the $64,000 level it was at from 2001
through 2007.
3. Board members are encouraged to contact City and County Council
members, the Mayor and County Commissioners before the County and City
budget hearings. We need to restore the third full time secretary position so we
can operate in three attorney/secretary pairs and increase efficiency and
effectiveness as we did from 1995 to 2007.
4. Beginning this year, there is a “check off” on the EBA dues invoice for
members to opt to contribute to the LAS or VLP. This is a result of the EBA’s
strategic planning session last year which included the formation of an Access to
Justice Task Force. Legal Aid received a $100 check in January 2012. Board
members are encouraged to inform their firms of this option so they know it is
available. It was discussed that many individual attorneys never see the dues
notice, as it is paid by the firm and sent straight to bookkeeping.

1. We need to replace outgoing board members Angela Freel (EBA),
Scott Wylie (EBA) and Daniela Vidal (Mayor) in May of 2012. Chad Sewich
Can be appointed to his first full term upon letter to the County Commissioners.
Former Magistrate Terrell Maurer is currently at the Bob Zoss Law Office and has
agreed to serve on the Legal Aid Board. LAS Board members from EBA must be
EBA members. It was discussed it might be desirable to have an attorney
board member from each of the local large firms. Angela Freel may talk to
Lauren Dimmett in her firm as a possible board member. There was also
discussion about choosing persons with political clout necessary to help us
restore our funding.
F.

Public Relations and Fund Raising Committee – Scott Wylie, Chair, Ted Barron,
Andrea Baltzell, and Angela Freel.
There was no report.

G. Succession Planning Committee – Wylie, Barron, Harris, Vidal, Freel,
Martin.
After the committee made its report and discussion was completed, Jean Blanton
moved and Ted Barron seconded a motion approving Sue Hartig vacating the
position of Executive Director and becoming Staff Attorney at the end of the day
Friday, February 3, 2012 and Kevin Gibson becoming Executive Director and
vacating the position of Staff Attorney on Monday February 6, 2012.

Letters will be sent by the board to the Mayor, City Council, County Council,
County Commissioners, and United Way. Pink slips will be submitted for both
Susie and Kevin to leave their current positions and take their new positions.
Since Susie and Kevin are paid exactly the same, there will be no budget
consequence. A press release will be distributed to local media.
Susie’s plan is to retire at the end of a pay period in February 2013. However, if
she must retire prior to the end of 2012 to keep insurance benefits at the
employee’s rate for herself and her husband, she will retire prior to the end of
2012. If she cannot retire with insurance benefits at the employee’s rate for
herself and her husband, she will stay on as staff attorney as long as she can or
until age 65, which would be April 2019.
H. Executive Director – Sue Ann Hartig
1. Talk-To-A-Lawyer is the first Thursday of each month from 4:30 to 7:00 p.m.
LAS covers six months a year and ILS covers the remaining six months, along
with private attorneys. The new telephone number is 812-618-4845.
2. Legal Aid Society has printed 2,000 each of its twelve informational
brochures. The brochures were distributed to each of the board members. The
brochures will be available on our website. An additional brochure about the
paternity affidavit is in progress.
3. Legal Aid will host a Vita Site tax preparation site Monday afternoons from
1:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. beginning January 30th through April 16th, 2012, with the
exception of Monday, February 20, 2012, a holiday. Kevin is again the site
coordinator. Kevin hopes to have at least two volunteers in addition to the three
attorneys.
4. There was discussion regarding the current attorney caseload. With
appointments set for 6 new clients per week per attorney, the work generated by
three attorneys for two support staff becomes unmanageable. The number of
cases opened (435) and the number of cases pending (255) in 2011 was less
than the last several years because we only set three appointment for new
clients per attorney per week for a good part of the year. Most private attorneys
do not have a caseload as large as the LAS attorneys. There are a good number
of clients who do not show up for their appointment, or who do not bring proof of
income, paternity affidavits, needed information, or are over income at
appointment time. Persons who are domestic violence victims need several
chances to make it a bit further through the system and gain strength each time.
Clients may be under such stress that on the day of their appointment the legal
issue is not the biggest or most immediate crisis. The number of contested trials
and mediations has greatly increased, taking full days and half days out of the
attorney calendars, and causing time consuming preparation. Support staff is
working through lunch, coming in early, and staying late, which the Director has
told them not to do, but they do so just to keep up. No overtime or compensatory
time is available. We are back to a staffing level we last saw in 1992, and a case
level of 1992 also. This will be a topic for continued discussion.

5. TANF (Temporary Assistance For Needy Families – the cash portion of the
“welfare” system) recipients have declined from 28,000 Vanderburgh County
families to 400 Vanderburgh County families. Sanctions for failing to do certain
things are lifetime sanctions now. Food Stamp and Medicaid rolls increasing.
6. Sue Hartig asked the board if they would like the emails she sends from time
to time about individual cases to continue, and to come from Garvin and Kevin
too, to which the board responded affirmatively.
IV.

NEW BUSINESS

MISCELLANEOUS BUSINESS INCLUDING FUTURE MEETING DATES OF
THE BOARD
A. The Board Members present at today’s meeting are current in their payments
owed for lunches and the holiday gathering. The Board Members who still owe
money will be contacted by email.
B. What are the top three priority items for LAS during the next 90 days?
C. What is our vision for LAS seven years hence? What will LAS look and
how will we get there?
E. Legal Aid Board Meetings are held on the 2nd Monday of odd numbered
months at 11:45 a.m. atthe Blue and Gold Room at Old National Bank. The
March 2012 meeting will be held on Tuesday rather than a Monday due
to a conflict with the Vita Site.

G. Executive Director – Kevin Gibson
1. Via e-mail, the Board approved the hiring of Attorney Adam J. Maday to replace
Sue Ann Hartig. Adam’s first day at the Legal Aid Society of Evansville, Inc.
was Tuesday, February 19, 2013. Sue Hartig’s last day at the Legal Aid Society
of Evansville, Inc. was Friday, February 15, 2013.
2. The United Way Allocations Panel visited LAS on February 22, 2013. The panel
members are Rosa Froiland (Shoe Carnival), Jennifer Borgra (Community
Volunteer), Janie Chappell (Deaconess Crosspointe), Steve Hoover (Vectren),
Marques Terry (EHA), and Carl Powers (First Security). A special thanks to Ted
Barron, Micah Prellwitz, and Jim Martin for attending the meeting. Chad Sewich
relayed he would be happy to attend any future United Way meetings such as
this. LAS requested an additional $10,000 from United Way to provide the
funding to make our third secretary position into a full-time position. However,
the County may still not approve the third secretary position due to the $20,000
cost of full-time benefits.
3. The Vita Site program was delayed one week and began on February 4th rather
than January 28th and will end on April 15, 2013. In 2011, we prepared a total of
154 returns; in 2010, we prepared a total of 106 returns.

4. Legal Aid purchased seven new computers (three with funds from the general
fund and four with a grant award). Jim Martin moved with a second by Chad
Sewich to declare the old computers as surplus and for LAS to contact United
Way to see if there are any non-profit agencies who could use these computers.
The IT Department with the County will remove any LAS programs from the
computers.
5. LAS will continue to receive free local EBA CLE for 2013.
6. There will be no board meetings prior to the Silent Auction for Law Day
scheduled for Friday, April 26, 2013. Legal Aid and VLP are responsible for
providing items for the Silent Auction. Jean Blanton volunteered to contact the
EBA and ask for donations. Ted Barron and David Kent suggested people donate
cash and then Jean Blanton would purchase items to be auctioned off also. Kevin
Gibson suggested businesses to be contacted for donations also.
7. Kevin Gibson reported the ONB Riverfront Grill will be closing March 15th. The
Board decided to keep the meetings scheduled for the Blue and Gold Room at
ONB if it is still available as the location is convenient for everyone.

“Getting to Know People Legal Aid Society Helps”

Steven is 32 years old. He is the father of Courtney, age three and Jamie age six. The
children were taken from the mother, Yvonne, age 30, and placed with Steven by Office of
Family and Children due to Yvonne’s substance abuse. Dennis contacted Legal Aid Society to
gain custody of the children. With our legal representation, he did get custody. Since the
children are now safe, the state dismissed the wardship. Yvonne now has visitation with the
children.

lease term, Polly notified her landlord of her forwarding address, cleaned-up, turned in her
keys and vacated her apartment. After 45 days, Polly telephoned her landlord and asked him
to refund her $200 security deposit. Polly, who had fulfilled her lease contract and caused no
damages to her landlord’s property, was legally entitled to the refund. Polly’s landlord
promised her a refund, but the refund never came. When she called again, Polly’s landlord
gave her the runaround, then quit answering the phone or returning her calls. Legal Aid
Society helped Polly sue her landlord, win a judgment, and recover her $200 security deposit.
Ashley, a 29 year old divorced waitress and mother of two, discovered that she was pregnant
and decided to place the child up for adoption. Ashley’s ex-husband, Matt, was not the father
of the unborn child. When Ashley left town to deliver her child and complete the adoptive
placement, Matt went to the divorce court and told the judge that Ashley sold her baby and
might sell 10 year old Brooke and 6 year old Mark, too. Upon her return to town, Ashley
learned that she could only visit Brooke and Mark under the supervision of Matt. Legal Aid
Society took Ashley’s divorce case back to court and convinced the judge that Matt’s
accusations were untrue. Ashley’s regular visitation privileges were restored.

WHO WE ARE
The Legal Aid Society of Evansville, Inc. is a not for profit law firm. Since 1958, when
the firm was created by our local bar association, the Legal Aid Society has provided
legal assistance of the highest quality to low income residents of Vanderburgh County.
Today, throughout Vanderburgh County courts, administrative agencies and other
legal forums, the firm’s lawyers counsel and advocate for those members of the
community who have no money with which to hire private attorneys. Legal Aid
charges its clients no fees.

WHY WE DO WHAT WE DO
The Legal Aid Society believes that low income persons should enjoy meaningful
access to a full range of high quality legal services so that they can anticipate and
prevent legal problems from arising, solve their legal problems and protect their legal
rights.
Helping those in need, solving our community’s problems, and remedying injustices
are the core values we share with our funders. Most of the firm’s work involves
assisting very vulnerable families, the elderly and the disabled, victims of domestic
violence and children.

WHAT WE DO
Legal Aid uses its resources to help struggling families and individuals challenged with
legal stressors to efficiently resolve their problems. However, the firm’s true impact
and its value to the community are most resonantly expressed in the stories of its
clients and of the successful outcomes they have realized with Legal Aid’s expert
assistance.

3. The only response from the letters sent out about Legal Aid’s need for

Gail Riecken who forwarded the letter to the House Ways and Means
Committee. The Craig Family Foundation (Randall Craig) donated Two
Hundred Fifty Dollars ($250) and Vectren Foundation donated Five
Hundred Dollars ($500).
Gail Knight Williams with Southwestern Behavioral Health sent Sue Hartig
a list of eighteen (18) suggestions of entities to write for grants. Cathy
signed those letters and they were sent the week of June 30th. Cathy
Nestrick agreed to make a personal follow-up call to Bill Bussing. Scott
Wylie agreed to make a personal follow-up call to Bob Jones.
Letters of inquiry have also been submitted from grants from the
Vanderburgh County Community Foundation Impact Grant and VCCF
Women’s Fund grant. A letter will also be submitted to the Evansville Bar

5. Scott Wylie informed the board that the government rate for publication costs
is expected to triple. Additionally, Sue reported that we are using more funds for

C. Secretary and approval of minutes of annual meeting and regular meeting of May
11, 2009 – Freel
The minutes of the annual and regular meeting of May 11, 2009, were
approved unanimously after motion by Scott Wylie and second by Amy Back.
D. Treasurer, Finance Report and Finance Committee – Goebel, Harris, Heard, Back,
Nestrick –
1. This Committee serves as the Audit Committee. Brian Goebel needs to make
at least two (2) unannounced visits to the office before year end to randomly
check accounting standards so we are in compliance with our internal
controls for the audit.
2. The joint City/County budget hearing held on July 29, 2009, was attended by
board members, Cathy Nestrick, Scott Wylie, Jim Martin, staff attorneys, Kevin
Gibson and Garvin Senn, and secretaries Karen Paulin and Vicki Boerner.
County employees can expect no salary increase except for the step raises and
an increase in health insurance premiums. City employees are facing loss of
vacation time over 4 weeks, no raises, increased health insurance premiums and
increased co-pays, increased prescription costs, and a net 3% pay cut because
the city will no longer be picking up the PERF contribution.
3. We have two (2) certificates of deposits of funds from the Indiana Civil
Legal Aid Fund (our reserves) which came due on August 1: one for

$18,659.71 plus interest was earning 3.5% at Integra Bank and one for
$15,000 plus interest was earning 5.25% at First State Bank. An
additional certificate of deposit for $5,925.11 earning interest of 3.5% at
Integra matured and was cashed out August 1. With current certificate of
deposit interest near 1%, a motion was made by Scott Wylie to allow the
funds to remain in the Legal Aid Society checking/savings accounts until
interest rates improve. The motion was seconded by Angela Freel.
The motion passed unanimously.
The bi-annual ICLAF grant to the Legal Aid Society in July 2009 was for
approximately $15,600. In past years, the amount has never been less
than $18,000.
E. Nominating and Personnel Committee – Wylie, Vidal, Martin
1. Sonia Keepes has been ill since May 4, 2009. She has exhausted all her
banked sick, personal, and vacation time during the first month of her twelve
(12) week FMLA leave. Her FMLA leave ended on July 24, 2009. The
personnel policy allows six (6) months of unpaid leave. Legal Aid has
requested three (3) months unpaid leave taking Sonia through October 16,
2009, at which time it would be the director’s discretion regarding the
remaining three (3) months. The request to ask the Commissioners for three
months sick leave was previously approved by the board by email. That vote
was confirmed unanimously after motion by Jamil Wali and second by Angela
Freel.
2. Ronda Koch is our full time temporary secretary. She is paid the hourly rate
of the initiation step for Sonia’s position. Legal Aid has transferred six (6)
weeks of pay for Ronda from Sonia’s line item and is in the process of
transferring another twelve (12) weeks.
3. Dr. Dionne Blue has been recommended by attorney Erica Taylor as a
candidate for the non-attorney County Commissioners board member
vacancy. Scott Wylie has asked Troy Tornatta to look into appointing her.

F. Public Relations and Fundraising Committee – Wylie, Wali, vacancy, Nestrick
We talked last meeting about the importance of being a good
community partner and doing more than just individual representation.
United Way now divides its work into three (3) coalitions: income, health,
and education. Each United Way agency is assigned to a coalition by self
identification. Legal Aid is in the income coalition. The report presented to

Aid was a key participant in the Vita Sites and all six staff members served
on a Bank on Evansville committee.
