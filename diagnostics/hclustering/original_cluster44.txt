LOCAL HOMESTEAD CREDIT
y

The Local Homestead Credit is a property tax relief tool implemented to give property tax relief
prior to the application
p
pp
of the circuit breaker.

y

If eliminated, property tax liabilities will increase for homestead owners whose property tax
bills are less than the 1% cap.

y

Elimination of the Local Homestead Credit would result in additional revenue of $12.8 million,
with $8.4 million of the revenue going to the City-County.

y

Pros:
•
Results in an additional $8.4 million additional funding for City-County government
services.
•
Eliminates the use of income tax as a property tax relief tool (implemented before property
tax caps).

y

Cons:
• Increases tax liability for homestead owners; average property tax bill increase of $21.
• Shifts revenues from schools, libraries and municipal corporations to city-county
government.

LEVY FREEZE LOCAL OPTION INCOME TAX

•
•

(IC 6-3.5-6-31)

The Levy Freeze Local Option Income Tax (LOIT) is determined by the amount of property tax growth forfeited
during the years the County elected to freeze property tax levies (2008
(2008-2010)
2010).
The DLGF certifies the LOIT rate annually. In 2014, the maximum rate was certified at .3224%.
The certified rate is calculated to generate the amount of property tax revenue that was forgone due to the
property tax freeze.

•

•

Currently,
C
l the
h Ci
City-County
C
applies
li a LOIT rate off .27%.
%
•
The City-County does not realize the full replacement of forgone property tax revenue.
•
$28.1 million of LOIT revenue is generated by the current rate.
•
$34.5 million of LOIT revenue could be realized if the current rate was increased to .3224%.

•

Impact on taxpayer with $50k in taxable income is approximately $25.

•

Pros:
•
Raises additional revenue for taxing units.
•
Rate will decline as personal income increases.

•

Cons
•
Not all revenue can be directed towards public safety.
•
Immediate increase in tax rate for income earners.
•

MAJOR REVENUE SOURCES
Alcohol Gallonage Tax - Income generated from a state-imposed tax on every gallon of
alcoholic beverages sold.
Auto Excise Tax - Income derived, in lieu of personal property tax, on all motor vehicles,
except those that fall under the commercial vehicle excise tax classification.
Cable TV Franchise Fees - The City receives a percentage, currently 5%, of either the
gross annual subscriber receipts or the franchisee’s gross annual receipts, whichever is
greater.
Commercial Vehicle Excise Tax – Revenue based on the weight of the vehicle and is
paid at the time of registration. The base for this tax is commercial vehicles such as
tractors and trailers that were subject to the property tax.
County Option Income Tax - Revenue generated from the income of those persons
working within Allen County. This tax is at a level of .6% effective July 1, 1994.
Economic Development Income Tax - The base for this tax is the same as the County
Option Income Tax, individual Indiana taxable income in Allen County. This tax is at a level
of .4% effective July 1, 1998.
Financial Institutions Tax - This tax is based upon a combination of the net income and
the personal property of financial institutions.
Fuel Tax - Taxes generated from the sale of gasoline and other fuels.
General Tobacco Tax - Revenue received from the taxation of all cigarettes sold, used,
consumed, handled or distributed with the state.
Interest Income - Revenue earned as the City invests its idle funds in various investment
vehicles.
Liquor Excise Tax - Income generated from the sale and renewal of liquor licenses.
Property Tax - The largest source of City revenues. This tax results from the tax rate
applied against the assessed value of the property.
Solid Waste Collection Fees - Revenues received from residential households for the
collection of solid waste, yard waste, and recyclables.
Other sources of revenue include, but are not limited to: animal control licenses, payments
in lieu of taxes, ordinance violations, rental property, zoning fees, engineering and

TAXES BASED ON INCOME
In March of 1989, the Common Council of the City of Fort Wayne enacted the County Option Income Tax (COIT), one of three
local option income taxes available to counties under State statutes in Indiana, as part of a tax reform package. Also, available
to counties under Indiana law is the County Adjusted Gross Income Tax (CAGIT) and the County Economic Development
Income Tax (CEDIT). The Common Council controlled enactment of the tax at that time based on the fact that the City
comprised 58.5% of the population of Allen County, even though the Allen County COIT Council actually enacts the tax.
The tax reform effort involved two primary strategies. One, it is appropriate to tax those citizens who live outside the City but
use City services such as roads and streets, fire protection, and police protection while they work in Fort Wayne. To a modest
extent, COIT accomplishes that. Two, adding a different tax base into the picture, income as opposed to property, broadens and
distributes the total tax burden in a fairer manner. COIT accomplishes that as well.
The tax reform package also included an increase in the Homestead Property Tax Credit from 4% to 12% by 1992 and a flat
property tax rate through 1992. The COIT tax began on July 1, 1989 at a rate of .2% on Indiana adjusted gross income.
Because of fluctuations in the base upon which COIT is computed, revenue could vary more from year to year than does
property tax revenue.
COIT increased to .3% on July 1, 1990, where it remained frozen until July 1, 1992. In March of 1992, the Common Council
removed a self-imposed freeze on the COIT tax and allowed it to go to .4% effective July 1, 1992. The Common Council
increased COIT to .5% effective July 1, 1993 and to .6% effective July 1, 1994. The City receives revenues from the State of
Indiana on a delayed basis.
In March of 1993, the Common Council enacted the Economic Development Income Tax (CEDIT) for Allen County at a level
of .2% effective July 1, 1993. Use of these funds is restricted to projects related to economic development, infrastructure
improvements, Parks and Safety capital expenditures or payment on bonds to fund any of these types of projects. In March of
1998, Common Council voted to increase the rate to .4% effective July 1, 1998.

About This Report
The purpose of this report is to provide a brief description about how City government is
organized in Fort Wayne and to describe the City budget process. This report will give the
reader an overview of the financial operations and structure of City government.
Each year, the City of Fort Wayne prepares the Operating Budget book that contains the
detailed budgetary information relating to each department of the City. Because the budget
book is long and detailed, we will highlight and summarize it in this report.
Comments and suggestions about this report are welcomed by the City Controller.
Individuals and organizations can best express concerns about City government by
contacting people directly responsible for your area of interest.
A list of the City
departments is detailed in this report.
Form of Government
Fort Wayne is governed under a Mayor-Council form of government where the elected
Mayor serves as head of the executive branch. The Mayor may serve unlimited four-year
terms and is the chief executive officer for the City. The legislative oversight body for the
City is the Common Council of the City of Fort Wayne. The council is composed of nine
elected Council members who serve four-year terms. A council member represents each of
the six councilmanic districts and three are elected at-large. The City Clerk’s office provides
City Council staff support if needed under the direction of the City Clerk. The City Clerk is
elected by the citizens of Fort Wayne every four years and can serve unlimited terms.

DIVISIONS OF THE CITY GOVERNMENT
Office of the Mayor
The Mayor oversees the implementation of policies and the efficient flow of ongoing services
through wide appointive powers. This includes the capability to appoint the heads of seven
major administrative divisions of the city and many board and commission members.
Specific departments under the Office of the Mayor include the Public Information Office,
Human Resources, Benefits, Cable, the Neighborhood and Citizen’s Advocate Office, the
Law Department, the Internal Audit Department, and Information Systems/ACS.
City Clerk
The office of the City Clerk is crucial as a liaison between the citizens of Fort Wayne and the
Common Council. The City Clerk also acts as a liaison between the Administration and the
Common Council. The office includes a number of Indiana Statutory responsibilities and
also serves as the administrator of the City of Fort Wayne Violations Bureau.
Finance & Administration
The mission of the Finance & Administration Division is to ensure fiscal responsibility and
effective administrative services for the City of Fort Wayne. The departments within the
division are the Controller’s Office, Risk Management, Payroll, Purchasing, and Property
Management.
Public Safety
The Division provides safety, maintains order and protects the rights of the Citizens of Fort
Wayne. The Fire Chief and Chief of Police retain the responsibility for major policy
decisions, budgeting, long-range planning and the day-to-day coordination of seven
departments: Police, Fire, Animal Control, Weights and Measures, Neighborhood Code,
Police Merit Commission, and Communications.
Community Development
The overall purpose of the Division is to improve Fort Wayne’s physical and economic
environment. The Division includes the following departments: Administration, Fiscal,
Redevelopment, Land Use and Development Permits, Community Development
Corporation, Planning, Special Projects/GIS and the Office of Housing and Neighborhood
Services.

The mission of the Division is to develop and implement creative community-based
strategies to enhance economic opportunity, build strong neighborhoods, and ensure a
dynamic framework for quality growth and development. Economic development, urban
revitalization, housing and comprehensive planning continue to be high priorities of the
City of Fort Wayne. Growth in the City’s assessed value is essential to holding its
property tax rate flat and ensuring that the cost of City services is shared by those who
use the services.
3

The City’s Community Development Division is primarily responsible for these efforts, both through its
various departments’ activities and those of contractors. The City contracts with the Fort Wayne-Allen
County Economic Development Alliance (“The Alliance”) to coordinate economic development
marketing services and project management.
City Utilities and Public Works
The City Utilities Administration Department represents the office of the Director of Utilities and is
responsible for enforcement and interpreting City Utilities rules and regulations. City Utilities
encompasses the departments of Accounting, Customer Relations, Data Control, Meter Reading, New
Water and Sewer Permits, Water Resources (Development Services, Planning and Design,
Engineering Support Services, Geographical Information Systems), Water Maintenance and Service,
Water Filtration Plant, Water Pollution Control Maintenance, Storm water Maintenance, and Water
Pollution Control Plant.
The Division of Public Works is the administrator for much of Fort Wayne’s infrastructure. Its
departments maintain and improve the City’s system for transportation and solid waste. From
engineering and intersection improvement to battling floods, the Division of Public Works provides a
vital support to neighborhoods, businesses, and economic development projects. The Division
encompasses the Office of the Director, Barrett Law, Solid Waste Management, Traffic Engineering,
Transportation Administration & Support, Street Light Engineering, Street Department, Street Project
Management, Flood Control, and City Garage.
Fort Wayne Parks and Recreation
The Parks and Recreation Department maintains more than 2,800 acres of public park lands and
provides numerous recreation facilities, programs and services for the Fort Wayne community.
Created in 1905, the Parks and Recreation Department is administered by a four-member bipartisan
Board of Park Commissioners. Authorized by state statute, the Board of Park Commissioners reviews
and approves the annual budget, expenditures and contracts. In addition, they oversee 84 parks,
including the Children’s Zoo, Headwaters Park, the Botanical Conservatory, McMillen Ice Arena and
three community centers.
The Fort Wayne park system was largely developed over the last 100 years through the generous
support of local citizens. This support continues to build on that legacy. In 2006, the renovation of the

historic barn at Salomon Farm Park was made possible using $520,602 from a private fund drive
totaling more than $1 million. A new restroom facility, paths and other improvements were also
completed at Salomon. Ground was broken at McMillen Park for a new Lifetime Sports Academy
Center/Golf Clubhouse in the fall of 2006, which was also funded in large part with private
contributions. The Department is profoundly grateful for this support.
Improvements of more than $500,000 were completed at Foellinger Theatre in Franke Park, thanks to
matching funds from Foellinger Foundation and CEDIT funds from Mayor Graham Richard. The
complete renovation of Lakeside Rose Garden’s sunken garden was the first major project funded
from a 2005 bond issue. Other bond-funded improvements included lighting at Kreager soccer fields,
construction of six new playgrounds, and resurfacing of tennis courts, basketball courts and portions of

4

the Rivergreenway. Cooper Center at Reservoir Park was also renovated and re-opened as
a youth center that offers after-school assistance and summer programming. Funding for the
computers in this facility was provided by the Community Foundation of Greater Fort Wayne.

Successful programming, both old and new, is also a tenet of the Parks and Recreation
th
Department. The Franke Day Camp operated its 60 consecutive summer in 2006,
serving over 2,200 area youth ranging in age from 4 to 18. The Botanical Conservatory
entered new territory by offering a Friday evening concert series called “Wired for
Sound” in the outdoor terrace garden. The concerts quickly caught on in popularity and
will be offered again in 2007.
The Department entered into a new management agreement with the Zoological
Society in January 2006, releasing all aspects of the zoo operation to their board. The
Zoological Society already employs most of the zoo’s staff and is an integral part of the
operation, especially fund-raising. This agreement strengthens the organizational
effectiveness of both the Children’s Zoo and the Fort Wayne Parks and Recreation,
while also maintaining close ties for reciprocal cooperation.

THE BUDGET PROCESS
The Civil City budget process begins with individual departments preparing draft budgets
each May for the next calendar/fiscal year. The division of Finance and Administration
provides the departments with a set of assumptions. These budget requests are then
subjected to internal review and modification. The Common Council actively participates in
the examination of the budgets. With the Mayor’s approval, a budget ordinance is then
prepared for introduction to the Common Council in early September. Beyond the public
and televised Common Council sessions, there is a legal public hearing held as part of the
budget process at which citizens may provide the administration and Common Council with
their comments concerning the budget. By state law, the Common Council must pass the
budget by the end of September each year. The Common Council has the power to
decrease any major category proposed by the Administration, but may not increase any
major category in the budget.
The next step is the final budget hearing of the Department of Local Government Finance in
December. This is the time for estimates to be verified and a final property tax rate set. The
Indiana Department of Local Government Finance must certify the rate by February 15th.
The 2007 budget was prepared on a monthly basis. All departments distributed their yearly
estimated expenditures into the months they expected each to occur. During 2007, actual
expenditures will be compared to the budget each month. Variances of +/- 3% and $1,000
for budgets less than $100,000 or variances of +/-3% and $2,500 for budgets over $100,000
will be explained.
Throughout the year the City may find the budget needs to be amended to account for new
funds that have become available, or to provide for a revision of objectives. Such revisions
are accomplished through quarterly fiscal ordinances in a process that is similar to the one
described above. At every appropriate point in the process, the public is notified of the
anticipated amounts of the budget revisions.
The schedule of major budget events is as follows:
April
May
July
September
December
January

Budget instructions issued by the City Controller
Budget requests submitted - Revenue estimates prepared
Internal reviews and modification of budget submissions
Budget submitted to Common Council, hearings and adoption
Department of Local Government Finance review and approval
Budget implementation

The City Utilities internal budget process is similar to the Civil City; however, the Board of
Public Works approves the City Utilities budget. City Utilities budget and revenue sources
are included later in this report.

Budget by Classification
The budgets of all governmental units in Indiana are prepared according to a form
prescribed by the Indiana State Board of Accounts. The legal level of budgetary control is
by object classifications. Objects are called expense accounts or line items by the private
sector. Major classifications of expenditures are as follows:
Personal Services – Expenditures for salaries, wages and related employee benefits. The
increased spending in this classification is due to annual salary increases of approximately
3% and the continued rise in health insurance premiums.
Supplies – Office supplies, operating supplies, repair and maintenance supplies. The 2007
budget shows an 18.27% increase for this classification, due to fuel, natural gas, and water
costs.
Other Services and Charges – Professional services, communication and transportation,
printing and advertising, insurance, utility services, repairs and maintenance, rentals, debt
service. The cost of professional services, contract services, lease, loan and bond
payments, primarily related to infrastructure projects, will vary significantly from year to year.
Capital Outlay – All lands, buildings, improvements, machinery and equipment purchases
that are not financed through leases or bond issues. The capital outlay for 2007 increased
for this classification to support infrastructure maintenance, as well as economic
development.

City Government Revenues
As shown in the Revenues by Source schedule, the City has many sources of revenue to pay for
the cost of operations and services. The majority of City revenues are generated from taxes.
The largest three tax revenues are: Property Taxes, County Option Income Tax (COIT) and
County Economic Development Income Tax (CEDIT).
State statutes, and/or local ordinances, define how each type of revenue may be used. Following
is a brief explanation of the use of the City’s larger revenue streams.
Taxes
Property Tax, Commercial Vehicle Excise Tax (CVET), Financial Institution Tax, COIT (County
Option Income Tax .6%), and Auto/Aircraft (license) Excise taxes are used exclusively to fund
operations of certain City departments. These departments perform executive/finance, public
safety, parks and community development work, and include administrative/engineering
departments in the Public Works Division. Most of these funds go into the City’s property tax
supported funds.
CEDIT (Community Economic Development Income Tax .4%) - In July 2005, SEA (Senate
Enrolled Act) 100 was passed which provides that a county, city, or town may use county
economic development income tax revenue for any lawful purpose.
The Excise Surtax and Wheel Tax revenue is derived from Allen County vehicle owners who pay
annual motor license excise tax. A distribution to county, cities and towns within the county is
based on the same formula as used for Local Road & Street fund distributions. These funds must
be used to construct, reconstruct, repair and maintain streets and roads. These funds are used in
the City’s Motor Vehicle Highway fund.
The Gas Tax revenue is generated from the sale of gasoline & other fuels. A distribution to
county, cities and towns within the county is based on the same formula as used for Motor
Vehicle Highway fund distributions. These funds are used to support the Motor Vehicle Highway
and Local Road & Street funds.
License & Permits
The largest revenue in the License & Permit category is the Cable Franchise Fees. These fees
are added to cable subscribers’ bills. Forty percent of this revenue is used to pay for the
operation of the government access channel with the remainder going into the City’s General
Fund for operating costs. All other fees listed go into the General Fund.
Intergovernmental Revenues
Governmental revenues are primarily provided by the State to pay 50% of annual costs of the
Pre’77 “pay-as-you-go” public safety pension plan ($9.7M) and to pay for the Street Department
operating costs and projects ($11M).

The City Utilities Budget Process
The City Utilities operation and maintenance budget process begins in July with individual
departments preparing draft budgets for the next calendar year. Utility Administration works with
the various departments to develop assumptions, service indicators, and objectives. The
accounting department prepares revenue and cash flow projections. The budgets and
projections are subject to review and modification by Utility Administration. Capital Improvement
committees prepare priority lists of revenue capital items, which are subject to review and
modification by Utility Administration. Revenue capital items included in the budget are
dependent on the available cash after consideration of budgeted operation and maintenance
expenses.
With the Mayor’s approval, the budget is presented to the Board of Public Works and the Board of
Stormwater Management for final approval.
Regardless of the amount, departments are required to submit all budget adjustments to Utility
Administration for approval. Plan changes that materially impact the budget are presented to the
Boards for approval.

Utility Revenue
The water user rates are based on the quantity of water used plus a charge based on the
meter size. Inside-the-city customers pay a lower water usage rate and a lower water meter
service charge than outside-the-city customers. Wholesale users are billed for services in
accordance with a contract or agreement. The rates and charges set forth in the agreement
are intended to cover the City’s cost of treating and supplying water as well as a portion of
the operation, maintenance and capital cost of the Water Utility.
The sewer user rates are based on the quantity of water used plus a billing charge. Insidethe-city customers pay a lower rate than outside-the-city customers. The City also imposes
an additional charge on users whose sewage waste exceeds the “stronger than normal
domestic strength” sewage waste limits, based on the applicable levels of discharges.
Wholesale users are billed for services in accordance with a contract agreement. The rates
and charges set forth in the agreement are intended to cover the City’s cost of treating and
disposing of the applicable waste as well as a portion of the operation, maintenance, and
capital costs of the Treatment Plant.
The stormwater user rates are based on ERUs (Equivalent Residential Units) of impervious
surface and apply to properties located within the City. An ERU is equal to the average
amount of impervious area of a single-family residential property, and is established at 2,500
square feet. Impervious areas are those that have been paved, and/or covered with
buildings, so the infiltration of water into the soil is prevented. Properties exempt from
property taxation are granted a 15% discount off their gross ERU’s.

MAJOR REVENUE SOURCES
Alcohol Gallonage Tax - Income generated from a state-imposed tax on every gallon of alcoholic
beverages sold.
Auto Excise Tax - Income derived, in lieu of personal property tax, on all motor vehicles, except
those that fall under the commercial vehicle excise tax classification.
Cable TV Franchise Fees - The City receives a percentage, currently 5%, of either the gross
annual subscriber receipts or the franchisee's gross annual receipts, whichever is greater.
Commercial Vehicle Excise Tax - Revenue based on the weight of the vehicle and is paid at the
time of registration. The base for this tax is commercial vehicles such as tractors and trailers that
were subject to the property tax.
County Option Income Tax - Revenue generated from the income of those persons working
within Allen County. This tax is at a level of .6% effective July 1, 1994.
Local Option Income Tax - The base for this tax is the same as the County Option Income Tax,
individual Indiana taxable income in Allen County. The Allen County Income Tax Council in June
of 2013 approved a Property Tax Relief (PTR) LOIT of .25% and a Public Safety (PS) LOIT of
.10% which will be effective October 1,2013. These LOIT's are also referred to as a type of COIT.
Economic Development Income Tax - The base for this tax is the same as the County Option
Income Tax, individual Indiana taxable income in Allen County. This tax is at a level of .4%
effective July 1, 1998.
Financial Institutions Tax - This tax is based upon a combination of the net income and the
personal property of financial institutions.
Fuel Tax - Taxes generated from the sale of gasoline and other fuels.
General Tobacco Tax - Revenue received from the taxation of all cigarettes sold, used,
consumed, handled or distributed with the state.
Interest Income - Revenue earned as the City invests its idle funds in various investment
vehicles.
Liquor Excise Tax - Income generated from the sale and renewal of liquor licenses.
Property Tax - The largest source of City revenues. This tax results from the tax rate applied
against the assessed value of the property.
Other sources of revenue include, but are not limited to: animal control licenses, payments in lieu
of taxes, ordinance violations, rental property, zoning fees, engineering and technical service fees,
grants and other contributions.

TAXES BASED ON INCOME
In March of 1989, the Common Council of the City of Fort Wayne enacted the County Option Income Tax (COIT), one of three
local option income taxes available to counties under State statutes in Indiana, as part of a tax reform package. Also, available
to counties under Indiana law is the County Adjusted Gross Income Tax (CAGIT) and the County Economic Development
Income Tax (CEDIT). The Common Council controlled enactment of the tax at that time based on the fact that the City
comprised 58.5% of the population of Allen County, even though the Allen County COIT Council actually enacts the tax.
The tax reform effort involved two primary strategies. One, it is appropriate to tax those citizens who live outside the City but
use City services such as roads and streets, fire protection, and police protection while they work in Fort Wayne. To a modest
extent, COIT accomplishes that. Two, adding a different tax base into the picture, income as opposed to property, broadens and
distributes the total tax burden in a fairer manner. COIT accomplishes that as well.
The tax reform package also included an increase in the Homestead Property Tax Credit from 4% to 12% by 1992 and a flat
property tax rate through 1992. The COIT tax began on July 1, 1989 at a rate of .2% on hidiana adjusted gross income.
Because of fluctuations in the base upon which COIT is computed, revenue could vary more from year to year than does
property tax revenue.
COIT increased to .3% on July 1,1990, where it remained frozen until July 1,1992. In March of 1992, the Common Council
removed a self-imposed freeze on the COIT tax and allowed it to go to .4% effective July 1, 1992. The Common Council
increased COIT to .5% effective July 1, 1993 and to .6% effective July 1, 1994. The City receives revenues from the State of
hidiana on a delayed basis.
hi March of 1993, the Common Council enacted the Economic Development Income Tax (CEDIT) for Allen County at a level
of .2% effective July 1, 1993. Use of these funds is restricted to projects related to economic development, infrastructure
improvements, Parks and Safety capital expenditures or payment on bonds to fund any of these types of projects. In March of
1998, Common Council voted to increase the rate to .4% effective July 1, 1998.
