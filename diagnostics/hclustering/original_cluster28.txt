City-County leadership summit

****** McBarnes_convenes_first-ever_City-County_leadership_summit ******
    * Published on February 3, 2012
    * under Mayor_Updates, News

Mayor invites area officials to event focusing on enhancing communications.
Frankfort, IN – With communications as one of his four cornerstones of his
new administration, Mayor Chris McBarnes is hosting an inaugural Leadership
Summit, gathering more than 40 county and city government, school and community
leaders together on February 23.
     “For the past several years, our City and County governing bodies
     have not communicated with each other as we all would have liked. The
     Leadership Summit is an opportunity to improve our relationships,
     help us all become better acquainted and communicate more effectively
     with each other for the good of our groups and especially, for all of
     our constituents,” McBarnes said.
Those invited to the Summit include Clinton County Council; Commissioners;
Sheriff; Planner; Surveyor; Emergency Management Agency Director; Chamber
Executive Director; Community Foundation Vice President; area school
superintendents; City of Frankfort Clerk-Treasurer; Council; Board of Works;
presidents of the Plan Commission, Board of Zoning Appeals and Airport
Authority Board; Utility Service Board; City Attorney; Fire Chief; Police
Chief; Parks and Streets Superintendent, and Building Inspector.
To facilitate the event, McBarnes reached out to Butler University
Communications and Organizational Leadership Professor Paul Sandin who will
lead Summit participants through the three-hour event at the Frankfort
Community Schools Administration Building.
While the meeting is not open to the public, media are welcome to cover the
event. In keeping with his focus on the importance of communication, McBarnes
will share outcomes, including action items, following the Summit.
     “It’s particularly challenging to build relationships that foster
     effective communications when we don’t have opportunities to be in
     front of each other and create trust and familiarity. In each of our
     roles, we are obligated to do our individual and collective best to
     be clear, concise and consistent in our communication efforts.
     “This Leadership Summit is intended to help all of us do just that.
     My long-term goal is that effective and efficient communication comes
     to the forefront of all of our minds as we perform our duties for the
     individuals, families, businesses and groups we serve in Clinton
     County and Frankfort,” McBarnes explained.
For questions or interview requests, contact Mayor Chris McBarnes at 765-654-
7332.

Frankfort, IN – Responding at 5:54 p.m. Tuesday night to a confirmed
residential fire at 1545 North County Road 130 West, Frankfort firefighters had
the blaze under control by 6:22 p.m.
According to Deputy Chief Jeff Cline, all three stations responded to the
general alarm and upon arrival, Engine #3 reported the attached garage was
fully involved.
     “Some of our firefighters entered the home through the front door
     and pushed the fire out of the kitchen into the garage, knocking it
     down before it reached further into the house. We vented the fire out
     above the overhead garage door and had the entire situation under
     control within 20 minutes of receiving the call.
     “Unfortunately, a cat died in the blaze and the occupant of the
     home had minor burns to his hands and forehead. He refused medical
     treatment at the scene. None of our firefighters were injured,”
     Cline said.
While the fire started in the attached garage, the cause remains under
investigation.
According to Fire Chief John Kirby, with all three stations responding to the
alarm, six off duty firefighters were called into Fire Headquarters to cover
the community, should another call be received.
     “The ongoing safety and security of the entire City is our top
     priority. While a confirmed house fire requires the involvement of
     all three stations, we tap off duty personnel to ensure all of our
     citizens and their property remain protected.
     “I’m extremely pleased with the speed and effectiveness our fire
     crews demonstrated in controlling and extinguishing this fire, while
     minimizing damage to the rest of the residence,” Kirby said.

water support, with only one used due to the firefighters’ speed in
extinguishing the fire.

Storm Water Control: Implementing Construction Site
Best Management Practices (BMPs)
What is the Problem?


The leading cause of soil erosion and sediment runoff is from residential and commercial construction
sites.

Why is Soil Erosion and Sediment Runoff a Problem from Construction Sites?



Runoff from construction sites contains pollutants such as: sediment, pesticides, fertilizers, petroleum
products, construction chemicals, contaminated soils, paints, debris, and sanitary waste.
It’s required that contractors use specific erosion and sediment control measures during construction
(for sites 1 acre or greater in size) to minimize the amount of pollutants entering our waterways.

What is Mandated for Construction Sites 1 Acre or Greater in Size?


Implement a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) or Erosion and Sediment Control Plan
before construction starts.
o The plan should include soil stabilization measures, perimeter controls, onsite and offsite
material storage areas, appropriate housekeeping practices, and runoff treatment practices that
must be implemented and maintained before and during construction activities.



Implement a Post-Construction Plan – Runoff from areas of new development or redevelopment
significantly affects receiving waterways.
o Post-construction measures should comply with engineering plans, implement management
practices to prevent, reduce or treat storm water runoff, establish areas to collect and treat
storm water and incorporate vegetation methods.

Erosion and Pollution Controls
Perimeter Protection
Silt fence should be used to filter sediment and should be located downslope of
disturbed areas. It must be properly installed prior to grading.
Silt fence that has fallen or is damaged in any way must be replaced immediately.
Consider using qualified personnel to install your control measures.
Stabilized Construction Site Entrances
Minimize off site vehicle/equipment tracking of sediments onto publicly or
privately owned paved surfaces by installing a temporary stabilized construction
site entrance.
Stabilized construction site entrances shall be constructed before clearing and
grading begins.
Construction entrance(s) shall be inspected daily for evidence of off-site vehicle tracking of mud and dirt.
Any sediment that is tracked onto roads must be swept up immediately. Sediment shall not be removed by
washing/flushing with water.

Sediment Basins
Sediment basins shall be installed prior to clearing or grading.
If sediment basins need to be removed for clearing or grading, additional
traps/ponds/systems should be installed on site to accommodate storage capacity.
Catch Basin Inserts and Inlet Protection
Catch basin inserts and/or inlet protection should be used to prevent sediments from
entering the storm water system.
Catch basin inserts and/or inlet protection must be inspected regularly and cleaned
when sediment has covered the fabric or insert is full of sediment.
Temporary Stabilization of Disturbed Areas
Preserve existing vegetation when possible and stabilize any disturbed areas
where construction activity has temporary or permanently ceased.
There are several options to accomplish temporary stabilization including
vegetation, sod stabilization, mulching, geotextile fabric and others.
Ensure that the method used is effective. Stabilization is not the mere application of grass seed. Bare
areas must be maintained until vegetation has been established at 70% density.
Dust Control
Dust must be controlled on your construction site.
A water truck should only spray enough water to control the dust or reach the
optimum moisture content for soil compaction.
Water should never be applied in a manner that would cause runoff from the site
that may pollute waterways.
Disposing Waste Properly
You are responsible for all waste generated at your construction site. All waste must be
placed in a trash container at all times and kept covered to prevent storm water
exposure.
If waste is deposited or blown into a creek/river/stream or any other area outside the
site, it must be picked up immediately and disposed of properly.

Conducting Inspections


A qualified person is required to inspect the site for all erosion and sediment control measures at least
once a week and after each rainfall event of 0.5 inches or more. Inspections must be documented.



Not all erosion and control measures will work everywhere. You are responsible for cleaning and
replacing any measure as necessary.



The SWPPP must be modified based on the results of the inspections.

Contact the Area Planning Commission (765-825-9808) or the Construction Site Erosion Control
Hotline (765-825-2158) for questions or complaints.

****** Fourth_police/community_meeting_July_12 ******
    * Published on June 28, 2012
    * under Police_Department_Updates

Frankfort, IN – The fourth in a series of community meetings hosted by the
Frankfort Police Department is set for Thursday, July 12 from 6:00 – 8:00
p.m. at the Hope United Methodist Church, 300 East Clinton Street, for
residents living in the northeast section of the City (north of Clinton Street
and east of Main Street).
According to Police Chief Troy Bacon, this fourth meeting will have the same
focus as the first three gatherings the Department hosted for specific
quadrants of the community.
“Our focus continues to be on creating positive, open lines of communication
between Frankfort residents and our police officers. We look forward to our
July 12 meeting to talk with our neighbors in the northeast section of town and
hear their questions, ideas and issues.
“Throughout each of our community meetings, our overall goal is to build
trust and familiarity between residents and the police to provide the very best
public safety service possible for everyone in Frankfort. Citizens’
participation in these meetings continues to be the key in helping us reach
that goal,” Bacon said.
Because each area of any community has its own particular concerns and needs,
the community meetings address the four geographic areas of the City, with
three meetings held since March.
Once citizens’ feedback has been evaluated from all four meetings, Chief
Bacon will announce next steps the Police Department will undertake in its
continuing communications with community members.
For questions or interview requests, contact Chief Bacon at 654-4245.

****** North_Maish_Road_surface_removal_begins_June_11 ******
    * Published on June 11, 2012
    * under Mayor_Updates, News

Frankfort, IN – As progress continues on the North Maish Road project, Rieth-
Riley is beginning road surface removal (milling) today with crews beginning
construction of the actual road surface.
The public is encouraged to utilize the marked detour route. Drivers who must
use Maish Road are asked to use extreme caution and follow the flagmen’s
directions. The crews will greatly appreciate motorists reducing their vehicle
speed as the road surface could be unstable and normal vehicle breaking could
be compromised.
Previously set traffic flow still is in effect. Maish Road is open for
southbound traffic; however, traffic flow may be adjusted on a daily basis.
The road replacement project includes new sidewalks and railroad grade
crossing, as well as stormwater dispersal capabilities including curbs,
gutters, piping and inlets. Turn lanes will be addressed to help school traffic
movement. The project is scheduled for completion in September 2013.
Questions? Contact GAI Consultants Senior Technician Bud McQuade at 260-249-
1361 or leave a message in the local field office at 659-0608.
