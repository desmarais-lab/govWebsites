The base bid was what we have been describing as Phase I throughout
the project This was what we felt we needed to get started with some
good equipment for the park The Add Alternate was what we have been
as

Phase II

wanted for the

Phase I and Phase II

We would recommend

accepting the base bid from Service Supply
Limited
Ideally we would suggest that the add alternate
be accepted as well If you decide to go back and purchase the
additional equipment at a later date the price will likely be higher In
addition you will pay an additional shipping charge and an additional
installation charge on a separate order It is our opinion that it will be
more economical to purchase the equipment now rather than
purchasing it in the future Please advise us on how you would like us to
proceed
at a minimum

The undersigned Contractor, being duly sworn upon his/her/its oath,  affirms
under the penalties of perjury that:

   1. Contractor has not, nor has any other member, representative, or agent
      of the firm, company, corporation or partnership represented  by  him,
      entered into any combination, collusion or agreement with  any  person
      relative to the price to be bid by  anyone  at  such  letting  nor  to
      prevent any person from bidding nor to induce anyone to  refrain  from
      bidding, and that this bid is made without reference to any other  bid
      and without any agreement, understanding or combination with any other
      person in reference to such bidding. Contractor further says  that  no
      person or persons, firms, or corporation has,  have  or  will  receive
      directly or indirectly, any rebate, fee, gift, commission or thing  of
      value on account of such sale; and


   2. Contractor certifies by  submission  of  this  proposal  that  neither
      contractor  nor  any  of  its  principals  are   presently   debarred,
      suspended, proposed for debarment, declared ineligible, or voluntarily
      excluded  from  participation  in  this  transaction  by  any  Federal
      department or agency; and


   3. Contractor has not, nor has any successor to,  nor  an  affiliate  of,
      Contractor, engaged in investment activities in Iran.


           a.  For  purposes  of  this  Certification,  “Iran”  means   the
              government of Iran and any agency or instrumentality of Iran,
              or as otherwise  defined  at  Ind.  Code  §  5-22-16.5-5,  as
              amended from time-to-time.

           b. As provided by Ind. Code § 5-22-16.5-8, as amended from time-
              to-time, a Contractor is engaged in investment activities in
              Iran if either:

                 i. Contractor, its successor or its affiliate, provides
                    goods or services of twenty million dollars
                    ($20,000,000) or more in value in the energy sector of
                    Iran; or


                ii. Contractor, its successor or its affiliate, is a
                    financial institution that extends twenty million
                    dollars ($20,000,000) or more in credit to another
                    person for forty-five (45) days or more, if that person
                    will (i) use the credit to provides goods and services
                    in the energy sector in Iran; and (ii) at the time the
                    financial institution extends credit, is a person
                    identified on list published by the Indiana Department
                    of Administration.

   4. Contractor does not knowingly employ or contract with an  unauthorized
      alien, nor retain any employee or contract  with  a  person  that  the
      Contractor subsequently learns is an unauthorized  alien.   Contractor
      agrees that he/she/it shall enroll in and verify the work  eligibility
      status of all of Contractor’s newly hired  employees  through  the  E-
      Verify  Program  as   defined   by   I.C.   22-5-1.7-3.   Contractor’s
      documentation of enrollment and participation in the E-Verify  Program
      is included and attached as part of this bid/quote; and

   5. Contractor shall require his/her/its  subcontractors  performing  work
      under this public contract to certify that the subcontractors  do  not
      knowingly employ or contract with an unauthorized  alien,  nor  retain
      any  employee  or  contract  with  a  person  that  the  subcontractor
      subsequently  learns  is  an  unauthorized   alien,   and   that   the
      subcontractor has enrolled in and is  participating  in  the  E-Verify
      Program.  The  Contractor  agrees  to  maintain   this   certification
      throughout the term of the contract with the City of South  Bend,  and
      understands that the City may terminate the contract  for  default  if
      the Contractor fails to cure a breach of this provision no later  than
      thirty (30) days after being notified by the City.

   6. Persons, partnerships, corporations, associations, or joint  venturers
      awarded a contract by the City of South  Bend  through  its  agencies,
      boards, or commissions shall not discriminate against any employee  or
      applicant for employment in the performance of a  City  contract  with
      respect  to  hire,  tenure,  terms,  conditions,  or   privileges   of
      employment, or any matter directly or indirectly related to employment
      because of race, sex, religion, color, national origin, ancestry, age,
      gender expression, gender identity, sexual orientation  or  disability
      that does not affect that person's ability to perform the work.

      In awarding contracts for  the  purchase  of  work,  labor,  services,
      supplies, equipment, materials, or any combination  of  the  foregoing
      including, but not limited to, public works  contracts  awarded  under
      public bidding laws or other contracts in which public  bids  are  not
      required by law, the City, its agencies, boards,  or  commissions  may
      consider the Contractor’s good faith efforts to  obtain  participation
      by those Contractors certified by the State of Indiana as  a  Minority
      Business (“MBE”) or as a Women’s Business  Enterprise  (“WBE”)   as  a
      factor in determining the lowest, responsible, responsive bidder.

     1. BID FORMS AND EXECUTION
     A. Bidders are expected to examine the Drawings, Specifications,

        information required.

     C. The Bidder shall sign the Proposal in the following manner: If the
        Proposal is made by an individual, his/her name and post office
        address must be shown.  If made by a partnership or joint venture,
        the name and post office address of each member of the partnership
        or joint venture must be shown.  If made by a corporation, the

        Supplies.”

     B. When samples are required, such samples shall be delivered or

        Invitation to Bid.  Samples must be shipped separately from bid
        documents and labeled clearly with the Bidder’s name, address and
        the commodity or equipment classifications and documents, the item
        (and item number, if any), and Material Safety Data Sheets (if
        applicable).  All samples must be representative of the commodities
        or equipment which will be supplied by the successful Bidder.  All
        samples will become the property of the City of South Bend and none
        will be returned, unless otherwise stated in the Specifications.

     C. In the event of an inconsistency between provisions of the contract
        documents, the inconsistency shall be resolved by giving precedence

           Clerk of the Board of Public Works

           227 West Jefferson Boulevard
           South Bend, Indiana 46601

        returned unopened.

     C. Bids will be opened and read publicly at the time and place
        designated in the Notice to Bidders.  Bidders, their authorized

        item for which the bid is being submitted. Bidders may submit
        separate bid bonds for each item being bid upon OR may submit one
        (1) bid bond equal to 10% of the combined total of all bids
        submitted.

        should such bid not conform to these requirements as listed herein
        or if a bid cannot be delivered in a manner consistent with the
        needs of the City.



     5. ADDENDA – NO VERBAL INTERPRETATIONS
     A. No inquiries by Bidders relative to interpretation of Plans,
        Specifications, Special Provisions, or other Bidding Documents will
        be answered verbally.  If any prospective Bidder is unable or
        unwilling to comply with one or more requirements of the bidding
        document, such Bidder should so inform the Board of Public Works in
        writing.  Upon receipt of such information, consideration will be
        given to the advisability of issuing an Addendum which would
        thereupon become applicable to all Bidders.  Any such inquiry must
        be submitted at least seven (7) days prior to the bid opening date
        in order to give the Board sufficient time to consider any
        necessary Addendum.  All answers to such inquiries, in the form of
        Addenda, will be furnished to all prospective Bidders who have
        registered with the City.  All Bidders are required to acknowledge
        receipt of any Addenda by inserting the Addendum number and the
        issuing date on executed Proposals.

     6. REJECTION OF PROPOSALS CONTAINING ALTERATION, ERASURES, INCOMPLETE
        BIDS AND ETC.

        additions not called for, conditional or alternate bids (except
        when and insofar as are invited), incomplete bids, erasures or
        irregularities of any kinds.

     B. All blank spaces for bid prices must be filled in, in ink, with the
        unit price and total price for each item (This does not apply to
        divisible bids).  In case of incorrect totaling of amounts and
        where the unit price and the extension thereof do not agree, the
        unit price for each item shall govern, and the City is authorized
        to correct all erroneous extension and totals for the purpose of
        comparing bids.

     7. TRADE DISCOUNTS
     A. Trade discounts shall not be shown separately, but shall be
        incorporated in the Bidder’s unit price, unless otherwise
        specified.

     8. VEHICLE BIDS
     A. Bidders may bid on one (1) or more vehicles, provided however, that

        submitted. Bidders may submit separate bid bonds for each vehicle
        being bid upon OR may submit one (1) bid bond equal to 10% of the
        combined total of all vehicle bids submitted.

     B. If an Option is included within these specifications, please be
        advised that, optional items placed in the specifications are to
        determine the best configuration of the item within a budgeted
        amount and may be included in the award criteria.     If the Board
        elects to award one or more option(s), the base bid price and the
        option bid price(s) will be totaled and compared for all bidders
        offering the final configuration.   Award will be made based on the
        lowest responsible/responsive bid prices submitted for the base bid
        with the selected option(s), if applicable. Failure to submit a bid
        on an option may result in the entire bid being non-responsive,
        depending on the final configuration of the product.


     9. The Board may reject any bid that does not conform to these
        requirements as non-responsive.

    10. TAX EXEMPTIONS

        written request to withdraw a bid is received by the Board of
        Public Works prior to the date and hour for receiving and opening
        bids.  In such cases, the same will be returned to Bidder unopened.

    12. ESCALATOR OR CONTINGENT CLAUSES
     A. The use of escalator clauses or other contingent clauses by the
        Bidder is prohibited, unless requested or permitted by the
        Invitation to Bid.  No Proposal shall contain nor be accompanied by
        any writing purporting to limit or qualify the City’s right to
        accept such Proposal or purporting to alter such Proposal or any
        Contract which may be executed pursuant thereto.

    13. PRICES MUST BE DELIVERED PRICES

        errors.

    15. SPLITTING OF AWARDS/DIVISIBLE BIDS
     A. Bids will be awarded on the basis of the total dollar amount for
        all items in the Proposal unless the bid is described by the City

        lowest responsible and responsive Bidder for each item or class of
        items as indicated in the bid documents.

    16. BIDDER QUALIFICATION
     A. The City may require any Bidder to submit evidence of
        qualifications, and may consider any evidence of the financial,
        technical, and other qualifications and abilities of the Bidder.
        The City will not award a Contract to a Bidder who, in its opinion,
        is not fully qualified on the basis of financial resources and
        responsibility, possession of adequate equipment, personnel,
        experience, and past record of performance to perform the
        obligations to be undertaken competently and without delay.

    17. PURCHASE ORDERS

        shown and all sub-contractors must be identified.

    20. PACKAGING
     A. All items shall be delivered strongly packed and marked according
        to accepted commercial practice unless otherwise directed in the
        Specifications.  No charge shall be made for containers and the
        City shall have no obligation to return containers unless otherwise
        provided by the Specifications or Special Provisions.  Any items
        not received in good condition will be rejected.

    21. INSPECTION OF GOODS
     A. The City of South Bend reserves the right to inspect and have any
        goods tested after delivery for compliance with the specifications.
         Notice of latent defects, which would make the item unfit for the
        purposes for which they are required, may be given at any time
        within one year after discovery of the defects.

     B. All items rejected must be removed immediately by the Contractor at
        the expense of the Contractor.  If the Contractor fails or refuses
        to remove the rejected items, they may be sold by the City of South
        Bend.

     C. In some cases, at the discretion of the City, inspection of the
        commodities or equipment will be made at the factory, plant, or
        other establishment where they are produced before shipment.

     D. The above provision shall not be construed in limitations of any
        rights the City may have under any laws including the Uniform
        Commercial Code.

    22. ASSIGNMENTS
     A. No person to whom a Contract has been awarded may assign his
        interest in the Contract without the consent, in writing, of the
        City.

    23. CANCELLATION
     A. The City of South Bend reserves the right to cancel any Contract
        for failure or refusal of performance, fraud, deceit,
        misrepresentation, collusion, conspiracy, or any other misconduct
        on the part of the Contractor.

    24. DEDUCTION OF DAMAGES
     A. If the City cancels the contract for any cause, it shall deduct
        from whatever is owed the Contractor on the Contract or any other
        Contract, any amount sufficient to compensate the City for any
        damages suffered by it because of the Contractor’s wrongdoing.

    25. METHOD OF INVOICING FOR PAYMENT
     A. Contractor shall bill the City of South Bend

        1. On regular invoice form giving a complete and detailed
           description of the goods delivered, including purchase order
           number.

        2. If the Contractor allows a discount, the period of time in which
           the City must make payment to qualify for the discounts shall be
           computed from the date the City received the invoice (completely
           filled out), or the date the goods are delivered and accepted,
           whichever may be later, and shall not be less than twenty (20)
           days.

        3. If more than one shipment is made under the Contract and on the

     A. The goods which are the subject of the Contract shall remain
        property of the Contractor until delivered to and accepted by the
        City of South Bend.

    27. ESTIMATED QUANTITIES
     A. If the quantity set forth in the Notice to Bidders and Proposal is
        approximate and represents the estimated requirements of the City
        for a specified period of time, the unit price and the extended
        total price thereof shall be used only as a basis for the
        evaluation of bids.  The actual quantities necessary may be more or

The undersigned Contractor, being duly sworn upon his/her/its oath,  affirms
under the penalties of perjury that:

   1. Contractor has not, nor has any other member, representative, or agent
      of the firm, company, corporation or partnership represented  by  him,
      entered into any combination, collusion or agreement with  any  person
      relative to the price to be bid by  anyone  at  such  letting  nor  to
      prevent any person from bidding nor to induce anyone to  refrain  from
      bidding, and that this bid is made without reference to any other  bid
      and without any agreement, understanding or combination with any other
      person in reference to such bidding. Contractor further says  that  no
      person or persons, firms, or corporation has,  have  or  will  receive
      directly or indirectly, any rebate, fee, gift, commission or thing  of
      value on account of such sale; and


   2. Contractor certifies by  submission  of  this  proposal  that  neither
      contractor  nor  any  of  its  principals  are   presently   debarred,
      suspended, proposed for debarment, declared ineligible, or voluntarily
      excluded  from  participation  in  this  transaction  by  any  Federal
      department or agency; and


   3. Contractor has not, nor has any successor to,  nor  an  affiliate  of,
      Contractor, engaged in investment activities in Iran.


           a.  For  purposes  of  this  Certification,  “Iran”  means   the
              government of Iran and any agency or instrumentality of Iran,
              or as otherwise  defined  at  Ind.  Code  §  5-22-16.5-5,  as
              amended from time-to-time.

           b. As provided by Ind. Code § 5-22-16.5-8, as amended from time-
              to-time, a Contractor is engaged in investment activities in
              Iran if either:

                 i. Contractor, its successor or its affiliate, provides
                    goods or services of twenty million dollars
                    ($20,000,000) or more in value in the energy sector of
                    Iran; or


                ii. Contractor, its successor or its affiliate, is a
                    financial institution that extends twenty million
                    dollars ($20,000,000) or more in credit to another
                    person for forty-five (45) days or more, if that person
                    will (i) use the credit to provides goods and services
                    in the energy sector in Iran; and (ii) at the time the
                    financial institution extends credit, is a person
                    identified on list published by the Indiana Department
                    of Administration.

   4. Contractor does not knowingly employ or contract with an  unauthorized
      alien, nor retain any employee or contract  with  a  person  that  the
      Contractor subsequently learns is an unauthorized  alien.   Contractor
      agrees that he/she/it shall enroll in and verify the work  eligibility
      status of all of Contractor’s newly hired  employees  through  the  E-
      Verify  Program  as   defined   by   I.C.   22-5-1.7-3.   Contractor’s
      documentation of enrollment and participation in the E-Verify  Program
      is included and attached as part of this bid/quote; and

   5. Contractor shall require his/her/its  subcontractors  performing  work
      under this public contract to certify that the subcontractors  do  not
      knowingly employ or contract with an unauthorized  alien,  nor  retain
      any  employee  or  contract  with  a  person  that  the  subcontractor
      subsequently  learns  is  an  unauthorized   alien,   and   that   the
      subcontractor has enrolled in and is  participating  in  the  E-Verify
      Program.  The  Contractor  agrees  to  maintain   this   certification
      throughout the term of the contract with the City of South  Bend,  and
      understands that the City may terminate the contract  for  default  if
      the Contractor fails to cure a breach of this provision no later  than
      thirty (30) days after being notified by the City.

   6. Persons, partnerships, corporations, associations, or joint  venturers
      awarded a contract by the City of South  Bend  through  its  agencies,
      boards, or commissions shall not discriminate against any employee  or
      applicant for employment in the performance of a  City  contract  with
      respect  to  hire,  tenure,  terms,  conditions,  or   privileges   of
      employment, or any matter directly or indirectly related to employment
      because of race, sex, religion, color, national origin, ancestry, age,
      gender expression, gender identity, sexual orientation  or  disability
      that does not affect that person's ability to perform the work.

      In awarding contracts for  the  purchase  of  work,  labor,  services,
      supplies, equipment, materials, or any combination  of  the  foregoing
      including, but not limited to, public works  contracts  awarded  under
      public bidding laws or other contracts in which public  bids  are  not
      required by law, the City, its agencies, boards,  or  commissions  may
      consider the Contractor’s good faith efforts to  obtain  participation
      by those Contractors certified by the State of Indiana as  a  Minority
      Business (“MBE”) or as a Women’s Business  Enterprise  (“WBE”)   as  a
      factor in determining the lowest, responsible, responsive bidder.


      In no event shall persons or entities seeking  the  award  of  a  City
      contract be required to award a subcontract to an MBE/WBE; however, it
      may not unlawfully discriminate against said WBE/MBE. A finding  of  a
      discriminatory practice by the City’s MBE/WBE Utilization Board  shall
      prohibit that person or entity from being awarded a City contract  for
      a period of one (1) year from the date of such determination, and such
      determination may also be grounds  for  terminating  the  contact  for
      which the discriminatory practice or noncompliance pertains.


      7.     The  undersigned   contractor   agrees   that   the   following
      nondiscrimination commitment shall be made  a  part  of  any  contract
      which it may henceforth enter  into  with  the  City  of  South  Bend,
      Indiana or any of its agencies, boards or commissions.


      Contractor agrees  not  to  discriminate  against  or  intimidate  any
      employee or applicant  for  employment  in  the  performance  of  this
      contract with privileges of employment,  or  any  matter  directly  or
      indirectly related to employment, because of  race,  religion,  color,
      sex, gender expression, gender identity, sexual orientation, handicap,
      national origin or ancestry.  Breach of this provision may be regarded
      as material breach of contract.


      I, the undersigned bidder or agent as contractor  on  a  public  works
      project, understand my statutory  obligations  to  the  use  of  steel
      products or foundry products made in the United States  (I.C.  5-16-8-
      1). I hereby certify that I and all subcontractors employed by me  for
      this project will use steel  products  or  foundry  products  on  this
      project if awarded.  I understand that violations hereunder may result
      in forfeiture of contractual payments.
                                     ***





I  hereby  affirm  under  the  penalties  of  perjury  that  the  facts  and
information contained in the foregoing bid for public  works  are  true  and
correct.

        Proposal is made by an individual, his/her name and post office
        address must be shown.  If made by a partnership or joint venture,

        or joint venture must be shown.  If made by a corporation, the

        (and item number, if any), and Material Safety Data Sheets (if
        applicable).  All samples must be representative of the commodities
        or equipment which will be supplied by the successful Bidder.  All
        samples will become the property of the City of South Bend and none
        will be returned, unless otherwise stated in the Specifications.

     C. In the event of an inconsistency between provisions of the contract

        needs of the City.



     5. ADDENDA – NO VERBAL INTERPRETATIONS
     A. No inquiries by Bidders relative to interpretation of Plans,
        Specifications, Special Provisions, or other Bidding Documents will
        be answered verbally.  If any prospective Bidder is unable or
        unwilling to comply with one or more requirements of the bidding
        document, such Bidder should so inform the Board of Public Works in
        writing.  Upon receipt of such information, consideration will be
        given to the advisability of issuing an Addendum which would
        thereupon become applicable to all Bidders.  Any such inquiry must
        be submitted at least seven (7) days prior to the bid opening date
        in order to give the Board sufficient time to consider any
        necessary Addendum.  All answers to such inquiries, in the form of
        Addenda, will be furnished to all prospective Bidders who have
        registered with the City.  All Bidders are required to acknowledge
        receipt of any Addenda by inserting the Addendum number and the
        issuing date on executed Proposals.

     6. REJECTION OF PROPOSALS CONTAINING ALTERATION, ERASURES, INCOMPLETE
        BIDS AND ETC.

        additions not called for, conditional or alternate bids (except
        when and insofar as are invited), incomplete bids, erasures or
        irregularities of any kinds.

     B. All blank spaces for bid prices must be filled in, in ink, with the
        unit price and total price for each item (This does not apply to
        divisible bids).  In case of incorrect totaling of amounts and
        where the unit price and the extension thereof do not agree, the
        unit price for each item shall govern, and the City is authorized
        to correct all erroneous extension and totals for the purpose of
        comparing bids.

     7. TRADE DISCOUNTS
     A. Trade discounts shall not be shown separately, but shall be
        incorporated in the Bidder’s unit price, unless otherwise
        specified.

     8. VEHICLE BIDS
     A. Bidders may bid on one (1) or more vehicles, provided however, that

        Bidders may bid on one (1) or more vehicles, provided however, that
        the bid submitted for each vehicle is delivered in a separate,
        sealed envelope, by vehicle, with the envelope clearly labeled on
        the outside as to the specific vehicle for which the bid is being
        submitted. Bidders may submit separate bid bonds for each vehicle
        being bid upon OR may submit one (1) bid bond equal to 10% of the
        combined total of all vehicle bids submitted.

     B. If an Option is included within these specifications, please be
        advised that, optional items placed in the specifications are to
        determine the best configuration of the item within a budgeted
        amount and may be included in the award criteria.     If the Board
        elects to award one or more option(s), the base bid price and the
        option bid price(s) will be totaled and compared for all bidders
        offering the final configuration.   Award will be made based on the
        lowest responsible/responsive bid prices submitted for the base bid
        with the selected option(s), if applicable. Failure to submit a bid
        on an option may result in the entire bid being non-responsive,
        depending on the final configuration of the product.


     9. The Board may reject any bid that does not conform to these
        requirements as non-responsive.

    10. TAX EXEMPTIONS

        written request to withdraw a bid is received by the Board of
        Public Works prior to the date and hour for receiving and opening
        bids.  In such cases, the same will be returned to Bidder unopened.

    12. ESCALATOR OR CONTINGENT CLAUSES
     A. The use of escalator clauses or other contingent clauses by the
        Bidder is prohibited, unless requested or permitted by the
        Invitation to Bid.  No Proposal shall contain nor be accompanied by
        any writing purporting to limit or qualify the City’s right to
        accept such Proposal or purporting to alter such Proposal or any
        Contract which may be executed pursuant thereto.

    13. PRICES MUST BE DELIVERED PRICES

        errors.

    15. SPLITTING OF AWARDS/DIVISIBLE BIDS
     A. Bids will be awarded on the basis of the total dollar amount for
        all items in the Proposal unless the bid is described by the City

        lowest responsible and responsive Bidder for each item or class of
        items as indicated in the bid documents.

    16. BIDDER QUALIFICATION
     A. The City may require any Bidder to submit evidence of
        qualifications, and may consider any evidence of the financial,
        technical, and other qualifications and abilities of the Bidder.
        The City will not award a Contract to a Bidder who, in its opinion,
        is not fully qualified on the basis of financial resources and
        responsibility, possession of adequate equipment, personnel,
        experience, and past record of performance to perform the
        obligations to be undertaken competently and without delay.

    17. PURCHASE ORDERS

     A. The City of South Bend reserves the right to inspect and have any
        goods tested after delivery for compliance with the specifications.
         Notice of latent defects, which would make the item unfit for the
        purposes for which they are required, may be given at any time
        within one year after discovery of the defects.

     B. All items rejected must be removed immediately by the Contractor at
        the expense of the Contractor.  If the Contractor fails or refuses
        to remove the rejected items, they may be sold by the City of South
        Bend.

        commodities or equipment will be made at the factory, plant, or
        other establishment where they are produced before shipment.

     D. The above provision shall not be construed in limitations of any
        rights the City may have under any laws including the Uniform
        Commercial Code.

    22. ASSIGNMENTS

BID NAME
FOR BIDS DUE

2016 Contract for the Trucking of Belt Pressed Biosolids for Land
Application
March 8, 2016

Pursuant to notices given, the undersigned offers bid(s) to the City of South Bend in accordance
with the following attachment(s) which specify the class or item number or description, quantity,
unit, unit price.
I.

GENERAL CONDITIONS
It is the City of South Bend intent of these specifications to describe a request for bids
for trucking and hauling services required by the City of South Bend. Between one (1)
and ten (10) trucks shall be required per day at various dates throughout the 2016
calendar year. The trucks and drivers supplied by the bidder will be used to haul belt
pressed, wastewater biosolids from the City’s Organic Resources Facility, 4340 Trade
Drive, South Bend, Indiana 46628 to various sites within a twenty (20) mile radius of the
Organic Resources Facility.
Since the trucking will take place as field and crop conditions become ready, it is
impossible to anticipate the exact dates when the trucking services will be required. The
number of trucks contracted per day will vary based upon the amount of hauling
required. This determination will be made by the Superintendent of the Organic
Resources Facility.
The wastewater biosolids to be transported have between twelve (12) percent and forty
(40) percent solids content. All trucks will be loaded by an employee of the Organic
Resources Facility. The trucks will be required to travel to a specific location (to be
determined) and unload the biosolids in a designated area. Each driver will be supplied
with paperwork and instructions that will need to be filled out accordingly for proper
record of delivery.

II.

TRUCK / VEHICLE REQUIREMENTS
The trucks shall have a minimum load capacity of fifteen (15) cubic yards each. Tri-axle
or Quad-axle vehicles are the preferred type of trucks for this contract. It shall be the
contractor’s responsibility to prevent any spillage of biosolids due to tailgate failure. Two
(2) mechanical locking devices, standard and mechanical, shall be used as a safety
measure. Trucks shall be equipped with a tarpaulin to cover the bed of the truck. Each
truck shall cover its truck bed with the tarpaulin prior to leaving the Organic Resource
Facility. It shall also be the contractor’s responsibility to shovel off tailgate aprons, if
needed, and to keep the truck tires reasonably clean to prevent spillage on road
surfaces. The successful bidder will be required to have all transport vehicles inspected
by the City of South Bend Organic Resources Superintendent at the Organic Resources
Facility and schedule an appointment to have their fleet inspected prior to work.
Vehicles that do not meet the minimum requirements for biosolids transport may not be
used. The City of South Bend may terminate a contract if the successful bidder fails to
provide adequate transportation equipment.

All drivers, fuel, supplies, and maintenance of the vehicle related to the hauling shall be
provided by the contractor and the costs of these items shall be incorporated into the bid
price. Fuel surcharges will not be accepted.
Eight (8) trucks are normally used per day for hauling biosolids. Occasionally, fewer
trucks may be contracted for shorter hauls and more for longer hauls.
III.

TRUCKING / HAULING PERIODS
It shall be the responsibility of the Superintendent of the Organic Resources Facility to
determine the schedule and duration for land application activities.
Normal working hours for hauling will be from 6:00 A.M. to 6:00 P.M. Local Time.
A minimum of twelve (12) hours advance notice will be given by the Superintendent of
the Organic Resources Facility to the successful bidder each time that hauling is
required.
The number of days per month hauling takes place will be dependent on field conditions,
weather, and customer demand for the City’s biosolids product.
The Superintendent of the Organic Resources Facility will notify the successful bidder of
all schedule changes. Should inclement weather become a factor prior to the start of
land application activities or during land application activities, the Superintendent shall
be responsible for notifying the Contractor of any changes in schedule due to weather.
Inclement weather and changing field conditions may factor into the number of hours
worked per truck on a given day. The City desires to maintain a continuous land
application operation when weather and field conditions are favorable to place biosolids.

IV.

BASIS FOR BIDDING
All bids shall be stated on a “per hour, per truck” basis for work performed Mondays
through Sundays. Trip time originates and ends at the Organic Resources Facility.
Please include bid price on the Bid Form.
This bid is a unit price bid and bids shall be evaluated on the basis of lowest, responsive,
responsible bidder.

V.

BID BOND REQUIREMENT
All bidders shall provide a Bid Bond or Certified Check in the amount of $5,000.00 with
the submission of their unit price bid. A refund of the bid security will be issued upon
satisfaction of Bid Award.

VI.

SUBCONTRACTORS
Subcontractors may not be utilized on the project without prior approval from the City
Purchasing and Public Works Departments. If the bidder intends to use subcontractors
to assist with hauling biosolids, the bidder shall supply a list of subcontractor trucking
companies that it plans to employ. Use of disadvantaged business enterprises, such as
minority business enterprise (MBE) or women’s business enterprise (WBE) is
encouraged.

If the City approves the use of subcontractors, sufficient proof of insurance shall be
submitted by all subcontractors. Truck inspections shall be required, as noted above,
prior to beginning work. Refer to other sections in the Specifications for insurance
requirements.
VII.

TRUCK DELIVERY RECORDS
The Contractor shall provide truck delivery trip tickets each day for each truck. The
tickets shall be used to record hours worked and the number of loads hauled by each
truck. The trip tickets shall be signed at the end of each day by the driver of the truck
and the Superintendent of the Organic Resources Facility or an authorized
representative of the Organic Resources Facility. Since record keeping is required, it is
imperative that accurate and correct records are recorded every day that land
application activities occur.

VIII.

BILLING PROCEDURES
The Contractor shall send all invoices to the Superintendent of the Organic Resources
Facility at 4340 Trade Drive, South Bend, Indiana 46628 at the end of each month in
which land application activities occur. The Superintendent shall review the pay
application for completeness and forward information to the City Purchasing Department
for processing payment. The Contractor shall submit a copy of all Truck Delivery
Records from the month of hauling with the pay application for City records.

project.
It shall be the Contractor’s responsibility for any damage to public or private property
caused by accidental spillage of the biosolids after the biosolids have been deposited
into the Contractor’s trucks.
The award of the contract pursuant to these specifications is subject to the Contractor’s
agreement to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the City of South Bend, its agents,
officers, and employees from any and all claims and suits, including court costs, attorney
fees, and other expenses, arising from or out of the performance of this contract by the
Contractor.

materials as mentioned in Article II. Truck / Vehicle Requirements. The Contractor or

from the Contractor, Subcontractors, or its agents.

XI.

MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS
The City of South Bend, upon recommendation by the Director of Utilities or the City’s
designated Project Representative, reserves the right to terminate the contract in the
event of non-compliance or unsatisfactory performance of the Contractor.
Neither Party shall be liable to the other Party for breach or for failure or delay in the
performance of its obligations hereunder caused by any act or occurrence beyond its
reasonable control, including, but not limited to: fires; floods; strikes (except any strikes
involving a Party’s personnel); a change in Federal, State, or local law or ordinance;
orders or judgments of any Federal, State, or local court, administrative agency or

amounts of precipitation, unusual extremes of temperature or wind, unusually extended
periods of adverse weather conditions; acts of war, aggression or terrorism (foreign or
domestic); equipment failure (other than due to inadequate maintenance thereof); and
acts of God.
It is specifically understood that, without limitation, none of the following acts, events or
circumstances shall constitute an act or occurrence beyond a Party’s reasonable control:
(i) reasonably anticipated weather conditions normal for the region in which the work is
performed or (ii) any failure to pay any sums in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. Whenever the provisions of this Section are believed to apply, the Party
relying thereon shall give prompt notice to the other Party of the circumstances, the
basis for applicability of this Section and the time required to cure such breach or delay.

the circumstances.

                       ) SS:
             COUNTY    )

The undersigned Contractor, being duly sworn upon his/her/its oath,  affirms
under the penalties of perjury that:

   1. Contractor has not, nor has any other member, representative, or agent
      of the firm, company, corporation or partnership represented  by  him,
      entered into any combination, collusion or agreement with  any  person
      relative to the price to be bid by  anyone  at  such  letting  nor  to
      prevent any person from bidding nor to induce anyone to  refrain  from
      bidding, and that this bid is made without reference to any other  bid
      and without any agreement, understanding or combination with any other
      person in reference to such bidding. Contractor further says  that  no
      person or persons, firms, or corporation has,  have  or  will  receive
      directly or indirectly, any rebate, fee, gift, commission or thing  of
      value on account of such sale; and


   2. Contractor certifies by  submission  of  this  proposal  that  neither
      contractor  nor  any  of  its  principals  are   presently   debarred,
      suspended, proposed for debarment, declared ineligible, or voluntarily
      excluded  from  participation  in  this  transaction  by  any  Federal
      department or agency; and


   3. Contractor has not, nor has any successor to,  nor  an  affiliate  of,
      Contractor, engaged in investment activities in Iran.


           a.  For  purposes  of  this  Certification,  “Iran”  means   the
              government of Iran and any agency or instrumentality of Iran,
              or as otherwise  defined  at  Ind.  Code  §  5-22-16.5-5,  as
              amended from time-to-time.

           b. As provided by Ind. Code § 5-22-16.5-8, as amended from time-
              to-time, a Contractor is engaged in investment activities in
              Iran if either:

                 i. Contractor, its successor or its affiliate, provides
                    goods or services of twenty million dollars
                    ($20,000,000) or more in value in the energy sector of
                    Iran; or


                ii. Contractor, its successor or its affiliate, is a
                    financial institution that extends twenty million
                    dollars ($20,000,000) or more in credit to another
                    person for forty-five (45) days or more, if that person
                    will (i) use the credit to provides goods and services
                    in the energy sector in Iran; and (ii) at the time the
                    financial institution extends credit, is a person
                    identified on list published by the Indiana Department
                    of Administration.

   4. Contractor does not knowingly employ or contract with an  unauthorized
      alien, nor retain any employee or contract  with  a  person  that  the
      Contractor subsequently learns is an unauthorized  alien.   Contractor
      agrees that he/she/it shall enroll in and verify the work  eligibility
      status of all of Contractor’s newly hired  employees  through  the  E-
      Verify  Program  as   defined   by   I.C.   22-5-1.7-3.   Contractor’s
      documentation of enrollment and participation in the E-Verify  Program
      is included and attached as part of this bid/quote; and

   5. Contractor shall require his/her/its  subcontractors  performing  work
      under this public contract to certify that the subcontractors  do  not
      knowingly employ or contract with an unauthorized  alien,  nor  retain
      any  employee  or  contract  with  a  person  that  the  subcontractor
      subsequently  learns  is  an  unauthorized   alien,   and   that   the
      subcontractor has enrolled in and is  participating  in  the  E-Verify
      Program.  The  Contractor  agrees  to  maintain   this   certification
      throughout the term of the contract with the City of South  Bend,  and
      understands that the City may terminate the contract  for  default  if
      the Contractor fails to cure a breach of this provision no later  than
      thirty (30) days after being notified by the City.

   6. Persons, partnerships, corporations, associations, or joint  venturers
      awarded a contract by the City of South  Bend  through  its  agencies,
      boards, or commissions shall not discriminate against any employee  or
      applicant for employment in the performance of a  City  contract  with
      respect  to  hire,  tenure,  terms,  conditions,  or   privileges   of
      employment, or any matter directly or indirectly related to employment
      because of race, sex, religion, color, national origin, ancestry, age,
      gender expression, gender identity, sexual orientation  or  disability
      that does not affect that person's ability to perform the work.

      In awarding contracts for  the  purchase  of  work,  labor,  services,
      supplies, equipment, materials, or any combination  of  the  foregoing
      including, but not limited to, public works  contracts  awarded  under
      public bidding laws or other contracts in which public  bids  are  not
      required by law, the City, its agencies, boards,  or  commissions  may
      consider the Contractor’s good faith efforts to  obtain  participation
      by those Contractors certified by the State of Indiana as  a  Minority
      Business (“MBE”) or as a Women’s Business  Enterprise  (“WBE”)   as  a
      factor in determining the lowest, responsible, responsive bidder.


      In no event shall persons or entities seeking  the  award  of  a  City
      contract be required to award a subcontract to an MBE/WBE; however, it
      may not unlawfully discriminate against said WBE/MBE. A finding  of  a
      discriminatory practice by the City’s MBE/WBE Utilization Board  shall
      prohibit that person or entity from being awarded a City contract  for
      a period of one (1) year from the date of such determination, and such
      determination may also be grounds  for  terminating  the  contact  for
      which the discriminatory practice or noncompliance pertains.


      7.     The  undersigned   contractor   agrees   that   the   following
      nondiscrimination commitment shall be made  a  part  of  any  contract
      which it may henceforth enter  into  with  the  City  of  South  Bend,
      Indiana or any of its agencies, boards or commissions.


      Contractor agrees  not  to  discriminate  against  or  intimidate  any
      employee or applicant  for  employment  in  the  performance  of  this
      contract with privileges of employment,  or  any  matter  directly  or
      indirectly related to employment, because of  race,  religion,  color,
      sex, gender expression, gender identity, sexual orientation, handicap,
      national origin or ancestry.  Breach of this provision may be regarded
      as material breach of contract.


      I, the undersigned bidder or agent as contractor  on  a  public  works
      project, understand my statutory  obligations  to  the  use  of  steel
      products or foundry products made in the United States  (I.C.  5-16-8-
      1). I hereby certify that I and all subcontractors employed by me  for
      this project will use steel  products  or  foundry  products  on  this
      project if awarded.  I understand that violations hereunder may result
      in forfeiture of contractual payments.
                                     ***



I  hereby  affirm  under  the  penalties  of  perjury  that  the  facts  and
information contained in the foregoing bid for public  works  are  true  and
correct.
