Narratives
Summary of Distribution and Uses of NSP Funds:
Project 1 - Acquisition/Rehabilitation - $1,357,893.99
Dollar Housing Program - Eligible Use B: Acquisition and Rehabilitation (LMMH) - Budget $0 - Activity cancelled
Acquisition and Rehabilitation - Eligible Use B: Acquisition and Rehabilitation (LMMH, 25% Setaside) - Budget $1,357,893.99 - Many of the
abandoned or foreclosed properties in University Park are in good condition and can be renovated and marketed to new homeowners at or
below 50% of AMI as a parallel effort with the dollar house initiative. This additional investment will encourage current property owners to
improve their homes and it will attract other stable families to buy in the neighborhood. Just like the dollar houses, the properties will be
selected based on the quality of location, construction features, other renovation nearby, and marketability of each house. These properties
will be fully upgraded to the same standards as the recently renovated NSP houses elsewhere in Gary. Under this program, either the City or
a single developer will be responsible to fully renovate and sell those houses designated for households at or below 50% of median. Based
on past experience, this is sufficient to fund the rehab and sale of up to ten to twelve houses of the type common to the western part of
University Park. An initial survey of the area has identified many small houses that should be high priority for rehab and sale instead of
demolition. It is expected that the houses will be renovated and sold in phases that will begin as the dollar house effort starts and will continue
into 2013 and beyond.
Project 2 - Demolition - Eligible Use D: Demolition (LMMA) - Budget $1,115,357.70 - The City of Gary received approval on January 22, 2013
of its request for a waiver from the Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Department of H.U.D. to increase the allocation of demolition funding from
ten percent (10%) of the grant to up to fifty-three (53%) of the grant to address the higher than usual amounts of abandonment in a few blocks
of the east and west sides of the University Park footprint and to address the demolition of the former Sheraton Hotel and parking garage.
There are a few blocks in this area that have a higher than usual amount of abandonment. This reflects less desirable design or construction
features in the tract houses. Nevertheless, no single significant part of the core neighborhood is severely distressed, so a targeted program of
demolition with careful treatment of the vacant lots should greatly stabilize the overall neighborhood. In terms of rental property, the
neighborhood is already a place of choice for stable renters and higher quality units should enhance the market.
Until recently, there have been few abandoned houses in University Park, and the community has a good tree canopy and a relatively low
number of open lots. However, matters are changing quickly and it is critical to now remove certain vacant houses and to have a solid plan for
the re-use of the properties. Therefore, there will be assigned staff to work with the Redevelopment Department to create a seamless process
of identification and notification of abandoned houses and a proactive plan for giving priority to demolitions where the adjacent owners are
willing to take responsibil

Summary of Distribution and Uses of NSP Funds:
ity. As a result of this effort, 55 houses will be removed in University Park over the next two years. A cleaner, better-maintained neighborhood
will restore confidence among the current residents and will encourage renting or owning by new residents.
There may be the opportunity for simultaneous demolitions in conjunction with other programs and institutions at some sites. If so, the total for
both areas could be 55 demolitions funded by NSP3 and 20 by other sponsors. The first priority for clearance will be sites adjacent to dollar
houses and other investment sites. The second priority will be abandoned houses adjacent to those property owners who are willing to take
responsibility for the cleared lot. The third priority will be given to distressed properties on otherwise stable blocks with the belief that early
intervention can be the most cost effective.
The fourth priority will be given to the demolition of the old Sheraton Hotel and its adjoining parking garage which has created an impediment
to redevelopment of the city's downtown area. The goal of demolishing these structures and the subsequent redevelopment of the area into
green space is to stimulate redevelopment and revitalization in the surrounding area while eliminating blight.
The fifth priority will be given to the demolition of property addresses on both sides of Ridge Road between Tyler Street and Van Buren Street.

Project 3 - Administration - Budget $244,607.31 - This activity represents less than 10% of the total NSP Grant and will be utilized for
administration of all related fiscal systems and production of required reports. Management of program components, monitoring and
evaluation of program and subgrantees.

How Fund Use Addresses Market Conditions:

Ensuring Continued Affordability:

Definition of Blighted Structure:
Definition of "Blighted Structure" according to the State of Indiana Code, the Interim Study Committee and Legislative Findings:
-Any premises that, because of physical condition, use, or occupancy, constitutes a public nuisance or attractive nuisance;
-Any dwelling that, because it is dilapidated, unsanitary, unsafe, or vermin infested or lacks the facilities or equipment required by housing
codes, is
unfit for human habitation;
-Any structure that is a fire hazard or is otherwise dangerous to the safety of persons or property;
-Any structure from which the utilities, plumbing, heating, sewerage, or similar services or facilities have been disconnected, destroyed,
removed, or
rendered ineffective so that the property is unfit for its intended use;
-Any vacant or unimproved land in a predominantly built-up neighborhood that, by reason of neglect or lack of maintenance, has become a
place for.
accumulation of trash and debris or a haven for rodents or other vermin;
-Any property that has tax delinquencies that exceed the value of the property;
-Any property with code violations that affect health or safety that is not substantially rehabilitated within one year after receiving a notice to

Definition of Affordable Rents:

Housing Rehabilitation/New Construction Standards:
The City of Gary Housing Standards for Rehabilitation Program as funded from HOME and CDBG will apply to NSP funds:
• Code/Health & Safety Repairs- Our first priority is to eliminate and remove any and all pre-existing City of Gary code violations, Health
and Safety hazards and bring the property to code. All projects will correct any pre-existing code deficiencies and/or health and safety repair
needs. This is inclusive of construction deficiencies which were completed without City permits. (room additions, garage conversions, patio
additions, etc.) All units will brought up to code and rehabilitation must obtain the permits necessary through the City of Gary Building
Department, or the property must be demolished as part of the rehab project.
• Lead Based Paint Hazards- As part of the Housing Rehabilitation under this NSP, a lead based paint test and a risk assessment are
required on all rehabilitation projects. This is done to identify the existence and scope of any lead based paint hazards in the property. The
"Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention in Federally Owned and Federally Assisted Housing" found at 24 CFR Part 35 will apply.
• Termite Repairs- The program requires a termite inspection report be prepared for every home by a licensed inspector. The report must
identify any termite or dry rot damaged wood members in the property, as well as whether there are any active termite infestations in the
property. The program requires that any termite or dry rot damaged wood be replaced or repaired due to health and safety risks posed to the
structure of the property. Fumigation or other treatments recommended must eliminate any active termite infestations and are required under
this program.
• General Property Improvements Upon- The Completion of the cost for rehabilitation of all code deficiencies has been completed, health
and safety items, lead based paint hazard and termite repairs are totaled, then any additional program funding may be used to address
general property improvements. General property improvements may include a wide range of items such as painting, replacement of fixtures,
cabinets, flooring, etc. The General property improvements MAY NOT include items that are a type or quality which exceeds the standards for
similar properties in the area or that exceed the basic standard of "decent, safe and sanitary housing". The acceptable standards are found in
24 CFR 983.101.

Vicinity Hiring:
The City of Gary will make every effort to hire employees who reside in the NSP3 target areas, and will require contractors to make every
attempt to do the same. In doing so, the City will coordinate these vicinity hiring provisions with its Section 3 program requirements.

            Fayette County Farmers Market Rules and Guidelines 2017
                                       
 
Introduction

Before applying to the Fayette County Farmers Market, please review this entire document, Indiana State Department of Health regulations, and other applicable information that pertains to your items for sale. Applications must be approved before you can participate in the Farmers Market. 

The Fayette County Farmers Market is a Growers-Only Market for Fayette, Franklin, Henry, Rush, Union and Wayne county producers/artisans to support the interest of local farmers, producers, and consumers. The purpose of the market is to create a sales venue for area farmers, provide opportunity for consumers to purchase quality farm-grown goods, provide a community gathering place, to promote and stimulate economic development, and create traffic in the Downtown area.

Vendors are the growers and producers of the fruits, vegetables, plants, herbs, flowers, baked goods, dried goods, jams, honey, syrup and/or other approved products intended to be sold at the market. The Fayette County Farmers Market supports local, small-scale farmers and gardeners by providing a marketing opportunity to sell homegrown produce, and homemade farm-related items directly to consumers. All products must be raised, harvested, prepared for resale, packaged, and displayed in accordance with federal, state and local regulations.

All value-added products and handcrafted items are to be made by the vendor.  Secondhand and flea market type items are NOT allowed. NO AUCTION ITEMS will be allowed at the market.

Vendors are responsible for ensuring that their products meet all applicable Health Department standards and agree to abide by the law to participate in the Fayette County Farmers Market. Questions regarding compliance with these regulations should be directed toward the Fayette County Health Department. The Fayette County Farmers Market is not responsible for the enforcement of USDA or any other federal, state or local regulations. Should any enforcement agent inspect our market, each vendor is responsible for the compliance of his/her merchandise.

Please submit the Fayette County Farmers Market application along with the signed market agreement that you have read the rules and guidelines and are in agreement with the terms of the market.  Applications need to be submitted and approved 1 week prior to the market along with payment.

Approved Products at the Market

 All vegetables, flowers, or herbs grown by the vendor from seed, bulbs, sets, or seedlings.
 Any fruits, nuts, or berries grown by the vendor from trees, bushes or vines on the vendor's property.
 Any vegetable or berry plant grown by the vendor from seed, seedling, cuttings, or division bulbs and seeds propagated by the vendor. Cut flowers or flowering plants may be sold.
 Honey produced by the vendor's bees.
 Fresh baked goods made by the vendor. In addition, pre-packaged baked goods must be labeled with ingredients to meet applicable federal, state and local laws, ordinances and requirements. See Home Base Vendor pamphlet
 Value-added agricultural products such as jams, dried tomatoes and soy milk. Value-added products and prepared food items must meet all applicable federal, state, and local health regulations.
 Plant and animal products grown and crafted by the vendor (soaps, herb salves, wreaths, etc).
 Meat and eggs products with proper state certifications on file and proper refrigeration.
 Art or craft items made by vendor or crafted by group members of nonprofit groups.

 Consignment Policy
A vendor may sell produce or value-added products on a consignment basis for another grower or producer with prior approval from the Market Coordinator. Under NO circumstances may a grower sell produce that was purchased at wholesale vendors for resale at the Fayette County Farmers Market.  The consigned produce has to have a sign stating the exact location of where it was grown.

The purpose of consignment is two-fold. First, it allows participation in the market by a local grower with a limited number of products. Second, it widens the variety of products available at the market, which benefits the consumer and promotes the success of the market. The following guidelines apply:
 Before bringing consigned products to market, the vendor must have an application approved.
 Consigned produce or products must be brought to the market without vendor prepayment for those items.
 The product must be grown or produced by the consignor on his or her own farm or facility.
 The consignor will be subject to all rules of the market, including inspection for compliance with grower requirements.
 Consignment arrangements as to quantity and price are between the vendor and the grower/producer of the item.
 No items may be offered for sale that are not produced by vendors or consignors, except by permission of the Market Coordinator, which may be granted if such items are determined to be for the good of the market as a whole and do not detract from other grower/vendors.
 Non-farm art, crafts, and value-added food products produced by a vendor may also be sold with the approval of the Market Coordinator. Farmers who produce value-added and craft items will receive preference over non-farmer artisans in selling these items at the market, dependent on market needs. No items in violation of copyright laws may be sold.
Value-added products  -  jams, dried fruits, soy milk, and similar goods  -  should use ingredients grown by the vendor or locally grown whenever possible. All value-added products must follow local, state and federal labeling guidelines.

 Not Permitted at the Fayette County Farmers Market 
The following items are prohibited under all circumstances:  firearms, open/unauthorized alcoholic beverages, unleashed pets, and items not approved by the Fayette County Farmers Market, the local or state Health Department, or other legal authority. 

Vendors may not sell produce that has been cut open, potentially hazardous food items, or food items that do not align with Health Department standards. Home Based Vendors (HBV - vendors NOT preparing food in a commercial kitchen) should carefully review Health Department guidelines for restrictions, paying special attention to packing and labeling requirements* of the HEA 1309.     *Each label requires 6 pieces of information and is outlined in detail in HEA 1309 (see Home Base Vendor rule pamphlet.).

Some examples of non-acceptable items at market are salsas from HBVs (considered potentially dangerous by the Health Department) or any vendor opening a product and selling that product individually without the proper certifications (Commercial Certifications required by Health Department). No RAW Milk is to be sold.




  Non-Profit Organizations at the Farmers' Market Beverage Station
 Non-profits can apply at no charge and earn cash for their fundraising effort by registering to run the Farmers' Market Beverage Station Booth, provide their own tent, beverages, and manpower to run the station. The Farmers Market would like healthy drinks to be served.
Completed Service Application required.

 Any non-profit group that is not selling, but setting up for informational or educational activities at the Farmers' Market, can do so at no charge.
Completed Service Application required. 


Market Fees/Booth Space

All fees will be used to support the promotion and operation of the market including, but not limited to, public relations and marketing expenses, market supplies, market fixtures and other business expenses as the Advisory Board sees fit.

 These fees are not refundable, and can be paid by cash or check (please make checks payable to: Fayette County Farmers Market).
  Fees:  $40 for the season (21 weeks) 
  	     $20 Pass for any 4 Saturdays	
  
 If a seasonal vendor knows he or she will be unable to attend the market on a particular day, the vendor should notify the Market Coordinator as soon as possible.
  
 All vendors are independent entities and as such are responsible for compliance with local codes and for paying all applicable taxes and/or federal, state and local fees. It is highly recommended that you research and stay current in checking the local state and other applicable regulations and see how they apply to you. 
  
Seasonal vendors will receive the same booth space each week so that the market has continuity and simplicity for its customers. Seasonal vendors will be given first preference of spaces on the first day of the market. Other spaces will be available on a first-come, first-served basis, unless the Market Coordinator approves otherwise. Market Coordinator reserves the right to relocate vendors as needed.
  
  Vendors are limited to one vehicle per space.  If a trailer is used to display and sell goods, it must be detached from the towing vehicle, and the towing vehicle must be removed from the Market area. No vehicles permitted to enter the Market area after 8:45am or leave before 12:00am. All displays, including umbrellas and canopies, must be securely anchored, without damage to city or county property, and not extend beyond the limits of the assigned space. Driving through the market is a safety issue, and vendors violating this rule or leaving early may be excluded from future markets.







Vendor Rules

 It is highly recommended each vendor carry his or her own personal, product, and liability insurance. All authorized vendors participating in the Fayette County Farmers Market agree that they are independent operators/entities and not partners or participants in a joint venture, and shall be individually and solely responsible for all claims, loss, injuries, deaths and/or any other damages that may occur as a result of the vendor's negligence, unsafe goods, and/or participation in the market.
 Vendors are responsible for all applicable laws, regulations, and ordinances pertaining to their farm products, baked or processed foods and shall have obtained all necessary licenses, permits, and inspections prior to selling any products at the market.  Vendors must clearly display all applicable licenses, permits, and prices as well as provide copies for the Market Coordinator to keep on file. In addition, farm or business names including addresses are to be in a prominent place.  Vendors agree to a production site visit/inspection by the Farmers Market Advisory Team.
 Vendors are responsible for their own display, including tables, extension cords, chairs, weather protection, etc. Each vendor is responsible for keeping his or her booth space clean, and to tidy up before leaving. Vendors must remove all trash and dispose of it properly. Vendors are also expected to help collaborate on the cleaning of the area after every market.
 Vendors selling by the pound must use and provide their own certified scale. 
 Vendors must maintain their display set up until the close of the market and may not begin breaking down until end of market time unless otherwise approved by the Market Coordinator.
 The Market Coordinator has the right to require a vendor to change his or her display if it is deemed to present a safety risk or does not otherwise comply with market rules.
 Vendors selling outside of the allotted time or driving during market hours may be asked to not return to the following market. 
 Vendors, their employees, and associates shall dress and act in a professional manner with customers, vendors, and staff. Vendors are expected to treat market staff, volunteers, other vendors, and customers with respect.
 Children under the age of fourteen years shall not be a vendor unless accompanied by and under the supervision of a parent or guardian or responsible adult.
 Rough, menacing, vulgar, profane, or abusive language and/or harassment or hawking of products will not be tolerated.

ADMINISTRATION AND FINANCE COMMITTEE
The Administration and Finance Committee of the City-County Council met on Tuesday,
July 16, 2013. Chair Angela Mansfield called the meeting to order at 5:32 p.m. with the
following members present: Pamela Hickman, Benjamin Hunter, Jack Sandlin and
Joseph Simpson. Marilyn Pfisterer, Mary Moriarty Adams and Maggie Lewis arrived
shortly thereafter. Hope Tribble, Chief Financial Officer, represented Council staff.
Chair Mansfield asked committee members to introduce themselves and indicate which
portion of the County they represent.
{Clerk’s Note: Councillors Pfisterer and Moriarty Adams arrived at 5:35 p.m.}
PROPOSAL NO. 186, 2013 - authorizes the Board of Commissioners of Marion County
to dispose of certain parcels that have an appraised value of $50,000 or more
Claudia Fuentes, Marion County Treasurer, stated that by virtue of her office, she also
serves as a County Commissioner. Every year, the Board of Commissioners is charged
with disposing of surplus property in tax sales. She said that this proposal is a request
to dispose of 334 properties appraised at a value of $50,000 or above, and is a routine
annual approval process. She presented a brief Powerpoint presentation (attached as
Exhibit A), and explained the tax sale process. She provided an additional handout
(attached as Exhibit B) showing the revenue and expenses of sold parcels and the
amount distributed to units of government based on those sales. Cindy Land,
administrative deputy, Marion County Treasurer’s Office, explained that these net
revenues are after all expenses, which include advertising, appraisals, postage, mowing
of properties, and other adminstrative duties, have been paid from sale proceeds.
{Clerk’s Note: Councillor Lewis arrived at 5:40 p.m.}
Chair Mansfield asked if this is different in any way from the standard approval
requested every year. Ms. Fuentes responded in the negative.
Councillor Pfisterer asked if there has been any attempt to change the appraisal value
amount at the State level to make this process less cumbersome. She said that maybe
raising that threshhold to $75,000 would help speed up the process. Ms. Land said that
the process can be very slow, as sometimes the order from the court comes at an
inopportune time for a hearing before the Council. They do not want to circumvent
anyone’s authority, but they would welcome that change to streamline the process.
Councillor Hickman said that administrative expenses include $40,000 for employee
reimbursement. She asked if this actually pays for staffing of the administration
process. Ms. Land said that they are able to reimburse the General Fund for a portion
of staff salaries spent in administering this process. Councillor Hickman asked if the
process therefore pays for itself. Ms. Land responded in the affirmative.

Administration and Finance Committee
July 16, 2013

Councillor Sandlin asked how many properties are included in this proposal. Ms.
Fuentes responded that there are 334 properties. Councillor Sandlin said that he has
heard it is a very slow process and asked how it can move forward. Ms. Fuentes said
that some of these properties are from the 2012 tax sale, which took place in October,
and they received the court order for disposal the first week of June, so it took about
eight months. Ms. Land added that there are so many factors that have to, by law, be
included in a judicial sale, that it makes the process lengthy. She said that there is an
auction, and if a parcel does not sell at auction, then there is a period of redemption,
with notices sent, and then notice advising of the court petition, and then the court has
to have time to act on that petition, and there are appeal times also built in. She said
that disposing of anything that does not sell at auction can be a very cumbersome
process.
Councillor Hunter said that in the recitals of this proposal, references are made to
Indiana Code (IC) 36-111-3, regarding authority from the Mayor, which has been
provided by Executive Order 395. However, some of these parcels in District 21 fall
within a historic district, and he asked if the authority mandated by IC 36-111-1 has
been satisfied, as well. Ms. Land said that this has never been an issue that has come
up before, and they follow the same process they have always followed. She said that
they do not typically have any parcels that are specifically historic that are tax-sale
eligible. Councillor Hunter said that some may think this is a technical thing and not
substantive, but he believes it is worth checking into. He said that IC 36-111-1 gives the
Historic Preservation Commision the same authority over parcels in a historic district as
the Mayor has over the other parcels. He said that he believes this should be looked at
by counsel before the full Council votes. Chair Mansfield said that the “Whereas”
statements are not a substantive part of the proposal. Councillor Hunter said that the
reference is not included in the Sections of the proposal, either, and he just wants to
make sure the process meets the requirements of the Code. Chair Mansfield asked if
Councillor Hunter wants to hold up the approval until this is clarified. Councillor Hunter
said that he is fine with passing the proposal out of Committee, but he would like to
make sure they are complying with the law. Ms. Fuentes asked what 21 parcels on the
list are located in a historic district. Councillor Hunter said that there are a few parcels,
and they are located in District 21. Chair Mansfield asked Councillor Hunter to get with
the Council attorney to address his question before the full Council meeting. Councillor
Hunter agreed.
Councillor Moriarty Adams moved, seconded by Councillor Sandlin, to send Proposal
No. 186, 2013 to the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried
by a vote of 8-0.
PROPOSAL NO. 187, 2013 - proposes an ordinance of the Marion County Income Tax
Council, under IC 6-3.5-6-1.5 and IC 6-3.5-6-13, to decrease the local homestead credit
to 4% for calendar year 2014 and to rescind the local homestead credit beginning in
calendar year 2015, and casts the vote of the Council on such ordinance

Administration and Finance Committee

Co-Chairs of the Local Homestead Credit Review Commission (LHCRC) Beth Henkel
(Local Attorney, former Department of Local Government and Finance Commissioner)
and James Steele (former City Controller and former Chief Financial Officer for the CityCounty Council) made a brief presentation to committee members regarding the work
and recommendation of the LHCRC and provided them with copies of an abbreviated
report from the commission. {Clerk’s Note: A copy of this report is on file in the Council
Office with the original set of these minutes.} They presented a brief Powerpoint
presentation (attached as Exhibit C) detailing the process undertaken by the
commission, including their objectives, their membership, and their meeting schedule.
Mr. Steele said that each of the public meetings included a presentation by the City
Controller regarding the City and County’s fiscal condition. He reviewed the fiscal
condition of the City and County as detailed in Exhibit C. He said that Policy Analytics,
LLC (PALLC), a local fiscal research and analysis firm, provided another presentation at
the meetings to explain the history and purpose of the local homestead credit and the
impact on taxpayers and local taxing units if this credit were to be eliminated. He said
that when the County Option Income Tax (COIT) homestead credit was created, it was
intended to help alleviate the burden of property taxes. This was before any of the 1%,
2% and 3% property tax caps, depending on the type of property, went into effect. He
reviewed the impact of eliminating this credit on taxing units and taxpayers. He said
that at the commission’s final meeting, nine members and one proxy were in
attendance. Of the nine members, five voted to phase out the homestead credit, and
four voted to retain the credit. The proxy also voted to phase out the credit, but General
Counsel Fred Biesecker ruled that the proxy’s vote could not be counted. The rules set
forth for the commission indicate that a recommendation had to be made by six
members of the commission, so the recommendation is somewhat limited because
there was no definitive recommendation by six official members. He reviewed the
seven additional recommendations made by the commission:
1. Continue City/County efficiency measures to reduce spendign
2. Additional funding for Auditor (hire outside help to help identify violations of HSC
claims)
3. Additional funding for Assessor (Eliminating the backlog of appeals would help
other units)
4. Increase LOIT (Local Option Income Tax) levy freeze rate (raise to the maximum
amount allowed by DLGF to provide an additional $14 million in revenue to the
local units of government) This would not help the schools, but it would provide
an additional $500,000 for IndyGo, $900,000 for the Library, and $2.6 million for
Health and Hospital Corporation (HHC).
5. Provide funding for Library and IndyGo (cover net loss in revenue through an offthe-top distribution)
6. Phase in Public Safety COIT rate increase (an increase from current 0.35% to
the maximum allowed of 0.50% would provide an additional $25 million of
revenue for funding the staffing and operations for public safety)
7. Establish Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Assessed Valuation (AV) pass-through
policy. Currently passing through about $1.3 billion of TIF AV back to the base,

Administration and Finance Committee

which reduces tax rates and reduces the circuit breaker impact for all unts of
government that receive property tax. If the same amount is passed in 2014, it
would result in a reduction of circuit breaker loss in the amount of $25.4 million to
all local units, and an $11.9 million reduction in circuit breaker loss for schools.
Mr. Steele relayed the votes on each recommendation as reported in the June 24, 2013
minutes of the commission, and said that the consensus was that the majority of
members were in agreement with these recommendations, with the LOIT levy freeze
rate increase and the Public Safety COIT rate increases suggested for further review.
He said that the Local Option Income Tax (LOIT) was established in order to freeze
property tax levies for a period of three years. That current rate is 0.27%, which only
provides $44 million of revenue. For a three-year levy freeze, there should be $58
million from the LOIT rate to provide relief to local units of government for their
operating budgets. There is, therefore, a $14 million shortfall to the local units of
government that they should have received, but have not because the LOIT rate is too
low. If it were established at the correct rate, the Parks Department would get an
additional $1.1 million of revenue, Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department would
get $1.1 million, the Indianapolis Fire Department would get $1.2 million, the Library
would get $913,000, IndyGo would get $557,000, and Health and Hospital Corporation
would get an additional $2,556,000 in revenue. That is how much revenues are being
shorted because the LOIT rate is not sufficient to pay for the three years of freeze. Mr.
Steele concluded by saying that a majority of members expressed concern about the
loss of revenue for local units of government, as well as increases, albeit slight, in
taxpayer bills during tough economic times.
Chair Mansfield asked if they have a slide that shows the map with the geographical
impacts and the level of impact on each parcel. She said that this map clearly shows
the public who will be impacted, and her district, in Washington Township, shows a
substantial impact. She said that the report indicates the average increase for most
taxpayers will be only about $20, but most of the properties in her district are in the $50
to $70 increase range. She said there are other areas, however, that have almost no
impact. Ms. Henkel stated that the areas that show no impact are primarily areas that
are already capped out at 1%. Mr. Steele added that the areas with the greatest
increase are predominantly areas with the lowest tax rates in the County. Chair
Mansfield said that these areas also did not receive the benefit of the tax caps, yet their
governing units are all hurting because of the caps; so this action does not benefit her
district.
Councillor Sandlin asked Mr. Steele to explain the impact of school referendums on this
credit. Mr. Steele said that several school districts in the County have passed
referendums, mostly on debt service or transportation, but at least two have passed
referendums on operating revenues. He said that these referendum amounts are
outside the freeze. If a property is capped at 1%, and that area’s school corporation
has passed a referendum, the referendum rate is added on at 100% over and above the

Administration and Finance Committee
July 16, 2013
Page 5
1% freeze. To exacerbate the problem, this homestead credit is paying a portion of the
referendum rate by a quirk of State statute, which it was never intended to do.
Councillor Simpson asked what townships will see the most negative impact. Ms.
Henkel said that Washington Township will be hit the hardest, and this is partly because
of low tax rates to begin with, but also exacerbated by the referendum. She said that
she lives in Washington Township, and if this credit elimination were implemented this
year with no phase in, she would pay an extra $28.
Councillor Hickman asked if these areas will also lose the most amount of money in the
area of schools and libraries. Mr. Steele said that this is probably not the case, because
the circuit breaker impact is the lowest where there are already low rates. Councillor
Hickman said that Washington Township does not have that low a rate. Ms. Henkel
said that Washington Township and Lawrence Township have the lowest tax rates in
the County. Ms. Henkel added that Franklin Township has the highest tax rate, and
they were not able to pass their proposed referendum, so most of those folks are
capped out at their maximum. Franklin Township and Indianapolis Public Schools (IPS)
will probably be hit the hardest by this action. Councillor Hickman asked if the
Washington Township School District will not then be the hardest hit. Mr. Steele said
that they will not. Councillor Hickman said that she does not understand why they are
taking money out of this one pot to pay for other things. She asked why they cannot
implement these other recommendations, which could be done easier, instead of
eliminating this homestead credit. Mr. Steele said that the commission was charged
solely with looking at whether or not to eliminate the homestead credit. During the
course of their meetings and discussions, they looked at other options to help mitigate
the lost revenue for taxing units, as requested by those who testified at the meetings.
These other recommendations are just options for the Council to consider in addition to
the phasing out of the homestead credit. He said that some of this loss will be mitigated
by the pass-through of the tax increment financing (TIF) incremental revenue, which the
Controller will speak to in his presentation. He said that even if a district does not have
a TIF, passing through this revenue lowers the County’s tax rate and it shifts out to all
taxing districts. He said that the commission simply was looking at other
recommendations to consider. Ms. Henkel added that an additional revenue of $8.3
million for the City and County will not fully address their $29 million deficit. These are
simply other recommendations that the Council and administration could consider as
add-ons or alternatives to help their financial situation. Councillor Hickman asked if
these are then simply recommendations that “may” happen, while the credit elimination
“will” take place. Mr. Steele said that with this proposal, they are only considering the
elimination of the homestead credit, so whether that occurs is based on the outcome of
this proposal. He said that during the commission’s process, however, they saw some
other things they felt the City, County and Council should consider.
Councillor Moriarty Adams said that she has not made up her mind about how she feels
on this issue and asked how this will affect Warren Township. Mr. Steele said that the
township will lose $1,100 and the schools would lose $272,000. He added that the City

Administration and Finance Committee
July 16, 2013
Page 6
has released TIF pass-through back to the base, which makes many of these school
districts a net winner, especially IPS. Councillor Moriarty Adams asked what will
happen next yea, if this proposal is passed and the credit is gone. She asked where the
City will then go to find revenue for their structural deficit. Mr. Steele said that the
recommendation, as proposed in this resolution, is to phase out that credit, so it will not
be completely gone next year. If it were eliminated in its entirety, the City would receive
an additional $8.3 million in net gain revenue. That amount would carry forward each
year as an ongoing revenue stream for the City and County. Councillor Moriarty Adams
asked if this would then reduce the structural deficit of $55 million by $8.3 million. Mr.
Steele responded in the affirmative. Ms. Henkel added that the Legislature has given
local government very few options. She said that a quarter of homeowners are getting
no benefit from this credit, while others see just a slight benefit. Some taxing units are
getting the benefit of income tax revenue that they would not normally receive. Mr.
Steele said that the property tax reforms changed the game. Most of this revenue no
longer provides property tax relief to homeowners; but instead, it provides circuit
breaker relief to certain taxing units who would otherwise not be eligible for COIT
dollars.
Councillor Hickman said that these funds are already designated for schools and
municipal corporations, but when they go into the General Fund, they can no longer
guarantee those funds would go toward schools, as the Council is no longer in control of
the General Fund due to new legislation. Chair Mansfield said that this is an additional
observation, but not necessarily related to the elimination of this credit.
Councillor Sandlin said that there was a lot of information presented before the
commission through a series of meetings. He said that schools now benefit from this
credit for expenses related to bus replacement, transportation and capital projects only.
If eliminated, the money they will lose will then go to benefit their taxpayers, instead. He
said that no one in government likes to deal with the fact that tax caps are in place,
even if they personally agree that they are a good thing; because governmental units
are struggling for revenues as a result of these caps. He said that the Council has the
ongoing responsibility of looking for things that will reduce their budgets without
reducing essential services, as well as looking at the right mix of taxes to support those
services. These are tough choices, and he is not sure any one thing will fill the hole that
is projected. Reducing spending, however, is still the most important thing; and all
agencies and departments are reducing their budgets, controlling costs, and doing more
with less.
Councillor Simpson thanked Mr. Steele and Ms. Henkel for doing a great job with this
commission and tackling this tough subject. He said that the commission’s process
seems to have been thorough and fair, but there is still a lot of thought needed. The
information provided through the work of the commission, however, makes it easier for
them to understand what they are up against.

Administration and Finance Committee
July 16, 2013
Page 7
Councillor Moriarty Adams asked if any of this increased revenue will go to public
safety. Mr. Steele said that it will, but that would be a better question for the Controller
during his presentation.
Councillor Pfisterer said that as a global observation, the homestead credit was
established in the 1980s, before tax caps were in existence, to provide property tax
relief. From a global perspective, the credit is no longer serving the function for which it
was designed. Mr. Steele concurred and said that less than 30% of the credit is actually
used for the function for which it was designed.
Chair Mansfield echoed Councillor Simpson’s appreciation to Ms. Henkel and Mr.
Steele and all the commission members for the time and effort they have spent on this
important issue.
Jason Dudich, City Controller, Office of Finance and Management (OFM), also thanked
Mr. Steele, Ms. Henkel and the commission for their work, and the public for attending
the hearings and providing additional input. He provided a handout (attached as Exhibit
D), and explained that this proposal will work to phase out an antiquated and out-dated
property tax relief program. He reviewed the handout in detail and said that this action
will have a minimal impact on homestead property taxpayers, with the average increase
being $22 per homeowner, and 25% of all taxpayers seeing no impact. He added that
there would be an impact on local units of government, and an additional $12.8 million
of COIT revenue would be distributed among units receiving those revenues. He said
that there is some room for growth in COIT revenue, as only 40% of parcels are
currently at their cap. He said that the City-County portion of this additional revenue
would go directly into the fund that primarily supports public safety and criminal justice
functions of the County. Some local units of government that do not benefit from
income tax revenue will see a negative impact, but these units were never intended to
get COIT revenue. He reviewed the discussed solutions to help mitigate that loss of
revenue for local taxing units. He said that they intend to increase the TIF pass-through
amounts. Currently, $1.4 billion is passed through, and they are proposing to pass
through an additional $3.7 million in 2014. Although areas where there are TIF districts
will benefit the most, this benefit will actually spread out to everyone to help mitigate
revenue loss. They also expect some potential natural growth in income tax revenue.
Due to an error at the State, some revenue was withheld, and they believe the State will
release this income tax distribution and it will begin to grow next year. He said that both
of these factors will help relieve some of the financial pressure on these local units. He
said that once the TIF is passed through, then schools would actually be held harmless
overall, and IPS would actually gain $1.3 million in 2014. Other school corporations
may not see such a huge benefit, but by phasing the credit out, as this resolution
proposes, they will help mitigate some of that impact and help them gradually cope with
the potential loss.
Councillor Hickman asked how a district without a TIF can be held harmless. Mr.
Dudich said that by passing through the TIF increment, all districts in the County will

Administration and Finance Committee
July 16, 2013

realize additional property tax revenue. Councillor Hickman asked if they can guarantee
TIF revenue for all school corporations that will lose money. Mr. Dudich said that there
is no guarantee that all schools will be without some loss, but overall, factoring in all
school districts, they will be held harmless. Councillor Hickman asked if he can give the
schools a specific dollar amount so that they have some idea what their budget will be.
Mr. Dudich said that once the pass-through is finalized, all units will receive notification,
and then if this proposal passes, the units will be aware of further impact. Councillor
Hickman said that even though Mr. Dudich says this revenue will go to fund public
safety, the Council does not have total control over the General Fund anymore, and so
they cannot guarantee it goes to fund public safety. Mr. Dudich said that the Council
votes on the budget and makes the final decision about where dollars go and what
expenditures are approved, so they do have the authority to determine that. Councillor
Hickman said that with some changes at the State, the Council no longer has complete
control of this fund, and she does not want the public to get the impression that they do.
Councillor Lewis asked if the TIF increment will be passed through anyway, even if this
proposal does not pass. Mr. Dudich responded in the affirmative, and said that it is a
yearly approval process. He said that the recommended pass-through may have been
a lesser amount if this action were not being considered, but it is the City’s commitment
to increase it to help mitigate the effect of this credit elimination.
Councillor Sandlin said that one of the things that came up in commission discussions
was the benefit of having a TIF pass-through policy, so that there is more consistency
from year to year. He said that he believes this recommendation is an important thing
to look at going forward. Mr. Dudich said that there is a working group that was created
as a result of the recent TIF Study Commission, and they have developed a policy, with
the input of Ms. Tribble, the Metropolitan Development Commission (MDC), the
Department of Metropolitan Development (DMD) and others. He said that the intent is
to use this policy going forward as a guide to the distribution of these monies.
Councillor Moriarty Adams asked how phasing it out is better than eliminating it outright.
Mr. Dudich said that it does not give the City the revenue they need immediately, so an
outright elimination would be more beneficial to them. However, for those who will be
losing dollars, a phase out helps them plan better to absorb that loss gradually. He said
it will still benefit the City with some increase in revenue the first year, but it would be
less than what they would prefer with a flat elimination. He said that he hopes there are
some additional changes at the State level by 2015 that may help mitigate the loss for
local units even further.
Councillor Hickman asked if the State releasing the additional COIT revenue will cause
the pot to grow enough so that this credit elimination is not needed. Mr. Dudich said
that the pot will most likely grow, but it still will not cover the services they provide and
the deficit they face. He said, conversely, the State could choose not to release those
dollars, and they would be in worse shape. He said that there is no one silver bullet to
fix all their problems.

Administration and Finance Committee

Chair Mansfield said that her constituents are more impacted than others throughout the
County. To be honest, she might be more open to this action if she believed the Mayor
had been fiscally responsible during his administration. She said that there have been a
number of instances, however, in looking at a holistic snapshot of his time in office, that
she feels the Mayor has been hemorrhaging money. She said that decisions such as
the sale of the parking meter revenue system, other corporate giveaways, self-serving
raises for Mayoral staff, and the use of RebuildIndy funds for a cricket field attest to this
fact. She said that some of these things would be fine to do if the City had extra money,
but when her district is in dire need of infrastructure for safety reasons, spending money
on a cricket field that most people will never use makes no sense. She said that looking
at all these things and adding them up, she cannot help but think what this money would
equal in terms of full-time police officers. She said that for these reasons, she cannot
support this proposal.
Councillor Simpson said that if this is such a good idea, he questions why the
Republicans did not do it when they were in control of the Council. He said that they
had the opportunity then to eliminate this tax credit, but chose not to. He said that one
of his greatest concerns is for some senior constituents who are on a fixed income,
where this $22 average increase might mean the difference in having food on their table
or medicine to address life and death health problems. He said that taxpayers have to
manage their budget, and he does not know why the City cannot manage theirs. He
said that he believes this issue does need to go to the full Council for discussion and a
vote of the full body. He said that he is not, however, inclined to support it in the end,
because it is basically a tax increase. He said that he appreciates Mr. Dudich’s
presentation in layman’s terms and the work of the commission, but he is still hung up
on the issue, because he also lives in Washington Township, which will be one of the
hardest hit.
Councillor Lewis asked for clarification that the phase-out will bring an extra $4 million in
2014 and $8 million the next year. Mr. Dudich said that the overall increased COIT
revenue from the elimination of the credit over the two-year period would be $12.8
million. The City and County’s share of that would be $8.4 million. If phased out over
two years, as this proposal recommends, the City would receive an increased revenue
stream of $4.2 million in 2014 and then another $4.2 million increase in 2015, for a total
of $8.4 million. The rest of that increase would go out to other units, and the City would
not get the entire $12.8 million increase.
Councillor Pfisterer said that the reason the Republicans did not eliminate this credit
when they were in control of the Council is because the fiscal situation of the City and
County was in better shape at that time, and the property tax caps had not yet fully
kicked in. She said that her district encompasses the Haughville area, which also has
lower taxes, and her constituents will also be impacted greater than the average
taxpayer. However, a great deal of this money will go toward public safety to keep

Administration and Finance Committee
July 16, 2013
Page 10
these taxpayers safe. Also, this credit is antiquated and has outlived its usefulness.
She said that for those reasons, she supports the proposal.
Councillor Moriarty Adams said that she is still up in the air regarding this decision. She
said that she just received her copy of the commission’s report at this evening’s
meeting, and she looks forward to reviewing it to help her make up her mind. She said
that she will vote the proposal out of committee this evening, because, like Councillor
Simpson, she believes there should be a debate on the Council floor for all 29
Councillors to weigh in on this issue. She said that she has some reservations about it
generally, but she will vote to advance it out of committee to the full Council.
Chair Mansfield stated that there is an amendment before the committee for Proposal
No. 187, 2013 (attached as Exhibit E), and she asked Ms. Tribble to explain the
amendment. Ms. Tribble said that this shores up the language in the proposal in order
to cover all bases with the Department of Local Government Finance (DLGF). She said
that the last time the Marion County Income Tax Council (MCITC) passed a resolution,
the credit was created at 8%, but since that time, there have been some changes in the
way the DLGF calculates that rate; and what is actually credited to taxpayers’ bills is
about 3.6%. She said that this shows a reduction from 8% in the recorded history to 4%
as a nominal amount, and recognizes the effective credit at 3.6%. This amendment
also notes the amount designated for the homestead credit as $12.5 million. This
language is for the benefit of any kind of activity by the DLGF after their review of this
ordinance if it is passed.
Councillor Pfisterer referred to the geographical impact map and asked if the elimination
is phased out, if those amounts of impact will then just be cut in half for the first year.
For example, if the effect of the elimination shows a $10 increase, would it be an actual
increase of $5 the first year. Ms. Tribble responded in the affirmative.
Councillor Moriarty Adams moved, seconded by Councillor Simpson, to “Amend”
Proposal No. 187, 2013 as per Exhibit E. The motion carried by a vote of 7-1, with
Councillor Hickman casting the negative vote.
Councillor Moriarty Adams moved, seconded by Councillor Simpson, to send Proposal
No. 187, 2013 to the full Council with a “Do Pass As Amended” recommendation. The
motion carried by a vote of 5-3, with Councillors Hickman, Lewis and Mansfield casting
the negative votes.
There being no further business, and upon motion duly made, the meeting was
adjourned at 7:00 p.m.
Respectfully Submitted,

AM/ag

City_of_Auburn  / News / APD Hosting Shop with a Cop Again This Holiday
***** APD Hosting Shop with a Cop Again This Holiday *****
Posted by thowens on November 3, 2015
The Auburn Police Department (APD) is once again holding its Shop with a Cop
program this holiday season. This program helps children in need purchase gifts
for Christmas, including one needed item for themselves (such as coat, hat,
clothing), as well as small gifts for other family members.
The APD strives to make the day an engaging and exciting one, starting off by
picking children up in one of our police vehicles and taking them (along with a
parent or guardian) to Wal-Mart to select items. We generally end the excursion
with a meal at a local restaurant.
The deadline for applications is November 30, 2015.You can complete our online
application or download and print off the Shop_with_a_Cop_application_form and
return it to the address on the form. Letters of approval will be mailed to the
address listed on this application.
Visit the APD section of this website to learn more about Shop_with_a_Cop,
including how it works and program criteria, rules and guidelines.
Monetary Donations Appreciated
The program has grown in interest and need in recent years. To ensure the APD
can meet the needs of all that apply, the department welcomes financial
assistance from the community. Citizens and businesses interested in
contributing can send checks (made payable to the Auburn Police Department) to:
Auburn Police Dept.- Shop with a Cop

Minutes for Richmond Environmental Sustainability Commission Meeting  4/16/14
Members present: Kelley Cruse-Nicholson, Darryl Decker, Scott Hess, Kevin McCurdy, Alison Zajdel, Scott Zimmerman, and community member Melanie Lennon (Environmental and Safety Manager for Johns Manville in Richmond)
The Meeting began at 8:05 am
Melanie began by talking about issues her company faces, in relation to environment and recycling: including looking for a place to recycle their broken pallets, and getting more recycled ground-up glass for their production.  She believes there are other companies in the area that would benefit from opportunities to use local recycled materials as well.  While there is a statewide list of recycling needs and providers, but there is no such list currently for the local area.  We could provide such a list, or work with other groups to provide it, for people to coordinate such recycling locally.  There used to be a "Lean Manufacturing Group" in town, but we don't know if it is still operative.  
We spoke of our concern, that the city should try to include recycling salvage efforts in some of the blight removal efforts currently happening.  The Environmental Commission might be able to advocate for these efforts.  The ability to demonstrate a plan for recycling/ salvage can also give the city an extra boost in applying for grants for this purpose.
We talked about concerns over manure storage regulations in the county ... not specific problems at the moment, since the county seems to be handling the issue well, but general concerns to keep involved and engaged in this issue.  The state doesn't seem to be regulating and policing this area effectively, thus raising the need to address it at a local level (especially the county).  Our Commission could make recommendation in this area for the city, though they would only apply within the city and a surrounding two-mile fringe area.  We will ask for more information about ongoing efforts and potential issues in manure storage, especially relative to water quality.  If a CAFO wanted to locate into Richmond's two-mile fringe, they would currently need to petition for a zoning change to "intensive agriculture."
Alison is meeting with Amy and Valerie from the EDC and Chamber of Commerce later today, and will try to set up a regular monthly meeting with them.  She will talk with them today about how the Environmental Commission can promote overall quality of life in ways that encourage businesses to move to town; as well as inquire into the state of the lean manufacturing group in town, and the EDC and Chamber's potential involvement in a local list of recycled materials and needs (see above).  Alison will also suggest solid waste management as a potential topic for the next environmental summit (an issue we discussed in our meeting).
Scott Zimmerman spoke about SPUR's efforts to foster trail connection in the area, with the ultimate goal after some initial planning of going to the state for funding that has become available in this area.
The Meeting adjourned at 8:56 am.

WHAT IS A MANAGED MEADOW?
The natural vegetation of much of the Midwest is
deciduous forest, and cleared or open grassy areas that are
not maintained will eventually revert back to forest. Once
an area is left unmowed for a length of time, the process of
ecological succession begins with an increasing diversity of
grasses and wildflowers. Golf courses are highly maintained
and well fertilized. They require a relentless daily regime

THE VISION
IMAGINE a Jasper Parklands that is:

Jasper Parklands is a publicly-accessible, passive recreational landscape and
educational asset for the City of Jasper and Dubois County.

Publicly accessible and open year-round
A contiguous landscape with a wide range of passive programming opportunities

CONNECTIVITY
Towns and cities are seldom in a position to acquire a large track of open space that is centrally located in or near the
downtown. Jasper is in the enviable spot to reimagine the character of this former Country Club site as a new community
asset in ways never before envisioned. The creation of Jasper Parklands represents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to create
a new community landscape which is unique unto its own while still remaining well connected to the broader network.

A network of recreation and fitness trails for all ages and physical abilities

PARKS AS CATALYSTS

A place that provides opportunities for artistic endeavors within a beautiful natural setting

A learning laboratory that educates people about the site’s ecology and natural aspects
Able to accommodate facilities that advance environmental stewardship

Many American cities are implementing urban parks and unique landscape areas in challenging environments. Jasper now
has a large landscape space surrounded by strong neighborhoods and numerous educational and community assets. All
planning relates to health, and investments in parks create opportunities for physical activity for people of all ages and levels
of mobility. The existing cart path forms the basis of a trail system geared towards enhanced health and wellness.

Easily accessible with a series of small, distributed parking areas
An asset to the neighbors that border it
A destination unlike any other in the City yet an integral, connected part of the park system

EXISTING OPPORTUNITIES
The park’s 48 acres comprise not only a contiguous site, but also a lush landscape with a great deal of topographic change,
mature tree canopy, a number of ponds and a network of paths. These existing site conditions should be celebrated. An
underlying challenge in development of the former Jasper Country Club property has been to retain the character or cohesion
of a large landscape space while still accommodating some small scale community uses which can activate the property.

A place of beauty and civic pride with photo-ops and public gathering/performance spaces
Easy to maintain with a managed-meadows approach
Implemented in a manner that allows flexibility and change

WATERBODIES

Respectful of the large landscape character yet accommodating uses that activate the site

Two ponds south of Klubhaus 61 form the basis of a focal point for the site. The two waterbodies follow the path of the
groundwater and mitigate issues of stormwater runoff and water retention during periods of heavy rainfall. A new pedestrian
bridge spans the lakes, linking the trail network together and creating an iconic, art-inspired design element in the middle of
the Parklands. The third smaller pond on the west portion of the site is drained.

PROGRAM IDEAS

FUTURE INTERVENTIONS

Nature trail that builds on current paths

Picnic and seating areas

Exercise stations and bike paths

Fishing and lakeside paths

Nature, Arts, and Cultural Center

Small, dispersed parking lots

Community flower gardens

“Managed meadows” along fairways

Some activation of the property has already occurred with the occupation of Klubhaus 61. Additional pavilions for picnics,
restrooms and shade structures will animate the trail. A landscape amphitheater creates opportunities to watch fireworks and
intimate outdoor performances. An area is reserved for a future Nature / Educational Center. With these modest interventions,
the benefits of the Jasper Parklands will be immediate and substantial as the site evolves over the next generation.

CASE STUDIES
A range of national case studies were investigated to learn lessons from other communities who have decommissioned
golf courses. The studies were selected to highlight the broad spectrum of reuse possibilities, from highly manicured to
wild. A continuum of possibilities exist, with a “Light Touch” as the preferred reuse strategy.

****** Mayoral_message_&#8211;_passing_of_Connie_Howe ******
    * Published on May 20, 2016
    * under Mayor_Updates, Parks_Department_Updates

With a heavy heart I share the news of the passing of a long-time, valued City
employee, Connie Howe. Connie wore a variety of hats over the course of her
more than 23 years of dedicated service.
Among her many responsibilities, Connie took care of the animals and birds when
the TPA Park Petting Zoo and bird aviary first opened, she was instrumental
with the Christmas lights display each year and served as point person for the
Parks Department’s work on the City’s Fourth of July celebration.
We owe Connie a great deal of gratitude for her many years of caring commitment
and public service to not only our Parks Department, but our entire community.
Her years of dedication and hard work made Frankfort a better place and our
recreational amenities much more enjoyable. Connie will be missed. May she rest
in peace.
Mayor Chris McBarnes

Tree Planting Procedures

Contact Holey Moley (within Indiana 1-800-382-5544 or 811) to locate any underground
utilities before you dig.
Keep the root ball well watered and the tree in a shaded place until you are ready to
plant.
Remove all tags, labels, and roping from the tree canopy.
Determine the root flare on the ball and burlap tree before the planting hole is dug so
that the depth of the planting hole can be measured properly.
 Remove twine and open the burlap from around the trunk area of the tree. Pull
back the excess soil around the trunk to locate root flare and main order roots.
(The root flare is the enlarged area where stem tissue begins to differentiate into
main order and lateral roots. The top of the root ball is not always the root flare.)
 Measure the distance from the base of the root flare to the bottom of the root ball
to determine the depth of the planting hole. (The root flare should be at finish
grade and the main order roots just below finish grade. The root flare may be
hidden within the root ball.)
Dig the planting hole to this depth and at least two times the diameter of the root ball
wide.
Break up the sides of the planting hole to avoid glazing. Leave the bottom of the hole
undisturbed to help support it and reduce settling.
Before the tree is placed in the planting hole, use bolt cutters to remove the bottom of
the basket cutting the basket horizontally. This is also a good time to remove the bottom
portion of burlap if the root ball is structurally sound. If the tree is container grown, cut
and remove the container.
Roll the tree into planting hole by the root ball, not the trunk. Be careful not to break off
the connection between the roots and trunk. (The root flare should be at or slightly above
finish grade.)
Balance the tree upright, straight and center. Visually check from two opposing 90
degree sides for straightness. Make any adjustments using shovels to position the root
ball for straight trunk orientation. Do not make adjustments by manipulating the trunk.
Use bolt cutters to remove the rest of the wire basket by cutting the basket vertically and
peeling off the basket.
Remove any remaining package material including twine, strings, burlap, staples, nails,
or plastic, exposing the root ball.
Prune dead or crushed roots and straighten or cut circling roots. Make clean cuts to
promote new root generation.
Backfill using the existing soil up to where the root flare begins to branch, gently tamp.
Fill soil just above where roots begin to laterally branch from the trunk. (A tree planted
even 1” too deep may form a dysfunctional root system).
Prune only dead, broken, injured branches or double leaders. Do not paint wounds.
Remove any additional transportation material including tree wrap, tape and string from
the trunk.
Pour five to ten gallons of water slowly around the tree to eliminate any air pockets.
Stake and brace the tree, if necessary. Support the tree but allow it to move or sway.
Mulch evenly with 2 - 3" of hardwood mulch at least to the diameter tree crown. Keep
mulch 3" away from the trunk.
Fertilize the tree only after the tree has been installed for one year.

   2. City Neighborhood Code Presents Gold Star Awards



****** City_Neighborhood_Code_Presents_Gold_Star_Awards ******


Fort Wayne's Neighborhood Code Enforcement Department today presented Gold
Star Awards to four recipients for bringing their properties up to Neighborhood
Code standards.

The properties were slated for demolition, but all of them were saved due to
the commitment of the award-winning property owners. The investments made by
the property owners have resulted in higher property values and enhanced
neighborhoods.

Gold_Star_Award_winners:
* Hicksville Building Loan and Savings for improving the property at 2936
Abbott St.
* Max Winningham for improving the property at 5030 Tyrone Rd.
* Fisher Property Management for improving the property at 4439 Winter St.
* Larry Brooks for improving the property at 2120 Catalpa St.

Neighborhood Code officials visited the property at 2936 Abbott St. to present
the awards. Hicksville Building Loan and Savings made a private investment to
make the property viable again.

&ldquo;We appreciate the commitment of property owners who care about our
community,&rdquo; said Tom Bandor, Director of the City's Neighborhood Code
Enforcement Department. &ldquo;Our department works each day to partner with
neighborhoods to develop high performance relationships that keep our community
safer and benefit residents.&rdquo;

Monticello has a solid industrial base in which no company dominates the labor
market, thus assuring a strong local economy.

The area's diverse industrial base represents national and international
companies - including Ball_Metal_Beverage_Container_Corporation, Emerson
Electric's_McGill_Corporation,Monticello_Spring_Corporation, MSCA, Polymer
Science, and Jordan_Manufacturing.

White County, with Monticello as it's county seat, is home to Cives_Steel
Company (the nation's largest steel fabricator) and Vanguard_Trailer - a growth
leader in the trucking trailer manufacturing industry. As Indiana's largest
popcorn producer, natural fit companies include Vogel Popcorn and Wabash_Valley
Farms, manufacturer of the famous stovetop Whirley Pop Popcorn Popper.

Area industrial and business employers benefit from the proximity of higher
education training programs provided through Ivy_Tech and Purdue_University.
While Monticello employees are well trained - resulting in an efficient,
dependable, hardworking and reliable workforce. Area companies have taken
advantage of state skill assessment and training grants designed to assist
workers in specific skill development.


Further information may be found at the White_County_Economic_Development web
site.

****** CODE FOR AMERICA FELLOWS TO DISCUSS NEW APPLICATION ******

The City of South Bend Code for America team will discuss CityVoice, its new
application for gathering feedback on vacant and abandoned properties, with the
media on Wednesday, October 2 at 2:00 p.m. in the 14th floor conference room,
County-City Building, 227 W. Jefferson. Code for America fellows Reed Duecy-
Gibbs and Tamara Manik-Perlman will outline the strategy they developed for
South Bend. Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Department of Code Enforcement Director
Shubhada Kambli will address how the application will inform Code
Enforcement’s work.
Also on Wednesday, the Code for America team will meet with residents to
discuss the application from 5:30-6:30 p.m. at Our Lady of the Road, 744 S.
Main St. Those interested in attending this meeting are encouraged to RSVP at
gocityvoice.eventbrite.com.
Code for America, known as the technology world’s version of the Peace Corps,
connects web-industry professionals with municipal governments to promote
openness and efficiency. Throughout the year, Code for America has been working
with the Department of Code Enforcement to develop CityVoice.
“The City of South Bend is swiftly becoming a more innovative and
technologically creative city,” says Mayor Buttigieg. “By gathering input
from residents, CityVoice will help Code Enforcement take a more efficient and
inclusive approach in addressing the problem of vacant and abandoned
properties.”
A vacant property map and all the voice messages from residents can be accessed
at southbendvoices.com. To leave feedback, residents must first identify a
property’s call-in code, which can be found on signs in front of properties
or at cityvoiceapp.com.
