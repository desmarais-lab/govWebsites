MARION COUNTY, INDIANA
2011 TAX SALE
INFORMATION AND PROCEDURES

PLEASE REVIEW THE ENTIRE CONTENTS OF THIS GUIDE!
NOTE: The Tax Sale item list will be available on the Treasurer’s web page August 10th.
More information about this feature can be found on page 3 of this guide.

The following information and procedures apply to Marion County only. The statute governing tax
sales in Indiana (I.C. 6-1.1-24 &25) affords the County Auditor and County Treasurer options regarding
the manner in which the Tax Sale may be conducted. Therefore, the exact procedures by which a county
conducts a tax sale for properties with delinquent taxes and special assessments may differ from county to
county.
This public auction or “Tax Sale” of real property is required by Indiana law. While some unfortunate
circumstances may exist which result in some properties being offered for sale, it is nonetheless required
that all properties with delinquent taxes, penalties, and special
assessment liens for unpaid sewer user charges, delinquent weed
cutting fees, delinquent solid waste service fees, delinquent storm
water fees, delinquent health and hospital liens, delinquent
nuisance fees and DMD liens as specified by law, be auctioned at
the Treasurer's Tax Sale.
The Tax Sale enables the Treasurer to collect the revenue that has been levied for the operation of 42
governmental units and school districts within Marion County. The staffs of the Marion County Treasurer
and Marion County Auditor appreciate the attention of prospective bidders and buyers to the procedures
governing this Tax Sale. Thank you for your participation. Your comments are welcome.

6. All Sales Are Final!
All sales are final, if purchased there is no refund or exchange. The office of the Marion County Treasurer
provides only the seven digit parcel number and minimum bid amount for it. Bidders are responsible for
determining any and all information regarding the parcel and its suitability. Bidders are urged to
thoroughly research the available tax sale properties to aid in identifying the exact piece of property
identified by the parcel number. Research may include, but not necessarily be limited to, a review of:
liens recorded with the Marion County Recorder;
plat maps in the County Assessor's office;
orders of the Department of Metropolitan Development and/or Health and Hospital concerning
demolition orders and unsafe buildings;
sewer user charges, solid waste service fees, and/or weed cutting charges that have not been
certified to the Treasurer by the Department of Public Works; and
Health & Hospital charges that have not been certified to the Treasurer.
Nuisance Fees by Department of Code Enforcement that have not been certified to the Treasurer.
If a successful bidder buys a “pig in a poke”, the buyer will get just that.

7. Bidding Procedure
Parcels will be offered in groups of 25 items such as items C1 through C25. At time of sale some items
will not be available; bidders should confirm an item of interest is shown in the group. Any registered
bidder may call out an item number within that range. A call for a specific item number is an offer to
purchase that item at the minimum advertised price. Once the minimum bid is made, that item is
auctioned to the highest bidder. Bid paddles must be raised high to be visible to the auctioneer and should
remain up until no longer bidding. Following the sale of an item another item number within the group of
25 parcels can be called out and auctioned. This procedure continues until there is either no calls for item
numbers within the group or all items in the group have been auctioned. At that time, the next group of
25 item numbers will be offered.
Once bidding commences on a particular item number the bidding increments will be set as deemed
appropriate solely by the auctioneer based on the number of bidders.
Minimum Bid
A call for a specific item number is an offer to purchase that item at the minimum advertised price. The
minimum bid is the total of all delinquent taxes, penalties, and special assessments presently due on the
parcel, the 2010 pay 2011 Fall taxes and special assessment fees (if any) and the $400.00 Administrative
Cost.

MARION COUNTY, INDIANA

2011 TAX SALE INFORMATION AND PROCEDURES

PAGE 5

The Administrative Cost includes $240 for the advertising expenses and actual administrative costs and
$160 for the Title Search Fee that is charged with each sale. The Title Search enables the Marion County
Auditor to notify all interested parties of public record that their office may be informed by the Auditor of
the impending issuance of a Tax Deed to a different owner. The title search remains the property of the
County Auditor.
Reoffer of Unsold Parcels
All unsold “A” and “C” parcels will be offered for sale again on the second day at the conclusion of the
first offering of parcels.
Full Payment Due the Day of Sale
Bidders must have the correct type of payment at the time of becoming a successful bidder. A high bidder
who fails to immediately pay the bid price in acceptable funds must pay a penalty of 25% of the amount of
the bid per IC. 6-1.1-24-8.

8. No Rights to Property During Redemption Period

A bidder is purchasing the tax lien; the tax lien buyer’s interest in the property is limited to the tax lien
until one of the following occurs: 1) the property is redeemed, or 2) the redemption period has expired and
the court has approved the issuance of a Tax Deed by the County Auditor, or 3) the tax lien buyer has not
surrendered the lien to the County Auditor within the prescribed 6 month period.
Redemption Period
Sold
“A” items: one year period following the date of sale.
“C” items: 120 days following the date of sale.
Unsold
“A” items: 120 days following the date of sale.
“C” items: 120 days following the date of sale.
During the redemption period the delinquent owner, occupant, or person with a substantial property
interest of public record may “redeem the property”, a term meaning to retain possession by paying all
monies owed to the county plus required fees, penalties and interest. Redemption of the tax lien sold at
tax sale results in the parcel remaining in the current owner’s name.
Tax sale buyers are trespassing if they attempt to enter the premises or exercise any ownership rights
during the redemption period and prior to the Tax Deed being issued in the buyer’s name.

9. Obtaining Tax Sale Certificate
Tax sale certificates are prepared by the Marion County Auditor and approximately four weeks after the
sale the Auditor’s office will notify the lien buyer that the tax sale certificate is available. The lien buyer
must present the tax sale receipt and photo ID to the Marion County Auditor, Room 841 of the CityCounty Building, in order to receive a Tax Certificate evidencing the buyer's lien against the property.

10. Optional Payment of Taxes During Redemption Period
A Tax Sale buyer may pay any taxes, penalties, and/or special assessments which become due on the
parcel subsequent to the Tax Sale but before the redemption period expires. Such payments can be made
by requesting a bill in person from the Marion County Treasurer and recording the payment with the
Marion County Auditor.
If the property is redeemed, the buyer will be reimbursed for recorded payments of subsequent taxes,
penalties, and/or special assessments plus interest at the rate of 10% per annum. It is the Tax Sale
Buyer’s responsibility to record any such payment in the Auditor’s office if the buyer expects to be
reimbursed when the property is redeemed.

11. Title Transfer after Redemption Period
The property will be transferred to the successful tax sale bidder if the owner does not redeem the property
during the redemption period. If the property is not redeemed within the redemption period the Tax Sale

MARION COUNTY, INDIANA

2011 TAX SALE INFORMATION AND PROCEDURES

PAGE 6

buyer may present the Tax Certificate to the County Auditor and receive a Tax Deed to the property
granting title to the property to the buyer or assignee of the buyer.
If the parcel is not redeemed and the Tax Sale buyer surrenders the Tax Certificate to receive a Tax Deed,
all delinquent taxes, penalties, and/or special assessments which became due subsequent to the Tax Sale
must be paid before the Auditor will petition the court to issue a Tax Deed to the Tax Sale buyer.
The Tax Sale buyer’s lien expires six (6) months after the expiration of the redemption period.
If the tax lien buyer wants title to the property the lien buyer must present the Tax Certificate to
the County Auditor during the 6 month period. After 6 months the lien is void and worthless.

12. Voided Sales
If, before redemption or the execution of a Tax Deed, it is found that the sale is invalid, the Tax Sale
buyer is not entitled to a Tax Deed, but shall be entitled to a refund of the purchase price plus 6% per
annum interest.
If, after the execution of a Tax Deed, it is found that the deed is invalid pursuant to I.C. 6-1.1-25-12, the
Tax Sale buyer is entitled to a lien on the property in the amount of the purchase price, any taxes or
special assessments paid subsequent to sale, and any amount due the Tax Sale buyer as an occupying
claimant plus interest at 10% per annum.

13. Statutory Payment to Lien Buyer of Redeemed Property
If a property is redeemed the Tax Sale lien buyer receives:
A. On the Minimum bid:
110% of the minimum bid if redeemed not more than 6 months after the date of sale, or
115% of the minimum bid if redeemed more than 6 months but not more than one year after the
date of sale.
B. On the difference between the successful bid price and the minimum bid (referred to as Tax Sale
Overbid):
10% per annum interest from the date of payment to the date of redemption.
C. On any taxes and special assessments paid by the Tax Sale buyer subsequent to the sale:
10% per annum interest from the date of payment to the date of redemption
A buyer who is to receive a payment as a result of redemption will be required to complete Form W-9 if a
signed form is not on file. The W-9 provides the County Auditor sufficient information to issue a 1099INT for the amount of interest and redemption fee received.

If the property is redeemed, the buyer will be reimbursed for recorded payments of subsequent taxes,
penalties, and/or special assessments plus interest at the rate of 5% per annum. It is the Tax Sale
Buyer’s responsibility to record any such payment in the Auditor’s Office if the buyer expects to be
reimbursed when the property is redeemed. Failure to record your subsequent tax payments may
mean you will not get reimbursed on a redemption.

12. Title Transfer after Redemption Period
The property will be transferred to the successful Tax Sale bidder if the owner does not redeem the
property during the redemption period. If the property is not redeemed within the redemption period the
Tax Sale buyer may present the Tax Certificate to the County Auditor and receive a Tax Deed to the
property granting title of the property to the buyer or assignee of the buyer.
If the parcel is not redeemed and the Tax Sale buyer surrenders the Tax Certificate to receive a Tax Deed,
all delinquent taxes, penalties, and/or special assessments which became due subsequent to the Tax Sale
must be paid before the Auditor will petition the court to issue a Tax Deed to the Tax Sale buyer.
The Tax Sale buyer’s lien expires three (3) months after the expiration of the redemption period.
If the tax lien buyer wants title to the property the lien buyer must present the Tax Certificate to
the County Auditor during the 3 month period. After 3 months the lien is void and worthless.

13. Voided Sales
If, before redemption or the execution of a Tax Deed, it is found that the sale is invalid, the Tax Sale
buyer is not entitled to a Tax Deed, but shall be entitled to a refund of the purchase price plus 5% per
annum interest.

14. Statutory Payment to Lien Buyer of Redeemed Property
If a property is redeemed the Tax Sale lien buyer receives:
A. On the Minimum bid:
110% of the minimum bid if redeemed not more than 6 months after the date of sale, or
115% of the minimum bid if redeemed more than 6 months but not more than one year after the
date of sale.
B. On the difference between the successful bid price and the minimum bid (referred to as Tax Sale
Overbid):
5% per annum interest from the date of payment to the date of redemption.
C. On any taxes and special assessments paid by the Tax Sale buyer subsequent to the sale:
5% per annum interest from the date of payment to the date of redemption.
A buyer who is to receive a payment as a result of redemption will be required to complete Form W-9 if a
signed form is not on file. The W-9 provides the County Auditor sufficient information to issue a 1099INT for the amount of interest and redemption fee received.

INFORMATION AND PROCEDURES

PLEASE REVIEW THE ENTIRE CONTENTS OF THIS GUIDE!
NOTE: The Tax Sale item list will be available on the Treasurer’s web page August 20th.
More information about this feature can be found on page 3 of this guide.

The following information and procedures apply to Marion County only. The statute governing tax
sales in Indiana (I.C. 6-1.1-24 &25) affords the County Auditor and County Treasurer options regarding
the manner in which the Tax Sale may be conducted. Therefore, the exact procedures by which a county
conducts a tax sale for properties with delinquent taxes and special assessments may differ from county to
county.
This public auction or “Tax Sale” of real property is required by Indiana law. While some unfortunate
circumstances may exist which result in some properties being offered for sale, it is nonetheless required
that all properties with delinquent taxes, penalties, and special
assessment liens for unpaid sewer user charges, delinquent weed
cutting fees, delinquent solid waste service fees, delinquent storm
water fees, delinquent health and hospital liens, delinquent
nuisance fees and DMD liens as specified by law, be auctioned at
the Treasurer's Tax Sale.
The Tax Sale enables the Treasurer to collect the revenue that has been levied for the operation of 42
governmental units and school districts within Marion County. The staffs of the Marion County Treasurer
and Marion County Auditor appreciate the attention of prospective bidders and buyers to the procedures
governing this Tax Sale. Thank you for your participation. Your comments are welcome.

to obtain other information about the parcels.

6. All Sales Are Final!
All sales are final, if purchased there is no refund or exchange. The office of the Marion County Treasurer
provides only the seven digit parcel number and minimum bid amount for it. Bidders are responsible for
determining any and all information regarding the parcel and its suitability. Bidders are urged to
thoroughly research the available tax sale properties to aid in identifying the exact piece of property
identified by the parcel number. Research may include, but not necessarily be limited to, a review of:
liens recorded with the Marion County Recorder;
plat maps in the County Assessor's office;
orders of the Department of Metropolitan Development and/or Health and Hospital concerning
demolition orders and unsafe buildings;
sewer user charges, solid waste service fees, and/or weed cutting charges that have not been
certified to the Treasurer by the Department of Public Works; and
Health & Hospital charges that have not been certified to the Treasurer.
Nuisance Fees by Department of Code Enforcement that have not been certified to the Treasurer.
If a successful bidder buys a “pig in a poke”, the buyer will get just that.

7. Bidding Procedure
Parcels will be offered in groups of 25 items such as items A1 through A25. At time of sale some items
will not be available; bidders should confirm an item of interest is shown in the group. Any registered
bidder may call out an item number within that range. A call for a specific item number is an offer to
purchase that item at the minimum advertised price. Once the minimum bid is made, that item is
auctioned to the highest bidder. Bid paddles must be raised high to be visible to the auctioneer and should
remain up until no longer bidding. Following the sale of an item another item number within the group of
25 parcels can be called out and auctioned. This procedure continues until there is either no calls for item
numbers within the group or all items in the group have been auctioned. At that time, the next group of
25 item numbers will be offered.
Once bidding commences on a particular item number the bidding increments will be set as deemed
appropriate solely by the auctioneer based on the number of bidders.
Minimum Bid
A call for a specific item number is an offer to purchase that item at the minimum advertised price. The
minimum bid is the total of all delinquent taxes, penalties, and special assessments presently due on the
parcel, the 2013 pay 2014 Fall taxes and special assessment fees (if any) and the $425.00 Administrative
Cost.
The Administrative Cost includes $265 for the advertising expenses and actual administrative costs and
$160.00 for the Title Search Fee that is charged with each sale. The Title Search enables the Marion
County Auditor to notify all interested parties of public record that their office may be informed by the
Auditor of the impending issuance of a Tax Deed to a different owner. The title search remains the
property of the County Auditor.

Reoffer of Unsold Parcels
All unsold “A” parcels will be offered for sale again on the second day at the conclusion of the first
offering of parcels.
Full Payment Due the Day of Sale
Bidders must have the correct type of payment at the time of becoming a successful bidder. A high bidder
who fails to immediately pay the bid price in acceptable funds must pay a penalty of 25% of the amount of
the bid per IC. 6-1.1-24-8.

8. No Rights to Property During Redemption Period

A bidder is purchasing the tax lien; the tax lien buyer’s interest in the property is limited to the tax lien
until one of the following occurs: 1) the property is redeemed, or 2) the redemption period has expired and
the court has approved the issuance of a Tax Deed by the County Auditor, or 3) the tax lien buyer has not
surrendered the lien to the County Auditor within the prescribed 6 month period.
Redemption Period
Sold
“A” items: one year period following the date of sale.
Unsold
“A” items: 120 days following the date of sale.
During the redemption period the delinquent owner, occupant, or person with a substantial property
interest of public record may “redeem the property”, a term meaning to retain possession by paying all
monies owed to the county plus required fees, penalties and interest. Redemption of the tax lien sold at
tax sale results in the parcel remaining in the current owner’s name.
Tax sale buyers are trespassing if they attempt to enter the premises or exercise any ownership rights
during the redemption period and prior to the Tax Deed being issued in the buyer’s name.

9. Obtaining Tax Sale Certificate
Tax sale certificates are prepared by the Marion County Auditor and approximately four weeks after the
sale the Auditor’s office will notify the lien buyer that the tax sale certificate is available. The lien buyer
must present the tax sale receipt and photo ID to the Marion County Auditor, Room 841 of the CityCounty Building, in order to receive a Tax Certificate evidencing the buyer's lien against the property.

10. Optional Payment of Taxes During Redemption Period
A Tax Sale buyer may pay any taxes, penalties, and/or special assessments which become due on the
parcel subsequent to the Tax Sale but before the redemption period expires. Such payments can be made
by requesting a bill in person from the Marion County Treasurer and recording the payment with the
Marion County Auditor.
If the property is redeemed, the buyer will be reimbursed for recorded payments of subsequent taxes,
penalties, and/or special assessments plus interest at the rate of 5% per annum. It is the Tax Sale
Buyer’s responsibility to record any such payment in the Auditor’s office if the buyer expects to be
reimbursed when the property is redeemed.

11. Title Transfer after Redemption Period
The property will be transferred to the successful tax sale bidder if the owner does not redeem the property
during the redemption period. If the property is not redeemed within the redemption period the Tax Sale
buyer may present the Tax Certificate to the County Auditor and receive a Tax Deed to the property
granting title to the property to the buyer or assignee of the buyer.
If the parcel is not redeemed and the Tax Sale buyer surrenders the Tax Certificate to receive a Tax Deed,
all delinquent taxes, penalties, and/or special assessments which became due subsequent to the Tax Sale
must be paid before the Auditor will petition the court to issue a Tax Deed to the Tax Sale buyer.
The Tax Sale buyer’s lien expires three (3) months after the expiration of the redemption period.

the County Auditor during the 3 month period. After 3 months the lien is void and worthless.

buyer is not entitled to a Tax Deed, but shall be entitled to a refund of the purchase price plus 5% per
annum interest.
If, after the execution of a Tax Deed, it is found that the deed is invalid pursuant to I.C. 6-1.1-25-12, the
Tax Sale buyer is entitled to a lien on the property in the amount of the purchase price, any taxes or
special assessments paid subsequent to sale, and any amount due the Tax Sale buyer as an occupying
claimant plus interest at 10% per annum.

13. Statutory Payment to Lien Buyer of Redeemed Property
If a property is redeemed the Tax Sale lien buyer receives:
A. On the Minimum bid:
110% of the minimum bid if redeemed not more than 6 months after the date of sale, or
115% of the minimum bid if redeemed more than 6 months but not more than one year after the
date of sale.

Overbid):
5% per annum interest from the date of payment to the date of redemption.
C. On any taxes and special assessments paid by the Tax Sale buyer subsequent to the sale:
5% per annum interest from the date of payment to the date of redemption.
A buyer who is to receive a payment as a result of redemption will be required to complete Form W-9 if a
signed form is not on file. The W-9 provides the County Auditor sufficient information to issue a 1099INT for the amount of interest and redemption fee received.

the court has approved the issuance of a Tax Deed by the County Auditor, or 3) the tax lien buyer has not
surrendered the lien to the County Auditor within the prescribed 3 month period.
However, pursuant to the Good Samaritan Law, Tax Sale Purchasers have certain rights and abilities of
maintaining the exterior of a property that they do not yet own. If the property is vacant, or abandoned,
the Tax Sale Purchaser may at your own risk and expense secure the property, remove trash and debris,
mow the grass, and remove paint or graffiti. Properties that are not maintained may incur nuisance
liens up to, and including, boarding, repair, demolition, high weeds and grass, and trash orders.
For more information regarding the Good Samaritan Law or to further learn about your rights, please visit
IC34-30-26 or call 317-327-4600.
Tax sale buyers are trespassing if they attempt to enter the premises or exercise any ownership rights
during the redemption period and prior to the Tax Deed being issued in the buyer’s name.
Redemption Period
Sold
“A” items: one year period following the date of sale.
Unsold
“A” items: 120 days following the date of sale.
The redemption of a tax lien sold at tax sale results in the parcel remaining in the current owner’s name
by paying all monies owed to the county plus required fees, penalties and interest.

9. Obtaining Tax Sale Certificate
Tax sale certificates are prepared by the Marion County Auditor and approximately four weeks after the
sale the Auditor’s office will notify the lien buyer that the tax sale certificate is available. The lien buyer
must present the tax sale receipt and photo ID to the Marion County Auditor, Room 841 of the CityCounty Building, in order to receive a Tax Certificate evidencing the buyer's lien against the property.

10. Optional Payment of Taxes During Redemption Period
A Tax Sale buyer may pay any taxes, penalties, and/or special assessments which become due on the
parcel subsequent to the Tax Sale but before the redemption period expires. Such payments can be made
by requesting a bill in person from the Marion County Treasurer and recording the payment with the
Marion County Auditor.
If the property is redeemed, the buyer will be reimbursed for recorded payments of subsequent taxes,
penalties, and/or special assessments plus interest at the rate of 5% per annum. It is the Tax Sale
Buyer’s responsibility to record any such payment in the Auditor’s office if the buyer expects to be

MARION COUNTY, INDIANA

reimbursed when the property is redeemed. Failure to record your subsequent tax payments may
mean you will not get reimbursed on a redemption.

11. Title Transfer after Redemption Period
The property will be transferred to the successful tax sale bidder if the owner does not redeem the property
during the redemption period. If the property is not redeemed within the redemption period the Tax Sale
buyer may present the Tax Certificate to the County Auditor and receive a Tax Deed to the property
granting title to the property to the buyer or assignee of the buyer.
If the parcel is not redeemed and the Tax Sale buyer surrenders the Tax Certificate to receive a Tax Deed,
all delinquent taxes, penalties, and/or special assessments which became due subsequent to the Tax Sale
must be paid before the Auditor will petition the court to issue a Tax Deed to the Tax Sale buyer.
The Tax Sale buyer’s lien expires three (3) months after the expiration of the redemption period.
If the tax lien buyer wants title to the property the lien buyer must present the Tax Certificate to
the County Auditor during the 3 month period. After 3 months the lien is void and worthless.

12. Voided Sales
If, before redemption or the execution of a Tax Deed, it is found that the sale is invalid, the Tax Sale
buyer is not entitled to a Tax Deed, but shall be entitled to a refund of the purchase price plus 5% per
annum interest.
If, after the execution of a Tax Deed, it is found that the deed is invalid pursuant to I.C. 6-1.1-25-12, the
Tax Sale buyer is entitled to a lien on the property in the amount of the purchase price, any taxes or
special assessments paid subsequent to sale, and any amount due the Tax Sale buyer as an occupying
claimant plus interest at 10% per annum.

13. Statutory Payment to Lien Buyer of Redeemed Property
If a property is redeemed the Tax Sale lien buyer receives:
A. On the Minimum bid:
110% of the minimum bid if redeemed not more than 6 months after the date of sale, or
115% of the minimum bid if redeemed more than 6 months but not more than one year after the
date of sale.
B. On the difference between the successful bid price and the minimum bid (referred to as Tax Sale
Overbid):
5% per annum interest from the date of payment to the date of redemption.
C. On any taxes and special assessments paid by the Tax Sale buyer subsequent to the sale:
5% per annum interest from the date of payment to the date of redemption.
A buyer who is to receive a payment as a result of redemption will be required to complete Form W-9 if a
signed form is not on file. The W-9 provides the County Auditor sufficient information to issue a 1099INT for the amount of interest and redemption fee received.

PLEASE REVIEW THE ENTIRE CONTENTS OF THIS GUIDE!
NOTE: The Tax Sale item list will be available on the Treasurer’s web page August 15th.
More information about this feature can be found on page 3 of this guide.

The following information and procedures apply to Marion County only. The statute governing tax
sales in Indiana (I.C. 6-1.1-24 &25) affords the County Auditor and County Treasurer options regarding
the manner in which the Tax Sale may be conducted. Therefore, the exact procedures by which a county
conducts a tax sale for properties with delinquent taxes and special assessments may differ from county to
county.
This public auction or “Tax Sale” of real property is required by Indiana law. While some unfortunate
circumstances may exist which result in some properties being offered for sale, it is nonetheless required
that all properties with delinquent taxes, penalties, and special
assessment liens for unpaid sewer user charges, delinquent weed
cutting fees, delinquent solid waste service fees, delinquent storm
water fees, delinquent health and hospital liens, delinquent
nuisance fees and DMD liens as specified by law, be auctioned at
the Treasurer's Tax Sale.
The Tax Sale enables the Treasurer to collect the revenue that has been levied for the operation of 42
governmental units and school districts within Marion County. The staffs of the Marion County Treasurer
and Marion County Auditor appreciate the attention of prospective bidders and buyers to the procedures
governing this Tax Sale. Thank you for your participation. Your comments are welcome.

5. Eligible Parcels In Sale
Parcel Identification
The seven digit “parcel number” identifies a property and identifies the exact property being offered.
While the owner and/or common address is advertised and/or read at the sale it is the parcel number that
must be used to establish the exact property and location. All sales are final; the bidder is responsible
for determining the parcel location.
Item Number Order of Sale
Parcels will be offered for sale in Item Number sequence, as identified in newspaper ads. Every parcel
has an item number and all item numbers start with “49A” followed by the assigned numeric number.
Combined Parcels
Combined parcels will be announced by the auctioneer. A list of combinations will be distributed before
the sale and posted at www.indy.gov/egov/county/treasurer/sale The minimum price presented is the
total of charges on all the parcels that are combined. Certain parcels, usually abutting and/or for which

CD: A CD in Microsoft Excel format can be purchased for $20.00 from the Treasurer’s office beginning

advertisement.
Web page: Beginning Wednesday, August 15, 2012, a PDF file to view or download will be available
and is updated nightly. The file is in the same format as the newspaper list. The Web address for viewing
and/or downloading is www.indy.gov/egov/county/treasurer/sale

from the Treasurer’s office beginning Wednesday, August 15th through the end of the tax sale. Only the
Tax Sale Item Number will appear on the list, it is necessary to have one of the original listings to be able
to obtain other information about the parcels.

6. All Sales Are Final!
All sales are final, if purchased there is no refund or exchange. The office of the Marion County Treasurer
provides only the seven digit parcel number and minimum bid amount for it. Bidders are responsible for
determining any and all information regarding the parcel and its suitability. Bidders are urged to
thoroughly research the available tax sale properties to aid in identifying the exact piece of property
identified by the parcel number. Research may include, but not necessarily be limited to, a review of:
liens recorded with the Marion County Recorder;
plat maps in the County Assessor's office;
orders of the Department of Metropolitan Development and/or Health and Hospital concerning
demolition orders and unsafe buildings;
sewer user charges, solid waste service fees, and/or weed cutting charges that have not been
certified to the Treasurer by the Department of Public Works; and
Health & Hospital charges that have not been certified to the Treasurer.
Nuisance Fees by Department of Code Enforcement that have not been certified to the Treasurer.
If a successful bidder buys a “pig in a poke”, the buyer will get just that.

7. Bidding Procedure
Parcels will be offered in groups of 25 items such as items A1 through A25. At time of sale some items
will not be available; bidders should confirm an item of interest is shown in the group. Any registered
bidder may call out an item number within that range. A call for a specific item number is an offer to
purchase that item at the minimum advertised price. Once the minimum bid is made, that item is
auctioned to the highest bidder. Bid paddles must be raised high to be visible to the auctioneer and should
remain up until no longer bidding. Following the sale of an item another item number within the group of
25 parcels can be called out and auctioned. This procedure continues until there is either no calls for item
numbers within the group or all items in the group have been auctioned. At that time, the next group of
25 item numbers will be offered.
Once bidding commences on a particular item number the bidding increments will be set as deemed
appropriate solely by the auctioneer based on the number of bidders.
Minimum Bid
A call for a specific item number is an offer to purchase that item at the minimum advertised price. The
minimum bid is the total of all delinquent taxes, penalties, and special assessments presently due on the
parcel, the 2011 pay 2012 Fall taxes and special assessment fees (if any) and the $442.50 Administrative
Cost.
The Administrative Cost includes $275 for the advertising expenses and actual administrative costs and
$167.50 for the Title Search Fee that is charged with each sale. The Title Search enables the Marion
County Auditor to notify all interested parties of public record that their office may be informed by the
Auditor of the impending issuance of a Tax Deed to a different owner. The title search remains the
property of the County Auditor.

Reoffer of Unsold Parcels
All unsold “A” parcels will be offered for sale again on the second day at the conclusion of the first
offering of parcels.
Full Payment Due the Day of Sale

who fails to immediately pay the bid price in acceptable funds must pay a penalty of 25% of the amount of
the bid per IC. 6-1.1-24-8.

8. No Rights to Property During Redemption Period

During the redemption period the delinquent owner, occupant, or person with a substantial property
interest of public record may “redeem the property”, a term meaning to retain possession by paying all
monies owed to the county plus required fees, penalties and interest. Redemption of the tax lien sold at
tax sale results in the parcel remaining in the current owner’s name.

during the redemption period and prior to the Tax Deed being issued in the buyer’s name.

by requesting a bill in person from the Marion County Treasurer and recording the payment with the
Marion County Auditor.
If the property is redeemed, the buyer will be reimbursed for recorded payments of subsequent taxes,
penalties, and/or special assessments plus interest at the rate of 10% per annum. It is the Tax Sale
Buyer’s responsibility to record any such payment in the Auditor’s office if the buyer expects to be
reimbursed when the property is redeemed.

11. Title Transfer after Redemption Period
The property will be transferred to the successful tax sale bidder if the owner does not redeem the property
during the redemption period. If the property is not redeemed within the redemption period the Tax Sale
buyer may present the Tax Certificate to the County Auditor and receive a Tax Deed to the property
granting title to the property to the buyer or assignee of the buyer.
If the parcel is not redeemed and the Tax Sale buyer surrenders the Tax Certificate to receive a Tax Deed,
all delinquent taxes, penalties, and/or special assessments which became due subsequent to the Tax Sale
must be paid before the Auditor will petition the court to issue a Tax Deed to the Tax Sale buyer.
The Tax Sale buyer’s lien expires six (6) months after the expiration of the redemption period.

6.  All Sales Are Final!
All sales are final, if purchased there is no refund or exchange.  The
office of the Marion County Treasurer provides only the seven digit parcel
number and minimum bid amount for it.  Bidders are responsible for
determining any and all information regarding the parcel and its
suitability.  Bidders are urged to thoroughly research the available tax
sale properties to aid in identifying the exact piece of property
identified by the parcel number.  Research may include, but not necessarily
be limited to, a review of:

      liens recorded with the Marion County Recorder;
      plat maps in the County Assessor's office;
      orders of the Department of Metropolitan Development and/or Health
      and Hospital concerning demolition orders and unsafe buildings;
      sewer user charges, solid waste service fees, and/or weed cutting
      charges that have not been certified to the Treasurer by the
      Department of Public Works; and
      Health & Hospital charges that have not been certified to the
      Treasurer.
      Nuisance Fees by Department of Code Enforcement that have not been
      certified to the Treasurer.

If a successful bidder buys a “pig in a poke”, the buyer will get just
that.

7.  Bidding Procedure
Parcels will be offered in groups of 25 items such as items A1 through A25.
At time of sale some items will not be available; bidders should confirm an
item of interest is shown in the group.  Any registered bidder may call out
an item number within that range. A call for a specific item number is an
offer to purchase that item at the minimum advertised price. Once the
minimum bid is made, that item is auctioned to the highest bidder. Bid
paddles must be raised high to be visible to the auctioneer and should
remain up until no longer bidding.  Following the sale of an item another
item number within the group of 25 parcels can be called out and auctioned.
 This procedure continues until there is either no calls for item numbers
within the group or all items in the group have been auctioned.  At that
time, the next group of 25 item numbers will be offered.

Once bidding commences on a particular item number the bidding increments
will be set as deemed appropriate solely by the auctioneer based on the
number of bidders.

Minimum Bid
A call for a specific item number is an offer to purchase that item at the
minimum advertised price. The minimum bid is the total of all delinquent
taxes, penalties, and special assessments presently due on the parcel, the
2012 pay 2013 Fall taxes and special assessment fees (if any) and the
$450.00 Administrative Cost.
The Administrative Cost includes $267.00 for the advertising expenses, pre
sale title search and actual administrative costs and $183.00 for the after
Title Search Fee that is charged with each sale.  The Title Search enables
the Marion County Auditor to notify all interested parties of public record
that their office may be informed by the Auditor of the impending issuance
of a Tax Deed to a different owner. The title search remains the property
of the County Auditor.

Reoffer of Unsold Parcels
All unsold “A” parcels will be offered for sale again on the second day at
the conclusion of the first offering of parcels.

Full Payment Due the Day of Sale
Bidders must have the correct type of payment at the time of becoming a
successful bidder. A high bidder who fails to immediately pay the bid price
in acceptable funds must pay a penalty of 25% of the amount of the bid per
IC. 6-1.1-24-8.

8.  No Rights to Property During Redemption Period
A bidder is purchasing the tax lien; the tax lien buyer’s interest in the
property is limited to the tax lien until one of the following occurs: 1)
the property is redeemed, or 2) the redemption period has expired and the
court has approved the issuance of a Tax Deed by the County Auditor, or 3)
the tax lien buyer has not surrendered the lien to the County Auditor
within the prescribed 6 month period.

Redemption Period
Sold
“A” items:  one year period following the date of sale.
“C” items: 120 days following the date of sale.
Unsold
“A” items:  120 days following the date of sale.
“C” items: 120 days following the date of sale.

During the redemption period the delinquent owner, occupant, or person with
a substantial property interest of public record may “redeem the property”,
a term meaning to retain possession by paying all monies owed to the county
plus required fees, penalties and interest.  Redemption of the tax lien
sold at tax sale results in the parcel remaining in the current owner’s
name.

Tax sale buyers are trespassing if they attempt to enter the premises or
exercise any ownership rights during the redemption period and prior to the
Tax Deed being issued in the buyer’s name.

9.  Obtaining Tax Sale Certificate
Tax sale certificates are prepared by the Marion County Auditor and
approximately four weeks after the sale the Auditor’s office will notify
the lien buyer that the tax sale certificate is available.  The lien buyer
must present the tax sale receipt and photo ID to the Marion County
Auditor, Room 841 of the City-County Building, in order to receive a Tax
Certificate evidencing the buyer's lien against the property.

10.  Optional Payment of Taxes During Redemption Period
A Tax Sale buyer may pay any taxes, penalties, and/or special assessments
which become due on the parcel subsequent to the Tax Sale but before the
redemption period expires. Such payments can be made by requesting a bill
in person from the Marion County Treasurer and recording the payment with
the Marion County Auditor.

If the property is redeemed, the buyer will be reimbursed for recorded
payments of subsequent taxes, penalties, and/or special assessments plus
interest at the rate of 10% per annum.  It is the Tax Sale Buyer’s
responsibility to record any such payment in the Auditor’s office if the
buyer expects to be reimbursed when the property is redeemed.

11.  Title Transfer after Redemption Period
The property will be transferred to the successful tax sale bidder if the
owner does not redeem the property during the redemption period.  If the
property is not redeemed within the redemption period the Tax Sale buyer
may present the Tax Certificate to the County Auditor and receive a Tax
Deed to the property granting title to the property to the buyer or
assignee of the buyer.

If the parcel is not redeemed and the Tax Sale buyer surrenders the Tax
Certificate to receive a Tax Deed, all delinquent taxes, penalties, and/or
special assessments which became due subsequent to the Tax Sale must be
paid before the Auditor will petition the court to issue a Tax Deed to the
Tax Sale buyer.

The Tax Sale buyer’s lien expires six (6) months after the expiration of
the redemption period.
If the tax lien buyer wants title to the property the lien buyer must
present the Tax Certificate to the County Auditor during the 6 month
period.  After 6 months the lien is void and worthless.

12.  Voided Sales
If, before redemption or the execution of a Tax Deed, it is found that the
sale is invalid, the Tax Sale buyer is not entitled to a Tax Deed, but
shall be entitled to a refund of the purchase price plus 6% per annum
interest.

If, after the execution of a Tax Deed, it is found that the deed is invalid
pursuant to I.C. 6-1.1-25-12, the Tax Sale buyer is entitled to a lien on
the property in the amount of the purchase price, any taxes or special
assessments paid subsequent to sale, and any amount due the Tax Sale buyer
as an occupying claimant plus interest at 10% per annum.

13.  Statutory Payment to Lien Buyer of Redeemed Property
If a property is redeemed the Tax Sale lien buyer receives:

    A. On the Minimum bid:
      110% of the minimum bid if redeemed not more than 6 months after the
      date of sale, or
      115% of the minimum bid if redeemed more than 6 months but not more
      than one year after the      date of sale.


      B. On the difference between the successful bid price and the minimum
bid (referred to as Tax Sale
            Overbid):
      10% per annum interest from the date of payment to the date of
      redemption.

      C.  On any taxes and special assessments paid by the Tax Sale buyer
subsequent to the sale:
      10% per annum interest from the date of payment to the date of
      redemption

A buyer who is to receive a payment as a result of redemption will be
required to complete Form W-9 if a signed form is not on file. The W-9
provides the County Auditor sufficient information to issue a 1099-INT for
the amount of interest and redemption fee received.
