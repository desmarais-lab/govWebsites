The Elkhart-Goshen Housing Market
Area (HMA) is coterminous with the
Elkhart-Goshen, IN Metropolitan
Statistical Area (MSA) and comprises Elkhart County in north-central
Indiana. The HMA is 110 miles east
of Chicago along Interstate 80. The
HMA is considered the recreational
vehicle (RV) manufacturing capital of
the country, producing 80 percent of all
RVs made in the United States (Elkhart
County Convention & Visitors Bureau).

Economy
Nonfarm payrolls in the ElkhartGoshen HMA have improved substantially since 2010, but they have not yet
returned to prerecession levels. During
the 12 months ending October 2015,
nonfarm payrolls increased by 4,500
jobs, or 3.7 percent, from the previous 12 months. The manufacturing
sector added the most jobs, followed
by the wholesale and retail trade
sector. Only one sector—the mining,
logging, and construction sector—lost
jobs. Nonfarm payrolls are expected
to expand an average of 2.2 percent
annually during the 3-year forecast
period, led by continued growth in the
manufacturing sector.

Rental Market
Rental housing market conditions in
the HMA are currently balanced, with
an estimated vacancy rate of 6.0
percent, down from 13.4 percent in
April 2010. The apartment market in
the HMA is tight, with a 3.2-percent
vacancy rate during the third quarter
of 2015, down from a 5.1-percent
vacancy rate during the third quarter
of 2014. (Reis, Inc.) During the next
3 years, demand is estimated for 820
new market-rate rental units, but no
rental units are currently under
construction (Table 1).
Table 1. Housing Demand in the
Elkhart-Goshen HMA
During the Forecast Period

Sales Market
Sales housing market conditions in the
HMA are soft but improving, with a
vacancy rate estimated at 2.0 percent,
down from 2.7 percent in April 2010.
During the 12 months ending October 2015, total home sales increased
2 percent, to 3,550 homes sold, and
the average home sales price increased
4 percent, to $151,800. Demand is
forecast for 1,475 new homes during
the next 3 years (Table 1). The 100
homes currently under construction
and a portion of the estimated 2,400
other vacant housing units that may
reenter the sales market are expected
to satisfy some of the demand during
the forecast period.

a strong presence in the HMA since
the 1940s. Approximately 80 percent
of all RVs produced in the United
States are made in the HMA, and
local economic conditions change
with the national demand for RVs.
The transportation equipment manufacturing industry, which includes
the RV industry, accounts for nearly
one-half of all manufacturing jobs,
or approximately one-fourth of all
payroll jobs in the HMA. Of the 10
largest employers in the HMA, 5 are
in the manufacturing sector, and 4 of
the 5 manufacture RVs (Table 2).
Overall economic conditions in
the HMA have been improving
continually since 2010, and they
continued to strengthen during the
12 months ending October 2015.
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 4,500
jobs, or 3.7 percent, to 126,800 jobs
(Table 3), slower than the gain of
4,800 jobs, or 4.1 percent, during the
previous 12 months. Approximately
58 percent of net job gains during
the past 12 months were attributable
to the manufacturing sector, down
from 67 percent during the previous
12 months. The unemployment rate
averaged 4.3 percent, down from
5.5 percent during the previous 12
months, and well below the peak of
17.9 percent during 2009 (Figure 1).
Despite the recent increase in jobs,
average weekly earnings have declined during the past 2 years because
employees are working fewer hours.
During the 12 months ending October
2015, weekly wages averaged $731,
down $37 from the recent high of
$768 per week during the 12 months
ending October 2013, reducing
household incomes. Table DP-1 at the
end of this report provides additional
employment data.

Changes in total nonfarm payrolls
have been dominated by trends in the
manufacturing sector for decades.
No other sector impacts the local
economy to the same extent as the
manufacturing sector. From 2003
through 2006, a period of strong
nonfarm payroll growth, annual job
growth in the HMA averaged 3,100
jobs, or 2.5 percent, and 65 percent of
the net job gains were in the manufacturing sector. The two next largest
sectors contributing to increasing
payrolls from 2003 through 2006 were
the professional and business services
and the education and health services
sectors, which each accounted for 13
percent of net job gains. From 2007
through 2009, during the national recession, nonfarm payrolls in the HMA
declined by an average of 11,500 jobs,
or 9.6 percent, annually. Approximately 75 percent of net job loss occurred
in the manufacturing sector, and the
sector with the next most significant
job loss was the wholesale and retail
trade sector, which accounted for 9 percent of net loss. Since 2010, payrolls
have increased by 5,000 jobs, or 4.6
percent, annually, to 126,800 jobs,
and 72 percent of jobs added were in
the manufacturing sector. Increasing
payrolls in the service-providing
sectors have also contributed to local

job growth, but the average annual
addition of 1,500 jobs in these sectors
is still less than one-half the average
annual job growth in the manufacturing sector.
The manufacturing sector, with
59,700 jobs in the HMA, accounted
for 47.1 percent of all nonfarm
payrolls during the 12 months ending
October 2015, nearly three times as
many jobs as the next largest sector
(Figure 2). From 2003 through 2006,
the manufacturing sector added an
average of 2,000 jobs, or 3.4 percent,
annually, when national RV shipments grew from 311,000 in 2002 to a
peak of 390,500 in 2006 (Recreational
Vehicle Industry Association). From
2007 through 2009, manufacturing
payrolls declined by an average of
8,600 jobs, or 15.7 percent, annually,
coinciding with a 14-percent average
annual decrease in national RV
shipments. From peak to trough, the
manufacturing sector in the HMA
lost 25,900 jobs, but, since 2010, has
regained 20,900, at an average pace of
3,600 jobs, or 7.7 percent, annually,
and RV shipments continue to increase. Despite the recent gains, jobs
in the manufacturing sector during
the 12 months ending October 2015
are 5,000 below the prerecessionary
peak in 2006 of 64,700 jobs and are
3,000 jobs, or 5.0 percent, below the
total number of manufacturing jobs in
2000 (Figure 3).
The wholesale and retail trade,
education and health services, and
professional and business services sectors are the three next largest sectors
in the HMA, accounting for 12.7, 9.0,
and 8.1 percent, respectively, of total
nonfarm payrolls during the past 12
months. These sectors also declined
during the 2007-to-2009 recession in
the HMA but are currently near or

above prerecessionary payroll levels.
During the 12 months ending October
2015, these sectors added 800, 300,
and 400 jobs at growth rates of 5.2,
2.7, and 4.0 percent, respectively.
Openings or expansions in these sectors during 2015 include a $74 million
addition of a surgery center at Elkhart
General Hospital and at Shoppes on
Six, a retail development anchored by
Ross, PetSmart, and Shore Carnival;
no estimates of added jobs at these
sites were released.
The leisure and hospitality sector,
although a relatively small sector,
with fewer than 6 percent of all
nonfarm payroll jobs in the HMA,
was the fastest growing sector during
the 12 months ending October 2015,
increasing 5.6 percent, or by 400 jobs,
continuing growth that began in 2011.
Visitor spending contributed more
than $431.9 million to the Elkhart
County economy in 2013 (the most
recent data available) compared with
$401.6 million in 2011, indicating an
annual increase of nearly 4.0 percent
(Economic Impact of Elkhart County’s Tourism and Travel Industry,

2011 and 2013). Spending in the category of attractions, such as Amish
cultural sites and the Recreational
Vehicle and Manufactured Housing
Hall of Fame, was the second largest
expenditure after lodging, accounting
for $76.7 million in direct spending.
During the 3-year forecast period, job
growth in the HMA is expected to
slow because RV shipment growth has
been slowing since 2013 but continues
to remain positive. Nonfarm payrolls
are expected to increase by 2,925 jobs,
or 2.4 percent, annually. Job growth
is expected to be strongest in the first
year of the forecast period and to
slow in the second and third years as
RV shipment growth slows. Payroll
gains in the manufacturing sector are
expected to lead job growth in the
HMA. Based on job announcements
made by more than 30 companies in
the manufacturing sector during 2014
and 2015, the addition of at least
2,850 jobs is expected in the sector,
which will make approximately $200
million in capital investments over
the next 3 years. Most of the jobs
announced are in the RV industry.

Population and Households
s of November 1, 2015, the
population of the ElkhartGoshen HMA is estimated at
204,200, reflecting an average increase
of 1,200, or 0.6 percent, annually
since April 2010 (Figure 4). Current
population growth is up from the
annual increase of 670 people, or 0.3
percent, from 2006 to 2010 but is less
than the annual increase of 2,625
people, or 1.4 percent, from 2002 to
2006 (U.S. Census Bureau, July 1
estimates). Despite strong job growth
since 2010, nearly all population
increases since 2006 have been the
result of net natural increase (resident
births minus resident deaths). From
2002 to 2006, net in-migration
averaged 730 people annually,

HMA, 2000 to Forecast

accounting for 28 percent of population growth. From 2006 to 2010, as
payrolls contracted, in-migration
switched to net out-migration,
averaging 1,325 people annually.
Since 2010, payrolls have grown, but
net out-migration is still averaging
280 people annually (Figure 5). With
the high level of unemployed workers
at the end of the decade, current
residents have filled most of the newly
created jobs. Most residents leaving
the HMA moved to an adjacent
county or a nearby larger metropolitan area, such as Chicago or Indianapolis, and most people moving into
the HMA came from the same places
but at a lower rate than those leaving
(Internal Revenue Service). Contributing to slower population growth is a
declining net natural increase, which
averaged 1,925 people annually from
2002 to 2010 but declined 24 percent,
to an average of 1,475 people a year
from 2010 to 2014.

Population growth is concentrated in
the smaller towns and unincorporated
areas of the HMA. The two largest
cities—Elkhart and Goshen—had
populations of 51,400 and 32,250,
respectively, in 2014, accounting for
25 and 16 percent of the HMA
population. The remaining 59 percent
of the population lived in smaller
towns or unincorporated areas in the
HMA, up from 58 percent in 2010
and 56 percent in 2000. Approximately 77 percent of the population
growth from 2010 to 2014 was
outside the two largest cities, and
most housing development also
occurred outside Elkhart and Goshen.
The rate of household growth in the
Elkhart-Goshen HMA since 2010 is
currently slightly faster than the
average growth rate from 2000 to
2010 because of improved economic

conditions and lower levels of
out-migration. As of November 1,
2015, an estimated 73,050 households
reside in the HMA, reflecting an
average annual increase of 500
households, or 0.7 percent, since 2010
compared with an average growth of
410 households, or 0.6 percent, a year
from 2000 to 2010. The number of
households has grown at a faster rate
than the population since 2010 but
has grown at a slower rate than the
population during the 2000s. The
homeownership rate is currently
estimated at 66.9 percent, or 48,850

households, down from 70.0 percent,
or 49,200 households, in 2010 and
from 72.2 percent in 2000. Figure 6
shows the number of households by
tenure in 2000, 2010, and the current
date. Tighter lending standards and a
decrease in average weekly wages
during the past 2 years contributed to
the continued decline in homeownership.
Population and household growth are
expected to continue to the forecast
date as job opportunities attract new
residents to the HMA. An estimated
increase of 209,200 residents and
74,800 households is expected by the
forecast date, which is an average
annual addition of 1,675 residents
and 580 households, or 0.8 percent
for both, higher than the rates during
the previous 5 years. As economic
conditions continue to improve and
unemployment continues to decline,
migration is expected to switch from
net out-migration to net in-migration,
supporting the faster population and
household growth.

Housing Market Trends
Sales Market
The sales housing market in the
Elkhart-Goshen HMA is soft but
improving. As of November 2015, the
sales vacancy rate is estimated to be
2.0 percent, down from 2.7 percent
in April 2010. During the 12 months
ending October 2015, total home
sales (including new and existing
single-family homes, townhomes, and
condominiums) increased to 3,550
homes sold, up more than 2 percent from the previous 12 months

(CoreLogic, Inc., with adjustments by
the analyst). Regular, nondistressed
sales increased the most, up 9 percent,
to 3,025 homes sold, compared with
the number sold during the previous
12 months, reflecting the highest
annual count since 2007. Short sales
decreased 19 percent, to 80 homes
sold, and real estate owned (REO)
sales fell 34 percent, to 300 homes
sold, continuing a period of decline
in distressed sales that began in 2014.

Sales Market Continued

Job growth and strong efforts by local
nonprofit organizations to provide
foreclosure-prevention assistance
contributed to fewer REO and short
sales. La Casa, the largest housingfocused nonprofit organization in
the HMA, helped 127 households
avoid foreclosure during 2014 (La
Casa, Inc.). In October 2015, 4.5
percent of home loans in the HMA
were seriously delinquent (90 or more
days delinquent or in foreclosure)
or had transitioned into REO status
compared with 5.3 percent in October
2014 and a high of 12.9 percent in
January 2010 (Black Knight Financial
Services, Inc.). At its peak, the HMA
rate of seriously delinquent loans
and REO properties was higher than
the 9.3-percent peak rate in Indiana,
which also occurred in January 2010;
the current local rate is lower than the
current state rate of 4.8 percent.

Total sales for the past 12 months are
above the recent low of 2,825 homes
sold reached during 2009, but they
remain below the average of 4,800
homes sold each year from 2003
through 2006, the previous period
of job growth. From 2007 through
2009, when payrolls were declining
and unemployment was on the rise,
total sales decreased an average of
16 percent annually. New home sales,
which accounted for only 7 percent of
all homes sold, decreased an average

of 36 percent each year and existing
sales dropped 15 percent annually.
Distressed sales (REO and short
sales) accounted for less than 10
percent of total sales during 2007 but,
in 2009, at the height of the national
and local recession, comprised more
than 30 percent of all sales. Since
2010, when economic conditions in
the HMA improved, total sales have
increased an average of 3 percent
annually. A decline in distressed
sales, continued low levels of new
home sales (averaging 120 homes
sold annually, or less than 4 percent
of all sales), out-migration, and lower
weekly wages contributed to slower
growth in sales.
Home sales prices for all new and
existing homes (including singlefamily homes, townhomes, and
condominiums) increased an average
of 6 percent a year from 2011 to
$146,500 for the 12 months ending
October 2014. During the past 12
months, the average sales price was
$151,800, up by $5,350, or 4 percent,
from the previous 12 months. Current
prices are $33,900, or 29 percent,
above the recessionary low reached
in 2007 but are $10,900, or 7 percent,
below the recent high reached in
2010. From 2003 through 2007, sales
prices increased an average of 11
percent annually and then declined an
average of 10 percent annually from
2007 through 2010.
Single-family home construction,
as measured by the number of
single-family homes permitted, has
been relatively stable in the ElkhartGoshen HMA during the past 24
months, averaging approximately 260
homes permitted for each 12-month
period, but remains below levels from
the early 2000s (Figure 7). From
2000 through 2006, the number of

single-family homes permitted averaged 970 homes annually but then
declined from 2007 through 2009 by
an average of 240 homes per year, to
a low of 140 homes during 2009. Job
losses in the HMA and tighter lending
standards contributed to the reduced
number of homes permitted. From
2010 through 2014, despite increasing
payrolls, single-family construction
remained low, at an average of 220
homes permitted annually. Of the 1,125
single-family homes permitted since
2010, only approximately 170 homes,
or 15 percent, were permitted by the
cities of Elkhart and Goshen. The
remaining 85 percent of homes were
permitted in smaller towns or unincorporated areas, mostly in subdivisions
that were platted in 2007 or earlier.
New residential developments have
been minimal since 2010 (McGraw
Hill Construction Pipeline database),
but several developments are
completing the approval process, with
construction expected to begin in
2016. Two older subdivisions—North
Meadow Estates and Timberstone—
are actively building homes. North
Meadow Estates, a 130-lot subdivision
in Goshen that began construction in
1999, is building homes with starting
prices at $145,000, and Timberstone,
with 160 home sites just outside
Elkhart that started construction in

2003, is building single-family attached
and detached homes that are selling
at an average sales price of $300,000.
Lots in North Meadow Estates are 88
percent sold and lots in Timberstone
are 51 percent sold. Two new developments are planned for the Millrace
area, a canalside neighborhood near
downtown Goshen. The Millrace
Neighborhood is a 15-unit cooperative
housing development. The privately
owned one- and two-bedroom homes
range in price from $130,000 to
$250,000. Millrace Townhomes is a
24-unit townhome development, with
homes ranging in size from 1,200
to 6,000 square feet; construction is
expected to begin in the spring of
2016.
During the 3-year forecast period,
economic conditions are expected
to continue to improve, resulting in
demand for 1,475 homes (Table 1).
Demand is expected to be greatest
for new homes in the $130,000to-$250,000 price range (Table 4).
Demand is expected to be highest in
the first year and then decline slightly
during the second and third years,
when job growth moderates and inmigration stabilizes. The 100 homes
currently under construction and a
portion of the 2,400 other vacant
units that may reenter the market will
likely satisfy some of the demand.

Rental Market
Rental housing market conditions
in the Elkhart-Goshen HMA are
balanced but tightening, with an
estimated vacancy rate of 6.0 percent,
down from 13.4 percent in April 2010
(Figure 8). The rental housing mix
is approximately 36 percent singlefamily homes; 53 percent multifamily
units, which includes townhomes,
condominiums, and apartments;
and 11 percent mobile homes (U.S.
Census Bureau, July 1 estimates,
2014). The share of single-family
homes in the rental inventory is up
from 34 percent of all rental housing
in 2010. Despite the increased portion
of single-family homes for rent, the
market share of this unit type is
expected to have peaked and be on
the decline because absentee owner
purchases peaked in 2013, with a high
of 23 percent of total home sales, and
have since decreased to 19 percent of
home sales during the first 10 months
of 2015.
Conditions in the apartment market
are tight, with a 3.2-percent vacancy
rate during the third quarter of 2015,
down from 5.1 percent in the third
quarter of 2014 and significantly
below a high of 17.1 percent during
2009 (Reis, Inc.). Apartment rents
averaged $731 during the third quarter
of 2015, up 3 percent from $709 a

year earlier. Monthly rents averaged
$452, $630, $801, and $901 for studio,
one-bedroom, two-bedroom, and
three-bedroom units, respectively. By
comparison, average monthly rents
were $927, $978, $1,177, and $1,450,
respectively, for the same unit types in
the Reis-defined Midwestern region.
The Reis-defined region includes
metropolitan areas in Indiana and
11 other states in the Plains and
Great Lakes regions, many of which
are likely to have a higher portion
of market-rate new construction
apartments. In the HMA, rent growth
during the previous 12 months was
greatest for units with fewer bedrooms and lowest for units with more
bedrooms. Monthly rents increased
an average of nearly 2 percent for studio and one-bedroom units, increased
less than 1 percent for two-bedroom
units, and declined nearly 1 percent
for three-bedroom units. The slower
rent growth for apartments with two
or more bedrooms can be attributed,
in part, to the relatively high number
of single-family homes for rent and
competitively priced for-sale units.
New multifamily construction,
especially for market-rate apartments, has been very low in the
Elkhart-Goshen HMA since 2009.

as measured by the number of units
permitted, averaged 410 units annually from 2000 through 2003 and then
decreased to 85 units annually from
2004 through 2010 (Figure 9). The
number of units permitted continued
to decline to an average of only 15 a
year from 2011 through 2014, and no
units were permitted in 2015. Since
2000, approximately 85 percent of
all multifamily units permitted were
apartments, and the rest were two- to
four-unit townhomes, most of which
were built in the early 2000s to mid2000s. No condominium buildings
with five or more units have been
built in the HMA since the 1980s.
In the past 15 years, 21 apartment
developments were constructed in
the HMA (McGraw-Hill Construction Pipeline database). Only 2 of
those developments, The Highlands

Apartments, built in 2000, and Regent
Square, built in 2003, are market-rate
properties for general occupancy. Of
the remaining 19 apartment properties,
10 are income restricted, 7 are age
restricted, and 2 are both income
and age restricted. Since 2009, the
3 apartment complexes, representing a
total of 113 units, have been developed
and all include income-restricted
units. The newest building, a 37-unit
mixed-income development called The
Hawks opened in the spring of 2015
and attained 100 percent occupancy
within 1 month of opening. Rent
for a one-bedroom unit is $623 for a
household earning 60 percent of Area
Median Income (AMI), for a twobedroom unit is $747 for a household
earning 60 percent of AMI, and for
a market-rate two-bedroom unit is
$875. It is part of the larger Millrace
redevelopment site near the canal in
downtown Goshen. An additional 24
units are planned at The Hawks, but
construction has not yet begun.

During the 3-year forecast period,
demand is expected for 820 additional
rental units (Table 1). Most of the
demand will be for one- and twobedroom units (Table 5). Demand is
expected to be highest in the first year
and decline slightly during the second
and third years of the forecast period.

Zone grant. The grant of $4 million will be used to build or rehabilitate
more than 300 homes, renew commercial activity and provide a complete
revitalization of the neighborhoods.

Mission Statement:
The Department of Metropolitan Development supports the vision of the City of
Indianapolis to promote safe streets, strong neighborhoods and a thriving
economy. This vision is given effect by planning and implementing services
and projects that stimulate affordable housing, promote economic development,
empower neighborhoods, and create jobs.

•

Unsafe Buildings
The Department works with the Marion County Health and Hospital
Corporation to board and demolish unsafe buildings. In 1998, 1087 were
boarded and 241 houses were demolished. Additionally, the City has and
will continue to redevelop formerly environmentally unsafe land for future
development.

•

The 2000 - 2004 Consolidated Plan
The Consolidated Plan is a requirement of the U.S. Department of Housing
and Urban Development to receive Community Development Block Grant
(CDBG), HOME Investment Partnership Grant (HOME), Emergency
Shelter Grant (ESG), and Housing for Persons with AIDS Grant
(HOPWA). The plan will be completed by the end of the year. It is a fiveyear strategy for housing and community development and includes the
one year action plan for use of the above listed funds. The Division of
Planning is completing the five year portion of the plan which includes
documentation of priority housing and non-housing community
development needs. The Division of Community Development and
Financial Services is completing the one year action plan.

•

Knozone Public Awareness Program
The Department continued implementation and refinement of the Knozone
Public Awareness Program, including new television and radio ad
campaigns, bicycle giveaways, the elementary school program, and
reduced bus fares on Nozone Action Days. This project will continue in
2000.

Significant Events:
•

16th & MLK Redevelopment Area
The Department facilitated the acquisition of property for the
redevelopment of the NCAA Distribution Center. A portion of the facility
will be occupied August 1, 1999 with the remainder to be developed in
2000.

•

Brownfields
In 1999, the Division has facilitated redevelopment at over 20 Brownfield
sites (City owned and privately owned) such as the M-Metals property, the
Bemis Bag property, and the Shell-Bulk property.

•

Affordable Housing
The Department continued to lead the way in ambitious and
comprehensive efforts to rebuild many of our inner-city neighborhoods. In
1998, the Department invested in the rehabilitation of 596 rental units, the
repair of 345 owner-occupied homes, and the creation of 88 new home
ownership opportunities. For 1999, the Department has entered into
contracts that should result at a minimum in the repair of 244 owner
occupied homes and the creation of 63 new home ownership opportunities.

•

Home Ownership Zone
Over the next two years, the Department will continue to coordinate the
community’s efforts to rehabilitate King Park through a Home Ownership

Township Facilities and Services Needs Assessments
To be completed by the end of 1999, these studies look at the supply and
demand for various social and civic services and facilities on a township by
township basis. The studies look at the current situation and projects
future needs in 2020 and at time of build-out.
Contaminated Wells
The Department organized public meetings with several neighborhoods to
facilitate the extension of public water mains where the drinking water
wells have been contaminated. This is a continuation of the project started
in 1998 where four neighborhoods with contaminated wells have now been
connected to public water.
New Augusta
The Department will work with the New Augusta Village Association to
develop and implement the New Augusta Conservation District Historic
Area Preservation Plan. It was designated as the third Conservation
District by the IHPC on March 3, 1999 and by the MDC on March 17,
1999.
Code Compliance Pilot Project
A team of 10 inspectors from Health and Hospital and the City’s Permit
Division have been assigned exclusively to resolve code violations in the
NESCO area. During the first 3 months (March through May 1999) of the
pilot project over 2,200 initial inspections were completed and 1,600
violations resolved. The inspection team also works with IPD, IFD, DPW,
and the Indianapolis Housing Agency to resolve issues that go beyond the
scope of code enforcement but also affect the quality of life in the NESCO
neighborhood.

New Initiatives:
•

Brownfields Revolving Loan Funding
The Department developed and implemented a local Revolving Loan
Program that will lend $300,000 (funds from EPA grant) to private parties
to encourage private sector clean-up of Brownfields sites in Indianapolis
beginning in the fall of 1999.

•

Mark-to-Market Program
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development designated the
City as a Participating Administrative Entity. This enables the City to
refinance Section 8 rental housing projects on behalf of HUD. The
Division sought this designation to more proactively manage the affordable
housing stock in Indianapolis.

•

Update of the Marion County Comprehensive Land Use Plan
An eighteen month planning process will be initiated, ultimately leading to
a complete rewrite of the Comprehensive Plan for Marion County. This
process will build upon work completed in 1999 with the Township Needs
Assessments and the Indianapolis - Marion County Development Assets
Book.

•

CoNECTions - Preliminary Engineering Phase
A preliminary engineering phase will be the first step toward
implementation of the Northeast Corridor Major Investment Study. The
CoNECTions study identifies strategies to alleviate current and projected
future traffic and to improve mobility throughout the northeast corridor
between downtown Indianapolis and the suburban communities in the
northeast.

Department of Metropolitan Development

•

Census 2000 - Local support for the US Census
Staff will assist US Census Bureau with preparation for a local Census
Awareness program and to increase community participation and
involvement in the Year 2000 decennial Census. The City's future success
in obtaining federal funding depends on a complete and accurate count.

•

Technology
The Department will continue to improve public access to records and to
make zoning research more accurate and efficient through enhanced
computer technology. Specific tasks will include maintenance and update
of the zoning base map files, continual upgrading of zoning background
information, and documentation of other land use petitions processed
through the office.

•

Woodruff Place
Coordinate and guide the Woodruff Place Neighborhood Association
through the Historic District Designation Workbook so an official request
for designation can be placed in front of the IHPC and the MDC.

•

M-Track
InspectTrack Mobile Data Field Inspection System will be implemented.
This will enable inspectors to interface with the City of Indianapolis
computer systems and improve operating efficiencies from field inspection
sites. This software has been certified to be year 2000 compliant.

Policy Goal and Outcome Description:

STRONG NEIGHBORHOODS. The Department empowers citizens by
involving them in directing City services (for example, regarding parks,
zoning, sewers, and liquor licensing) in ways that will improve their
neighborhoods.

THRIVING ECONOMY. The Department attracts and maintains businesses
in order to strengthen the economy and keep unemployment low.

Jobs & Economic Development

Department of Metropolitan Development
Division of Administrative Services
Authority relative to the Indianapolis Canal, the Indiana Repertory Theatre
Building, and the Transportation Center at Union Station.

Mission Statement:
The Division of Administrative Services provides managerial services to other
divisions in the Department of Metropolitan Development. The Division is
responsible for the management of several city owned properties. The Division
also acquires, maintains and disposes of property in accordance with established
area plans. In addition, the Division takes an active role in promoting economic
development by leveraging public and private resources to aide in the creation of
affordable housing and new employment opportunities.

•

Organizational Policy:
The Division of Administration is organized in three sections: the Director’s
Office, Real Estate, and Economic Development.
•

Director’s Office
The Director’s Office manages the Department and directs implementation
of the Mayor’s initiatives. The Section provides support to the Metropolitan
Development Commission and serves as a liaison to the City County
Council. Members of the Section represent DMD on several boards
including the Indianapolis Neighborhood Housing Partnership Board, and
the Indiana Theatre Condominium Association Board.

•

Real Estate
The Real Estate Section maintains an inventory of City owned property and
acts as the disposition agent for City Departments. The Section acquires
and maintains property under the redevelopment law for the Department of
Metropolitan Development. The Section is also responsible for property
management. This responsibility includes oversight of day to day property
management carried out by the Indianapolis-Marion County Building

Economic Development
The Economic Development section assists with the implementation of
commercial development plans that promote job creation and retention. In
addition, the section assists with the neighborhood projects that revitalize
communities. The Section also makes recommendations to the Metropolitan
Development Commission regarding approval of economic incentives, such
as tax abatements. The section conducts fiscal impact studies in support of
the resolutions it makes to the MDC. Economic development efforts from
January through June of 1999 have retained 1,797 jobs, created 995 new
jobs, and resulted in private investments totaling $133.2 million.

Significant Events:
•

Blacherne, Savoy-Link and Hoosier
DMD acquired three downtown apartment buildings from HUD in the
spring (Blacherne, Savoy-Link and Hoosier). The MDC has selected
redevelopers for the buildings. Title to the properties will be passed in the
summer of 1999. The Blacherne and Savoy will be redeveloped for 66
market rate apartments. The Hoosier will be redeveloped with retail on the
first floor and 60 apartments; low income residents will occupy 36 of the

Department of Metropolitan Development
Division of Community Development and Financial Services
Mission Statement:
The Division of Community Development and Financial Services empowers
neighborhoods and builds community partnerships by acquiring, promoting, and
effectively managing information and financial resources. The Division carries
out its mission by providing funding to support initiatives focused on affordable
housing, neighborhood empowerment, commercial revitalization, workforce
development, homeless assistance, youth activities, senior services, health
services, and the elimination of slums and blight. Additionally, the Division
provides financial management for the entire Department.

•

Home Ownership Zone
Construction in the Homeownership Zone, a new initiative in 1999, will
continue in 2000. The Division will coordinate the community’s effort to
build or rehabilitate over 300 homes, renew commercial activity, and
provide a complete revitalization of the King Park neighborhood.

•

Neighborhood Empowerment
The City provides technical assistance to eight umbrella neighborhood
associations located within seven targeted neighborhoods. Grants are
awarded to these groups to carry out approximately 25 projects each year
which are identified and prioritized by the neighborhood.

•

Commercial Revitalization
The Division continues to support the improvement of commercial facades
by providing funding to local businesses for exterior improvements.

Organizational Policy:
The Division manages the following federal grants in support of these
initiatives: The Community Development Block Grant, the HOME Investments
Partnership Program, the Emergency Shelter Grant, the Housing Opportunities
for Persons with Aids Grant, the Home Ownership Zone Grant, the Homeless
Continuum of Care Grant, and the HOPE 3 Grant.

Significant Events:
•

Affordable Housing
In 1998, the Division supported the repair of 345 owner-occupied homes,
the creation of 88 new home ownership opportunities, and the
rehabilitation of 596 rental units. For 1999, the City has entered into
contracts with Community Development Corporations and other non-profit
organizations, which at a minimum will result in the repair of 244 owneroccupied homes and the creation of 63 new home ownership opportunities.
The Division anticipates creating, rehabilitating, or improving over 600
rental units.

In 1999, the Division also assisted the Economic Development staff with
land acquisition and household relocation for purposes of developing an
industrial park at I-70 and Keystone interchange.
•

Workforce Development
In 1999, the Division partnered with three community organizations to
provide training and employment opportunities to the residents of
Indianapolis/Marion County. This initiative should lead to nearly 300 job
placements.

The 2000 - 2004 Consolidated Plan
Annually the Division prepares an Action Plan that details how the
Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), HOME Investment
Partnership Grant (HOME), Emergency Shelter Grant (ESG), and Housing
for Persons with AIDS Grant (HOPWA) will be utilized in Indianapolis.
These actions must meet the goals and objectives of a five-year strategic
plan entitled the Consolidated Plan. In addition to preparing the Action
Plan, the Division is coordinating with the Planning Division on the
development of the 2000 – 2004 Consolidated Plan.
Homeless Assistance
The Division competes for grant funds to prevent and address
homelessness. In 1999, the Division was awarded approximately $3.2
million for ten projects that provide transitional and permanent housing
and supportive services to homeless individuals. An additional $1 million
was awarded on a formula basis to the City for shelters and programs
assisting the homeless or persons at risk of homelessness.
Youth Activities, Senior Services, and Health Services
The Front Porch Alliance is the Division’s partner in a grant program that
provides funds to over 40 youth service providers for summer activities.
These activities are part of a collaborative effort with the Indianapolis
Foundation and the Lilly Endowment. Additionally, the Division is
supporting a pilot project that provides Saturday evening events for youth.
The Division also works with several community organizations to provide
persons with senior services and health services. We estimate that 7,000
persons will be served by these projects in 1999.

•

Elimination of Slums and Blight
The City works with the Marion County Health and Hospital Corporation to
board and demolish unsafe buildings. In 1998, 1087 were boarded and 241
houses were demolished. Additionally, the City has and will continue to
redevelop formerly environmentally unsafe land for future development.

•

Financial Services
The Division provides financial management for the Department, which
includes budgeting, cash management, loan servicing, internal controls, and
financial reporting. The Division enables line managers to manage their
budgets through on-line procurement of goods and services, on-line access
to budgets, and increased training in activity-based costing.

New Initiatives:
•

Mark-to-Market Program
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has designated
the City as a Participating Administrative Entity. This enables the City to
refinance Section 8 rental housing projects on behalf of HUD. The Division
sought this designation to more proactively manage the affordable housing
stock in Indianapolis. The Division anticipates signing agreements by late
summer of 1999 with the majority of activity to begin in the 1st quarter of
2000.

•

Far From Home Foundation, Inc.
Beginning in 2000, the Division will administer a $400,000 grant on behalf
of the Far From Home Foundation. This grant will fund operational
support for substance abuse treatment and transitional housing for homeless
veterans.

Division of Planning
therefore provides short and long-range planning services for transit
systems, highways, arterial and collector roadway systems, bicycle and
pedestrian transportation systems, air transport systems, and air quality
preservation initiatives.

Mission Statement:
The Division of Planning prepares long range plans, programs, and policies
designed to facilitate orderly and positive growth in the Indianapolis-Marion
County metropolitan area. In connection with this activity, the Division of

Sub-area Planning
The Sub-area Planning Section prepares small area plans, usually for older
inner-city neighborhoods and corridors, as well as the Regional Center and
special districts. Redevelopment area plans are also prepared by this
section. The Section works with community organizations to formulate
neighborhood, corridor, and redevelopment area plans. Another important
on-going function of Subarea Planning is a quarterly update to the City’s
comprehensive database of Registered Neighborhood Organizations,
churches, and schools. These lists are supplied to land development
petitioners (for variances, rezonings, etc.), the City Departments, the
Alcoholic Beverage Commission, and others for use when notifying the
public of proposed actions. Specialized data requests, including custom
maps, are prepared frequently by staff in this section using the City’s
geographic information system (GIS).

•

Comprehensive Planning
The primary function of the Comprehensive Planning Section is preparation
of updates to the Comprehensive Plan for Marion County. The Section also
prepares smaller area plans, typically for suburban areas and corridors, and
occasional special area plans such as those recently completed for the Naval
Air Warfare Center and Fort Benjamin Harrison. The section also
examines and documents land use and urbanization trends in Marion
County, and it conducts special studies as required such as cost-benefit
analyses and future development projections.

Organizational Policy:
The Division of Planning is organized into five functional areas:
•

•

Information Resources and Policy Analysis
The Information Resources and Policy Analysis (IRPA) Section compiles
and analyzes housing and other demographic information, which it uses to
develop housing policies, homeless assistance strategies, population
forecasts, and other reports. For Marion County the IRPA Section serves as
a repository for US Census data, Social Assets and Vulnerability Indicators
(SAVI) data, federal Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data, and
aggregated local permit data.
Transportation Planning
The Transportation Planning Section of the Division serves as the
Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) for the entire Indianapolis
Metropolitan Planning Area (MPA). The MPA includes not only all of
Marion County but the urbanized portions of the eight surrounding counties
as well. So that local units of government within the MPA may qualify for
federal highway and transportation funding, coordinated area-wide
planning for the entire metropolitan region must first be accomplished
through the efforts of the MPO. The Transportation Planning Section

Administration
Administration supports all activities of the Division by providing overall
policy direction and management; program administration
and development; finance, purchasing, personnel, fiscal analysis, and
secretarial services; and distribution of public and internal information.

•

The 2000 - 2004 Consolidated Plan
The Consolidated Plan is a requirement of the U.S. Department of Housing
and Urban Development to receive Community Development Block Grant
(CDBG), HOME Investment Partnership Grant (HOME), Emergency
Shelter Grant (ESG), and Housing for Persons with AIDS Grant (HOPWA).
The plan will be completed by the end of the year. It is a five-year strategy
for housing and community development and includes the one year action
plan for use of the above listed funds. The Division of Planning is
completing the five year portion of the plan which includes documentation
of priority housing and non-housing community development needs. The
Division of Community Development and Financial Services is completing
the one year action plan.

•

coNECTions - Major Investment Study
A preferred alternative will be recommended and a final report will be
developed by late 1999 or early 2000. The CoNECTions study was
conducted to identify strategies to alleviate current and projected future
traffic and to improve mobility throughout the northeast corridor between
downtown Indianapolis and the suburban communities in the northeast,
including Fishers, Noblesville and Carmel.

•

Knozone Public Awareness Program
Accomplishments for the 1999 season include new television and radio ad
campaigns, bicycle giveaways, the elementary school program, and reduced
bus fares on Nozone Action Days. This project will continue in 2000.

•

Inner City Retail Study
In 1999 staff conducted the Inner City Retail Study with the purpose of
assessing and describing the existing climate of the inner city retail market
in Indianapolis. The Inner City Retail Advisory Committee, made up of
neighborhood and business leaders, held three meetings. The Committee
recommended strategies to strengthen existing retail and attract additional
retail where it is lacking. Consultants for this effort are the IUPUI Center
for Urban Policy and Environment (CUPE) and Terzo and Bologna.
Wellfield Protection Zoning - Implementation
Staff assists the Marion County Wellfield Education Corp. (MCWEC) in
development and implementation of the public education and voluntary
business registration components of the Wellfield Protection Program.
Indianapolis was awarded Groundwater Guardian status. This project will
continue in 2000.
The Indianapolis Housing Strategy Action Plan
The Indianapolis Housing Strategy Action Plan is the implementation
document for the work completed by the Indianapolis Housing Task Force
in 1998. When complete at the end of 1999, it will outline: the action
steps, agencies that have accepted responsibility for completing each of the
action steps, and a timeline for completion of each action step.

continue throughout the year.
Lafayette Square Area Plan
This 1999 plan charts a course of action for the community and for the City
of Indianapolis to improve the viability and competitiveness of the area
around the Lafayette Square mall. The plan addresses not only economic
development issues but related topics such as the perception of crime, crime
prevention, beautification, land use, infrastructure, and city services.
Implementation is occurring through the combined efforts of the business
community, not-for-profit organizations, residents, and the City of
Indianapolis.
Township Facilities and Services Needs Assessments
To be completed by the end of 1999, these studies look at the supply and
demand for various social and civic services and facilities on a township by
township basis. The studies look at the current situation and projects future
needs in 2020 and at time of build-out.

•

Census 2000 - Local support for the US Census
Staff will assist US Census Bureau with preparation for a local Census
Awareness program and to increase community participation and
involvement in the Year 2000 decennial Census. The City's future success
in obtaining federal funding depends on a complete and accurate count.

•

Update of the Marion County Comprehensive Land Use Plan
An eighteen month planning process will be initiated, ultimately leading to
a complete rewrite of the Comprehensive Plan for Marion County. This
process will build upon work completed in 1999 with the Township Needs
Assessments and the Indianapolis-Marion County Development Assets
Book.

•

Regional Center Plan Update
Approximately every 10 years the Division of Planning prepares a new plan
for downtown Indianapolis. In preparing the plan, staff holds public
meetings seeking participation and contribution of ideas from people who
live, work, and own property in the area. This update will focus on
identifying and prioritizing strategies for economic development, housing,
job creation, entertainment & recreation, and retail shopping for the period
of year 2000 through year 2020.

•

New Subarea Plans
In 2000 the Subarea Planning Section anticipates preparing one new
community plan for an inner city or other threatened neighborhood.
Community planning involves area stakeholders in a collaborative process
aimed at strengthening the neighborhood. In preparing a plan, the staff
holds a series of public meetings seeking participation and contribution of
ideas from people who live, work, and own property in the area. Plan
preparation will depend on Community Development Block Grant funding

Information Resource Center
Staff has secured an Internet-based service that provides access to over 5000
published periodicals, journals, newspapers, and news wires. By the end of
the year, five planning documents will be converted to an Internetaccessible format. In 2000 indexes and abstracts of all Planning documents
will be made accessible on the City/County intranet.

2000 Annual Budget
Department of Metropolitan Development
Division of Neighborhood Services
The Township Administrators assist citizens, businesses and community
organizations in obtaining necessary zoning approvals and permits;
facilitating land use negotiations between developers, businesses and
communities; and educating citizens and communities on code
requirements.

Mission Statement:
The Division of Neighborhood Services
The Division of Neighborhood Services consists of two sections whose mission
is to provide high quality customer service.
The Township Administrators
• Facilitate and enhance communication between members of the public and
government
• Identify and assist in addressing the need for city services identified by
township residents, community organizations and businesses
• Enlist citizen and business participation with government and increase
public awareness of the programs and services offered by the City of
Indianapolis
Current Planning
• Processes all land use petitions for public hearings and prepares
recommendations relative to those petitions
• Reviews, revises and updates zoning ordinances to reflect the needs of the
community

•

Significant Events:
•

Corridor Clean-Up
In conjunction with the Department of Public Works, the Division is
developing a plan for a beautification/enhancement project along two major
corridors. The goal is to improve the appearance of the corridors to create a
more positive image of the neighborhoods that border these streets.

•

Contaminated Wells
The Division organized public meetings with several neighborhoods to
facilitate the extension of public water mains where the drinking water
wells have been contaminated. This is a continuation of the project started
in 1998 where four neighborhoods with contaminated wells have now been
connected to public water.

•

Petitions Processed
A total of 420 petitions have been processed as of June 30, 1999.

Organizational Policy:
•

Township Administrators
Each township is assigned one Township Administrator. Center Township
has two Administrators. The Township Administrators are dedicated to
bringing government closer to the citizens by connecting residents,
businesses and community organizations to city and county services.
Township Administrators provide information to community members to
increase their understanding of how government works, who makes it work
and how best to facilitate solutions.

Current Planning
The Current Planning Section processes all land use petitions in the most
efficient manner possible, provides professional recommendations regarding
those petitions, and reviews, revises and updates the zoning ordinances to
reflect the needs of the community.

•

GIS Planner
The Current Planning Section has hired a GIS planner to oversee GIS
projects. Responsibilities of the planner will also include ensuring that new
technology can be easily used by staff and by members of the public.

New Initiatives:
•

Continue to Update Zoning Ordinances
The Current Planning Section will continue to monitor all of the zoning
ordinances to determine if there are problems with interpretation or use. As
issues arise, changes can be made through the public hearing process. The
Section will also be responsible for changes to ordinances or new
ordinances recommended by elected officials, the administration, or the
general public.

•

Technology
The Current Planning Section will continue to improve public access to
records and to make zoning research more accurate and efficient through
enhanced computer technology. Specific tasks will include maintenance
and update of the zoning base map files, continual upgrading of zoning
background information, and documentation of other land use petitions
processed through the office.

2000 Annual Budget
Department of Metropolitan Development
Division of Neighborhood Services
Outcome and Combined Activities Description:

NEIGHBORHOOD EMPOWERMENT. The department enables citizens to
work with the City to develop their neighborhoods physically, socially, and
economically.

Citizen Participation
The Township Administrators encourage citizen participation in the delivery of
city services and in the improvement of the quality of life within their
neighborhoods and communities. Through mailings, notices and attendance at
neighborhood meetings, the Township Administrators inform residents of
opportunities for them to participate and advise them on how to participate
effectively. Activities include assistance with forming new neighborhood or
business associations, information on neighborhood clean-ups, notices of liquor
board hearings and land use hearings, and training on how the land use petition
process works. The process of providing opportunities for citizens to participate
in government decision-making results in stronger and safer neighborhoods.
Customer Service
One of the Township Administrator’s goals is to provide quality customer
service by responding to inquiries/requests for service from township residents
and businesses. Staff members provide direct assistance or referral to the
appropriate agency/department with the goal of responding within one business
day of the request. Direct interaction with the community’s leadership and
participation on

the Township Teams (a team of city representatives from all the city
departments chaired by the Township Administrators) promotes the goal of
effective customer service and strong, safe neighborhoods.
Land Use Petitions
The Current Planning Section is the primary source for assisting Marion County
residents in the various avenues of the land use process. These include petitions,
review and update of zoning ordinances, and negotiation, mediation and
remonstrance relating to land use. The Current Planning Section will continue
to each year effectively process approximately 900 land use petitions. Dockets
and notices will be prepared in a timely manner so petitioners, neighborhood
residents, and public officials are well informed of proposals. Staff reports,
outlining professional land use issues, will continue to be provided to the
decision-makers.
Ordinance/Rules
The Current Planning Section of the division is responsible for the revision of
Zoning Ordinances. These are updated on a regular basis in order to remain
current with the needs of the City and to ensure county-wide continuity. The
application of zoning ordinances in a fair and equitable manner promotes safe
and strong neighborhoods.

NEIGHBORHOOD EMPOWERMENT. The department enables citizens to
work with the City to develop their neighborhoods physically, socially, and
economically.

Historic Preservation
The division’s emphasis is on enabling property owners in historic districts to
maintain, develop, and renovate their properties within guidelines that have
been developed in conjunction with the people who live, work, and own property
in the area. Historic districts are residential and commercial neighborhoods that
are strengthened by giving people in the districts greater opportunities to
participate in the changes that occur around their property and by giving them
the confidence that the very character that attracted them and their investment to
the neighborhood will not be undermined by the actions of others.
Other activities involve providing preservation assistance county-wide and
assisting the City with preservation-related issues. Activities include:
•

2000 Annual Budget
Department of Metropolitan Development
Division of Permits

Mission Statement:

•

The Division of Permits issues permits in compliance with land use,
development, infrastructure and building regulations and utilizes combined
inspections to enforce those regulations in order to promote responsible
development.

Organizational Policy:
The Division of Permits is staffed from employees by, directed by, and receives
budget support from two departments: the Department of Capital Asset
Management and the Department of Metropolitan Development.

Significant Events:
•

Code Compliance Pilot Project
A team of 10 inspectors from Health and Hospital and the City’s Permit
Division have been assigned exclusively to resolve code violations in the
NESCO area. During the first 3 months (March through May 1999) of the
pilot project over 2,200 initial inspections were completed and 1,600
violations resolved. The inspection team also works with IPD, IFD, DPW,
and the Indianapolis Housing Agency to resolve issues that go beyond the
scope of code enforcement but also affect the quality of life in the NESCO
neighborhood.

•

Number of Permits Issued
30,025 permits were issued during the first six months of 1999 compared to
27,598 for the same period of 1998. Increased efficiencies in the permitting
process have decreased the average time a customer waits from 47 minutes
in June of 1998 to 7 minutes in June of 1999.

•

Technology Changes
Computers have been upgraded and now include a GIS data viewer. Paper
documents are being scanned and will become available electronically. The
Tidemark PermitPlan system is in the process of being converted and
upgraded to a newer version which will allow the Division to implement a
mobile data field inspection system.

The Division of Permits is organized into three functional areas:
Administration, Permits, and Inspections.
•

Administration
Administration staff supports all activities of the Division by providing
overall policy direction and management, program administration and
development, and budget and personnel management.

•

Permits
Permits staff works with citizens on a daily basis to provide quality service
in contractor licensing, registrations, issuing permits and responding to
requests for information. Permit staff licenses and registers contractors,
issues permits in compliance with applicable regulations, and manages
records and databases for all permitting files. In addition, the addressing
staff assigns all street names and addresses to new or replatted
developments in the County. The databases maintained by this section are
shared with the Metropolitan Emergency Communications Agency (MECA)
as the basis for Marion County’s Emergency 911 system.

Inspections
Inspection staff inspects properties to ensure safety and compliance with
local building codes and related ordinances. All inspectors and Project
Managers have been combined into geographic (Geo) teams and crosstrained so that more inspections can be done per site visit. The
inspectors in the inspection group do building inspections, zoning
inspections, rehab inspections, infrastructure inspections and right-of-way
inspections. This staff continues to focus enforcement on non-licensed
contractors and persons performing activities without permits.

Division of Permits

•

Y2K Response
Y2K issues were identified in the Contractor Licensing mainframe database
and the PermitPlan software. The Contractor Licensing database has been
converted to a web application that resolved those issues. The Version 2.5
upgrade of PermitPlan has been certified Y2K compliant. Internal systems
and databases are being checked and will be confirmed Y2K compliant by
October 1999. Permitting staff is participating in a multi agency effort to
develop a contingency plan to assist in covering a major emergency should
it occur.

New Initiatives:
•

Automated Document Management
The Division’s objective is to convert its documents into a digital format
acceptable for input into the document management system and reduce the
amount of time required to do permits research and reviews. Several
additional record sets have been targeted for scanning in 2000. In addition,
the division will pursue the opportunity for accepting digital submittals.

•

Tidemark
PermitPlan v2.5 will be implemented. This will enable the Division to
build new cases and add new fields of information without requiring outside
assistance. It will also provide the capacity to be accessed from remote
locations by mobile data units for field inspections. This software has been
certified to be year 2000 compliant.

•

M-Track
InspectTrack Mobile Data Field Inspection System will be implemented.
This will enable inspectors to interface with the City of Indianapolis
computer systems and improve operating efficiencies from field inspection
sites. This software has been certified to be year 2000 compliant.

•

Internet Permitting
The Division will continue to put more permits and information on-line.
On-line permit research has proven successful. Right-of-way and electrical
permits can be applied for on the Internet. Heating and cooling and
plumbing permits will be available on the Internet in 2000.

City of Elkhart Comprehensive Plan Update
Chapter 9: Implementation

Introduction
Compared to implementation, preparing the comprehensive plan
is relatively uncomplicated. The real challenge often comes in
translating a plan’s vision, goals, and recommendations into the
day-to-day operations and actions of City government. The main
purpose of the City of Elkhart’s Comprehensive Plan Update is to
implement its recommendations,
When the City determines how to implement the Comprehensive
Plan’s recommendations, it is important to continuously consider
the integrity of the planning process, the community’s values, and
why those ideas are so important. A plan is a community’s future.
It is the collective will and dreams of its citizens and a community’s
duty is to find ways to give it life that keep it true to the vision and
maintain its integrity.
A comprehensive plan is comprehensive for a reason – because
everything in a living community is interconnected – and it must
be implemented in a way that treats its components as part of
a whole. It takes great care to make every decision within the
context of that basic reality. With these thoughts in mind, this
chapter is meant to help a community adopt, implement and
update a comprehensive plan and make it available to the public.

Adoption
A local government must prepare a resolution to adopt its
comprehensive plan to ensure that it promotes the public health,
safety, morals and convenience, order or the general welfare and for
the sake of efficiency and economy in the process of development.
Typically each Common Council has a process for adopting
resolutions and generally involves a public hearing allowing public
comment. If residents are actively involved throughout the planning
process, the public hearing should go smoothly. Using a resolution,
the local government formally adopts the plan – by a simple
majority vote. The procedures for adopting a plan are described
in Indiana Code, 36-7-4-501. Even with a well-designed planning
process, a community may lack consensus on certain issues or, in
the worst case, may not have enough support to adopt a plan. In
that case, a local government may want to:
•

Setup a committee to work through the remaining issues.
The committee should have balanced representation from
all sides of the issues in dispute and a definite timeline for
reporting back its recommendations.

•

Recommend further study of the issues with a clear timeline.
Through additional study, participants may discover new
information that will help them develop a consensus.

•

If the community is extremely divided on an issue, it may be
necessary to bring in a professional facilitator or a mediator
to help it find a solution. Sometimes a community must
make tough choices and move on.

Program Administration & Development
The City’s comprehensive plan contains many different
recommendations in each Chapter that will be carried out
through existing departments and programs. During the creation
of this plan, several departments have come together to create
this plan. The future implementation of the plan requires the ongoing communication and interaction between these departments.
Strong partnerships are needed to foster good communication and
provide additional alliances in the implementation of some of these
recommendations. The implementers/champions should present
the recommendations of this plan formally to the City’s various
boards and commissions. Some of the key departments that need
to continue to be involved include: Community Development
& Redevelopment, Economic Development Department,
Neighborhood Associations, Planning & Zoning Department,
Public Works & Utilities Department, Street Department, Parks
and Recreation, Public Safety and Emergency Management, and
the Office of the Mayor. To achieve the vision and goals set
forth in this plan, some of the existing programs and policies the
City current uses may need to be modified so the policies and
recommendations contained herein can be implemented. Some of
the recommendations proposed may also require new initiatives
for the City. These should be implemented when the necessary
resources are available.
As mentioned in Chapter One: Introduction section under “How
to Use this Plan,” the plan should be adopted as a matter of land use
and redevelopment policy for the City. After the plan is adopted
the City should create an implementation task force and include a
periodic review of the goals and objectives of the Comprehensive
Plan to ensure that it is consistent with the changing environment
within the City.
Each department will carry out the recommendations spelled
out in Chapter Three and summarized priorities at the end of
this chapter. These recommendations will be carried out through
day to day policy decisions which will be made by Planning and
Engineering staff, Plan Commission and City Council. The future
land use map illustrates the targeted redevelopment of areas
within the City. To that end, the future land use map, itself, is
a visual representation of the recommendations and the future
direction of growth. The map is a conceptual snapshot of how
the City should look in 20 years in terms of land use. Because of
the uncertainty associated with the timing, market conditions, and

City of Elkhart Comprehensive Plan Update
Chapter 9: Implementation

location of future development, the administration of this plan will
require that Elkhart remain flexible in the possibilities associated
with the future development, while still remaining true to the
overall intention of this plan.

Interpretation
The Elkhart Comprehensive Plan should serve as Elkhart’s
guide for land use and development policies for development
and redevelopment in the study area. The long range goals,
objectives, and recommendations, along with the supporting
maps, are intended to guide development decisions towards the
community’s collective vision of the future. Members of the city
staff, Plan Commission and City Council should interpret the
goals and objectives as a long-term and deliberately broad vision.
The commission and council should keep in mind that this plan
reflects the community’s values. City officials cannot expect to
control all circumstances. However, the spirit of this plan should
be adhered to in order to ensure that the community’s values
are maintained. The strategic action steps, on the other hand,
are intended to direct the day-to-day decisions concerning more
specific and task oriented activities. Members of the City Council
should interpret the strategic actions steps by saying, “given our
long-term goals and changing community conditions, these are the
projects and programs that we want to complete in the shortterm and long-term, and this is how we plan to accomplish them.”
Interpreting the plan in this way will enable the members of both
the commission and city to justify their approval, or denial, of any
proposed development or redevelopment in Elkhart.
When a new annexation, rezone, planned unit development (PUD),
subdivision, or site plan review request is filed with the Planning
& Development Department, the City planning staff as well as
other city departments should review and evaluate the application
against the Elkhart Comprehensive Plan and the City’s ordinances
and provide a staff report with a formal recommendation to the
Plan Commission regarding its findings. The staff report should
include an evaluation of the development and the degree to which
the proposed project conforms to the plan’s goals, objectives,
recommendations, and future land use, environment & design,
economic development, and corridor and character maps.
The Elkhart Comprehensive Plan does not contain the actual
decisions that should be made; however, it does serve as a
reminder and provide guidance of the community’s collective
vision for the future growth and development of this area and
should be interpreted as such.

Adopted February 2, 2015

Chapter 9: Implementation

Rezoning
Zoning protects the rights of individual property owners while
promoting the general welfare of the community. The purpose
of zoning is to locate specific land uses where they are most
appropriate. In determining the most appropriate zoning designation, the City must consider such things as public utilities, road
access, and the existing or established development pattern of
the area in which development is proposed.
In general, the Plan Commission and City Council should consider
that a rezone is only justifiable under the following circumstances:
•

When the requested rezoning is consistent with long range
land use plans adopted by the appropriate governing body

•

When there was an error or oversight in the original zoning
of the property

•

When changes have occurred to conditions in the vicinity
of the property which prevent the reasonable use of the
property as currently zoned

•

When the requested rezoning benefits the community at
large

Rezones should not be granted because of a single hardship
expressed by a property owner or group of property owners.
The community’s collective vision for the future is not negotiable.
Should the Plan Commission recommend approval to the City
Council for numerous rezones that are substantially inconsistent
with the future land use map associated with the Elkhart
Comprehensive Plan, the plan should be updated. This is an
indication that the area’s conditions, issues and/or priorities have
changed.

Implementation Task Force
The Plan Commission and/or City Council should consider
appointing an implementation task force to guide the
implementation of the plan. It is recommended that this task
force be a committee of the Plan Commission and/or the
City Council and be appropriately named the “Planning and
Zoning Committee”. This task force should spearhead City
planning initiatives, interface with the Community Development
Department, Public Works and Streets Departments, and provide
input on all planning related decisions for the City in accordance
with the Elkhart Comprehensive Plan. Such a task force should
include project steering committee members, representatives
of the City Council, and Redevelopment Commission, Plan
Commission, Board of Zoning Appeals, planning staff, and citizens.
For the implementation of the Plan to be successful, organizations
9.4

Adopted February 2, 2015

City of Elkhart Comprehensive Plan Update
Chapter 9: Implementation

and agencies assigned to each implementation item must be aware
of their role, responsibility, and/or abilities.

Work Plan
The Elkhart Comprehensive Plan covers a broad variety of
issues and subject matters. In order to implement the plan, the
implementation taskforce should, on an annual basis, prioritize
the recommendation and action steps outlined in the plan for
that fiscal year and develop a strategy for moving these items
forward. This information should be shared and approved by
the City Council, since they control the budget for the City. It
will be important that this is completed prior to City budgeting
time in order to ensure adequate funding is in place if funds are
anticipated from the City budget.

Monitoring & Update
Planning does not have a defined beginning and end. It is an on-going
process that responds to new information and circumstances and
incorporates changing conditions into decisions. Circumstances
that may change include physical conditions of buildings and/or
infrastructure, economic climate, the natural environment, and
social and community goals.
Once the plan is adopted it will need to be revised from time to time
to ensure that it stays consistent and relevant to current conditions.
It is best that the City continue in the same partnership manner
it has to undertake the creation of this plan. An implementation
committee should be used to monitor and update this plan. A
plan update should occur at intervals of approximately every five
years. The purpose of the plan update is to re-evaluate the goals,
policies, and strategies contained within this Plan (noting those
to change and those to remove), and to develop new policies if
necessary to make sure that this Plan is being effective. The plan
update process is further described below.
A disciplined schedule for plan review is helpful in plan
implementation. Noting areas of the plan’s success helps to
build support for future planning activities. The identification of
less successful components of the plan may suggest a need for
refinement and/or amendment. The City Council, in a joint work
session with the Plan Commission, should therefore conduct a
thorough annual review of the plan, asking whether the conditions
on which the plan was predicated still hold true. An annual
“report card” should be prepared by the City staff which reviews
and documents the activities of the Redevelopment Commission,
Plan Commission, Board of Zoning Appeals, and City Council that
are relevant to Elkhart.
Also, prior to preparing the annual City operating budget, an
assessment should be completed that documents the impacts of
Adopted February 2, 2015

9.5

City of Elkhart Comprehensive Plan Update
Chapter 9: Implementation

the plan implementation activities. This assessment should consist
of the following:
•

Major differences between projected economic and
demographic growth rates and actual growth

•

Necessary adjustments to the implementation tools and
techniques - these may be brought on by changes in state
legislature, etc.

•

Deviations by the Redevelopment Commission or Plan
Commission from the plan, and why those deviations were
made

•

Requests for amendments to the plan, in order to determine
if there is a pattern of requested changes emerging

•

Changes in the local/regional political structure that may
affect the implementation of the plan

•

Identifying the programs and projects completed that were
identified in the plan.

•

For each implementing program/project, develop criteria
that can be used to measure the effectiveness of the program,
apply those criteria, and write a report summarizing the
strengths and weaknesses of the program

•

Identify new programs, if any, that could be implemented

A separate process exists for amendments to the Plan. The City
should perform amendments on a yearly or periodic basis as
needed. This plan amendment should be at the recommendation
of the implementation committee. Plan amendments may include
revisions to one or more sections of this plan as a result of changes
within the market, infrastructure, a specific issue/policy change or
change in state law. Plan amendments may include changes to
the land use plan map or may be as small as correcting text. The
process for making these amendments is described below.

Plan Update Process
This plan should be updated at least every five (5) years, unless
otherwise directed by the Plan Commission or Common Council.
This is important, especially since the land use plan focuses on
redevelopment of key core areas and large parcels in the City.
The City’s prime consideration in making a determination of
when an update should be initiated, should include what changes
have occurred since the Plan was last updated. These changes
may be in such areas as the economy, the environment, changes
in administration, traffic congestion, jurisdictional priorities,
projected growth or something else significant. The plan update
should include a thorough review and evaluation of the vision
9.6

Adopted February 2, 2015

City of Elkhart Comprehensive Plan Update
Chapter 9: Implementation

and development policies contained within Chapter 3 of the plan.
Within that review, each development policy should be reviewed
for achievement, in process or lack of relevancy. Policies that have
been achieved or are not relevant should be changed or removed
from the plan. New policies should be developed, if necessary, to
accommodate any changes in conditions and ensure the plan is
still effective. A plan update should also include a thorough review
of the validity of all the information contained within the plan
and should include extensive opportunities for involvement by the
public, boards and commissions, elected and appointed officials,
staff and other affected interests.

Plan Amendment Process
Plan amendments should be considered when the overall vision
and development policies still remain. This process should be
undertaken when changes are needed to specific redevelopment
parcels, as identified in this plan, or a stretch of road that might
be changed. An amendment should be considered only when
it will not change the overall vision or development principals
established. The amendment would be in accordance to IC 36-7500 series and occur as follows:
•

The City’s Plan Commission would give notice for a
public hearing for an amendment to the jurisdiction’s
Comprehensive Plan in accordance with IC 5-3-1

•

Hold a public meeting(s) and approve the amendment
by certifying the Comprehensive Plan amendment to the
appropriate jurisdiction’s legislative body

•

A resolution shall be adopted by the appropriate
jurisdictional legislative bodies

Fiscal Considerations
The implementation of the comprehensive plan will require the
City’s financial commitment and support to carry out the policies
and achieve the vision and goals set forth herein. These financial
commitments should include existing programs and policies the city
currently has in place. Although it is the City’s intent to administer
this plan with the current financial resources available, monies may
need to be set aside in future budgets to carry out some of the
recommended actions. The adoption of the Comprehensive Plan
does not authorize expenditures for its implementation. The City
Council, in accordance with state statutes and the City policies,
may authorize the financial resources to implement the plan.
Funding may be available from outside sources. When
opportunities become available and make sense financially, the
City should seek these funds through federal, state or local grants,
loans and other financial resources. This may also include the city

investing in sending a staff member to be certified by the state in
some granting programs, Office of Community and Rural Affairs
(OCRA), for example.

Tools
In today’s current economy, development has slowed tremendously
from the pattern from the late 90’s and early 2000’s. Cities will
not see the housing boom again and many today have to cope with
foreclosures and an overabundance of housing stock. As noted in
Chapter 2 Process & Methodology, the City of Elkhart’s Housing
Condition is fairly stable and there is not a large gap between the
supply and demand of housing. However, the City has the largest
percentage of housing (almost 44%) in the value range of $50,000
to $100,000.
In terms of industrial and commercial development, the trends
in the City have shown that these land uses have decreased.
In terms of the tax base, this has been a hard hit for the City’s
budget. However issues of over commercialization of Elkhart’s
corridor and environmental issues on industrial property have
left large areas of redevelopment potential within the City. With
this slowdown in the economy, while difficult for the City, an
opportunity exists to redefine areas and put the City in a position
for strong redevelopment and the creation of jobs when the
economy recovers.
While the City is struggling, it should be cautious in terms of
just accepting any development. Any development occurring
should be considered appropriate and consistent with the
direction that Elkhart desires and is stated in the Comprehensive
Plan. The City should evaluate development on a case by case
basis. Since the economy is in recovery mode, infill or targeted
economic development will need incentives to help make it spur
development. There are a variety of tools and mechanisms that
the city can use to help attract this growth.
The purpose of this section is to provide a list of tools that can be
used to implement the plan. In some cases the City is already using
some tools, in other cases there are other options and incentives
that the City can employ to implement the vision of this plan and
spur economic redevelopment. Below is a discussion of the tools
out there that the City could use:

Economic Development Administration (EDA) – The EDA is a
department under the Department of Commerce. Their mission
is to promote the federal economic development agenda by
promoting innovation and competitiveness, preparing American
regions for growth and success in the worldwide economy. The
EDA has many different granting programs to implement both
planning and infrastructure projects. This information can be
found on the EDA’s website at WWW.EDA.GOV. As discussed in
Chapter 7, Elkhart has a Comprehensive Economic Development
Strategy. That document will be critical in the seeking of grants.
The following grant programs are currently available under the
EDA program:
FY 2012 EDAP FFO: Public Works and Economic Adjustment
Assistance Programs opportunity: Synopsis taken from Grant
Announcement: EDA supports development in economically
distressed areas of the United States by fostering job creation
and attracting private investment. Specifically, under this
FFO, EDA will consider construction, non-construction, and
revolving loan fund investments under the Public Works and
Economic Adjustment Assistance programs. Grants made
under these programs will leverage regional assets to support
the implementation of regional economic development
strategies designed to create jobs, leverage private capital,
encourage economic development, and strengthen America’s
ability to compete in the global marketplace. Under this FFO,
EDA solicits applications from rural and urban communities
to develop initiatives that advance new ideas and creative
approaches to address rapidly evolving economic conditions.
EDA’s Planning and Local Technical Assistance Programs:
Synopsis taken from Grant Announcement: Under the Planning
program EDA assists eligible recipients in creating regional
economic development plans designed to stimulate and guide
the economic development efforts of a community or region.
As part of this program, EDA supports Partnership Planning
investments to facilitate the development, implementation,
revision, or replacement of Comprehensive Economic
Development Strategies (CEDS), which articulate and prioritize
the strategic economic goals of recipients' respective regions.
In general, EDA provides Partnership Planning grants to the
designated planning organization (e.g., District Organization)
serving EDA-designated Economic Development Districts to
enable these organizations to develop and implement relevant
CEDS. In addition, EDA provides Partnership Planning grants
to Indian Tribes to help develop and implement CEDS and
associated economic development activities. The Planning
program also helps support planning organizations, including
District Organizations, Indian Tribes, and other eligible

Recipients, with Short Term and State Planning investments
designed to guide the eventual creation and retention of
higher-skill, higher-wage jobs, particularly for the unemployed
and underemployed in the Nation’s most economically
distressed regions. The Local Technical Assistance program
strengthens the capacity of local or State organizations,
institutions of higher education, and other eligible recipients
to undertake and promote effective economic development
programs through projects such as feasibility analyses and
impact studies.
Housing & Urban Development (HUD): HUD’s mission, as
stated on their website (WWW.HUD.GOV) it to create strong,
sustainable inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for
all. HUD has been instrumental in dealing with Elkhart’s housing
issues by providing funding to update plans, purchase properties,
rebuild and renovate homes. The majority of Elkhart’s housing
funding comes from the Community Development Block Grant
Fund (CDBG). HUD has been in partnership with DOT and EPA
to provide funding for the Sustainable Communities Initiative,
Choice Neighborhood Planning Grants and Livable Communities
Grant. The department also has grants for the Fair Housing
Initiatives Program, and other programs. The best way to monitor
this is to work with Elkhart’s Community Development Manager,
Crystal Welsh, and monitor HUD’s website.
Department of Transportation (DOT): The DOT’s primary
mission is to support the United States Highway system, airport
system, transit system among other areas. However they also
provide funding to states who thereby provide funding to the
Indiana MPO’s. Besides general funding, the DOT also accepts
applications for other grants such as the HUD/EPA/DOT joint
programs of sustainable communities, choice neighborhood
programs, and livable communities grants. The DOT also has calls
for TIGER Grants, FHWA Highway Grants, Transportation Safety
grants, FTA Grants and FAA spaceport grants. More information
of these grants can be found on DOT’s website at WWW.DOT.
GOV. Like the other federal grant process, it is imperative that
the City work with MACOG as they will keep abreast of these
intiatives.
State
Shovel Ready Program: The Indiana Economic Development
Corporation helps communities certify economic development
sites as “ready for development.” The program is aimed at helping
companies locate and develop a site quickly. Indiana’s Shovel Ready
Program has a series of criteria that qualify a site to be shovel
ready. Grant funding for this program can be found at http://iedc.

Economic Development for a Growing Economy (EDGE)
Program: This Indiana Economic Development Corporation
program is a refundable tax credit program that rewards
companies creating jobs and contributing to the growth of Indiana’s
economy. EDGE credits are calculated as a percentage of payroll
tax withholding for net new Indiana jobs. EDGE credits may be
awarded for a period of up to 10 years. The website for this
program is: http://iedc.in.gov/tax-credits-exemptions/economicdevelopment-for-a-growing-economy-tax-credit.
Venture Capital Investment Credit: This Indiana Economic
Development Corporation program was established to improve
access to capital to fast growing Indiana companies by providing
individual and corporate investors an incentive to invest in new
firms. To participate in the program, businesses must enroll.
Investors who provide qualified debt or equity capital to enrolled
firms receive a credit against their Indiana income tax liability.
The website for this program is: http://iedc.in.gov/tax-creditsexemptions/economic-development-for-a-growing-economy-taxcredit.
Hoosier Alternative Fuel Vehicle Manufacturer Tax Credit: The
purpose of this program is to provide job creation and higher wages
for Indiana businesses who help reduce the energy dependency and
help to reduce air pollution due to the manufacturing or assembly
of alternative fuel vehicles in Indiana. This program provides a
tax credit to those businesses who manufacture alternative fuel
vehicles. The business must compensate its employees at least 150
percent of the state’s hourly minimum wage and agree to maintain
operations for at least 10 years. More about the program can be

Façade Improvement Program
With a façade improvement program, the City would provide
both technical and financial assistance to Elkhart property owners
or business tenants who are seeking to renovate or restore
commercial, historic residential or industrial building facades and
associated elements, including signage and lighting. The program’s
purpose would be to support the vitality of the City of Elkhart’s
designated commercial, historic or targeted redevelopment sites
and to encourage re-investment and redevelopment throughout
the area by improving the appearance of existing buildings and
other elements associated with the appearance of the property
(ie signs and lights). The program would need to limit the
improvements to such items as window and door repair, repair
and restoration of historic architectural details, painting, removal
of siding or other elements that would bring the building back to
its original design, storefront rehabilitation, repair/replace awnings;
façade lighting; signs; masonry repairs/tuck pointing; and major
landscape improvements consistent with city improved streets.

Tax Phase-In
The tax phase-in is the gradual collection of property taxes on
new improvements to real estate and/or personal property during
a designated number of years. Personal property that is eligible
for the incentive includes equipment for manufacturing, research
and development, logistic distribution, and information technology.
The phase-in may extend from one to ten years.
Application for a phase-in begins with city staff meeting with
the potential recipient to determine the firm’s needs. The
applicant then formally submits paperwork for review by staff.
The application is scored by staff members, who determine the
number of years for which the phase-in should be offered. The
Common Council retains final authority to either approve or
deny the phase-in application.
This is currently an incentive program the City implements.

Tax Abatement
Tax abatement is a tool used by local governments to spur on
private development and lure companies to locate in their
jurisdiction. Tax abatement is used to help spur job creation by
exempting a portion or all of assessed value from hitting the tax
rolls of a new development. Tax abatements can be granted for both
new construction and for redevelopment projects (rehabilitation
of an existing building or redevelopment of a site into a new use).
Additionally, the City has the opportunity to provide property
tax abatements on equipment for manufacturing and laboratory
uses and/or computer equipment for experimental research and

Adopted February 2, 2015

City of Elkhart Comprehensive Plan Update
Chapter 9: Implementation

development laboratories that have not been previously taxed in
Indiana. Tax abatement can be granted for up to ten years and is
typically developed on a graduated scale to come back onto the
tax rolls. In order to offer tax abatement, the City will have to
implement four tasks including:
1. Eligibility Requirements – property must be characterized as
either undesirable for normal development or designated as
an economic revitalization area and an application tailored
to Elkhart’s tax abatement process should be filled out prior
to any development or personal property being purchased.
2. Evaluation, Recommendation and Public Process – evaluate
application, determine if any conditions should be met prior
to the granting of tax abatement (wage level, number of
jobs, clean industry, etc.), prepare resolution for approval,
and hold preliminary and confirmatory public hearing.
3. Post Approval Requirements – after construction has been
completed and new assessment has been determined,
property owner is required to file additional paperwork
with the county auditor.
4. Annually Monitor Program – property owner is required to
file additional paperwork with the county auditor 60 days
after the end of each year. The City Council should review
information to ensure that the property owner is compliant
with the conditions of the abatement.
The City currently uses the Tax Phase-In in a similar manner as
tax abatement.

Aurora Capital Loan Program
The Aurora Capital program finances the rehabilitation and
construction of commercial real estate in the heart of the city.
The maximum loan amount for work is $50,000 with a fixed
interest rate of 2.5 percent.
The objective of the loan pool is to stimulate physical improvements
to small businesses in downtown Elkhart. Funds shall be used
only for downtown development projects. Program guidelines
mandate that each project: be located within a specific boundary
area, be compatible with the Redevelopment Plan, and have a
substantial positive impact on the downtown area. Funds can
be used for development of market rate housing – but not lowincome housing – and projects must incorporate at least partial
office or commercial uses.
This is currently an incentive program the City implements.

City of Elkhart Comprehensive Plan Update
Chapter 9: Implementation

Tax Increment Financing (TIF)
TIF is a funding technique that takes advantage of development
or redevelopment to pay public infrastructure costs or other
improvements within a designated area. The tax increment is the
difference in the tax capacity and tax revenues generated after
development has occurred compared with the tax capacity and tax
revenues previously generated. The City then uses this “captured
increment” to pay or repay incurred public costs that are eligible
expenditures, including acquiring property, removing structures,
utility improvements, streetscape improvements, additional
studies, etc. The City currently uses TIF and has seven active TIF
districts as noted in Chapter Seven, Economic Development.
It has been the general policy of the City to use TIF only for
commercial, office and industrial redevelopment to help pay for
needed improvements through tax increment financing. The
City typically pays for the infrastructure improvements prior to
the development build out. This puts the city at a bit of risk,
and especially within this current economic climate, of paying
for infrastructure projects without the guarantee that the
development will materialized.
One of the options the City could consider is the “pay as you go”
approach. In this particular scenario, the City puts the onus on
the development rather than taking the risk themselves. In this
situation, the City would reimburse the developer for those agreed
upon and eligible project costs after the development has been
constructed. Using this type of approach ensures that increments
will be generated from the new construction and the City does
not issue bonds for financing a project. TIF is an implementation
device for economic development and redevelopment and is
currently used by the City.

Regulatory Controls & Policy
Zoning & Subdivision Control Ordinance
Updates
The Elkhart Comprehensive Plan is a statement of policy and
it is not a regulatory document. The most common regulatory
means for implementing the plan include zoning and subdivision
ordinances. Zoning is the most direct method for regulating land
use. In addition to restricting uses, zoning ordinances also dictate
the bulk of development (typically through height requirements,
floor-area ratios, etc.) and its site placement (typically through the
use of building lot setbacks). The subdivision ordinance relies on
the right of municipalities to regulate the subdivision of land, and
places the burden of implementing public infrastructure directly
on the developer.

Adopted February 2, 2015

9.15

City of Elkhart Comprehensive Plan Update
Chapter 9: Implementation

Currently the zoning for the City is managed through Elkhart’s
Planning Department as well as the Plan Commission. Therefore,
the City should consider revising its ordinances to be consistent
with the recommendations of this plan.

Capital Improvement Program (CIP)
The CIP is a planning document that covers a timeframe of
three to five years, and is updated annually and implements the
comprehensive plan by providing the necessary funding for shortrange infrastructure and capital improvement projects. The
document provides guidance and planning for capital improvements
throughout the city and allocates financial resources to various
community needs and requests. The document states the City
Council’s prioritization of the financial resources available for
capital project spending by identifying which projects should be
included, when they should be constructed and how they will be
financed.
This plan represents the City’s tentative commitment to comply
with the plan unless circumstances or priorities change in the
future. The commitment is more certain in the first year of the
CIP and becomes increasingly more tenuous in subsequent years.
Nevertheless, the CIP should be used as the City’s present plan and
priority over the next three to five years. Even though the CIP is a
planning document, it should not be an automatic authorization of
the construction of projects, because of the procurement process
and the allocation of resources.
This would be a new program for the City to implement.

Infrastructure Replacement Plan and Policy
(IRPP)
Planning and providing financing for capital replacement costs
is a difficult challenge for the City during this economic climate.
Determining replacement costs involves evaluating assets and their
expected useful lives, projecting replacement costs, examples of
financing options, determining bonding levels, estimating users fees
and tax levies and evaluating impacts on property owners. This
issue is addressed through the annual budgeting process as well as
using the CIP (discussed above). While both of these approaches
are important components of any capital planning process, neither
provides enough information about long-term replacement needs.
Therefore, planning for Elkhart’s long term replacement needs is
even more essential to support the redevelopment targeted in
this plan. Typically, in the past, as an incentive the City’s policy
has been to pay for replacement costs of infrastructure through
TIF, tax levies or through the general budget. The City may need

9.16

Adopted February 2, 2015

City of Elkhart Comprehensive Plan Update
Chapter 9: Implementation

to consider special assessments to an area to cover some of the
replacement costs if TIF or general funds are not available.
To respond to these issues, the City Council may want to create
and adopt an infrastructure replacement plan and policy for the
city. This plan would describe the city’s policy and conditions
necessary in paying for replacement infrastructure. The plan would
also present information derived through analysis of replacement
needs over the next fifty years. Examining future needs well in
advance, and consistent with the redevelopment objectives of this
plan, will allow the City to develop strategies for meeting future
demands. The infrastructure replacement policy requires a longterm analysis of replacement needs in an effort to:
•

Moderate changes in tax levies

•

Manage debt levels

•

Predict and plan for future debt issuance

•

Maintain quality services

•

Limit the use of special assessment

This would be a new program for the City to implement.

Housing Program
The recommendations support initiatives to conserve and
rehabilitate sound housing and to broaden housing opportunities
for the residents of Elkhart. The recommendations in this plan
support the initiatives of the Housing Needs Assessment Update
(April 2010). The future land use map illustrates appropriate areas
for housing. For detailed implementation measures regarding
Elkhart’s housing stock, the implementation task force of the
comprehensive plan should refer to the 2012 Housing Needs
Assessment Update.

Private Land Use Decision
The Plan guides landowners in the City of Elkhart. If landowners
want to use their land in a new way, they need to identify the zoning
district in which the property is located, and determine whether
the zoning regulations allow the development of the proposed
land use. If not, the owner needs to examine the Comprehensive
Plan concerning the property, since a change in zoning must be
consistent with the intent of the Plan.

Deteriorating Properties
As Elkhart continues to recover from the effects of the recession
on its local economy and the increased vacancy in buildings and
land due to the closing of businesses, the City will need to assess
and address deteriorating properties. These properties could be
Adopted February 2, 2015

9.17

City of Elkhart Comprehensive Plan Update
Chapter 9: Implementation

considered to be “eyesores” within the community and impact the
success of economic development efforts. There are a few action
steps that the City could undertake to mitigate any potential
“community eyesores.” These action steps include the following:
1. Create and Adopt a Design and Aesthetics Overlay Ordinance
•

Conduct aesthetics and design survey within the
downtown, existing overlay districts and key targeted
redevelopment properties.

•

Determine appropriate design and aesthetic treatments
for the various areas within the community and key
redevelopment sites.

•

Develop overlay district that would correspond to each
area where it would be implemented.

•

Determine how improvements would occur whether
it be through public, private, or a combination of
mechanisms.

•

Adopt Aesthetics Overlay Ordinance.

2. Create a formalized list of unsafe buildings, under-utilized
properties and key properties for redevelopment.
•

Identify/inventory buildings.

•

Prioritize worst cases.

•

Determine if design & aesthetics overlay would be
pertinent to implement on identified property.

•

Begin outreach to property/business owners to
determine clean-up/aesthetic treatments.

•

Determine if formal code enforcement is needed.
Consider litigation if necessary.

•

Incentivize compliance by property owner to clean
up properties/site by providing tax incentives, disposal
assistance,
mitigation
assistance,
infrastructure
improvements, or partnership to create redevelopment
plans.

3. The City should develop a more formalized pursuit of nonconformities and obsolete uses.

City of Elkhart Comprehensive Plan Update
Chapter 9: Implementation

•

Determine higher/better use for sites which could be
just green space, tree production, sod production, solar
field, community facility, etc.

•

Determine relocation opportunities of businesses into
zoning districts or industrial parks that are planned for
such uses.

•

Incentivize relocation or removal including moving
assistance, tax incentives, disposal assistance, mitigation
assistance, break on permit fees/utility permits and
connection fees.

•

Determine who can take title to land if current owner
wants to sell, or make donation.

4. Consider de-annexation.
•

The City should have conversations with the County to
determine if County is interested in taking back excess
land.

•

Prior to any de-annexation, the City should confirm that
if de-annexation occurs it does not create legal issues
for City in the future if failure to comply with annexation
ordinance or associated “Fiscal Plan” ever occurred.

Goals & Recommendations Prioritization
Throughout this comprehensive plan, several goals and
recommendations were made. As mentioned in this chapter,
this plan is a 20 year document and therefore, not all of the
recommendations can and should be implemented at one
time. The purpose of this section is to summarize the goals
and recommendations and identify what tools are needed to
implement the recommendations. The table below also spells
out who, whether public or private, should be involved in the
implementation of that particular recommendation. A lead
entity is identified with the support entities listed below it. It
is anticipated that the lead entity will spearhead that particular
recommendation and involve the support entities to assist. The
level of importance and level of difficulty help to prioritize the
recommendations along with the timeline for implementation. The
level of importance signifies how important the recommendation
is to the City’s vision in regards to the series of recommendations
under the goal. A high importance obviously increases the priority
whereas a low priority means that the recommendation is one of
the last ones to be implemented. The level of difficulty indicates
how difficult a recommendation is to implement. A level one
means there are little to no challenges or constraints to implement
the recommendation. If the level of difficulty is coupled with the
high level of importance, then the recommendation becomes
Adopted February 2, 2015

9.19

City of Elkhart Comprehensive Plan Update
Chapter 9: Implementation

one of the top recommendations under that goal to implement
first. However, if a level of difficulty is four, it means there are a
number of challenges to implement and it will likely take some
time before the recommendation can be fully implemented. If a
high level of difficulty is coupled with a high level of importance
then the recommendation will be a higher priority but may take
longer to implement, whereas a low importance and a high level of
difficulty makes that recommendation one of the last ones to be
implemented as noted by the timeframe. There is nothing to say,
however, that a recommendation must fall within the suggested
timeline for implementation.
DOWNTOWN/CULTURAL GOAL: Continue revitalization
of Elkhart’s downtown to re-establish itself as a center of
commercial, civic, cultural, and social activity.
Downtown is a part of Elkhart’s iconic identity. In most
communities, the economic health and vitality of a city is gauged
by the condition of its downtown. Revitalization of Downtown
Elkhart has been a continuous effort for more than a decade.
Elkhart’s citizens and City leadership have indicated on numerous
occasions that downtown is important and should be an economic
development priority for the community. Downtown has many
residential, retail, and commercial space competitors throughout
Elkhart and the Michiana Region. Responding to this competition
and downtown’s competitive advantages, the Comprehensive

City of Elkhart Comprehensive Plan Update
Chapter 9: Implementation

Plan Update recommends preparing downtown properties for a
streamlined redevelopment process, capitalizing on downtown’s
unique qualities, enhancing downtown’s civic, cultural, and social
niche, and assisting the downtown management organization.
The Comprehensive Plan Update supports the previous planning
endeavors, in particular the 2004 Downtown Action Agenda, which
outline strategies for downtown redevelopment, revitalization,
and organizational initiatives.
NEIGHBORHOODS GOAL: Direct investment, amenities,
and new housing development to established residential areas
within the City’s boundaries to create additional opportunities
for diverse ages, income levels, and stages of life in neighborhoods
of choice.
Neighborhoods are the places where everyday life occurs. They
create and form communities and flourish with the availability
of quality and proximate housing, schools, jobs, health care,
public safety, retail, and services. Elkhart’s residential population
has experienced a modest increase since 2000. The demand
for new housing, however, is stagnant and older neighborhoods
near the center of the City are continuing to experience high
vacancy rates. Residential growth has occurred primarily through
annexation of subdivisions in suburban areas adjacent to Elkhart’s
outer City limits. The Comprehensive Plan Update emphasizes the
need and desire to maintain and reinvest in existing residential
neighborhoods within the existing City limits. This maintenance
and reinvestment involves physical improvements to housing stock
and gateways, public and private sector financial commitments,
revised review and approval processes, and programmatic support
to reinforce Elkhart’s residential neighborhoods. Through these
various means, it is important to provide housing products at
various price points that appeal to homebuyers and renters that
demand a quality home in or near the center city.
Housing in the City of Elkhart should be affordable and attractive
to all citizens, regardless of income or whether they rent or own
their homes. The following action steps provide guidance to City
policy and decision-makers to support the Neighborhoods Goal.
Policy development requires the leadership and commitment of
Elkhart City officials and collaboration with other partners. It is
not solely up to the City to implement the following action steps;
however, it is necessary that the City create an environment that is
conducive to success in this area by dedicating more resources to
organizing efforts, setting guidelines, and enforcing ordinances to
enhance and promote assets, creating and maintaining partnerships,
and galvanizing stakeholders. Neighborhood associations are the
essential partners in accomplishing the action steps.

Chapter 9: Implementation

MOBILITY GOAL: Establish and maintain a balanced and
connected system for all modes of transportation within the City
and to regional networks.
Elkhart’s transportation system includes air, rail, water, and surface.
A balanced transportation system provides opportunity for all
means of travel in a cooperative and coordinated manner to meet
the needs of the community. It also fully integrates with adjacent
land uses, serves the travel demands and desires of citizens, and is
compatible with the natural environment.A transportation system
that provides safe, convenient, and efficient movement of traffic is
vital to a community’s well-being. It has significant influence on the
appearance, character, and economic viability and is an important
consideration when current and future land use decisions are
made. It affects the “where, when, and way” that development takes
place and creates access to markets, employment, and investment.
The Comprehensive Plan Update’s recommendations pertaining
to mobility include strategies that increase efficiency and safety
while meeting the access and needs of all motorized and nonmotorized modes of transportation. These recommendations are
intended to assist public officials, developers, and other interested
parties in making decisions relating to land use, public right-of-way
improvements, funding opportunities, future public investment,
and other transportation issues.
GOAL: Establish and maintain a balanced and connected system for all modes of
transportation within the City and to regional networks.

City of Elkhart Comprehensive Plan Update
Chapter 9: Implementation

EDUCATION & ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT GOAL:
Grow and diversify Elkhart’s economy through academic
programming, training, and business retention, expansion, and
recruitment initiatives. Enhance the skillset and educational
attainment of the workforce to qualify it for employment
opportunities in a variety of industries and positions.
The local and regional economy is fundamental to a community’s
quality of life and its citizens’ standards of living.A healthy economy
creates employment opportunities, supports the tax base, attracts
residents, funds public facilities and government services, and
establishes a community where people want to live. Education
and economic development are reciprocally linked in that an
educated population positively contributes to economic growth
and sustainability and a growing economy expands and increases
the quality of educational opportunities.
Economic development has both individual and collective rewards.
Increased personal income and wealth increase the tax base so a
community can provide the level of services that citizens expect.
Likewise, education also has both individual and collective rewards.
An educated and skilled individual has the ability to pursue
employment opportunities that offer a higher level of salary, thus
increasing personal wealth and contributing more to the local
tax base. Tax money is reinvested in the community’s educational
system which produces additional skilled workers required by
current and potential employers. A community that provides a
workforce to meet the changing needs of employers will be most
attractive for sustainable economic development efforts.
Elkhart prides itself on a skilled workforce. City leaders have
recognized for years the importance of diversifying the skill set
of its residents through conventional and innovative education
and job training endeavors. As economic trends shift, a diversified
workforce will not be solely dependent on one industry to provide
employment and will be better positioned to handle economic
ebbs and flows. The Education & Economic Development Goal
of this Comprehensive Plan Update reinforces the educationeconomic development relationship and outlines techniques to
capitalize on the region’s diverse educational resources to advance
the City’s traditional economic development efforts of business
retention, attraction, and expansion.
In addition to the City of Elkhart’s Economic Development
Department, the lead advocate of economic development in
Elkhart County is the Economic Development Corporation
(EDC). Since 2000, the EDC has been instrumental in attracting
and retaining quality businesses in the County and is the City’s key
partner in fostering Elkhart’s economy. The following action steps
provide guidance to City policy and decision-makers to support

AESTHETICS, NATURAL RESOURCES & OPEN SPACE
GOAL: Create opportunities for investment, activities, and
programs that ensure protection of the City’s built and natural
environments, maintenance of open space and greenways, and
respect for its heritage.

AESTHETICS, NATURAL RESOURCES & OPEN SPACE

Elkhart’s heritage and natural resources are essential components
of the community. Most notably, the St. Joseph and Elkhart rivers
have shaped the development of the City and their presence
contributes to the community’s character, environmental quality,
and recreational amenities. Because Elkhart’s natural resources
are inherent components of the City, the provision of adequate
greenspace and the protection of sensitive environmental
areas must be considered as necessary public facilities similar
to infrastructure and utility services. Additionally, heritage
preservation is also an important local government service and
a sensible investment, returning multiple benefits from modest
expenditures. The intent of the Aesthetics, Natural Resources &
Open Space Goal of this Comprehensive Plan Update is to protect
significant, scarce, non-renewable resources and develop ways to
capitalize on these assets while advancing preservation endeavors.
To achieve this goal, environmental and heritage stewardship
should be approached as a shared responsibility. Efforts will
require coordination among City departments, not-for-profit
organizations, the private sector, and other local, state, and federal
agencies to work together to maintain Elkhart’s unique sense of
place.

HEALTH & SAFETY GOAL: Coordinate public services and
amenities with land use decisions to protect the well-being and
quality of life of Elkhart’s citizens and its environment.
The advantages of amenable intergovernmental relations include
thoughtful and proficient land use decision-making processes,
coordinated growth management and preservation, efficient
delivery of services, and economies of scale. Growth and
development cross jurisdictional boundaries and departmental
responsibilities. There are no requirements for comprehensive
plans to address intergovernmental collaboration. However, as one
of the six primary goals of this Comprehensive Plan Update, the
health and safety of the Elkhart community includes maximizing
public resources through cooperation, streamlined processes,
and consolidated efforts to provide for responsible use of land
and logical growth. By coordinating decision-making and approval
processes, the City of Elkhart can better connect and align
transportation systems, City services, and other infrastructure and
resources with neighborhoods, commercial centers, institutions,
and recreational facilities.

Lincoln Park Neighborhood Revitalization Plan

1 - INTRODUCTION
The Lincoln Park Neighborhood Revitalization Plan was made possible through the partnership and commitment of residents of the
Lincoln Park Neighborhood, neighborhood stakeholders, and other community partners within a process facilitated by the City of
South Bend. The plan serves to identify long-term physical improvements over a 20-year period, while being mindful of the need to
identify short-term opportunity and maintain the momentum of the planning process. The purpose of this plan is to:
•
•
•
•
•

provide context for existing neighborhood enhancement efforts,
provide a set of recommendations that will help guide decision making in the Lincoln Park Neighborhood,
build confidence for future investment by neighborhood stakeholders and other community partners,
instill pride for residents who believe in their neighborhood’s potential, and
improve quality of life for residents, their children, and grandchildren.

A – WHY PLAN NOW?
In 2009, the Department of Housing and Urban Development designated a portion
of the City of South Bend, including the Lincoln Park Neighborhood, as a
Neighborhood Revitalization Strategy Area (NRSA) (See Map 1). The designation
allows dedication of resources towards neighborhood improvements, including the
demolition of substandard homes in Lincoln Park. It also serves to strengthen and
complement opportunities by other partners working in the neighborhood.
B – PARTNERS IN REVITALIZATION
An immediate opportunity for the neighborhood is to capitalize on the efforts of
multiple partners. This includes the South Bend Heritage Foundation, which owns
and manages the Colfax Cultural Center and the Charles Martin Youth Center, key
assets in the neighborhood. Additionally, Neighborhood Development Associates
and Habitat for Humanity are involved in redevelopment efforts in the
neighborhood.

2 - LINCOLN PARK NEIGHBORHOOD PROFILE
The Lincoln Park Neighborhood is located to the immediate northwest of downtown South Bend. The neighborhood is defined by the
area bounded to the north and east by Lincoln Way West; to the west by Blaine and LaPorte Avenues; and to the south by the eastwest alley running north of LaSalle Avenue (See Map 2). It is also immediately adjacent to the Lincoln Way West Commercial
Corridor, a major South Bend thoroughfare that connects downtown South Bend with the South Bend Regional Airport.
A - HISTORY
The Lincoln Park Neighborhood was developed in the early
1900’s with homes in a variety of architectural styles
including American Four Square, Bungalow, Queen Anne,
Shingle Style, and Dutch Colonial Revival. The homes
featured gabled roofs, wood shingles, brick chimneys, and
porches. The Lincoln Highway, a national road named after
President Abraham Lincoln, once passed along the
neighborhood on its coast-to-coast route.
For more than a century, the Colfax School (now Colfax
Cultural Center) has been a prominent feature in the Lincoln
Park Neighborhood (Photo 2). Built in 1898, the Colfax
School is the oldest remaining Victorian schoolhouse in
South Bend. The school was named after South Bend resident
Schuyler Colfax, the 17th Vice President of the United States.

Like many of the South Bend neighborhoods established prior to the middle of the 20th century, Lincoln Park was negatively
impacted by the economic, social, and cultural decline that took place in South Bend following the closing of Studebaker and other
industrial employers. The Lincoln Park Neighborhood suffered from the increase of abandoned/vacant homes, a reduction in owner
occupied residences, an increase in criminal activity, and a decline in commercial activity, particularly along the Lincoln Way West
Corridor. Many buildings in the neighborhood were demolished as population declined. The Census statistics tell the story. Between
1960 and 2010, the Lincoln Park Neighborhood’s population declined by 75%. Similarly, the number of housing units declined within
the same 50-year period by 56%.

Housing
The Lincoln Park neighborhood covers an area of approximately 50
acres or 0.08 square miles. It is comprised of 320 separate property
parcels characterized by six major land use categories: singlefamily housing; multi-family housing; mixed use; commercial;
institutional; and vacant land (See Map 3 and Table 2 for details).

Tract 19, Block Group 1 and 2
The neighborhood contains 147 single-family housing properties
(46% of the total), which are principally found west of Cushing
Street. Many lot frontages are 40 feet in width and most garages and other accessory buildings are found to the rear of the houses.
The small lot sizes limit the attractiveness of the properties to many homebuyers and investors.

Multi-Family
Eight multi-family properties exist in the neighborhood (3% of the
total), and all appear to exist within buildings originally constructed
as single-family residences. Some of these multi-family properties
are located along the Lincoln Way West corridor.

Commercial / Mixed Use
Thirteen commercial/mixed use properties are found in the
neighborhood (4% of the total), and all are concentrated along the
Lincoln Way West commercial corridor in an area east of Cushing
Street. This stretch of properties is anchored at both ends by strong
business fixtures on the corridor, with Louie’s Tux Shop (Photo 4) and
WUBS Radio headquarters / Interfaith Christian Church at the west end
and McDonald Studio to the East. Additional well-established business
like Gene’s Camera and Teachers Credit Union are immediately
adjacent to the neighborhood, north of Lincoln Way West. One mixeduse property exists on Lincoln Way West.
Institutional
The Lincoln Park Neighborhood is the home of three significant
institutional properties (1% of the total), each located along the Lincoln
Way West Corridor. The Colfax Cultural Center houses low-cost
studios and galleries for artists, performance space for dancers and
actors, a workshop space for a church and mosque, offices for several
art-related businesses and social service agencies.

Photo 2 - Louie’s Tux Shop represents one of many long time
businesses in and around Lincoln Park

The Charles Martin Youth Center (Photo 5) serves as a popular meeting
place for social, business and governmental gatherings. The Center is
home to the Augustus F. Hawkins Literacy Center, South Bend Friends
Meeting, New Discoveries Preschool and River Bend Math. The center
is dedicated to former South Bend resident Charles Martin, a youth and
community advocate.
SBHF owns both the Charles Martin Youth Center and the Colfax
Cultural Center, which are part of the Colfax Campus.
Built in 2007, Fire Station #2 is South Bend’s newest fire station; it
provides service to all of Lincoln Park as well as many of South Bend’s
other west side neighborhoods. The station also serves as one of only

Center is a centerpiece for the neighborhood

two stations in the City that house water rescue craft. The station was designed in order to complement the surrounding
neighborhood.
Vacant Land
There are 148 vacant parcels in the neighborhood (46% of the total). While some of these lots serve to provide parking to adjacent
businesses or open space to adjacent residences, many are without use or purpose, serving to detract from adjacent, occupied
residences. As noted earlier, some of these vacant lots are the result of house demolitions, by the City over the last several years to
address problem properties. While most of these lots are scattered throughout residential areas of the neighborhood, a few are
concentrated along the commercial district bordering Lincoln Way West. While for decades these unused lots have devalued
neighboring properties, their presence alternately offers future development opportunities.
C - BUILDING CONDITIONS
The Lincoln Park Neighborhood contains a total of 177 primary structures. A property survey conducted in August 2012 evaluated
building conditions based upon the following five categories: excellent, good, adequate, poor, and very poor. Survey results showed
the building conditions within the Lincoln Park Neighborhood ranged from the well maintained to the marginally habitable (See Map
4). Table 3 provides a breakdown of building conditions by survey category.
The results show that a total of 52 buildings or 29 % of all properties were found to be in good or excellent condition. This category
includes each of the institutional uses and many of the commercial properties noted earlier. Conversely, 52 buildings or 29% of all
properties were found to be in poor or very poor condition. It is likely that some of the worst buildings found in the very poor
category are or will soon be candidates for demolition by the City of South Bend Department of Code Enforcement.
The condition that describes most building conditions is adequate.
A total of 73, or 42%, of all properties were found to be in adequate
condition. By definition, these buildings need only minor repairs
and if repairs are completed, they could serve to add tremendous
potential to future investment in the neighborhood. However, if left
unmaintained, these properties would likely continue to limit the
neighborhood’s desirability.

Overall, the most significant challenge that the existing building
conditions presents is that buildings in the poorest conditions are not
concentrated on a particular block or street but are scattered throughout
the neighborhood, sometimes side-by-side with those that are well
maintained (Photo 6). Under this scattered scenario, each block and/or
street has problem properties, dragging down the value of surrounding
houses and the quality of life for the residents. Similarly, scattered
vacant and unkempt lots exacerbate the problem.
D - INFRASTRUCTURE CONDITIONS
A general assessment of current infrastructure conditions within the
Lincoln Park Neighborhood was conducted in September 2012 and
includes a review of streets, alleys, curbs, sidewalks, and lighting.

Photo 6 - Many blocks in the neighborhood contain both poorly
kept and well-maintained property, sometimes side by side.

Streets
Street within the neighborhood are in good condition, particularly for the major streets (Lincoln Way West, LaPorte Avenue, LaSalle
Avenue, William Street, and Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive). The most notable aspect of the street conditions within the Lincoln Park
Neighborhood is the significant number of brick surfaces (Photo 7). Even
though they have been in existence for about a century, these streets are
generally in good condition. Their existence serves as a marketable asset that
when bundled with other neighborhood strengths could attract desired new
investment.
Alleys
Alleys are generally in fair to good condition. Most alleys are dirt surfaces with
some sections in need of grading. A few less traveled sections have become
overgrown and/or covered with trash, usually in areas where adjacent properties
are vacant or abandoned. The two most significant east-west alleys (south of
Lincoln Way West and north of LaSalle Avenue are largely comprised of
improved surfaces.

City of South Bend, IN

Photo 7 - Brick streets represent one of the
neighborhood’s greatest assets

Lincoln Park Neighborhood Revitalization Plan

Curb / Sidewalks
Curb and sidewalk conditions in the neighborhood range from good to poor. The sidewalk conditions often correspond to the
occupancy and maintenance of the adjacent properties; unoccupied properties tend to be in the poorest condition. As noted earlier in
the plan, the scattered nature of vacant and/or poorly maintained structures impacts nearly every block in the neighborhood. This
impact extends to curb and sidewalk conditions as there are few blocks that have complete stretches of sidewalk that remain intact. A
more specific property-by-property review of curb and sidewalk conditions is necessary to plan infrastructure improvements.
Lighting
Most lighting in the neighborhood consists of wood poles with “cobra head” light fixtures under ownership by American Electric
Power (AEP). With tall poles on a single side of the street, this type of lighting is vehicle oriented and does not serve pedestrians well.
For those blocks with large numbers of vacant houses and lots, the level of lighting significantly declines. Recent lighting upgrades
along Lincoln Way West and Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive offer decorative poles and pedestrian oriented fixtures.

4 - PUBLIC PLANNING PROCESS
The Lincoln Park Neighborhood Revitalization Plan was developed through a
three-month public planning process from July 1, 2012, to October 1, 2012.
The process included visioning sessions, modeling exercise, and public
presentation – each led by City of South Bend Department of Community and
Economic Development staff. Neighborhood residents, stakeholder
representatives and other community partners – with more than 50 participants
in all, attended each of the meetings. Each public input session was preceded
by the mailing of notification letters to each household by the City of South
Bend. The City also developed flyers that were distributed door-to-door by
neighborhood stakeholders.
A - VISIONING SESSION
Photo 8 - Participants take part in visioning exercise
At two visioning sessions held at the Colfax Cultural Center on August 9, 2012,
attendees were asked to first identify the strengths and weaknesses of the Lincoln Park Neighborhood as a part of a group exercise
(Photo 8). Armed with that information, attendees then imagined how the neighborhood would appear in the year 2032 by listing and
presenting elements that they saw the neighborhood looking like in 20-years (Photo 9). These visioning elements served as the
foundation for the rest of the planning process. Following the sessions, these vision elements were assembled and analyzed by City
planning staff. The result of the analysis was a list of common visioning themes
or “big ideas.” These ideas, in no particular order, are as follows:

•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Attract New Housing
Identify Key Commercial Sites
Create Neighborhood Gateways
Enhance Public Infrastructure
Utilize Neighborhood Assets
Develop New Greenspace
Improve Lincoln Way West
Photo 9 - The visioning exercise resulted in a drafting of
priority visioning elements

B - MODELING EXERCISE
A second public input session held at the Charles Martin Youth Center on
August 29, 2012, had 21 residents, neighborhood stakeholders, and other
community partners in attendance. During this session, attendees were asked to
build upon the “big ideas” developed at the visioning session by creating a
layout or “model” of the neighborhood. During the exercise, each team was
equipped with an aerial photo of the neighborhood and a series of colored
shapes and markers to locate future elements within the neighborhood. The
elements and colors were as follows:
•
•
•
•
•
•

YELLOW - Single Family Housing
ORANGE - Multi Family Housing
RED - Commercial
GREEN - Green Space / Open Space
BLUE - Neighborhood Gateways
BROWN - Public Infrastructure Enhancement

Each of the three teams developed and presented a model that
physically depicted a vision for their neighborhood (Photos 10 &
11). While each of the individual models contained unique
variations of the provided neighborhood elements, they had many
similarities including maintaining single-family housing in the
western and southern portions of the neighborhood; creating a
centralized open space; developing commercial/retail use along
Lincoln Way West; identifying neighborhood gateways at major
intersections along Lincoln Way West; and enhancing
infrastructure throughout the neighborhood. The three individual
team results are shown in Figures 1-3.

C - PUBLIC PRESENTATION
On September 20, 2012, residents, neighborhood stakeholders, and
other community partners convened at the Charles Martin Youth
Center to hear plan concepts (Photo 12). As part of the
presentation, City of South Bend staff provided an overview of the
planning process including the results of the previous public input
sessions and presented a draft of the neighborhood master plan that
included future land use designations and other planning elements.
The presentation also introduced a draft of the six core
implementation strategies, listed as follows:
1 - Facilitate New Housing Construction
2 - Coordinate Rehabilitation Of Existing Housing
3 - Encourage Development Of The Lincoln Way West Corridor
4 - Introduce Open/Green Space
5 - Enhance Infrastructure & Transportation
6 - Establish Neighborhood Identity

The post presentation feedback in response to implementation strategies and other aspects of the plan helped to inform the final plan
document.
D - SOUTH BEND COMMON COUNCIL ADOPTION
Members of the South Bend Common Council participated in the planning process. The Council’s adoption of the Lincoln Park
Neighborhood Revitalization Plan makes it the City’s official policy for this neighborhood.

5 - MASTER PLAN RECOMMENDATIONS
Grounded on the ideas of participants during the visioning sessions and modeling exercise, the neighborhood master plan for the
Lincoln Park Neighborhood represents a 20-year outlook for the physical development of the neighborhood. The plan serves to build
on neighborhood assets and strengths and to pursue opportunities for improvement. Through future land use recommendations as
well as neighborhood identity, transportation, and infrastructure enhancements, the plan presents for the first time a comprehensive
vision for the neighborhood that broadcasts its potential. A breakdown of the master plan follows. See master plan map (Map 5) for
additional details about each land use and proposed enhancement items.
A - SINGLE FAMILY HOUSING
Much of the Lincoln Park Neighborhood is and has been historically characterized as single-family housing. A single-family house
means that the building is usually occupied by just one household or family and consists of just one dwelling unit. Single-family
housing will be predominately located in the area to the
west of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive and a small area
to the east along portions of Kunstman Court and Taylor
Street. This area of single-family housing is shown on the
master plan map in yellow. Maintaining single-family
housing in these areas requires the construction of new
housing and the maintenance and/or rehabilitation of
existing housing stock.
New Housing
The introduction of new housing in the area would reduce
vacant lots and introduce new residents. Housing styles
should reflect the existing homes in the neighborhood.
Nonprofit housing organizations including HFH (Photo
13), the Near Northwest Neighborhood, Inc. (NNN), and
the SBHF, have recently built well-designed single-family
housing in adjacent neighborhoods.

Map 5 - Lincoln Park Neighborhood Master Plan

City of South Bend, IN

17

Lincoln Park Neighborhood Revitalization Plan

Key recommendations for new single-family housing include:

1. Offer new housing styles consistent with the architecture of existing neighborhood structures, for example American Four
Square and Bungalow.
2. Assemble larger lot frontages and lot sizes necessary to accommodate bigger backyards/side yards that would offer added
private open space, garages, and other out buildings.
3. Provide new homes that include a variety of housing amenities, including but not limited to: number of
bathrooms/bedrooms, garage, storage space, appliances, and finishing materials.

Existing Housing
As a neighborhood that was primarily developed in the first few decades of the 1900’s, the oldest existing structures either have
reached or are approaching 100 years of age. Lincoln Park contains many (if scattered) well-maintained homes, characterized by the
recent building survey as in “good” or “excellent” condition. With nearly half
of the existing housing in the neighborhood classified as in adequate condition,
some minor repairs would allow the neighborhoods housing stock to be
improved and maintained for the next several years. If unmaintained, these
properties would degrade and have a negative impact on the surrounding
neighborhood. Maintenance of existing housing is essential to the future
revitalization of the neighborhood.
B - MULTI-FAMILY HOUSING
The future viability of the Lincoln Park Neighborhood is dependent upon the
range of housing choices matching the variety of homebuyer and resident
needs, including multi-family housing. Multi-family is a classification of
housing where multiple individual units are contained within one building. The
two principal areas recommended for multi-family housing are each located
along Lincoln Way West, one between Blaine Avenue and Harrison Street and
the second between Kunstman Court and Taylor Street. Each area is indicated

City of South Bend, IN

Photo 14 - Local Example of Well-Designed Multifamily
Housing (Triplex) by South Bend Heritage Foundation

18

Lincoln Park Neighborhood Revitalization Plan

by the orange areas on the master plan map. Lincoln Way West was selected as an appropriate location for new multi-family housing
because it can support a greater density and this location serves to buffer the single-family use immediately to the south from the more
intensive land uses. Existing multi-family housing located in the neighborhood that utilize originally built single-family structures are
supported but opportunities to revert these properties back to single family are also encouraged.
Key recommendations for new multi-family housing include:

1. Lower density development in the form of duplexes and triplexes should be explored. Well-designed low-density multifamily housing can be found within adjacent neighborhoods and would be well suited for Lincoln Park (Photo 14).
2. Utilize designs that reflect the size and dimension of single-family homes (Photo 14) so that they contribute to the overall
appearance of the neighborhood.
3. Offer amenities that would be attractive to senior living.

C - COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT
As the major corridor connecting downtown South Bend to the South Bend
Regional Airport, Lincoln Way West is home to many anchor businesses,
especially within the Lincoln Park neighborhood. Enhancing this strong
commercial district is recommended through development of unused and
underutilized commercial property between Cushing Street and LaSalle
Avenue. On the master plan map, the commercial area is shown in red.
This recommendation focuses on infill opportunities in two specific areas:
the southeast corner of Cushing Street and Lincoln Way West (Photo 15)
(former site of Lincoln Way Foods) and the vacant lots west of William
Street.
Photo 15 - The Southeast corner of Lincoln Way West and

Cushing Street offers a commercial development opportunity
for three significant neighborhood users: the offices of the SBHF; the
Charles Martin Youth Center; and Teachers Credit Union, a recent redevelopment project that could serve as a template for further

City of South Bend, IN

19

Lincoln Park Neighborhood Revitalization Plan

commercial development.
Key recommendations for Commercial Use include:

1. Infill commercial development in the neighborhood should complement current commercial development. For example:
a. A zero or limited setback from the corner and a building mass that serves to match that of the Charles Martin Youth
Center and South Bend Heritage Foundation,
b. An architectural style and use of construction materials that reflects that of the South Bend Heritage Foundation
offices,
c. Parking to the rear of buildings

D - INSTITUTIONAL USES
The existing institutional uses within the Lincoln Park
Neighborhood are among the neighborhood’s most significant
landmarks. A portion of the Colfax Campus, the Colfax Cultural
Center and Charles Martin Youth Center, give the neighborhood a
centerpiece by providing educational, cultural, and faith-based
opportunities to residents. Fire Station #2 (Photo 16) is equally
prominent as the city’s most modern firefighting facility. On the
master plan map, the institutional uses are shown in blue.

Photo 16 - Fire Station # 2 – The City of South Bend’s newest fire
station and a strong neighborhood asset

Key recommendations for Institutional use include:

1. Maintain the current institutional uses in the neighborhood and build upon their strengths.
2. Consider development along institutional uses such as Colfax Cultural Center a higher priority while assessing phasing of
residential units.

City of South Bend, IN

20

Lincoln Park Neighborhood Revitalization Plan

E - OPEN SPACE
During the visioning sessions, participants documented the neighborhood’s
lack of open space as a chief concern. This priority is reflected by the
establishment of an open space / green space area to the south of the Colfax
Cultural Center in a location otherwise bounded by Harrison Street to the west;
Cottage Grove Avenue to the east; and Fuerbringer Street to the south. This
area is shown on the master plan map in green.
This centrally located open space offers many advantages. It capitalizes on the
established cultural amenities and recognition factor already provided by the
Colfax Campus. Over time, the residential area surrounding the space would
become more desirable for residences and could serve as the first phase of
residential development, attracting new families into the neighborhood.
Finally, the location also serves to provide a central space that neighbors can
identify as something belonging to the neighborhood.

Photo 17 - A community garden would be a signifigant
addition to the proposed new open space. Photograph

Key recommendations for Open Space:

1. Consider open space development in phases, being mindful of current residents in identified lots.
2. Use of this property as open space could include the following uses: community gardens (Photo 17), a landscaped seating
area, and small neighborhood playground
F - NEIGHBORHOOD GATEWAYS
A neighborhood gateway is defined as a key point found on the edge of a neighborhood that serves as an entry into it. Three
neighborhood gateway locations for the Lincoln Park Neighborhood were identified: primary gateways at the Cottage Grove Avenue /
Lincoln Way West intersection and the Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive / Lincoln Way West intersection; and a secondary gateway at
the LaPorte Avenue / Oak Street intersection. These gateways are shown on the master plan map as blue asterisks. Neighborhood
gateways often incorporate signs or other welcoming elements to help inform residents and visitors about entry into the neighborhood.

City of South Bend, IN

21

Lincoln Park Neighborhood Revitalization Plan

Several neighborhoods in South Bend have incorporated
welcome signs (Photo 18).
Several South Bend neighborhoods use identity elements
separate from, or in addition to, gateway signs. These identity
elements include banners and street sign “toppers,” an
attachment to or incorporation within street name signs. The
Near West Side Neighborhood Organization currently utilizes
City of South Bend owned light poles along Martin Luther King,
Jr. Drive between Lincoln Way West and Western Avenue to
display banners that identify the neighborhood.
G - BUS SHELTER
Given its proximity to downtown South Bend and access to the
Lincoln Way West corridor, the Lincoln Park Neighborhood is
well positioned to accommodate future growth opportunities.
However, despite these advantages, neighborhood transportation
would benefit from future upgrades coupled with the previously
mentioned recommendations. Three bus routes currently serve
the Lincoln Park Neighborhood, including Route 4 (Lincoln
Way/Airport) (Photo 19), which primarily travels along Lincoln
Way West between the airport and downtown. The master plan
recommends working with TRANSPO (the municipal bus
system serving the Cites of South Bend and Mishawaka) to
explore the addition of permanent bus stop location(s) with
shelter(s) along Lincoln Way West. The priority location for a
bus stop/shelter at the corner of Lincoln Way West and Cottage
Grove Avenue is shown on the master plan map with the number
7. Providing improved access to mass transit helps serve the
Lincoln Park Neighborhood and improve Lincoln Way West’s
status as a “complete street” corridor for all users (motorists,
bicyclists, pedestrians, and mass transit users).

City of South Bend, IN

identity by informing those entering the neighborhood

Lincoln Park Neighborhood Revitalization Plan

While TRANSPO currently operates a “flag stop” system where riders signal buses along designated routes, they have recently
announced plans to switch to a designated stop system starting in 2013. The announcement included a request for public input
concerning the location of these designated stops. Once stops are determined, these sites should also be considered for bus shelters.
The addition of shelters would not be purely functional. Bus shelters could also be used to further complement the identity of the
neighborhood in their design and color.
H – STREET LIGHTING
Participants within the visioning sessions noted walkability as one of the
desired priorities for the Lincoln Park Neighborhood. This desire for
walkability is supported by destinations both within the neighborhood - like the
Colfax Campus and the future neighborhood open space - and numerous
destinations adjacent to the neighborhood, including Muessel School, the Kroc
Community Center, and downtown South Bend. With its pedestrian-scaled
fixtures, the decorative lighting along Lincoln Way West provides safety for
walkers while offering a unique identity treatment along the corridor from
downtown to Sherman Avenue (Photo 20). To improve the future walkability
within the neighborhood to local and citywide destinations, pedestrian-oriented
lighting should be extended west along Lincoln Way West.

decoration along the Lincoln Way West corridor

6 - PLAN IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES
In order to accomplish the desired future land use and other neighborhood enhancements detailed within this plan document,
implementation strategies and their associated action steps and priorities must be defined. Of equal importance and perhaps most
crucial to translating the action steps from concepts to reality, is the assignment of lead and partner organizations for each step. What
follows is a plan implementation matrix that contains the principal plan implementation strategies.

INTRODUCTION
PURPOSE OF REPORT
The purpose of this annual report fulfills the statutory duties of the Area Plan Commission Executive
Director as listed in Indiana Code IC 36-7-4-312:
(1) Propose annually a plan for the operation of the planning department;
(2) Prepare and present to the commission an annual report.

LEGAL FOUNDATION FOR PLANNING
Indiana Statutes, Title 36, Article 7, Chapters 1 and 4 as amended empower cities and counties to plan.
These units of government are further charged with the purpose: “to improve the health, safety, convenience
and welfare of their citizens, and to plan for the future development of their communities to the end:
1. That highway systems be carefully planned;
2. That new communities grow only with adequate public way, utility, health, educational, and
recreational facilities;
3. That the needs of agriculture, forestry, industry, and business be recognized in future growth
4. That residential areas provide healthful surroundings for family life; and
5. That the growth of the community is commensurate with and promotive of the efficient and economical
use of public funds" (I.C. 36-7-4-201).
Indiana Code further states that these units of government may establish planning and zoning entities to
fulfill this purpose (I.C. 36-7-4-202).
With the above state enabling legislation as its basis, land use planning has been ongoing for well over
a half century in many of Indiana’s local governments. The first consolidated city/county plan commission to
be established here was in 1955. Today, the Evansville-Vanderburgh County Area Plan Commission serves the
entire area of Vanderburgh County, containing 235.74 square miles (U.S. Census Bureau), with Evansville being
the only incorporated city and Darmstadt as the only incorporated town

FUNCTIONS OF AREA PLAN COMMISSION
AREA PLAN COMMISSION (APC)
The APC members are an appointed board that serves without compensation. Their
membership is composed of thirteen voting members, seven from the City and six from the County.
County Representatives
Member of the County Commissioners
Member of the County Council
County Surveyor
School District Representative
Two Citizen Members

City Representatives
Member of the Common Council
Member of Board of Public Works
Five Citizen Members

The Area Plan Commission meets on the second Thursday of each month at 4:00 P.M. in Room
301, City Council Chambers, in public hearing. The meeting is open to the public for citizen
comments on agenda items and consideration by the Commission. The Area Plan Commission keeps
minutes of its proceedings and official actions. These minutes and files are public record and are
kept in the Area Plan Commission office, Room 312 of the Civic Center Complex.
The following is a typical list of items heard by the Plan Commission:
 Requests for primary subdivision approval for plats and replats;
 Requests for city and county rezonings;
 Reports from staff; and
 Requests to amend the City and County Zoning and Subdivision Ordinances.
A set of criteria in State law and the Zoning Code must be considered by the APC in
determining appropriate actions on these items. One of those considerations is the Comprehensive
Plan, which serves as a guide for the Area Plan Commission and elected bodies on making all land
use decisions. Table 1 shows the data on the number of development proposals filed and the
actions taken by the APC in 2014. Except for the Rezonings and Special Uses categories, the number
of proposals requested in other categories was higher this past year than in 2013 and, in some cases,
2012 as well. The type of subdivisions filed were primarily minor as opposed to major subdivision plats.

BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS
The Board of Zoning Appeals (established in 1925 by the original zoning ordinance) is an
appointed board that serves without compensation. State enabling legislation provides for a system
of variance and appeal from the Zoning Ordinance requirements. The Board of Zoning Appeals
(BZA) is the local judicial entity that rules on these items.
The following is a typical list of items heard by the BZA:
 Requests for Variances from one or more of the Zoning Code requirements;
 Requests for Special Uses which by their nature cannot be classified in the usual
residential, commercial, or industrial zoning districts;
 Appeals by a petitioner of decisions made by administrative staff, administrative
board, or other bodies (except for the Plan Commission itself), in relation to
enforcement and/or interpretation of the Zoning Ordinance or issuance of
Improvement Location Permits.
Since the BZA acts as a judicial board, State Statue prohibits contact with any board member
concerning agenda items. Following a public hearing, the Board makes a determination of
approval, approval with conditions/limitations, denial, or modification based upon criteria found in
State law and in the Zoning Ordinance.
The BZA meets in open public hearings the third Thursday of each month at 4:00 P.M. in the
City Council Chambers, Room 301. The Board keeps minutes of official actions of its proceedings.
These minutes and files are public records and are kept in the Area Plan Commission office, Room
312 of the Civic Center Complex. See Table 1 for information relative to the number of variance and
special use requests heard by the Board of Zoning Appeals.

FINANCING
The Area Plan Commission is financed by annual appropriations from Vanderburgh County
and the City of Evansville. The total budget for 2014 was $ 786,385.00, 85% of which is funded by
Vanderburgh County and 15% by the City of Evansville. In 2014, the Area Plan Commission also
returned $296,904.98 to the County general fund in revenue it generated from filing and permit fees.
This figure is an 80 percent increase (over $130,000.00) in funds returned to the County above the
2013 total, due to the new fee schedule adopted by APC in early 2014. Information concerning the
2014 Budget and Disbursements is provided in Table 2. Table 3 displays the amount and type of fees
collected by Area Plan Commission for all revenue items such as rezoning and subdivision filing fees.

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN
The U.S. Supreme Court in their 1926 decision on Village of Euclid vs. Ambler Realty Company
(272 U.S. 365, 1926) determined that zoning was a valid use of the police power. Communities now
had a means of determining their own character. Courts began to perceive the need for a
comprehensive appraisal of all the land within the political jurisdiction and the consideration of
contiguous lands. This comprehensive appraisal was to determine appropriate land use and to
provide a firm basis for zoning decisions.
Because a community is a complex organization with many interrelated parts, the designation
of appropriate land use is an involved planning process. For this determination to effectively meet
future needs, local officials must have a good understanding of the interrelationships between the
diverse set of elements that make up the community such as types of soils, flooding potential,
vehicular circulation, availability of utilities, and many others. To meet this need, the Comprehensive
Plan was developed, which assimilates and organizes this information and designates appropriate
land uses, as a guide for the future.
Thus, the Comprehensive Plan is:
1. A comprehensive document addressing all functional components of development
within the City and County;
2. A set of action plans containing goals, objectives, and policies of the community
pertaining to orderly growth and development and quality of life;
3. A guide for the physical development of the community, including future land use;
4. A long range (20-year) planning document identifying what the community
aspires to become, suggesting actions to achieve these desires, and listing strategies
and techniques to avoid anticipated problems in the future; and A legal basis for the
local land development regulations in the community and is required by state law
(I.C. 36-7-4-601 and 701) to legally adopt zoning and subdivision ordinances.
The current Comprehensive Plan was adopted in 2004 after an extensive Plan review and
update. The Plan reflects input and assistance from numerous government agencies and private
individuals, from an appointed citizen Vision Committee, and from the general public in a series of
Comprehensive Plan meetings. The review and update of the Plan is part of an ongoing planning
process which involves the following primary functions of the Evansville and Vanderburgh County
Area Plan Commission:
7

1. Conducting an ongoing program of comprehensive and land use planning
accomplished through extensive research in areas such as demographics, education,
health, public safety, housing, public utilities, waste management, recreation,
transportation, and natural hazard mitigation.
2. Implementing the Comprehensive Plan by administering, updating and enforcing the
related ordinances (Zoning Ordinance, Subdivision Ordinance, Flood Hazard Ordinance
and Thoroughfare Regulations) and by coordinating related private, public, and
governmental actions.
3. Reviewing and providing an analysis of all land use proposals filed (e.g. rezonings and
subdivisions) for consideration by the Area Plan Commission, City Council, County
Commission, and Town of Darmstadt;
4. Advising local units of government on land use planning issues and providing
any requested information or special planning studies.

WORK ACCOMPLISHED IN 2014
COMPREHENSIVE PLAN
The current City/County Comprehensive Plan was adopted in 2004 by the Area Plan
Commission, Town Board of Darmstadt, City Council, and County Commissioners. Copies of the Plan
are available for review at the Area Plan Commission office, at several of the Public Library branches
and on the internet at the APC website: http://www.evansvilleapc.com. As part of the on-going
effort to implement the current Comprehensive Plan, in 2014, the APC continued to work on
accomplishing some of the recommended plan strategies or policies.
Work on an update of the current Comprehensive Plan began in 2010 providing another
opportunity for the public to look at the “big picture” and develop strategies to help shape the future
development of our community. Four public meetings were held early in the planning process to
obtain comments from City and County residents. Other local agencies that have responsibilities
related to land use and development have assisted staff by reviewing the draft Plan update, and
providing information and comments on the Plan, including the Department of Metropolitan
Development, the Evansville Metropolitan Planning Organization, the City and County Engineers, and
the Water and Sewer Department. Updating of the background data on which the Plan is based is
now essentially complete. New information incorporated into the draft Plan includes demographic
data from the 2010 Census, the 2010 land use inventory, more recent population projections, and
many other updates.
To improve the look of the Plan and to incorporate appropriate content from the regional
sustainability plan (officially titled “The Millennial Plan for 2040”) which was adopted in April, 2014, the
APC staff worked with the County Commissioners to secure funding to hire the Lochmueller Group,
the local consultants who authored the Millennial Plan. Specifically, the LG will reformat the
Comprehensive Plan to have the same professional look as the Millennial Plan and will also redesign
graphics using a more modern graphics software. The contract with the LG was finalized at the end
of 2014. Hearings on the draft Plan update will be held, and the Plan will be completed and
adopted in 2015.

ZONING ORDINANCE
The City and County Zoning ordinances govern land use in Evansville and Vanderburgh
County. The ordinances define the districts into which the City and County are divided, the
restriction on the uses within the districts, and the site development standards (amount of green
space, parking, etc.) within the districts. Per State law, rezoning decisions are made at public
hearings of the Area Plan Commission (acting as a recommending body), City Council, County
Commissioners, and Town Board of Darmstadt (who make the final decisions and adopt the rezoning
ordinances).
In 2014, the Area Plan Commission staff continued to research, write staff field reports, and
provide verbal comments at the Area Plan Commission and Board of Zoning Appeals meetings on
each proposed rezoning, variance, appeal, and special use. Verbal comments are provided at the
hearings to update the members on any changes that occurred since the staff field report was
written, and to inform the general public attending the meeting. Staff has continued to make visual
11

presentations using multiple digital images of each site area including aerial photographs for all site
development proposals before the APC and BZA. Following public meetings, applicants are notified
of official actions and records of the meeting are prepared and kept on file for future reference.
Official Zoning Maps, the permanent record of zoning districts for Evansville and Vanderburgh
County, are located on the GIS website (www.evansvillegis.com) and are updated monthly. The
zoning maps, in conjunction with complete and accurate legal descriptions, are maintained and
updated by staff for reference by the public as the primary source of zoning information, and are the
basis for issuing Zoning Certificate letters.
The review of rezoning, variance, and special use petitions is a significant aspect of the Area
Plan Commission’s efforts to administer the Zoning Ordinance. Table 1 displays the number of these
petitions filed in 2014, and the action taken by the Area Plan Commission. This data shows that the
APC staff processed and coordinated the review of 33 rezoning petitions. Of these petitions, 36 were
approved by the City Council or County Commissioners (additional carried over from previous year).
The total number of variance and special use petitions filed for consideration by the Board of Zoning
Appeals were 85 and 35 respectively.
The APC Staff researched, drafted, and obtained approval for several Zoning Code
Amendments in 2014. The first two amendments were a follow-up to work done in 2013 on the
following topics:
1. The issuance of improvement location permits, elimination of the requirement that plans
for multi-family developments be reviewed by both the Subdivision Review and Site
Review Committees, and updating the list of the Commercial Site Review Committee
members identified in the Code. In conjunction with this code change, staff also
prepared a new application form for non-residential and multi-family residential permits.
The modifications to the application form were adopted by the APC, and they went
into effect in April, 2014. An updated fee schedule was adopted by APC and also
went into effect in April 2014 to set fees at levels more comparable to other Indiana
mid-sized cities and counties.
2. The elimination of the requirement for hard and sealed surface for mini-storage and a
few other low traffic generating uses in the County if they meet certain requirements,
such as a perimeter green buffer. This amendment was adopted by the County in
January, 2014.
3. Another amendment passed in 2014 addressed temporary signs. More specifically, new
standards were established for on-premise, temporary signs such as banners, sandwichboards and flag signs. The amendments eliminated certain temporary signs from the
requirement to obtain a sign permit and listed those types of temporary signs within
certain parameters as exempt from permit requirements. The APC staff worked with an
ad-hoc Temporary Sign Committee appointed by the Mayor and included other
interested parties to reach a consensus. This proposal was adopted by the City Council
in July, 2014, along with a minor follow-up clarification amendment adopted later in the
year. Staff will monitor whether the new ordinance is working as intended in the City. If

12

no problems arise over a reasonable period of time, a similar County version of these
sign code changes will be filed for adoption by the County Commission.
4.

The City Council initiated an ordinance change in 2014 to relax parking requirements
for entertainment uses in the Downtown, along West Franklin Street and North Main
commercial areas. Staff worked with the City Council to revise the amendment to only
apply to the Downtown due to the extensive parking infrastructure (public parking
garages and surface lots) that exist in that area, and to expand the parking waiver to
all commercial uses. The APC recommendations for the Franklin and North Main
corridors were influenced by property owners’ comments in these areas who requested
to be removed from the amendment. These areas do not have the extensive parking
availability as in the Downtown. After discussion of these concerns with the City Council,
a consensus on a final version of this amendment was reached that allowed for the
elimination of parking requirements for all uses except for residential and child care
facilities in the C-3 Zoning District area of the downtown only. The ordinance change
was approved by the City Council in November, 2014.

Work on an additional Zoning Code amendment was initiated by staff in 2014 after the
suggestion for code amendments was made by a cellular provider who complained that the current
Code requirements were making it too difficult to find sites meeting the spacing requirements for new
cellular towers. Instead of just looking at changing the spacing requirements, staff undertook an
extensive look at Codes from other communities and determined that a more comprehensive
approach was needed to update the entire portion of the Code addressing wireless communication
facilities. A draft of this new section of the City and County Zoning Codes was completed in 2014.
The first draft of this ordinance change was recently reviewed by representatives of the interested
private cellular company and revisions are currently being made. Once work on the revisions is
complete, the second draft will be distributed to all interested parties and be discussed at an APC
meeting. It is anticipated that these amendments will be adopted in 2015.

ZONING ENFORCEMENT
The Evansville-Vanderburgh County area has three Zoning Enforcement/Investigator Officers
who, among other responsibilities, respond to complaints from the public, make site inspections and
take other enforcement actions. Enforcement personnel are responsible for investigating all
complaints of Zoning Code violations, contacting property owners when complaints are verified by
inspection, maintaining thorough and confidential case files, and working with individuals in violation
of the Zoning Code to effect prompt compliance. If all other methods are unsuccessful including
issuing fines, court action is initiated to ensure compliance. In 2014, there were approximately 800
complaint site inspections and, when warranted, these inspections were followed by issuance of
almost 600 Zoning Code violation letters.
In addition, the APC staff ensures that all proposals for new development also comply with the
ordinance. In 2014, staff continued inspecting new or expanded multi-family, commercial and
industrial development sites prior to the issuance of Certificates of Occupancy by the Building
Commission to ensure that the construction is consistent with the approved site plans. When
significant discrepancies are found that do not comply with Zoning Code requirements, the
developers are notified to make the necessary corrections. Certificates of Occupancy are not issued
13

until an inspection by APC staff reveals that the construction is in conformance with the approved
site plan.

SITE REVIEW PROCESS
The Site Review Committee is another of the ongoing review boards of the Area Plan
Commission. This Committee meets weekly to review plans for all new commercial development,
industrial development, all other non-residential uses, and apartment complexes, prior to issuance of
improvement location permits. During this meeting, plans are reviewed for conformance with
applicable codes, and the applicant is notified if additional information is needed. If a site plan is
denied, the Area Plan Commission staff notifies the applicant in writing.
The APC staff chairs the Site Review Committee meetings, serves as primary intake for commercial
and industrial permit applications, and is responsible for monitoring the permit through the review
process. Application forms and plans are received and reviewed, computer entries are made, and
plans are dispersed prior to the weekly Site Review Committee meeting to the following offices:
Building Commission
County Engineer
County Surveyor
City Engineer
Fire Department
Water and Sewer Utility
Other requested City & County agencies
Table 3 shows that in 2014, applicants paid APC fees to file 241 site development plans for review.
The total number of site plans reviewed was 245 which included plans of government entities that do
not pay fees. Of the total number of plans reviewed, 84 percent of these sites are located in the City
and 16 percent in the County.
Examples of the major projects reviewed are:
CITY PROJECTS:
 HCW Evansville (Double Tree Hotel), 601 Walnut Street, 10 Story – 244 room hotel
 Old Evansville Brewery, corner of Fulton Ave. & W Indiana St., change of use/remodel
for offices.
 Delaware Trace Apartments, 4201 North Green River Road, 2nd phase with 5 buildings –
80 apartment units
 Meijer Store, 2622 Menard’s Drive, 192,940 sq. ft. retail store with convenience store/gas
station
 Two Kins Investment, 1824 Pollack Avenue, 6 buildings – 76 apartment units
 CVS Pharmacy, 609 North St. Joseph Avenue, 13,225 sq. ft. retail building
 Echo Community Health Care, 316 Chandler Avenue, 2 story - 5,785 sq. ft. building
 Brickyard Condominiums, 3615 Upper Mt. Vernon Road, 1 – 6 unit building
COUNTY PROJECTS:
 Schnuck’s Market, 12920 Old State Road, 59,000 sq. ft. grocery & 14,000 sq. ft. retail
building
 Woodward Development, 15000 Foundation Drive, 100,000 sq. ft. spec warehouse
 Evansville Baseball/Softball Complex, 4300 Heckel Road, 8 baseball/softball fields
As part of an on-going effort to revamp the Site Review process, the staff unveiled the start-up of a
project tracking link on the APC website, where an applicant or a representative for a Site Review
project undergoing review can see a map of the projects currently under review, and click on their
14

location, which will then display information about the project including all the agency comments
and whether each agency has given their approval or if it is still pending. This will be helpful for the
applicants to be aware of their project’s status, the nature of any agency comments, and what
agency(ies) they might still need to contact to obtain approval and issuance of the Improvement
Location Permit from the APC. It will also give an opportunity to local contractors to see what
projects are being considered for approval in the City and County, and provide permit status
updates.

ISSUANCE OF PERMITS
The Area Plan Commission issues improvement location permits for residential, commercial,
and industrial uses before construction activity can begin. These permits are not only required for
new structures, but are also issued for additions, accessory buildings, changes of use, and signs. In
2014, the Plan Commission processed a total of 1,992 applications for improvement location permits.
The trends section of this report below provides more information and analysis of these permits and
other 2014 development related data.

SUBDIVISION REVIEW PROCESS
As designated by State law, the Area Plan Commission has sole authority over the subdivision
process. Prior to filing a subdivision plat, the APC mandates that all applicants requesting plat
approval or subdivision waivers must meet with staff in a pre-application conference. Requests for
primary subdivision plat approval are reviewed initially by the Area Plan Commission staff to insure all
required information for submitting a plat is included, and then by the Subdivision Review Committee
for technical assessment. The Subdivision Review Committee meets the second Monday of each
month to review major subdivisions. The Committee reviews all applications for subdivision plat,
replat and plat vacation approval, and makes recommendations to the Area Plan Commission.
Proposed subdivision plats and agency comment forms are distributed by staff to the following
offices:
Building Commission
City Engineer
County Engineer
County Surveyor
Health Department
Evansville Water and Sewer Utility
Evansville Metropolitan Planning Organization
Determinations on primary plat and replat approvals for minor subdivisions have been
delegated by the APC to the Subdivision Review Committee. A change in procedure was initiated
about a year ago that allows minor subdivisions to be reviewed by the Subdivision Review
Committee each week after the Site Review meeting. This results in a much quicker review time and
shorter time-frame for getting agency comments on minors back to the applicant, instead of waiting
a month to be discussed by the Subdivision Review Committee. This procedure has been working
well as minor plats generally do not have significant technical issues or complications. In most cases,
minor plats that are approved by the Subdivision Review Committee are not heard at the APC public
meeting unless accompanied by a request for subdivision waiver.
Major subdivisions, those with three lots or more, must be heard at a public meeting of the
Area Plan Commission. The plats, the staff field reports on each proposal, any recommended
conditions of plat approval, and other relevant information are then presented at the public hearing

15

for a determination on primary plat approval. Following public meetings, applicants are notified of
official actions and records of the meeting are prepared and kept.
The Area Plan Commission has delegated the authority to grant secondary plat approval to
the Executive Director. Secondary approval has multiple requirements that have to be met prior to
recording the plat. One of these requirements involves submittal of a Letter of Credit ensuring that all
subdivision improvements are installed by the developer at no cost to the taxpayers. As of December
31, 2014, the Area Plan Commission held 79 letters of credit for subdivision improvements. The Area
Plan Commission monitors the construction status of all subdivision improvements in the City and
County. In the subdivisions with active letters of credit, the total value of all improvements amounts
to $17.9 million. Since some of these improvements have been completed, the Area Plan
Commission is currently holding nearly $3.1 million in letters of credit for the remaining improvements.
These amounts change as improvements are made, inspected, and accepted.
As part of the subdivision process, the Area Plan Commission staff approves subdivision and
street names to avoid duplication, and assigns addresses for new lots in the City and County.
Table 1 shows that there were 55 subdivisions filed in 2014. Of these plats, 6 major subdivisions
were granted primary plat approval by the Area Plan Commission and 35 minor subdivisions were
approved by the Subdivision Review Committee. The number of subdivisions filed last year was
somewhat higher than the number filed in 2013. Table 1 also shows that the APC approved 3
subdivision waivers in 2014, and 4 requests were filed to vacate all or a portion of an existing plat.
Staff also worked on a proposed amendment to the County Subdivision Code in 2014 that
addressed expiration of primary plat approval; updated other wording in the Code; removed
sidewalks from the letter of credit requirement for new subdivisions by making their installation
contingent upon the issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy for new structures, allowed for
modification of the sidewalk requirements to install alternative pathways within a subdivision instead
of or in addition to sidewalks if desired by the developer; required any waivers of the sidewalk Code
provisions to be approved by the Area Plan Commission and the Board of Public Works (in the City) or
recommended for approval by the APC and approved by the County Commissioners (in the
County); and required all subdivisions installing any sidewalk to submit a pedestrian plan showing the
proposed location of the sidewalk and handicapped ramps. This ordinance was approved by City
Council in December, 2014, and was approval by the County Commission in February, 2015.
Along with these Code changes, the Area Plan Commission approved a new letter of credit form for
the banks to follow when submitting a letter of credit. The new wording on the form eliminates the
need for the staff to track the expiration dates of letters of credit, as the new letters do not expire-they automatically renew. The new letter of credit changes also require a 10 percent contingency
be added on cost estimates instead of 5 percent, and require inflationary increases in the amount of
letters of credit if the subdivision improvements are not complete and accepted.

INFORMATION AND TECHNOLOGY
GIS WEB MAPPING AND APPLICATIONS
The Area Plan Commission continued to support IT/GIS operations in 2014 by maintaining
numerous GIS layers along with many other on-going activities. The following is a description of these
projects and activities over the past year.
Commercial Site Review Status: Launched In December, 2014, this web map application provides
the public and other interested parties access to searchable and interactive information related to
commercial development within the City of Evansville and Vanderburgh County. Committee
members of Commercial Site Review are able to update the current review status of a project and
have that information published to the web map in real time, increasing communication between
the reviewing agency and the project applicant.
Residential Growth 2007-2014 This web application consists of data compiled and geocoded from
several permit systems that were in use over the years. The result is a time based map illustrating the
areas of residential development activity over time.
Application Summary 2014 All applications received in 2014 have been geocoded and can be
viewed by type (e.g. City Rezoning’s, Agricultural Building permits, On Premises Signs, etc.). The results
are summed to show area of activity and count summaries.
Economic Development Areas. A simple map viewer for the Evansville and Vanderburgh County TIF
Area boundaries as well as the Enterprise Zone.

17

DATABASE MANAGEMENT & RECORDS
APC continues to perform the weekly Property Master update/import for the Munis Permitting
Application. Property records that are entered into GIS are combined with property data from the
Assessor’s office to create the Property Master Table. This table is then imported into Munis, and
serves as the source data for the Munis permit application.
In 2014, staff combined the County Surveyor’s and Area Plans digital subdivision records into
one directory, thus creating a more efficient method of obtaining data through GIS and the creation
of the Subdivision Plat Index available at www.evansvilleapc.com
In addition, staff scan all new permit site plans, both commercial and residential. The plans are
then linked to the corresponding permit record in the Munis permit database.

AREA PLAN COMMISSION WEB SITE
In 2014, the APC converted its entire website over to the new City/County Vision Internet page
providing a more modern look and feel, while preserving the same level of information and its
availability. The Area Plan Commission domain and web address still remains:
www.evansvilleapc.com.
The Area Plan Commission web site includes all APC and BZA filing dates, meeting dates,
agendas and meeting minutes, staff field reports as well as instruction packets, forms, fees, the
Commercial Site Review agendas, and 2010 census data for the City and County. The entire
Comprehensive Plan and the City/County Zoning Codes are also available on our web address. All
this information will continue to be available in printed form in the Area Plan Commission office. In
addition to the Zoning Map, the website now offers a Maps and Apps directory for web mapping
applications. The APC also recently started an open data initiative, In addition to the regular
maintenance and web applications, providing GIS data to the public from a download page on
http://evansvillegov.org/index.aspx?page=3391

COMPUTER REFRESH CYCLE
Since information technology work depends heavily upon having the proper hardware, in
2014 we continued the process of changing out the old APC office computers with new ones having
GIS capability. In addition, with combined funds from other offices, we purchased a large-format
scanner/printer to replace our older, inoperable machine. These purchases will greatly improve our
ability to respond faster to customers and overall provide higher quality work.

COMMITTEE PARTICIPATION
The APC Executive Director and staff serve on the following committees beyond the
Subdivision and Site Review:
Downtown Design Review
Local Emergency Planning
Evansville MPO Technical
Pigeon Creek Greenway Advisory
Flood Advisory

18

NFIP / CRS
One of the ordinances that the APC helps to administer along with the Building Commission is
the Floodplain Management Ordinance. This ordinance was rewritten and adopted in 2011 based
on State Statue and is a requirement for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program. As
part of its duties in regard to floodplain management, the APC chairs the Flood Advisory Board which
considers any requests for variances to this ordinance. There were no floodplain variance requests
filed in 2014.
Through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), as of November, 2014, City and County
residents had 1,216 insurance policies totaling $281.15 million in coverage for potential flood damage
to their homes or businesses. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and Indiana
Department of Natural Resources administer the NFIP and ensure that local governments meet the
minimum requirements. To reduce the amount of the premiums paid for this flood insurance by City
and County residents, the Area Plan Commission coordinates the City and County’s participation in
the Community Rating System (CRS) Program. This rating, as established by FEMA and the Insurance
Service Office (ISO), rewards communities with insurance premium discounts for a variety of local
flood protection efforts that go beyond minimum NFIP requirements.
The City and County have continued to meet the requirements for their current CRS rating as
a Class 8 community. This rating means that City and County residents have received and will
continue to receive 10 percent discounts for their NFIP policies issued or renewed since April 1, 1999.
As a condition of continued participation in the CRS program, we are required to recertify annually
that we continue to implement the credited activities. The APC staff coordinates and compiles the
City and County CRS recertification documentation to keep the 10 percent insurance discounts our
residents currently enjoy.

PIGEON CREEK GREENWAY PROJECT
The proposed Pigeon Creek Greenway project will entail construction of a 40-mile paved
bicycle and pedestrian trail throughout the City and County. Currently, almost 7 miles of the trail is
complete along Pigeon Creek and through the Downtown riverfront. It has become a popular
community amenity that improves the quality of life for our residents and visitors. The Area Plan
Commission staff contributed to the project in 2014 through its participation on the Greenway
Advisory Board and assistance to the Parks Department on Greenway related matters, particularly
mapping the existing and proposed trail route. The APC staff also continued to notify Greenway
officials of development proposals that could impact a planned greenway route; and participated
as part of the Steering Committee for the upcoming 2015 Bicycle/Pedestrian Master Plan.

CENSUS
The Area Plan Commission holds the designation as a State data center affiliate for the
Evansville Metropolitan Statistical Area, and is a depository for Census data. Some of the local
census data and information is available on the Area Plan Commission website, and also at the Area
Plan Commission office. This data can be obtained for various demographic levels, including the
MSA, County, City, township, census tract and census block geographic units. The APC staff
responded to numerous requests from businesses, non-profit organizations, government agencies,
and the general public for local and regional census data. The APC routinely disseminates this
19

information as a public service, as we the local agency that annually offers this assistance for the City
and County. The Census Bureau depends on the cooperation of local governments to provide data
support and technical assistance.

PROVIDING PLANNING I NFORMATION TO THE PUBLIC
A continual function of the Area Plan Commission is that of a clearinghouse for information
concerning land use, zoning, population estimates and projections, housing, growth and
development, and other planning issues that affect the area. Information requests are frequently
received from developers, realtors, public officials, and the general public.

PROFESSIONAL EDUCATI ON
To increase staff knowledge on information that will allow the Plan Commission to better serve
City/County residents, the APC staff received training on the Munis Permitting, Tyler Cashiering, and
KRONOS Timekeeping software and benefitted from online webinars. Several of the staff members
participate in continuing education programs on an ongoing basis to meet professional certification
requirements, such as the Indiana Chapter of the American Planning Association annual state
conference.

CURRENT DEVELOPMENT TRENDS
ANALYISIS OF APC DEVELOPMENT DATA
The trends for various types of development proposals reviewed by the Area Plan Commission
over the last 10 years are illustrated in Table 4. This data shows that the development activity level in
2014 was generally about the same as previous years. However, subdivision activity has been
rebounding since its recent low point in 2009. The 55 subdivisions filed in 2014 is the highest level of
subdivision activity over the last ten years, and represents a 20 percent increase from the 2013 total.
The rezoning activity and the number of special uses filed were down slightly from the 2013 totals.
These figures reflect general economic conditions that are continuing to improve.
The amount of land affected by the approved rezonings and the subdivision plats recorded in
2014 are shown in Tables 5 and 6. APC records for last year show that a total of 95.8 acres was
rezoned, most of which was in the Commercial zoning category. In looking at the total acreage
rezoned in both the City and the County, every zoning category recorded acreage decreases from
the 2013 totals. The commercial districts accounted for the largest decrease among all zoning
categories due to the significant drop in acreage rezoned in the County. Land zoned into the
Commercial and Industrial districts actually increased somewhat in the City. The majority of the
newly zoned land in 2014 was also in the City.
The subdivision information in Table 6 shows a total of 168 lots were recorded on 203 acres
within the 47 subdivisions recorded in 2014. The lot total in the recorded subdivisions and
parcelizations is a low for the 3-year reporting period shown in Table 6, due to the lower than normal
lot total in the County. Given that the number of subdivisions recorded in 2014 as shown on Table 4 is
not a low number, the 2014 subdivisions had a fewer number of lots per recorded plat. The majority
of the new subdivisions are located in the County and are residential in nature. The acreage and the
number of recorded lots result in an average lot size that increased from the previous year total of
0.87 acres per lot. The average lot size for 2014 was 1.21 acres per lot. The new subdivisions will
improve the availability and selection of lots in our community.
Table 7 shows data on the type and number of Improvement Location Permits issued by the
Plan Commission in 2014. The total number of permits issued by the Area Plan Commission during the
year was 1,992. This represents only a one percent increase in permits issued from 2013. Most of the
permit categories on Table 7 show an increase for 2014. The categories with the largest number of
permits issued last year were Signs (621) and Additions and Remodeling (444). The Additions and
Remodeling category recorded the biggest gain for 2014 and Signs showed the biggest loss over the
past year due to a Code change exempting most temporary signs from permit requirements. Permits
for Single Family homes in the City also showed an impressive 74 percent increase, while permits for
55 commercial/industrial buildings were issued last year, a 41 percent climb from the 2013 total. The
Single Family and Commercial Activity Map on Page 24 illustrates the locations of the residential and
commercial permits issued in 2014.
Table 8 shows that residential permit activity in 2014 increased by 7.7 percent from the previous
year total. However, the 435 housing units permitted in 2014 is still somewhat below the normal
21

amount of units permitted in a “good” year, which is typically 500 units in the City and the County
together. Of the total housing units permitted overall, 45 percent of the units were permitted for
locations in the City, while 55 percent were permitted for the unincorporated County.
When examining these residential permits by type of unit, Table 8 shows a total of 308 single
family and 128 multi-family units permitted. This split on housing type equates to about 70 percent of
the new units being single family. When considering the geographic area in housing type, 89
percent of the total units permitted in the unincorporated area of the County were single family,
while just over half of the units permitted in the City were multi-family. This data demonstrates that
the units constructed in the City are providing more of a variety in housing types than the new units in
the County, which tend to be more traditional, suburban single-family.
In looking just at geographic area, the unincorporated County had 240 units permitted and
the City had 196. While the total for the County has been stable over the last few years, the City total
has been increasing. As has been the case for the last several years, none of the township growth
totals are considered to be a high level of permit activity (over 150 units) considering our past growth
trends. The data for our fastest growing areas shows a surprising change this past year as Knight
Township in the City, (in the Moderate growth category), recorded the most growth (with 127 units
permitted). Unincorporated Center Township has traditionally been our fastest growing area, but it
didn’t have as strong of a year in 2014 as it has in the recent past (only 103 units permitted). It was
followed closely by Scott Township (with 91 units). The growth in Pigeon Township showed the biggest
decline from the 2013 totals due to no multi-family growth occurring in 2014, which is highly unusual.
The 2004-2025 Comprehensive Plan has three growth scenarios and projections for the amount
of new residential land that could be required by Year 2025, with the highest projection being 7.4
square miles. Although only about a third of a square mile was used for lots platted in 2014, the high
projection for future residential land still appears to be valid. With the national economic outlook
continuing to rebound from the recession, the local development data is showing steps in the right
direction, and considering proposed local projects such as the downtown Hotel, the Evansville
branch of the IU Med School and the Promenade (far east side of the City) on the near horizon, we
expect these factors to have positive impacts to help grow the economy of our region well into the
future. The trends indicated in this local data are that our overall growth rate will remain steady and
stable, that the northeast portion of the County will rebound as the fastest growth area for residential
development in the County, and that the trend to multi-family units will continue within the City. Due
to the rate that demolition of older housing is occurring (about 150 units per year), future trends are
also expected to reflect significant urban core redevelopment.

City of Indianapolis

2001 Annual Budget
Department of Metropolitan Development
Mission Statement:

The Department of Metropolitan Development supports the City’s overall goal of enhanced quality of life in its neighborhoods by improving services to neighborhoods,
enforcing zoning and health and safety codes, and creating economic development opportunities that benefit all citizens. This vision is given effect by planning and
implementing services and projects that stimulate affordable housing, promote economic development, empower neighborhoods, and create jobs.

Significant Events:
Naval Air Warfare Center (NAWC)
The Naval Air Warfare Center, located on the eastside of Indianapolis, was transferred to the City at no cost in 2000. While the site currently houses some industrial
development, the available acreage is targeted for future industrial development and will be transferred to a private developer in 2000. The City will use the land sale
proceeds and has applied to the Economic Development Administration for a grant to fund the widening of 16th Street between Shadeland and Arlington Avenues,
which will complement future and current development at this site.
Brownfields
The City of Indianapolis has been awarded $150,000 in supplemental assistance funding from the EPA for the Indianapolis Brownfield's Redevelopment Program.
Funds will be used for site assessment throughout the City. The City also received a $39,984 site assessment grant from the Indiana Development Finance Authority
to assess a property in southeastern Center Township. In addition, the City has closed on a former brownfields site, Bemis Bag, that will be developed into a multifamily housing subdivision.
I70 & Keystone Redevelopment Area
The Real Estate Section is in the process of acquiring approximately 300 parcels of land to be redeveloped into a light industrial or commercial area. Acquisition,
property management and related development activities continue to complete this development.
Affordable Housing
In 1999, DMD supported the repair of 334 owner-occupied homes, the creation of 96 new home ownership opportunities and the rehabilitation of 104 rental units.
For 2000, the City has entered into contracts with community development corporations and other non-profit organizations, which at a minimum will result in the
repair of 340 owner-occupied homes and the creation of 81 new home ownership opportunities. The division anticipates creating, rehabilitating, or improving over
164 rental units.

2001 Annual Budget
Department of Metropolitan Development

Fall Creek Place
Construction and other redevelopment activities in Fall Creek Place, a federally designated Home Ownership Zone, will continue through 2000 and into 2001. As a
partner in the project, the Department will coordinate the community’s effort to build or rehabilitate nearly 322 homes, as well as new parks and infrastructure to
support these units.
Homeless Assistance
The City competes for HUD grant funds to prevent and address homelessness. In 2000, HUD awarded approximately $3.2 million to the City for ten projects that
provide homeless individuals with transitional and permanent housing and supportive services. An additional $1 million was awarded on a formula basis to the City
for shelters and programs assisting the homeless or persons at risk of homelessness.
Elimination of Slums and Blight
The City works with the Health and Hospital Corporation of Marion County to board and demolish unsafe buildings. In 1999, 951 were boarded and 224 houses were
demolished. Additionally, the City has and will continue to redevelop formerly environmentally unsafe land for future development.
Mark-to-Market Program
During 2000, the Department staff initiated the refinancing of Section 8 rental housing projects, totaling 327 units of affordable housing. These units will be
maintained in the inventory units for Marion County residents.
M-Track
InspectTrack and Mobile Data Computers have been implemented for the recording of field inspections. Each building, zoning, and right of way inspector has a field
computer and printer system that improves operating efficiency. The applications add consistency and continuity to enforcement action and permit compliance.
Combined Enforcement Efforts
Working closely with IPD, Health & Hospital Corporation of Marion County and the Marion County Prosecutor’s Office, Permit Compliance staff has assisted in
seeking resolutions to quality of life concerns through cooperative enforcement actions.
CoNECTions - Major Investment Study
The CoNECTions study has been conducted to identify strategies that will alleviate current and projected future traffic. It also aims to improve mobility throughout
the northeast corridor between downtown Indianapolis and the suburban communities in the northeast, including Fishers, Noblesville and Carmel. A final report is
expected in the fall, 2000. In 2001, staff will continue with follow-up activities related to recommendations made from the CoNECTions study.

2001 Annual Budget
Department of Metropolitan Development

Census 2000 - Local support for the US Census
Staff assisted the US Census Bureau in the preparation of a local Census Awareness program by increasing community participation and involvement in the Census
2000.
Update of the Marion County Comprehensive Land Use Plan
A twenty-month planning process has been initiated and will ultimately lead to a complete rewrite of the Comprehensive Plan for Marion County. This process
already includes work completed with the Township Needs Assessments and the Indianapolis-Marion County Development Assets Book. The Comprehensive Plan
will be developed for the entire county, rather than for each township. This will accommodate issues crossing township boundaries, including infrastructure and
watersheds. The Plan will also address issues related to development competition among the townships.
Regional Center Plan Update
The Regional Center Plan Update is a portion of the update to the Comprehensive Plan. This update focuses on identifying and prioritizing strategies for economic
development, housing, job creation, entertainment and recreation, and retail shopping in the Regional Center for the next 20 years (year 2000 through year 2020).

New Initiatives:
Market Square Arena: The Economic Development section, in coordination with the Division of Planning, will conclude an economic feasibility and land use study for
the reuse of the Market Square Arena site. An RFP for redevelopment will be issued in late 2000 or early 2001.
Technology: In conjunction with the Department of Public Works and SCT, the Mayor’s Action Center continues to participate in the development of improved
technology-driven communication systems between the service delivery organizations and the Mayor’s Action Center. The goal is to enhance service delivery and Center
responsiveness to citizen requests.
City Performance Review: The Township Administrators will create and distribute a survey to neighborhood organizations to analyze the performance of the City and
the Township Administrators’ efforts to meet neighborhood needs. The Township Administrators will follow-up with neighborhood associations to formulate strategies
that will address areas where needs are not being met as identified in the surveys and will update neighborhood associations as to the progress of these improvements
through meetings and internet postings.
Ordinance Review Committee: Township Administrators will implement and lead the internal Ordinance Review Committee composed of staff from Neighborhood
Services, Current Planning, Permits, Code Compliance and Corporation Counsel. The Committee will meet regularly to address issues related to zoning ordinance and
development code interpretation, with the primary goal of addressing conflicting/confusing regulatory requirements, in order to provide enhanced service to the public.

Department of Metropolitan Development

Lead-Based Paint Tests and Abatement: In 2000, HUD expanded the requirements for recipients of federal funds to test for and abate lead-based paint in homes that
are receiving assistance. In 2001, CDFS will enact policies to help community development corporations and other housing providers implement these new HUD
standards.
Automated Document Management: The Permits Division’s objective is to convert its documents into a digital format acceptable for input into the document
management system resulting in a reduction in the amount of time required to conduct permits research and reviews. Several additional record sets have been targeted for
scanning in 2001. In addition, the division will pursue the opportunity for accepting digital submittals.
Tidemark: PermitPlan v2.7 will be implemented. This will enable the division to build new cases and add new fields of information without requiring outside assistance.
It will also provide field inspectors the ability to access information from remote locations through use of mobile data units.
M-Track: InspectTrack Mobile Data Field Inspection System with real-time capability will be implemented. This will enhance the inspector’s ability to interface with the
City of Indianapolis computer systems and improve operating efficiencies from field inspection sites.
Combined and Improved Enforcement Efforts: In 2000, the City and the Health and Hospital Corporation of Marion County began collaborating on a project to share
Tidemark technology, which will enhance overall code enforcement efforts. This project will be complete in 2001. Additionally, the Department will improve code
enforcement city-wide through the addition of zoning inspectors.
New Sub-Area Plans: In 2001, the Planning Division anticipates preparing one new community plan for an inner-city or at-risk neighborhood. Community planning
involves area stakeholders in a collaborative process aimed at strengthening the neighborhood. In preparing a plan, the staff conducts a series of public meetings seeking
participation and contribution of ideas from people who live, work and own property in the area.
Special Transportation Studies: In 2001, the Transportation Planning Section of the Division of Planning will conduct special neighborhood and corridor studies as
refinements to the Regional Transportation Plan. This will further the goal of making the plan more multimodal within the context of livable communities.
Smart Growth Index: The Smart Growth Index, a software program awarded to the City from the Environmental Protection Agency, will be used to simulate
transportation and development scenarios and to measure their outcomes. It will be used as a major tool in the Land Use portion of the Comprehensive Plan Update and
will involve converting existing GIS layers and creating new data sources for use in the model.
Brownfields Catalog: In support of the City’s commitment to the redevelopment of brownfields, the Department will created a brownfields catalog, which will describe
all of the brownfields’ sites owned by the City. Each of these sites will be entered according to its redevelopment potential, evaluated for assessment and clean-up
activities, and actively marketed to developers.

Department of Metropolitan Development
Division of Administrative Services
Mission Statement:

The Division of Administrative Services provides managerial services to divisions within the Department of Metropolitan Development. These services include
management of several city-owned properties, and acquisition, disposal and maintenance of property in accordance with established area plans. In addition, the division
takes an active role in promoting economic development by leveraging public and private resources to aide in the creation of housing and new employment opportunities.

Organizational Policy:
The Division of Administration is organized in three sections: the Director’s Office, Real Estate and Economic Development.
Director’s Office
The Director’s Office manages DMD and directs implementation of the Mayor’s agenda. It also provides support to the Metropolitan Development Commission and serves
as a liaison to the City-County Council. Members represent the City on several boards including the Indianapolis Neighborhood Housing Partnership, and the Indiana
Theatre Condominium Association.
Real Estate
The Real Estate Section maintains an inventory of city-owned property and acts as the disposition agent for city departments. The section acquires and maintains property
under the redevelopment law for DMD and is responsible for property management, which includes the oversight of daily property management carried out by the
Indianapolis-Marion County Building Authority relative to the Indianapolis Canal, the Indiana Repertory Theatre building, and the Transportation Center at Union Station.
Economic Development
The Economic Development section assists with the implementation of commercial, industrial and retail development plans, which promote job creation and retention, and
increase the tax base. In addition, the section assists with neighborhood projects that revitalize communities. The section also makes recommendations to the Metropolitan
Development Commission (MDC) regarding approval of economic incentives, such as tax abatements, and conducts fiscal impact studies in support of the resolutions it
makes to the MDC.

City of Indianapolis

2001 Annual Budget
Department of Metropolitan Development
Division of Administrative Services
Significant Events:

Meadows
The division continues to work with neighborhood-based organizations and developers to design a comprehensive redevelopment plan for the area.
16th & MLK Redevelopment Area
The Real Estate section facilitated the acquisition of property for the redevelopment of the NCAA Distribution Center. The final phase will be acquired and developed
in 2001. The Real Estate section will begin Phase II with acquisition and other development activities in 2001.
Union Station
While the Station’s head house is entirely leased, the train shed has been vacant for several years. Throughout the spring and summer of 2000, the Metropolitan
Development Commission will be entertaining proposals from potential developers concerning reuse opportunities for this portion of the Station. Annual property
management for the Station totals $1 million; full occupancy will likely decrease the City’s yearly commitment.
Naval Air Warfare Center (NAWC)
The Naval Air Warfare Center, located on the eastside of Indianapolis, was transferred to the City at no cost in 2000. While the site currently houses some industrial
development, the available acreage is targeted for future industrial development and will be transferred to a private developer in 2000. The City will use the land sale
proceeds and has applied to the Economic Development Administration for a grant to fund the widening of 16th Street between Shadeland and Arlington Avenues,
which will complement future and current development at this site.
Brownfields
The City of Indianapolis has been awarded $150,000 in supplemental assistance funding from the EPA for the Indianapolis Brownfields' Redevelopment Program.
Funds will be used for site assessment throughout the City. The City also received a $39,984 site assessment grant from the Indiana Development Finance Authority to
assess a property in southeastern Center Township. n addition, the City has closed on a former brownfields site, Bemis Bag, that will be developed into a multi-family
housing subdivision.
I70 & Keystone Redevelopment Area
The Real Estate Section is in the process of acquiring approximately 300 parcels of land to be redeveloped into a light industrial or commercial area. Property
management and related development activities continue to complete this development.

Division of Administrative Services

Fall Creek Place
The Real Estate Section is coordinating with the Division of Community Development and Financial Services to acquire and later dispose of property for residential
home ownership development. Property management activities are ongoing. In 2000, the Metropolitan Development Commission selected a developer to coordinate
the redevelopment activities for this project.
Canal Walk
Property management activities continue at of one of downtown Indianapolis’ premier pedestrian green-spaces. The Canal Walk is a recipient of The American Society
of Landscape Architects Medallion Award for excellence in landscaping and Indianapolis Downtown, Inc.’s landscaping award.
Canal Extension Project
This three-block addition to the downtown Canal Walk will be completed in spring 2001. Besides offering the public a beautiful place to enjoy, it will also be a
development amenity.

New Initiatives:
Market Square Arena: The Economic Development section, in coordination with the Division of Planning will conclude an economic feasibility and land use study for the
reuse of the Market Square Arena site. An RFP for redevelopment will be issued in late 2000 or early 2001.
Buggs Temple: In July 2000, the DMD issued an RFP for the sale and redevelopment of Buggs Temple, a historically significant structure, which is located at the north end
of the Canal Extension Project. The title will be passed in late 2000 or early 2001, after the MDC has selected a redeveloper.
Brownfields Catalog: In support of the City’s commitment to the redevelopment of brownfields, the division will create a brownfields’ catalog which will describe all of
the brownfields’ sites owned by the City. Each of these sites will be entered according to its redevelopment potential, evaluated for assessment and clean-up activities, and
actively marketed to developers.

Department of Metropolitan Development
Division of Community Development and Financial Services
Mission Statement:
The Division of Community Development and Financial Services (CDFS) empowers neighborhoods and builds community partnerships by acquiring, promoting
development and effectively managing information and financial resources. The division carries out its mission by providing funds to support initiatives focused on
affordable housing, neighborhood empowerment, commercial revitalization, workforce development, homeless assistance, youth activities, senior services, health services
and the elimination of slums and blight. Additionally, the division provides financial management for DMD.

Organizational Policy:
CDFS manages the following grants from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in support of these initiatives: the Community Development
Block Grant, the HOME Investments Partnership Program, the Emergency Shelter Grant, the Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDs Program, the Home Ownership
Zone Grant and the Supportive Housing Program.

Significant Events:
Affordable Housing
In 1999, CDFS supported the repair of 334 owner-occupied homes, the creation of 96 new home ownership opportunities and the rehabilitation of 104 rental units. For
2000, the City has entered into contracts with community development corporations and other non-profit organizations, which at a minimum will result in the repair of
340 owner-occupied homes and the creation of 81 new home ownership opportunities. The division anticipates creating, rehabilitating, or improving more than 164
rental units.
Fall Creek Place
Construction in Fall Creek Place, a federally designated Home Ownership Zone, will continue through 2000 and into 2001. The Division will coordinate the
community’s effort to build or rehabilitate nearly 322 homes, as well as new parks and infrastructure to support these units.
Neighborhood Empowerment
The City provided technical assistance and funds to eight umbrella neighborhood associations located within seven targeted neighborhoods. Grants were awarded to
these groups to implement approximately 25 projects each year, which are identified and prioritized by the neighborhood.

Division of Community Development and Financial Services
Commercial Revitalization
The division continues to support the improvement of commercial facades by providing matching funds to local businesses for exterior improvements. In 1999 and
2000, the division continued to assist the Economic Development staff with land acquisition and household relocation for the purpose of developing an
industrial/commercial park at the I-70 and Keystone interchange.
Unsafe Buildings and Sites
In 2000, CDFS budgeted for securing and/or demolition of 3,000 unsafe buildings and the remediation of four environmentally contaminated sites.
The Annual Action Plan
Each year, the division prepares an Action Plan that details how the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), HOME Investment Partnership Program (HOME),
Emergency Shelter Grant (ESG), and Housing for Persons with AIDS Program (HOPWA) will be utilized in Indianapolis. Collectively, these grant programs total more
than $17 million. These actions must meet the goals and objectives of a five-year strategic plan entitled the Consolidated Plan.
Homeless Assistance
CDFS competes for HUD grant funds to address and prevent homelessness. In 2000, the division was awarded approximately $3.2 million for ten projects that provide
homeless individuals with transitional and permanent housing and supportive services. An additional $1 million was awarded on a formula basis to the City for shelters
and programs assisting the homeless or persons at risk of homelessness.
Youth Activities, Senior Services, and Health Services
Provides funds to more than 24 youth service providers for summer activities. CDFS also works with several community organizations to provide persons with senior
services and health services. It is estimated that more than 5,200 persons will be served by these projects in 2000.
Elimination of Slums and Blight
The City works with the Health and Hospital Corporation of Marion County to board and demolish unsafe buildings. In 1999, 951 unsafe buildings were boarded and
224 houses were demolished. Additionally, the City has and will continue to redevelop formerly environmentally unsafe land for future development.
Financial Services
The division provides financial management for DMD, which in 2000 is proposing a budget of more than $40 million. This includes budgeting, cash management, loan
servicing, internal controls and financial reporting. The division enables line managers to manage budgets through on-line procurement of goods and services, on-line
access to budgets, and increased training in activity-based costing.

Mark-to-Market Program
During 2000, division staff initiated the refinancing of Section 8 rental housing projects, totaling 327 units of affordable housing. These units will be maintained in the
inventory for Marion County residents.

New Initiatives:
Transitional Living Program for Youth: In July of 2000, DMD applied for three years of federal funding in the amount of $596,760 from the Department of Health and
Human Services. Funds will be used to provide fourteen units of transitional housing for homeless youth between the ages 16 - 21.
Lead-Based Paint Tests and Abatement: In 2000, HUD expanded the requirements for recipients of federal funds to test for and abate lead-based paint in homes that are
receiving assistance. In 2001 CDFS will enact policies to help community development corporations and other housing providers implement these new HUD standards.

Outcomes and Activities:

HUMAN SERVICES. The division invests in community centers, health centers and other service providers.

Youth and Family Services
The division works with partners in the community to provide funds for programming and transportation for senior citizens, access to health care and youth activities.

sustain the physical, social and economic development of their neighborhoods.

2001 Annual Budget
Department of Metropolitan Development
Division of Planning
Mission Statement:

The Division of Planning combines professional expertise with broad-based community input for the development of short and long-term goals, the creation and
maintenance of comprehensive plans and policies, and the recommendation of implementation actions, encouraging sustainable growth patterns in the Indianapolis-Marion
County metropolitan area.

Organizational Policy:
In 2000, DMD’s Division of Planning and the Current Planning Section joined into one division. Utilizing the zoning process, two staffs work closely in the development
and implementation of new long-range plans.
The Division of Planning is organized into six functional areas:
Administration
Administration supports all activities of the Division by providing:
• overall policy direction
• policy management
• program administration
• program development
• finance
• purchasing
• personnel
• clerical services
• distribution of public and internal information.
Comprehensive Planning
The primary function of the Comprehensive Planning Section is preparation of updates to the Comprehensive Plan for Marion County. The section also prepares smaller
area plans, typically for suburban areas and corridors, and occasional special area plans. Additionally, the section examines and documents land use and urbanization trends
in Marion County. It also conducts required special studies, such as cost-benefit analyses and future development projections.

City of Indianapolis

2001 Annual Budget
Department of Metropolitan Development
Division of Planning

Current Planning
The Current Planning Section processes all land use petitions in the most efficient manner possible; provides professional recommendations regarding those petitions; and
reviews, revises and updates the zoning ordinances to reflect community needs.
Information Resources and Policy Analysis
The Information Resources and Policy Analysis (IRPA) Section compiles and analyzes housing and other demographic information, which is then used to develop housing
policies, homeless assistance strategies, population forecasts and other reports. In Marion County, the IRPA Section serves as a data repository for the US Census, Social
Assets and Vulnerability Indicators (SAVI) data, the federal Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data and aggregated local permit data.
Sub-area Planning
The Sub-area Planning Section prepares smaller area plans, usually designed for older inner-city neighborhoods and corridors, as well as the Regional Center and special
districts. Working in conjunction with community organizations, the section formulates neighborhood, corridor and redevelopment area plans. An important ongoing
function of Sub-area Planning is a quarterly update to the City’s comprehensive database of Registered Neighborhood Organizations, churches and schools. These lists are
supplied to land development petitioners (for variances, rezonings, etc.), City departments, the Alcoholic Beverage Commission and other interested parties to use when
notifying the public of proposed actions. Specialized data requests, including custom maps, are prepared frequently by staff in this section using the City’s geographic
information system (GIS).
Transportation Planning
The Transportation Planning Section of the Division serves as the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) for the entire Indianapolis Metropolitan Planning Area
(MPA). The MPA includes not only all of Marion County, but also the urbanized portions of the eight surrounding counties. In order for local units of government within
the MPA to qualify for federal highway and transportation funding, coordinated area-wide planning for the entire metropolitan region must first be accomplished through the
efforts of the MPO. The Transportation Planning Section therefore provides short and long-range planning services for transit systems, highways, arterial and collector
roadway systems, bicycle and pedestrian transportation systems, air transport systems and air quality preservation initiatives.

Significant Events:
Wellfield Protection Zoning - Implementation
Staff assists the Marion County Wellfield Education Corporation (MCWEC) in the development and implementation of the public education and voluntary business
registration components of the Wellfield Protection Program. In addition, Indianapolis was awarded Groundwater Guardian status for the successful and continued
partnership with Marion County Wellfield Corp. in the development and implementation of the Wellfield Protections Program. This project will continue in 2001.

CoNECTions - Major Investment Study
The CoNECTions study has been conducted to identify strategies that will alleviate current and projected future traffic. It also aims to improve mobility throughout the
northeast corridor between downtown Indianapolis and the suburban communities in the northeast, including Fishers, Noblesville and Carmel. A final report is expected
in the fall of 2000. In 2001, staff will continue with follow-up activities related to recommendations made from the CoNECTions study.
Knozone Public Awareness Program
Accomplishments for the 2000 season include more television and radio ad campaigns, continuation of the elementary school program and reduced bus fares on
Knozone Action Days. This project will continue in 2001.
Information Resource Center
The Online Information Resource Center consists of three components. These include access to electronic resources through the Dow Jones Interactive service,
converted to Division of Planning documents, and the creation of electronic indexes to the Division’s documents. In 2001, IRPA will contract with an outside firm to
provide digital abstracts of the documents in the Division’s Master File. Conversion of these documents and indexing will make them easier to use for staff and the
general public.
Census 2000 - Local support for the US Census
Staff assisted the US Census Bureau in the preparation of a local Census Awareness program by increasing community participation and involvement in the Census
2000.
Update of the Marion County Comprehensive Land Use Plan
A twenty-month planning process has been initiated and will ultimately lead to a complete rewrite of the Comprehensive Plan for Marion County. This process already
includes work completed with the Township Needs Assessments and the Indianapolis-Marion County Development Assets Book. The Comprehensive Plan will be
developed for the entire county, rather than for each township. This will accommodate issues crossing township boundaries, including infrastructure and watersheds.
The Plan will also address issues related to development competition among the townships.
Regional Center Plan Update
The Regional Center Plan Update is a portion of the update to the Comprehensive Plan. This update focuses on identifying and prioritizing strategies for economic
development, housing, job creation, entertainment and recreation, and retail shopping in the Regional Center for the next 20 years (year 2000 through year 2020).

Congestion Management System
Transportation Planning will continue to identify and facilitate low-cost means of reducing traffic congestion. These include intelligent transportation systems, demand
management initiatives and signal interconnect projects.
Continue to Update Zoning Ordinances
The Current Planning Section will continue to monitor all of the zoning ordinances to ensure appropriate interpretation and/or use. As issues arise, changes can be made
through the public hearing process. The section will also be responsible for changes to ordinances or new ordinances recommended by elected officials, the
administration or the general public.
Technology
The Current Planning Section will continue to improve public access to records and to make zoning research more accurate and efficient through enhanced computer
technology. Specific tasks include maintenance and update of the zoning base map files, continual upgrading of zoning background information and documentation of
other land use petitions processed through the office.
Petitions Processed
A total of 569 petitions have been processed as of June 21, 2000. In 1999, 1272 petitions were processed.

New Initiatives:
New Sub-area Plans: In 2001, the Sub-area Planning Section anticipates preparing one new community plan for an inner-city or at-risk neighborhood. Community
planning involves area stakeholders in a collaborative process aimed at strengthening the neighborhood. In preparing a plan, the staffs conducts a series of public meetings
seeking participation and contribution of ideas from people who live, work and own property in the area.
Redevelopment Area Plans: Staff will assist in developing redevelopment area plans in 2001, similar to those done for the Consolidated Building at 115 N Pennsylvania
or Meridian Place at Meridian and Vermont. The need for redevelopment plans is coordinated among the Economic Development, Community Development and Financial
Services, and Planning staffs. Staff prepares the information necessary for the Metropolitan Development Commission to declare a redevelopment area. Establishment of
a redevelopment area allows government to accomplish a wide variety of public goals, including acquisition of endangered properties and the ability to accept proposals for
new development.
Website Monitoring: IRPA will provide website management, in coordination with other DMD web coordinators and the Public Information Officer. As part of its webbased efforts, IRPA will research the viability and costs of providing an Online Community Forum. In order to increase citizen Internet access and awareness, IRPA will
explore the possibility of applying for a Technology Opportunities Program Grant from the Indiana Department of Commerce.

Special Transportation Studies: Transportation Planning will conduct special neighborhood and corridor studies as refinements to the Regional Transportation Plan.
This also furthers the goal of making the plan more multimodal within the context of livable communities.
Smart Growth Index: The Smart Growth Index, a software program awarded to the City from the Environmental Protection Agency, will be used to simulate
transportation and development scenarios and to measure their outcomes. It will be used as a major tool in the Land Use portion of the Comprehensive Plan Update, and
will involve converting existing GIS layers and creating new data sources for use in the model.

Outcomes and Activities:

NEIGHBORHOOD EMPOWERMENT. The department enables citizens to work with the City to physically, socially and economically develop their neighborhoods.
Sub-area Planning
Sub-area Planning provides planning and technical assistance to neighborhoods, parks and other areas of Marion County. Plans are prepared which assess the housing
demand in neighborhoods undergoing redevelopment, analyze existing conditions and provide information for areas where redevelopment is scheduled.
Zoning
The Current Planning Section is the primary source for assisting Marion County residents in the various avenues of the land use process. These include petitions, review and
negotiation, mediation and remonstrance relating to land use. The Current Planning Section will continue to effectively process approximately 1,100-1,200 land use
petitions each year. Dockets and notices will be prepared in a timely manner in order for petitioners, neighborhood residents and public officials to be well informed of
proposals. Staff reports outlining professional land use issues will continue to be provided to decision-makers.
Ordinance/Rules
The Current Planning Section of the division is responsible for the revision of Zoning Ordinances. These are updated on a regular basis in order to remain current with the
needs of the City and to ensure continuity countywide. The application of zoning ordinances in a fair and equitable manner promotes safe and strong neighborhoods.
Administration
Administration provides managerial support to the Planning Division.

2001 Annual Budget
Department of Metropolitan Development
Division of Neighborhood Services
Mission Statement:

The Division of Neighborhood Services directly links Indianapolis residents, neighborhood groups, and associations to City services by providing high quality customer
service and a dedicated link to City departments.

Organizational Policy:
The Division of Neighborhood Services consists of two sections:
The Township Administrators
• Facilitate and enhance communication between members of the public and city government.
• Assist neighborhood residents, community organizations and businesses in identifying the need for city services.
• Enlist citizen and business participation with government and increase public awareness of the programs and services the City of Indianapolis has to offer.
Township Administrators are assigned to a geographical territory. They are dedicated to bringing government closer to the citizens by connecting residents, businesses and
community organizations to city and county services. Also, Township Administrators provide information to residents, businesses, and community organizations to increase
their understanding of how government works, who makes it work and how best to facilitate solutions. Further, Township Administrators assist citizens, businesses and
community organizations in understanding the process for gaining zoning and various approvals and permits; facilitating land use negotiations between developers,
businesses and neighborhood organizations; and educating citizens and neighborhood organizations on code requirements.
The Mayor’s Action Center
• Provides citizens with one central point to request information about City services and to request assistance in handling requests for service delivery.
The Mayor’s Action Center is a centralized call-center that provides information to citizens and initiates service requests on their behalf to City departments. Additionally,
the Mayor’s Action Center serves as the public switchboard for the City-County Building.

City of Indianapolis

2001 Annual Budget
Department of Metropolitan Development
Division of Neighborhood Services
Significant Events:

Community Problem Solving
Township administrators actively engaged neighborhood residents in community change. Administrators collaborated with neighborhoods on issues such as zoning and
code enforcement, police and security issues, concerns about schools and education, the maintenance of parks and the quality of park programs, and other quality of life
issues. Examples of community problem solving are:
•
•
•

Served as a catalyst for the development of Towne Run Trail Park.
Advocated the zoning of the Interstate Highways to regulate outdoor advertising signs on previously un-zoned property.
Established meetings with the United States Postal Service to discuss future plans for the Rainbow Station and Nora branches.

New Initiatives:
Technology: In conjunction with the Department of Public Works and SCT, the Mayor’s Action Center continues to participate in the development of improved
technology-driven communication systems between the service delivery organizations and the Mayor’s Action Center. The goal is to enhance service delivery and Center
responsiveness to citizen requests.
City Performance Review: The Township Administrators will create and distribute a survey to neighborhood organizations to analyze the performance of the City and the
Township Administrators’ efforts to meet neighborhood needs. The Township Administrators will follow-up with neighborhood associations to formulate strategies that will
address areas where needs are not being met as identified in the surveys and will update neighborhood associations as to the progress of these improvements through
meetings and internet postings.
Ordinance Review Committee: Township Administrators will implement and lead the internal Ordinance Review Committee composed of staff from Neighborhood
Services, Current Planning, Permits, Code Compliance and Corporation Counsel. The Committee will meet regularly to address issues related to zoning ordinance and
development code interpretation, with the primary goal of addressing conflicting/confusing regulatory requirements, to provide enhanced service to the public.

City of Indianapolis

2001 Annual Budget
Department of Metropolitan Development
Division of Neighborhood Services
Outcome and Activities:

NEIGHBORHOOD EMPOWERMENT. The department enables citizens to work with the City to develop their neighborhoods physically, socially, and economically.

Customer Service
One of the division’s visions is to provide quality customer service by responding to inquiries/requests for service from township residents and businesses. Staff members
provide direct assistance or referral to the appropriate agency/department with the goal of responding within one business day of the request. Direct interaction with the
community’s leadership and participation on the Township Teams (a team of city representatives from all the city departments chaired by the Township Administrators)
promote the goal of effective customer service and strong, safe neighborhoods.
Additionally, the Township Administrators encourage citizen participation in the delivery of city services and in the improvement of the quality of life within Indianapolis
neighborhoods and communities. Through mailings, notices and attendance at neighborhood meetings, the Township Administrators inform residents of opportunities for
effective participation. Activities include assistance in the formation of new neighborhood or business associations, information on neighborhood clean-ups, notices of
liquor board hearings and land use hearings, and training on how the land use petition process works. The process of providing opportunities for citizens to participate in
government decision-making results in stronger and safer neighborhoods.

•

Primary responsibility: Preservation Planner (new position)
Update existing Historic Area Preservation Plans.
Work with neighborhoods to develop new Historic and Conservation Districts.
Act as a liaison with neighborhood associations.
Assist DMD with planning efforts affecting historic and established areas of the city.

Environmental Reviews
• Primary responsibility: Preservation Architectural Reviewers (2)
• Provide required historic preservation reviews for federally funded projects.
Give Assistance for Preservation (GAP) Program
Primary responsibility: Preservation Assistant
• GAP administers small grants to low-income property owners in IHPC districts, which results in the restoration of highly visible historic architectural features
on applicants’ homes.

Significant Events:
Woodruff Place
The Woodruff Place Civic League presented the IHPC with a petition showing approximately 73% property owner support for developing a preservation plan that
could be adopted to establish IHPC designation for the neighborhood. The IHPC directed the staff to work with the Civic League in developing the final plan for
public review, public hearing and adoption. Review and adoption of the plan is anticipated in the fall of 2000.
Fall Creek Place Builders’ Guide
IHPC staff developed and published a Builders’ Guide which provides design guidelines and standards for new construction in the Fall Creek Place Home Ownership
Zone. It will be used by the City and builders who build in the area to ensure new housing meets the aesthetic and architectural goals of the plan for the area.
Sanborn Maps on CD
A 2000 initiative was to digitally image historic Sanborn Atlas maps in order to make them more accessible to the staff and public. Significant time and money was
saved as a result of finding a source that had already put Sanborn maps on CDs and provides them for sale. The division now has Sanborn maps from 1887, 1898,
1914/15, and 1956 available on CD.

New Initiatives:

City of Indianapolis

2001 Annual Budget
Department of Metropolitan Development
Historic Preservation Division

Designation of New Historic & Conservation Districts: Several neighborhood organizations have expressed interest in obtaining IHPC designation. At least one is
actively building support among property owners. It is projected that in 2001, at least one new district will come under IHPC jurisdiction and at least one neighborhood will
be working actively with staff to develop a plan for future designation.
Expansion of Preservation Planning, Enforcement and Staff Services: If an additional staff position is added, it is anticipated that staff will then be able to:
a) provide neighborhoods with increased preservation planning services;
b) provide quicker response to neighborhood issues;
c) increase staff’s communication with neighborhoods and presence at neighborhood meetings;
d) allow more effective neighborhood input into IHPC decision-making;
e) provide more consistent and timely enforcement of certificates of appropriateness issued by the IHPC; and
f) provide more assistance to City code and zoning inspectors within historic districts.
An additional position will also allow the two architectural reviewers more time to assist applicants and monitor construction projects for compliance with approved
plans.

Outcome and Activities:

NEIGHBORHOOD EMPOWERMENT. The department enables citizens to work with the City to develop their neighborhoods physically, socially, and economically.

Historic Preservation
The division’s emphasis is on enabling property owners in historic districts to maintain, develop, and renovate their properties within guidelines that have been developed in
conjunction with the people who live, work and own property in the area. Historic districts are residential and commercial neighborhoods that are strengthened when people
in the districts have greater opportunities to participate in the changes that occur around their property. It also gives them the confidence that the very character that attracted
them and their investment to the neighborhood will not be undermined by the actions of others.

Other activities involve providing preservation assistance countywide and assisting the City with preservation-related issues. Activities include:

Administration: General management, office operations and personnel matters.
Historic District Services: Issue about 350-400 certificates of appropriateness per year in historic districts; conduct monthly IHPC hearings, weekly Hearing Officer
hearings; provide daily staff approvals; handle violations; carry out the Threatened Buildings Program; and provide technical and design assistance to persons in historic
districts.
Historic Preservation Plans: Complete a Conservation or Historic District Plan anticipated to start in 2000. Work with a second neighborhood to complete a
Conservation or Historic District Plan.
General Preservation Services: Provide technical assistance to the City and members of the public throughout Marion County in areas outside designated districts.
Historic Preservation Environmental Reviews: Provide 1,000-1,500 reviews per year for federally funded housing rehabilitation, demolition and other projects.
Restoration Assistance: Work with DMD staff to administer a program that will make between five to ten small grants available to low income property owners in IHPC
districts. Grants are to be used to restore highly visible historic architectural features that will make a considerable difference in the visual character of the house within its
historic context.

2001 Annual Budget
Department of Metropolitan Development
Division of Permits
Mission Statement:

The Division of Permits issues permits in compliance with land use, development, infrastructure and building regulations, while utilizing combined inspections to enforce
those regulations for the promotion of responsible development.

Organizational Policy:
The Division of Permits receives budget support from two departments: the Department of Capital Asset Management and the Department of Metropolitan Development.
Employees in the division are both staffed and directed by the two departments.
The Division of Permits is organized into three functional areas: Administration, Permits, and Inspections.
Administration
Administration staff supports all activities of the division by providing overall policy direction and management, program administration and development, and management
of budget & personnel.
Permits
Permits staff works with citizens on a daily basis to provide quality service in contractor licensing, registrations, permit issuance and responses to public information. Permit
staff licenses and registers contractors, issues permits in compliance with applicable regulations, and manages records and databases for all permitting files. In addition, the
addressing staff assigns all street names and addresses to new or replanted developments in Marion County. The databases maintained by this section are shared with the
Metropolitan Emergency Communications Agency (MECA) as the basis for Marion County’s Emergency 911 system.
Inspections
Inspection staff inspects properties to ensure safety and compliance with local building codes and related ordinances. All inspectors and project managers have been
combined into geographic (Geo) teams and cross-trained resulting in more inspections conducted at each site visit. The inspectors perform building inspections, zoning
inspections, rehab inspections, infrastructure inspections and right-of-way inspections. Building staff continues to focus enforcement on non-licensed contractors and
persons performing activities without permits. Zoning staff continues to focus on resolution of neighborhood concerns.

Significant Events:

Encroachment Licenses
The 1999 revision of the encroachment ordinance moved the responsibilities for management of all public right-of-way encroachments from the Controller’s Office to the
Division of Permits. This ordinance requires that all approved newspaper containers be legally established with an encroachment license by January 2001, which could
increase the existing encroachment inventory by 1,000 additional license applications. An encroachment case is currently being designed in PermitPlan, which will
convert the process from paper to electronic, thereby providing a better method of tracking and reporting.
City of Indianapolis Integrated Permitting System (CIIPS)
The CIIPS application was implemented in January 2000 and is a result of the combined efforts of Current Planning and the Division of Permits to share critical zoning
information, which is necessary for the review of development permits. By integrating this application with our permit tracking software, PermitPlan, the CIIPS
application was launched, and critical zoning documents are electronically accessible to the desktops of permit staff.
Bar Coding
A bar coding application has been designed to reduce the amount of preparation required for documents prior to being scanned and loaded into our records management
software, FileNet. By integrating this bar coding application with existing software, the bar code label indexes pertinent information and is then attached to permit
documents. This application validates the accuracy of the critical indexes and also serves as an upfront electronic quality control check, which would otherwise require
additional time and effort of the records staff.
Internet Permitting
In the first six months of 2000, the HVAC, Plumbing and Structural permits have been added to the division’s existing Internet submittal options. Currently, the structural
permit submittal is available for work that does not require detailed plans. In the last six months of 2000, staff will add sewer permits for lateral connections and sewer
repairs, structural permits for homeowners and wrecking permits. Once these permits are completed, the division will work on additional permit types requiring plan
submittals and how to accomplish the online acceptance of those plans.

Tidemark
The upgrade of v2.5 was accomplished several months ahead of schedule and went into production in October 1999. In 2000, three version updates have been implemented
which provided solutions for several application bugs that were identified through extensive testing. Tidemark Cashier is under review and is being tested in our test
database environment. This component integrates several additional features, which will enhance the fee collection, reconciliation, and fee reporting processes. Currently,
reconciliation is required for the cash register and PermitPlan, while the correction and comparison are segregated processes. The implementation of this Tidemark
application is planned for late 2000 or the first quarter of 2001.

M-Track
InspectTrack and Mobile Data Computers have been implemented for the recording of field inspections. Each building, zoning, and right-of-way inspector has a field
computer and printer system that improves operating efficiency. The applications add consistency and continuity to enforcement action and permit compliance.
Combined Enforcement Efforts
Working closely with IPD, Health and Hospital Corporation of Marion County and the Marion County Prosecutor’s Office, Permit Compliance staff has assisted in seeking
resolutions to quality of life concerns through cooperative enforcement actions.

New Initiatives:
Automated Document Management: The division’s objective is to convert its documents into a digital format acceptable for input into the document management system
resulting in a reduction in the amount of time required to conduct permits research and reviews. Several additional record sets have been targeted for scanning in 2001. In
addition, the division will pursue the opportunity for accepting digital submittals.
Tidemark: PermitPlan v2.7 will be implemented. This will enable the division to build new cases and add new fields of information without requiring outside assistance.
It will also provide field inspectors the ability to access information from remote locations through use of mobile data units.
: InspectTrack Mobile Data Field Inspection System with real-time capability will be implemented. This will enhance the inspector’s ability to interface with
M-Track
the City of Indianapolis computer systems and improve operating efficiencies from field inspection sites.
Internet Permitting: The Division will continue to put more permits and information on-line. On-line permit research has proven successful. Right of way, electrical, heat
and cooling, plumbing, sewer lateral and sewer repair, and non-plan review structural permits can be applied for on the Internet. Wrecking, enhanced structural, and
Master permits will be available on the Internet in 2001.
Lead Based Paint Program: These efforts involve the training and implementation of un-funded federally mandated lead hazard containment and abatement programs,
which will have a positive impact on neighborhood rehabilitation programs.
Abandoned Vehicles on Private Property: Develop and implement a stronger program for the removal of inoperable and abandoned motor vehicles in residential
neighborhoods within the guidelines of the state statute.
Combined and Improved Enforcement Efforts
In 2000, the City and the Health and Hospital Corporation of Marion County began collaborating on a project to share Tidemark technology, which will improve overall
enforcement efforts. This project will be complete in 2001. Additionally, the division will improve code enforcement citywide through the addition of zoning inspectors.

Baby Boomers are entering their senior years and
their choices will influence senior housing issues from
now through 2030 as the balance of this generation
reaches 65+ years. These seniors are predicated
to live longer and will likely require a spectrum of
housing options that provide a continuum of choices
spanning from independent living to full-care nursing
home facilities. Most seniors desire to age in-place,
but unfortunately most seniors will reach a point
where they are no longer physically able to stay in
their homes and will require adequate housing for
this transition.
Currently there is an under-supply of appropriate
senior housing in Elkhart and in the short-term (2-5
years), this demand will likely grow significantly
as Baby Boomers transition from the workforce to
retirement. During this transitional period, Elkhart
has the ability to develop additional units to both
meet the existing unmet demand for housing and
add additional units for the forecasted influx for
rental senior housing in the next five (5) to ten (10)
years.

has forced the market to look at alternative methods
for both aging in-place and traditional senior living
options.
Multi-generational living arrangements provide
an affordable and social way for many seniors to
age within their communities. Multi-generational
households have historically provided care to aging
senior parents. Living with extended family may
increase as many seniors face depleting financial
resources to pay for assisted living. Traditional
single-family homes can easily accommodate multigenerational households, but some cities have
made amendments to regulations and zoning to
allow for “mother-in-law” suites or “granny flats”
to provide additional independence and separation
between the family household and senior household
members.

National trends
The Baby Boom generation is one of the largest
population segments in recent US history and will
have a huge impact as they transition from traditional
family households to empty nesters and finally
into senior facilities. This population represents a
growing demand for senior living options that will
be larger than any previous generation before them.
The need to accommodate this group, which could
easily absorb a majority of the existing senior units,

Senior co-housing provides a non-traditional option
that allows groups of seniors to jointly share a
property which may consist of a single housing
unit, attached units, or condos as an alternative to
aging independently in their own homes and having
to suffer the financial burden of home health care.
Within this cohabitation model, residents share cost,
common space, amenities, caregivers and home
health aids, and have the added benefit of increased
social interaction. This model has been popular
among the Baby Boom generation who has seen
the negative effects associated with institutionalized
senior care and seek alternative lifestyle choices.
Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities
(NORCs) referred to neighborhoods or groups of
homes and buildings dominated by senior-aged
householders. These naturally occurring clusters are
not built with this purpose in mind, but have ensued
due to an aging population that desires to age inplace. This approach to senior housing emphasizes
partnerships that support the delivery of cost
effective, community-based health and supportive
services within a defined geographical area. NORC
programs are typically supported by a blend of public
and private funding from various service-provider
agencies.
While NORCs provide a continuum of care within
an existing neighborhood, many communities are
turning to master planned communities to serve their
aging population. These planned communities often
provide a continuum of care including independent
living, assisted living, long-term care, and memory
care and hospice options within a single, easily
accessible campus. This new community provides
convenient access to senior services and health care
while providing social interactions among people in
similar stages of life .

Limiting fac tors to affordability
Rising cost of health care, changes in insurance
and declining fixed-incomes are forcing more and
more seniors to seek affordable housing options.

Financially, many seniors entering retirement have
lost significant retirement income, personal savings,
and home equity as a result of the Great Recession.
This reduction in financial well-being has moved more
seniors into lower income brackets, reducing the
resources needed to move into appropriate senior
housing. This financial insecurity has influenced a
developing trend among seniors to secure reverse
mortgages to provide the financial resources to
pay for daily needs such as groceries, medicine,
transportation, and housing costs. These national
trends are evident in Elkhart’s growing senior
population and additional thinking is necessary to
develop a strategy to support this population and
reverse the effects it may have on the City’s housing
market.
In addition to housing costs, medical care and
medications comprise a large portion of the monthly
expenditures for seniors. As these costs continue
to rise, seniors must dedicate a larger portion of
their income to this expense, reducing their ability
to pay for other daily needs such as groceries, home
maintenance, and overall housing costs and could
potentially lead to more seniors falling below the
poverty line and unable to support themselves.
Additionally, changes in insurance through the
Affordable Health Care Act may change the cost of
health care for this population group. While there
are no direct changes in the Medicare eligibility,

the Affordable Health Care Act may influence the
savings and / or expenses associated with medical
expenditures for seniors.

Over the next five (5) to twenty (20) years the
Baby Boom generation will drastically increase the
proportion of seniors in Elkhart. Baby Boomers are
generally healthier, more energetic and more active
than preceding senior generations. They have also
experienced greater affluence, but due to the recent
recession may have lost retirement savings and
experienced reduced home values. These factors are
leading many seniors to postpone retirement into
their later senior years.

Population trends
Overall population change in Elkhart has been flat
and based on recent growth trends, this pattern will
continue in the short-term. This stagnant growth
pattern is even more evident in the City’s workforceaged population (25 to 64 years), which lost
population, in large part due to the economic effects
of the recession. However, this loss would most likely
have been much greater, if not for the in-migration of
large numbers of younger, Hispanic families over the
last two (2) decades.
One age group that resisted this trend and is projected
to continue growing is the senior population. Based
on current trends, Elkhart’s senior population (age
55+), including the aging Baby Boom generation, is
projected to grow by nearly ten (10%) percent. In
some age cohorts that represents a nearly twenty
(20%) percent growth over the next five years with
seniors accounting for over one-quarter of the City’s
population in 2017. This growing senior population
will alter the city’s current demands for housing,
health and human services, and workforce availability
as household’s transition from families to retirees
and empty-nesters.

Housing trends
National trends reflect changes in housing needs
and preferences between the aging Baby Boomer
generations and growing millennial population. This
disconnect between the two groups is causing growing
concerns with the ability to transition existing housing
from one generation to the next, leaving many cities

projections for the next five years indicating little to
no growth. The recession also impacted household
growth which is a factor used in determining demand
for new housing. During the Great Recession,
Elkhart lost households, however, recovery from
the recession altered this growth pattern and new
projections indicate that the City will slowly begin
to add at a rate of less than one (1%) percent, new
households in the near-term.
In the case of Elkhart, the number of housing units,
which represents the supply, is already greater than
the demand for units and housing growth is projected
to increase at a greater rate than household growth.
Vacancies are already reflecting the impacts of the
recession’s distressed housing market which created
a vacancy rate near fifteen (15%) percent and is
expected to increase over the next few years. The
most likely culprit of this increase is due in large
part by the effects of an aging population and their
changing housing needs.
As seniors age out of
their housing and into apartments, assisted living, or
nursing homes, an influx of single-family homes will
come onto the market. In Elkhart there is currently
little to no new demand to absorb these units and
the already high vacancy rate may continue.
This downward pressure on the City’s housing market
will force some seniors to remain in their homes due
to the inability to sell in the distressed market. As
their ability to maintain their homes decrease, due
to physical and financial ability, homes have the
potential to fall into a state of disrepair. There will
be an increasing need to assist senior homeowners
to relieve the financial burden of homeownership on
limited incomes and the ability to access supportive
services, as this population continues to increase
with little to no ability to move out of their homes
and into appropriate senior housing.

Employment trends
The recent economic downturn caused employment
rates across the country to plummet. Elkhart did not
escape these effects, unemployment numbers in the
City climbed to a nation-wide high of over twenty
(20%) percent at the height of the recession. Today,
employment has risen, nearly reaching pre-recession
numbers due in large part to substantial employment
growth in 2012 when Elkhart led the nation in this
category.

among seniors entering retirement because pension
plans have been cut or reduced, the age to redeem
social security benefits has increased, and personal
savings have been depleted by debt and the recent
economic crisis. With housing making up a large part
of senior’s expenses, affordable housing options will
be a key factor in allowing seniors to live within their
tightened fixed incomes.

Senior housing options
Approximately two-thirds of Elkhart’s senior
population (65+) reside in single-family units. Most
seniors desire to remain in their homes for as long
as they are physically able to care for themselves
and their property. National trends indicate that

ELKHART SENIOR HOUSING market analysis

more seniors are turning to home health care
options to increase their ability to age in-place. This
trend appears likely to continue in Elkhart due to
the affordability of homeownership, a decreasing
demand for single-family homes, and a lack of
suitable senior-living options.
Seniors who age in-place need additional services
typically provided in many senior-living communities.
These may include home health care, financial
assistance, home maintenance or home repair
assistance, and modifications to existing units to
accommodate aging homeowners. Other aging
in-place options include multi-generational living
and non-family living arrangements that provide
additional opportunities for seniors to remain in the
community.
Options within the City of Elkhart offer seniors a full
spectrum of housing choices for those who desire to
eliminate the responsibility of maintaining a home
or have health issues – independent apartments,
assisted living communities, and nursing homes /
memory care centers. Most of these facilities cater
specifically to one senior housing type, however
continuum of care facilities offer a range of housing
types that allow seniors to transition to appropriate
housing as their needs progress.
Design of senior housing facilities have greatly
changed in Elkhart since the 1980s when traditional
high-rise developments were the predominate
building type. Today, senior developments tend to be
low-rise, accessible apartment buildings that provide
lifestyle amenities, a sense of community, and health
services that support the City’s aging population.
Senior housing campuses, which offer a continuum
of care, are a growing trend nation-wide and within
Elkhart County. Facilities within the County offer
options for seniors looking for increased social
interaction and access to convenient care services.
The integration of health care within the campus
design or nearby reduces the cost for operators and
provides more efficient services to their residents.

THE CONTINUUM OF
SENIOR HOUSING
Independent Living Units are age-restricted
apartments, often designed to accommodate the
physical and social needs of seniors. Community
atmosphere and age-appropriate services make
these units attractive to seniors who can live
independently, allowing them to maintain an
active lifestyle.
Assisted Living Facilities provide limited services
such as personal grooming, housekeeping, and
meals for seniors with limited physical and /
or mental abilities. Residents of assisted living
facilities typically cannot or choose not to care
for themselves independently and require some
form of daily assistance.
Nursing Home or Memory Care Facilities
provide intensive, 24-hour care for nearly all
personal needs of residents. Most residents of
these facilities have physical, mental, or other
health issues that do not allow them to care for
themselves.

Assisted Living Facilities provide limited services such
as personal grooming, housekeeping, and meals for
seniors with limited physical and / or mental abilities.
Residents of assisted living facilities typically cannot
or choose not to care for themselves independently
and require some form of daily assistance.
Nursing Home or Memory Care Facilities provide
intensive, 24-hour care for nearly all personal needs
of residents. Most residents of these facilities have
physical, mental, or other health issues that do not
allow them to care for themselves.

Senior housing inventor y
A recent inventory of senior housing options revealed
that the supply has been stagnant for the past ten
(10) years, while the senior population within the
City has grown dramatically. There has been no new
senior housing constructed for low- to moderateincome seniors since 1977 and many of the older
developments are in need of significant upgrades
and renovations.
A number of the aging buildings are in need of HVAC
and electrical upgrades, raising operating cost due to
the inefficiency of the outdated systems. Additionally,
some of the older facilities have not been updated to
meet current ADA requirements due to structural or
financial constraints. While some of the older units
are not as compatible with the current needs of the
aging population, the City is not without modern
facilities. Much of the new senior housing was built
in the decades between 1990 and the later part of
the last decade.

Primary interviews with senior housing operators
revealed that most facilities in Elkhart had vacancy
rates around five (5%) percent or less and a majority
of them had waiting lists that would adequately fill
these vacancies. The low vacancy rates and waiting
list indicates a pent-up demand for senior housing
that is not being met by the current supply.
Of the existing supply of senior housing, nearly twothirds are market-rate rentals. The market rate units,
which range in rent from $1,000 to $2,000 a month,
tend to be newer than their affordable counterparts
and typically offer a wider range of services and
amenities. Public and subsidized housing make up a
majority of the remaining units, with public housing
accounting for only a small portion of all senior
housing in Elkhart. Public housing units are incomerestricted units available to the lowest income
residents with household incomes below thirty (30%)
of the Area Median Income (AMI).

Amenities and health care needs
Not dramatically different from amenities offered
within a typical, non-age restricted housing
development, senior amenities tend to focus on
providing well-rounded services that limits the need
for residents to leave the facility for daily needs.

These services can include community rooms, dining
options, fitness centers, crafts and entertainment,
protected parking, housekeeping, and health care
services.
Access to health care is a significant driver of senior
housing, especially in assisted living and nursing
home facilities where most residents have health
concerns that require daily attention by health
care providers. Recent developments have seen
decreases in operational cost by locating in proximity
to regional health care providers due to the high
demand by their residents. Clustering senior housing
options near one another or adjacent to hospitals
or medical business clusters may reduce the overall
cost of housing and health care within the senior
population.

meets the requirements of the program and includes
single-family rental units. The voucher program
is administered locally by public housing agencies
(PHAs) who receive funding from HUD. Elkhart is
eligible to receive the Housing Choice Vouchers but
has not yet applied for additional credits through this
program. The City should re-investigate the ability
to utilize this program to provide housing assistance
to the growing senior and low-income communities.
Another federal program that requires additional
investigation is Section 202 which provides financial
assistance in the form of capital advances to cover
construction, rehabilitation, or acquisition cost
related to housing for very low-income seniors. HUD
provides private and non-profit developers with
interest-free capital. As long as the project serves
low-income seniors for the forty (40) year eligibility
period, the capital does not need to be repaid and
acts as a grant to the recipient.

Federal Housing Programs
A federal program delivered by the Department
of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the
Housing Choice Voucher Program provides financial
assistance to very low-income families, elderly,
and disabled households with an emphasis on
those earning below 30% of the Area Median
Income (AMI). The housing voucher allows eligible
households to rent housing of their choice that

Population projections, based on past growth
patterns, indicate the City of Elkhart’s population
will continue to decline overtime if social and
economic conditions remain relatively stable over
the next decade. The City’s workforce base shows
the greatest loss, which could impact Elkhart’s major
employers, but also presents an opportunity to
attract new residents. The most noteworthy change
is expected to occur in the senior (55+) population,
which shows significant growth as the Baby Boom
generation reaches retirement age.
Within the next five (5) years, twenty-five (25%)
percent of Elkhart’s population will be fifty-five (55)
years or older. The largest portion of the growth is
expected to occur in the sixty-five (65) to seventyfour (74) age range - recent retirees. This population
segment represents the first wave of demand
for senior-specific housing and increases as the
population ages, with demand increasing significantly
when people reach seventy-five (75) years of age.

Housing trends

Economic trends

Housing values suffered substantially from the
economic downturn of the recent recession.
Additionally, reduced housing demand due to
insufficient workforce population growth, declining
in-migration from employment loss, changes in
housing needs, growth in the County, and an aging
population, indicates little change for Elkhart’s
housing market. Without intervention, the potential
for continued decline is a real concern for the City.

Since the recession, the national economy has
seen positive growth and at the local level, growth
that has made Elkhart one of the fastest growing
employment bases in the country. This economic
recovery provides a positive outlook for job seekers,
but will have a less positive impact on the senior
community. Many seniors will continue to face
economic conditions based on reduced savings,
lowered home values, fixed incomes, and rising
medical costs.

These factors have greatly impacted the senior
population, causing many to remain in their homes
due to a dramatic reduction in the value and an
inability to sell during a slower housing market.
However, data shows the demand for owner-occupied
housing units is expected to increase, predominately
in upper income households. Both nationally and at
the local level, homeownership demand increases
until residents reach seventy-five (75) years of age,
and then progressively decreases as they age. This
increased demand reflected in the data is most
likely coming from Baby Boomer households, who
significantly outnumber the previous generation.
This population segment already owns their own
homes and is now reaching senior age; therefore a
growth in households that make up this age group
is realized.
Owner-occupied housing units are dominated by
upper- and middle-income households. While
homeownership is affordable to many in Elkhart,
very low- to moderate-income households tend
to occupy the majority of rental units. Looking at
the general population, not just seniors, the lower
incomes – those who could qualify for subsidized
or affordable housing– make up ninety-seven (97%)
percent of all renters. However, rental trends differ
greatly between various age groups. Currently, only
thirty-one (31%) of seniors rent and make up a very
small portion of the total rental market, accounting
for just over twelve (12%) percent of all renters.

16

ELKHART SENIOR HOUSING market analysis

While the recession may have impacted seniors
negatively; population and economic trends indicate
that Elkhart will experience a decrease in low- and
moderate-income senior households over the
next five (5) years. The biggest changes to senior
households will occur at the top and the bottom
of the income strata. Middle- and upper-income
households are expected to increase by twentyfive (25%) while the lowest earning households are
projected to increase by eleven (11%) percent. This
will create increased demand for public housing,
reduce demand for affordable units, and drive up
demand for market-rate rental units.
Housing affordability becomes an issue for seniors
living on fixed-incomes. Senior incomes fell during
the last decade forcing many households to live on
less income, reduced savings, and fewer retirement
benefits. Typically, as senior’s age, their incomes
decrease making housing less affordable, and it may
become very constrained on fixed-income budgets.

SENIOR HOUSING NEEDS
ASSESSMENT

Current Rental supply / demand
analysis
Based on the recent rental housing inventory*,
Elkhart’s overall supply of senior housing,
independent of residents’ income levels, currently
meets the demand. When you begin to look at each
income segment, it becomes evident that there are
not enough affordable and public housing units to
meet the current demand created by that subset of
the population.
Senior households that earn below 80% AMI qualify
for affordable housing and represent nearly twothirds of the current demand for senior housing.
In contrast, affordable and public housing units

there is demand for three (3) additional units. This

ELKHART SENIOR HOUSING market analysis

grossly underserved in Elkhart and the surrounding
market.
Very-low income households, those who earn less
than 30% AMI, currently do not have access to an
adequate supply of housing. Senior households that
qualify for public housing are expected to increase
over the next five (5) years. Under-supplied in the
current market, growth in this income segment
will only intensify the problem, leading to an even
greater housing gap in the near-term.
The only market that is currently met by the existing
housing supply is market-rate senior units, where
supply adequately meets the existing demand.
However, projected to grow by twenty-five (25%)
percent over the next five (5) years demand for
this housing type will increase dramatically. If no
additional units are brought into the market, the
current supply, even though it slightly outweighs the
demand, will not meet the additional demand.

that route, others will move into market-rate units
they may not be able to afford, forcing them to make
choices between daily needs such as food, clothing,
and medicine to cover their monthly housing costs.

Rental demand projec tions by housing
/ market type
As the Baby Boom generation ages the size of the senior
population is projected to grow disproportionately
to other age groups in Elkhart and throughout most
communities across the country. This growth will
severely affect senior housing, supportive services,
that were designed to serve the much smaller senior
population of past generations. Between 2010 and
2017, the senior population (age 55+) will grow by

Affordability analysis
Based on existing housing costs and income ranges,
homeownership appears to be the most affordable
housing option for seniors. This affordability may be
linked to the higher than average number of seniors
within Elkhart that have remained in their homes
well into, and in some cases, past retirement. While
this option may appear affordable at first glance, it
does not include the cost to provide any services
or amenities that are offered in traditional senior
housing communities.
Senior market-rate apartments present the most
financial burden to Elkhart’s seniors. This housing
option is only affordable to middle- and upperincome households. There are options for seniors
to secure public housing and subsided units, but
the current demand – which is expected to grow –
exceeds the current supply, leaving many low income
seniors to seek out substandard, low rent options
that do not provide the services needed by the senior
population. While some low-income seniors may go

an additional thousand households and make up
twenty-five (25%) of the total households in the City.
Within that age group, the subset between sixtyfive (65) to seventy-four (74) represents the first
significant increase in senior housing needs. This age
group is projected to grow the fastest, increasing by
nearly twenty (20%) within five (5) years.

Projec ted rental supply / demand
analysis
A basic supply / demand analysis indicates that over
the next five (5) years as demand for senior housing
continues to grow; an already under-supplied market
will not meet the mounting housing needs of Elkhart’s
senior population. Even with projected decreases in
low- to moderate-income senior households, there
will still be an unmet housing demand for subsidized
and affordable units. With increases in the very
low-income as well as market-rate households, the
demand for all types of housing will quickly outpace
the existing supply leaving Elkhart seniors with very
few options for high quality, affordable housing.

Based on recent economic trends, the economic
outlook for Elkhart’s seniors is more positive than
it had been during the recession. An analysis of
projected household income segments showed
positive growth for the middle- and upper-income
households with a decline in the number of
households that would be eligible for subsidized or
affordable housing units. On the other end of the
spectrum, very low-income households those who
earn under 30% AMI, are also projected to grow,
but at a much slower rate. What these projections
indicate is that in the short-term (2-5 years), the
demand for subsidized and affordable senior housing
units will remain high, but looking at long-term
growth (5-10 years) the analysis shows signs that
this demand will begin to decrease and alternatively
demand for market-rate units will increase.

Current projections indicate that there could be an
overall unmet housing demand in excess of 1,500
to 1,800 units over the next five (5) years, with a
majority of those units targeted towards low- and
moderate-income populations. Public housing units
will continue to be in demand, and with no new
units proposed, the current under-supply of units is
projected to increase. In this short-term timeframe
of two (2) to five (5) years, the increased demand
for market-rate units will quickly absorb the existing
supply of units and create an unmet demand within
the market for this price range.

Utilizing both the projected population changes
paired with income distribution projections and
senior rental trends, demand over the next five (5)
years for market-rate rentals are expected to grow.
Another market segment with potential growth is
public housing where data indicates future demand
in the short-term.

R ECO M M E N DAT ION S

Elkhart’s population is expected to remain steady
over the next five (5) years with the exception of
the senior population which is projected to grow
by nearly twenty-five (25%). The current supply of
rental housing targeted towards senior households
does not adequately meet the current demand and
will seriously under-serve any future demand as
this population continues to expand over the shortterm. Development opportunities within the market
present the City of Elkhart with new opportunities
to accommodate the housing needs of this growing
population segment.

S E N I O R R E N TA L H O U S I N G
M A R K E T D E V E LO PM E N T
OPPORTUNITIES
Shor t-term oppor tunities
Based on the current supply / demand analysis for
the City of Elkhart, senior housing needs are not
being met within the current market. Low- and
moderate-income households are greatly underserved, with present supply meeting only thirty (30%)
of the estimated demand for affordable rental units.
With an already under-supplied market, any growth
will increase this housing gap. While this population
segment is expected to decline, the existing unmet
demand will be able to absorb any new units
constructed within the City. Affordable units,
available to households with incomes between 30%
and 80% AMI, could be absorbed at a rate of 150 to
175 units per year over the next five (5) years.

Public housing is currently under-supplied as well
within the Elkhart market, with approximately forty
(40%) of the current demand met by the existing
supply. Interviews with public housing operators
supported these findings, indicating there were
waiting lists for a majority of these facilities. This
current unmet demand will continue to increase
as this segment of the population is expected to
increase by eleven (10%) percent over the next five
(5) years. Additional public housing units, set aside
for households earning less than 30% AMI, are
currently needed within the market with the ability
to absorb an additional 150 to 175 units annually
for the next five (5) years.

Long-term market oppor tunities
Even with a projected decrease in household
growth for this income segment, affordable units
will continue to be in demand until enough are
developed to meet the existing need. Long-term (510 years) projections indicate that households falling
into this income strata will decline by approximately
twenty-five (25%) percent over the next five (5) years
and reduce the current demand for affordable units
from over 1,000 units (in 2012) to roughly 500 to 750
units in 2017. If current demands are not met in
the short-term, there will be a continued need to
construct additional affordable units in the longterm.
Both in the short-term as well as the long-term,
public housing provides a development opportunity
in Elkhart. Expected to grow by approximately
eleven (11%) percent over the next five (5) years,

ELKHART SENIOR HOUSING market analysis

21

households earning less than 30% AMI will be underserved by the current supply of public housing
by about 800 units. Housing to support verylow income households represents a long-term
development opportunity; the number of units that
could be absorbed over the next five (5) to ten (10)
years depends on construction of new units in the
short-term timeframe.
Growth in the middle- and upper-income households
represents a long-term development opportunity for
Elkhart to increase their number of market-rate rental
units. The projected growth of these households
amounts to approximately 120 to 150 new units that
could be absorbed into the market over the longterm. In addition to growth in these income ranges,
rental housing numbers are projected to increase
among all age groups with younger generations
demanding greater amounts of rental units. If
continued growth rates of middle- and upperincome senior households are sustained, demand
for market-rate housing will exceed current supply
over the next five (5) years and appear to support
the ability to absorb fifteen (15) to forty (40) units
annually within the long-term period.

O P P O R T U N I T I E S TO
SUPPORT SENIOR
HOMEOWNERSHIP
Much of the short- and long-term development
opportunities are based on growth projections of
rental housing demand, but there is projected growth
in owner-occupied housing units within the senior
population. The Baby Boom generation represents
a large influx of households aging into what is
considered “senior” age cohorts. Traditionally, this
large population segment comes from a generation
where homeownership levels were high. This
continues to be the norm as Baby Boomers age.
In some cases they remain in their homes due to
a desire to age in-place, while others mobility is
limited due to economic hardships and lowered
housing demand that directly affect their ability to

22

ELKHART SENIOR HOUSING market analysis

sell their homes. No matter the reason, Elkhart must
rethink the definition of senior housing and how this
population will access senior care and services in a
home-based setting.
Recent housing and economic data for Elkhart
indicates that homeownership is one of the most
affordable options for senior housing in the City. This
affordability does not include access to health care,
senior services, or the sense of community created
within many senior housing campuses. There
are many non-traditional senior housing options
that can provide necessary services that deserve
additional exploration – multi-generational living,
non-family living, senior co-housing, home nursing
care, or naturally occurring retirement communities.
These alternative housing options reflect a growing
desire by many seniors to age in-place or in a homebased setting for financial and social reasons and
present new opportunities for Elkhart to satisfy the
increased demand within the senior community.

Describe the data sources used to determine the areas of greatest need.
Response:
Gary, IN used the HUD User NSP3 Mapping Tool to determine the areas of greatest need.
PolicyMap and the HUD NSP Data Set was also used.

Determination of Areas of Greatest Need
Describe how the areas of greatest need were established.
Response:
The City of Gary has chosen two discrete target areas that qualify according to the rules stipulated under
NSP3. The University Place project serves a small part of the much larger West Glen Park neighborhood,
which is one of the finest in the city, though still an area of great need. The community benefits from its
location adjacent to the Northeast campus of Indiana University, a large park, a golf course, convenient
shopping, one of the better high schools, and easy access to the Interstate highway system.
The neighborhood also suffers from the very soft market conditions that negatively impact the entire
city. There are many vacant houses in the overall community, some of which are clearly abandoned and
will probably never be rehabbed. Other houses are vacant between rentals or are on the market for
sale. In terms of maintenance, housing values, and abandonment, the streets nearest to Broadway are
the most troubled. Much of this results from the negative impacts of commercial structures on
Broadway, many of which are used by marginal businesses or are vacant. Therefore, stabilizing these
neighborhood streets west of Broadway is considered critical to protecting West Glen Park from the
further encroachment of serious disinvestment.
The second target area named Townhouse Square is a small part of the East Glen Park neighborhood.
This is one of the southernmost areas of East Glen Park and, as a result, benefits from its closeness to
newer shopping and entertainment facilities as well as its location near the Lew Wallace High School.

The neighborhood is defined by very low housing values, which affects all of Gary, Indiana, since the
population has dropped by nearly half over recent decades. In this particular area, there are vacant
houses, some not rented and others not sold. In the wider neighborhood there are so many abandoned
houses that most are unlikely to be rehabbed. While much of area is still in modest to good repair, the
presence of abandoned houses and the existence of 24 boarded rental townhouses has undermined
confidence in the immediate neighborhood. As is common in Gary, Massachusetts Street, which is the
nearest to Broadway, is the most troubled due the negative impacts of commercial activities.
Pennsylvania, Connecticut, and Delaware Streets are more stable, but have growing vacancy and
undermaintenance concerns.
The combination of demolition and redevelopment in these two target neighborhoods have the
potential to make an impact. Moreover, the type of housing provide a calculated stepping stone for
homeownership, which encourages stable households and an investment in the communities by the
residents.

Definition of “Blighted Structure” according to the State of Indiana Code, the
Interim Study Committee and Legislative Findings:
‐Any premises that, because of physical condition, use, or occupancy,
constitutes a public nuisance or attractive nuisance.
‐Any dwelling that, because it is dilapidated, unsanitary, unsafe, or vermin
infested or lacks the facilities or equipment required by housing codes, is
unfit for human habitation.
‐Any structure that is a fire hazard or is otherwise dangerous to the safety of
persons or property.
‐Any structure from which the utilities, plumbing, heating, sewerage, or
similar services or facilities have been disconnected, destroyed, removed, or
rendered ineffective so that the property is unfit for its intended use.
‐Any vacant or unimproved land in a predominantly built‐up neighborhood

Definition
Continued affordability will be ensured for the entire period of affordability
through monitoring, following the specific HOME monitoring requirements
as defined in 24 CFR Part 92.
The City of Gary Housing standards for Rehabilitation Program as funded
from HOME and
CDBG will apply to NSP funds:
• Code/Health & Safety Repairs‐ Our first priority is to eliminate and remove
any and all pre‐existing City of Gary code violations, Health and Safety
hazards and bring the property to code. All projects will correct any pre‐
existing code deficiencies and/or health and safety repair needs. This is
inclusive of construction deficiencies which were completed without city
permits. (room additions, garage conversions, patio additions etc.)
All units will be brought up to code and rehabilitation must obtain the
permits necessary through the city of Gary Building Department, or the
property must be demolished as part of the rehab project.
• Lead Based Paint Hazards ‐ As part of the Housing Rehabilitation under this
NSP a lead based paint text and a risk assessment are required on all
rehabilitation projects. This is done to identify the existence and scope of
any lead based paint hazards in the property. The “Lead‐Based Paint
Poisoning Prevention in Federally Owned and Federally Assisted Housing”
found at 24 CFR Part 35 will apply.
• Termite Repairs ‐ The program requires a termite Inspection Report be
prepared for every home by a licensed inspector. The report must identify
any termite or dry rot damaged wood members in the property, as well as
whether there are any active termite infestations in the property. The
program requires that any termite or dry rot damaged wood be replaced or
repaired due to health and safety risks posed to the structure of the
property. Fumigation or other treatments recommended must eliminate any
active termite infestations and are required under this program.
• General Property Improvements Upon ‐ The completion of the cost for
rehabilitation of all code deficiencies has been completed, health and safety
items, lead based paint hazard and termite repairs are totaled, then any
additional program funding may be used to address general property
improvements. General property improvements may include
a wide range of items such as painting, replacements of fixtures,
replacement of cabinets, flooring etc. The General property improvements
MAY NOT include items that are a type or quality which exceeds the
Page 3

standards for similar properties in the area or that exceed the basic standard
of “decent, safe and sanitary housing”. The acceptable
standards are found in 24 CFR 983.101

area median income.
Response:
Total low‐income set‐aside percentage (must be no less than 25 percent): 25.00%
Total funds set aside for low‐income individuals = $679,464.75

Meeting Low‐Income Target

A site has not yet been identified, although the city has explored several
possible sites in the target areas. The city will do one or two projects in the
target areas, and together, at least 12 units will be available for rental upon

completion of the redevelopment. This number far exceeds the minimum
impact requirement for the target of areas of 0‐1. Of the amount allotted for
this redevelopment activity, 31.2% will go towards meeting the 25% set‐aside
requirement (which will translate to at least 25% of the city's entire NSP3
allocation).
The redevelopment effort may include some demolition of vacant structures
that are currently located on the project site – incidental to the
redevelopment effort ‐‐ to decrease the project’s post‐rehab density and
make the post‐rehab project more attractive to the marketplace.
For the Townhouse Square target area, the intended rental market are those
households residing in the area, those households seeking a more suburban‐
like location, and those households employed by the nearby businesses on
Broadway. The townhouses will be developed and marketed as a logic partial
step between apartment rental and first‐time homeownership, since each
unit will have its own front and rear yards and its own meters for utilities. For
the University Place target area, the intended rental market is a pool of
households residing in the area, employees of the nearby businesses, and
those individuals employed at Indiana University. Redeveloping rental units
will protect the areas from the further encroachment of serious
disinvestment.
With the proposed work in the Townhouse Square area, there will be more
structures maintained at a higher standards, and a more positive
neighborhood identity to encourage more property owner investment and
more stable house sales prices. Upon completion of the rental units in the
University Place area, there will be more structures at a high standard, and
improved marketing of the neighborhood as part of a broader effort to re‐
position this area and all of West Glen Park as a neighborhood of choice.
To comply with the NSP3 statute concerning for vicinity hiring, the City of
Gary will make every effort to hire employees who reside in the NSP3 target
areas, and will require contractors to make every attempt to do the same. In
doing so, the City will coordinate these vicinity hiring provisions with its
Section 3 program requirements.
This project will occur in one or both of the NSP3 target areas.

Location Description

1. A rental project in the University Place target area would serve a small part
of the much larger West Glen Park neighborhood, which is one of the finest in
the city. It has many intact blocks with housing from the 1930’s to the 1960’s.
The community benefits from its location adjacent to the Northeast campus
of Indiana University, a large park, a golf course, convenient shopping, one of
the better high schools, and easy access to the Interstate highway system.
The neighborhood also suffers from the very soft market conditions that
negatively impact the entire city. There are many vacant houses in the overall

rehabbed. Other houses are vacant between rentals or are on the market for
sale. Some have become single‐family rental units, but most remain as
homeowner properties. There were never very many apartment structures in
the neighborhood and most of these are near the university campus.
In terms of maintenance, housing values, and abandonment, the streets
nearest to Broadway are the most troubled. Much of this results from the
negative impacts of commercial structures on Broadway, many of which are
used by marginal businesses or are vacant. Therefore, stabilizing these
neighborhood streets west of Broadway is considered critical to protecting
West Glen Park from the further encroachment of serious disinvestment.

2. Townhouse Square is a small part of the East Glen Park neighborhood. This
is one of the southernmost areas of East Glen Park and, as a result, benefits
from its closeness to newer shopping and entertainment facilities as well as
its location near the Lew Wallace High School.
The neighborhood is defined by very low housing values, which affects all of
Gary, Indiana, since the population has dropped by nearly half over recent
decades. In this particular area, there are vacant houses, some not rented
and others not sold. In the wider neighborhood there are so many abandoned
houses that most are unlikely to be rehabbed. A number of houses are single‐
family rental units, but many remain homeowner properties. There are
neighborhood churches as resources, but the congregations are smaller than
in the past, so there are excess facilities.
While much of area is still in modest to good repair, the presence of
abandoned houses and the existence of 24 boarded rental townhouses has
undermined confidence in the immediate neighborhood. As is common in
Gary, Massachusetts Street, which is the nearest to Broadway, is the most
troubled due the negative impacts of commercial activities. Pennsylvania,
Connecticut, and Delaware Streets are more stable, but have growing vacancy
and undermaintenance concerns.

Low Moderate Middle Income Area Benefit (LMMA)
Gary, IN has a vastly more significant number of housing units than residents.
In order to “right size” the area and address the actual needs of the market,
some demolition activities must take place. The City is estimating that at least
8 units will be demolished. With fewer blighted properties, the
neighborhoods have a greater chance for stability, making the remaining
homes and newly redeveloped properties more marketable. This demolition
activity will include the removal of the structures and appropriate treatment
to the land and the necessary costs for legal work, site surveys, and other
associated expenses so that the city can take possession of the vacant lots for
approved end uses.
The Gary Community Development Department will enter into a sub‐recipient
agreement with the City of Gary Redevelopment Commission, which will be
responsible for day to day implementation of the demolition components of
the NSP program.
The City of Gary will make every effort to hire from the target area. In doing
so, the City will coordinate with its section 3 program.
The NSP3 demolition effort will occur in the two NSP3 target areas detailed
above.

the neighborhood and most of these are near the university campus.
In terms of maintenance, housing values, and abandonment, the streets
nearest to Broadway are the most troubled. Much of this results from the
negative impacts of commercial structures on Broadway, many of which are
used by marginal businesses or are vacant. Therefore, stabilizing these
neighborhood streets west of Broadway is considered critical to protecting
West Glen Park from the further encroachment of serious disinvestment.
2. Townhouse Square is a small part of the East Glen Park neighborhood. This
is one of the southernmost areas of East Glen Park and, as a result, benefits
from its closeness to newer shopping and entertainment facilities as well as
its location near the Lew Wallace High School.
The neighborhood is defined by very low housing values, which affects all of
Gary, Indiana, since the population has dropped by nearly half over recent
decades. In this particular area, there are vacant houses, some not rented
and others not sold. In the wider neighborhood there are so many abandoned
houses that most are unlikely to be rehabbed. A number of houses are single‐
family rental units, but many remain homeowner properties. There are
neighborhood churches as resources, but the congregations are smaller than
in the past, so there are excess facilities.
While much of area is still in modest to good repair, the presence of
abandoned houses and the existence of 24 boarded rental townhouses has
undermined confidence in the immediate neighborhood. As is common in
Gary, Massachusetts Street, which is the nearest to Broadway, is the most
troubled due the negative impacts of commercial activities. Pennsylvania,
Connecticut, and Delaware Streets are more stable, but have growing vacancy
and undermaintenance concerns.

NSP3 Score
The neighborhoods identified by the NSP3 grantee as being the areas of greatest need must have an
individual or average combined index score for the grantee's identified target geography that is not less than
the lesser of 17 or the twentieth percentile most needy score in an individual state. For example, if a state's
twentieth percentile most needy census tract is 18, the requirement will be a minimum need of 17. If,
however, a state's twentieth percentile most needy census tract is 15, the requirement will be a minimum
need of 15. If more than one neighborhood is identified in the Action Plan, HUD will average the
Neighborhood Scores, weighting the scores by the estimated number of housing units in each identified
neighborhood.

Neighborhood Attributes (Estimates)
Vacancy Estimate
USPS data on addresses not receiving mail in the last 90 days or "NoStat" can be a useful measure of
whether or not a target area has a serious vacancy problem. For urban neighborhoods, HUD has found that
neighborhoods with a very high number vacant addresses relative to the total addresses in an area to be a
very good indicator of a current for potentially serious blight problem.
The USPS "NoStat" indicator can mean different things. In rural areas, it is an indicator of vacancy. However,
it can also be an address that has been issued but not ever used, it can indicate units under development,
and it can be a very distressed property (most of the still flood damaged properties in New Orleans are
NoStat). When using this variable, users need to understand the target area identified.
In addition, the housing unit counts HUD gets from the US Census indicated above are usually close to the
residential address counts from the USPS below. However, if the Census and USPS counts are substantially
different for your identified target area, users are advised to use the information below with caution. For
example if there are many NoStats in an area for units never built, the USPS residential address count may
be larger than the Census number; if the area is a rural area largely served by PO boxes it may have fewer
addresses than housing units.

Foreclosure Estimates
HUD has developed a model for predicting where foreclosures are likely. That model estimates serious
delinquency rates using data on the leading causes of foreclosures - subprime loans (HMDA Census Tract
data on high cost and highly leveraged loans), increasing unemployment (BLS data on unemployment rate
change), and fall in home values (FHFA data on house price change). The predicted serious delinquency rate
is then used to apportion the state total counts of foreclosure starts (from the Mortgage Bankers Association)
and REOs (from RealtyTrac) to individual block groups.
Total Housing Units to receive a mortgage between 2004 and 2007: 47
Percent of Housing Units with a high cost mortgage between 2004 and 2007: 73.68
Percent of Housing Units 90 or more days delinquent or in foreclosure: 12.58
Number of Foreclosure Starts in past year: 4
Number of Housing Units Real Estate Owned July 2009 to June 2010: 2
HUD is encouraging grantees to have small enough target areas for NSP 3 such that their dollars will have a
visible impact on the neighborhood. Nationwide there have been over 1.9 million foreclosure completions in
the past two years. NSP 1, 2, and 3 combined are estimated to only be able to address 100,000 to 120,000
foreclosures. To stabilize a neighborhood requires focused investment.

year): 1

Market Analysis:
HUD is providing the data above as a tool for both neighborhood targeting and to help inform the strategy
development. Some things to consider:
1. Persistent Unemployment. Is this an area with persistently high unemployment? Serious consideration
should be given to a rental strategy rather than a homeownership strategy.
2. Home Value Change and Vacancy. Is this an area where foreclosures are largely due to a combination of
falling home values, a recent spike in unemployment, and a relatively low vacancy rate? A down payment
assistance program may be an effective strategy.
3. Persistently High Vacancy. Are there a high number of substandard vacant addresses in the target area of
a community with persistently high unemployment? A demolition/land bank strategy with selected acquisition
rehab for rental or lease-purchase might be considered.
4. Historically low vacancy that is now rising. A targeted strategy of acquisition for homeownership and rental
to retain or regain neighborhood stability might be considered.
5. Historically high cost rental market. Does this market historically have very high rents with low vacancies?
A strategy of acquiring properties and developing them as long-term affordable rental might be considered.

INTRODUCTION
South Bend Weed & Seed Program

The strategies and programs identified in this plan build upon
four key underlying principles:

In 2002, a portion of the City of South Bend, Indiana, was
designated a Weed and Seed Community by the US
Department of Justice. This unique program provides
resources to assist communities in four areas:

 Collaboration to establish permanent channels of
communication among stakeholders and partnerships among
organizations with similar goals, to identify strategic and
innovative approaches to effective crime prevention and
neighborhood restoration, and to build broad support for the
Weed & Seed strategies.

1) Control of violent crime, drug trafficking, and drugrelated crime in targeted neighborhoods.
2) Provision of safe environments free of crime and drug use
for residents.
3) Cooperation of law enforcement agencies and prosecutors
in “weeding out” criminals from target areas.
4) “Seeding” to bring prevention, intervention, treatment and
neighborhood revitalization services to target areas in order
to meet social service and economic revitalization needs.
Four committees were established to deal with particular
aspects of the Weed & Seed Program, including Law
Enforcement; Community Policing; Prevention, Intervention,
and Treatment (social service needs); and Neighborhood
Restoration. This plan was prepared for the Neighborhood
Restoration Committee in order to identify needs of target
area neighborhoods and strategic programs to bring about
positive change.

NEIGHBORHOOD RESTORATION PLAN
South Bend, Indiana
Weed & Seed Program

 Coordination to effectively concentrate resources in
the designated neighborhoods, better match available services
with community needs, identify and eliminate overlaps and
duplication of efforts, and maximize benefits from existing
services and programs.

 Community Participation to empower residents to
solve their own problems and to function more effectively so
as to limit dependence on “outsiders” to meet neighborhood
needs.

 Leveraging Resources from a variety of sources to
fully fund plan strategies. Weed & Seed disseminates
funding as seed money to help access other funds.

INTRODUCTION
Community Participation
This document is the product of a ten-month, participatory
planning process that involved a wide cross-section of the
South Bend community. Key stakeholder participants
included the residents of the target neighborhoods, the Mayor
and City Council members from the neighborhoods, the
Police, Community and Economic Development, and Code
Enforcement departments, area social service providers, faithbased organizations, social clubs, business owners, rental
property owners, and members of the real estate and
development communities.
The following people were interviewed by the planning
consultant at focus group meetings:

Based upon the public planning process, this plan records the
collective ideas and aspirations of stakeholder participants. It
provides an assessment of existing conditions and stakeholder
lists of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats for the
area. It articulates a “Vision” for the future and goals that
serve as a basis for program recommendations. Finally, it lays
out an action plan of strategies and programs designed to
address key restoration needs of the neighborhood over the
next ten years. The action plan provides cost estimates and
clearly identified implementation responsibilities.

Westside The Westside Neighborhood is located
between Western Ave. and Sample St., north to south,
and between the Grand Trunk Western railroad
corridor and Lake St., east to west. The planning area
for Westside was extended west to Sheridan St. for
Weed & Seed initiatives.

St. Casimir’s The St. Casimir’s Neighborhood is

Target Area Description

located between the Grand Trunk Western railroad
corridor, north and west, Sample St., south, and
Arnold St., east. The entire neighborhood is
designated a historic district and the homes are small
and closely spaced. The West Side and St. Casimir’s
neighborhoods have always been home to South
Bend’s Polish/Eastern European population, but today
their populations are undergoing change. The
neighborhoods are growing as the home of South
Bend’s Hispanic population.

Comprised of Three Neighborhoods

LaSalle Park The LaSalle Park Neighborhood is
The Weed & Seed Target Area is comprised of three distinct
neighborhoods that abut one another to form a collective
planning area as illustrated above.
The boundaries and key characteristics of these neighborhoods
are described as follows.

Weed & Seed Program

located between Linden St. and Western Ave., north
to south, and between Meade St. and Sheridan St.,
east to west. This neighborhood is a long-standing
home of South Bend’s African American population.
Ties to this neighborhood remain strong even though
many of those who grew up there now live in other
areas of the city. Notably, the neighborhood has
several vacant and underutilized lots.

Page 11

NEIGHBORHOOD CONDITIONS
Demographic Characteristics
All three neighborhoods experienced shifts in population over
the past decade as census data, shown on following pages,
records.

 Westside Neighborhood
In the 1990’s, Westside’s population increased by nearly 25%
to a total of 5,528 residents. The racial composition of the
Westside changed as well. During the 1990’s, the Hispanic
population increased by 206%, while the African American
population rose by 46%. However, the White population
decreased 22% during the decade.
In 2000, the population of the Westside Neighborhood was
41% White, 29% African American, and 30% all other races
or combination of races. Hispanic people, who may be of any
race, accounted for 38% of the population.
In the same decade, the number of residents under age 20
increased by 49%, while the population of those over 65
declined by 22%. As the result, more children live in the
neighborhood, thereby increasing demand for safer sidewalks,
streets, and play areas.

In 2000, the Westside had 1,958 housing units, of which
1,788 were occupied. The total number of housing units
increased by 11% from 1990 - 2000. The neighborhood had
518 rental units in 2000 compared to 367 in 1990. In 2000,
rental units comprised 29% of the neighborhood’s occupied
housing, up from a figure of 22% in 1990.

 St. Casimir’s Neighborhood
From 1990 - 2000, St. Casimir’s population increased 24%
to a total of 1,434 residents. In the 1990’s, the White
population decreased 24%, while the Hispanic population
increased by 146%. The number of African American
residents doubled. By the year 2000, the population of the
St. Casimir’s Neighborhood was 45% White, 15% African
American, and 40% all other races or combination of races.
Hispanic residents, who may be of any race, comprised
nearly half the neighborhood’s population.
The age distribution of residents changed dramatically in
this neighborhood with a 67% increase in residents under 20,
and a 43% decline in residents over 65. Simply stated, longterm residents are aging and moving on, while younger
families with children are replacing them. This change is
significantly altering the cultural character of the
neighborhood.

NEIGHBORHOOD CONDITIONS
St. Casimir’s had 470 housing units, 414 of them occupied, in
2000. This total number of units dipped 2% over the preceding
ten years. Similarly to the Westside, housing in this
neighborhood is about 90% occupied. The number of rental
units increased from 131 in 1990 to 144 in 2000. Rental units
comprised 35% of the neighborhood's total occupied housing
stock.

LaSalle Park had 674 housing units in 2000; this is a 4%
decline over ten years. Again, nearly 90% of units are
occupied. The total number of rental units increased to 284
in 2000, when they comprised 48% of the neighborhood's
total occupied housing stock as compared to 42% in 1990.

 LaSalle Park Neighborhood
During the 1990’s, LaSalle Park’s population fell 8% to 1,486
residents. The African American population of the
neighborhood decreased 19%. Over this same period, the
number of White residents increased 20% and the Hispanic
population more than quadrupled, though both groups still
make up a relatively small share of the overall population.
In 2000, the population of the LaSalle Park Neighborhood was
79% African American, 10% White, and 11% all other races or
combination of races. Hispanic residents, who may be of any
race, made up 12% of the neighborhood’s population.
The number of residents under the age of 20 dropped by 6% in
the 1990’s but still accounted for a third of the population.
Because the drop in the youth population was at a rate slower
than the loss of population in general, youth accounted for a
slightly larger share of the population in 2000 than in 1990.
The population of residents over 65 decreased by 12%.

NEIGHBORHOOD CONDITIONS
Existing Land Use
Characteristics
These neighborhoods grew alongside Western Avenue, the
main road that, for years, led to Chicago. As industry
developed adjacent to downtown, and the city grew out from
its historic core, new neighborhoods emerged. Existing land
use within the target area, as illustrated on the following page,
reflects this pattern. The area is comprised of residential
clusters that abut a shallow lot, auto-oriented commercial
corridor anchored by a large parcel node. Key aspects of the
land use survey are described as follows:

Western Ave. has been the subject of recent initiatives aimed at
revitalizing the city’s commercial corridors. The Western Ave.
Commercial Corridor Revitalization Action Plan was developed
for the City, and an active Steering Committee is in place
guiding its funding and implementation. Since actions for
Western Ave. have been identified, residents felt that this plan
should focus more specifically on the residential portions of the
area. Still, it is important to understand the function of Western,
and to consider it and the neighborhood as a whole.

 Western Avenue Corridor Initiatives
Today, Western Ave. still leads to Chicago but new highways
provide primary access to South Bend. Still, Western Ave.
remains a main corridor within the city and further west into
the county.
Shallow lot, mixed-use commercial developments front
Western Ave. between Olive and Mayflower. Uses include
auto service, parts supply, convenience and discount retail, as
well as variety of other small business enterprises.
Entertainment uses include a bowling alley, bakery, small
restaurants and taverns. In the oldest areas, housing fronts
Western.

merchandise outlet, healthcare, and food service uses. This
node is generally occupied, though some buildings are vacant
and others underutilized. Nice buildings can be found, but the
area presents a tired appearance overall.

 Housing Stock
Housing within the neighborhoods was primarily built in two
periods. The oldest sections date back to the late nineteenth
century, and are located in the eastern portion of the Westside
Neighborhood, and in the St. Casimir’s Neighborhood. The
remaining sections of the neighborhoods were constructed
mainly in the postwar era.
Most of the housing within the neighborhood is primarily
wood frame and siding construction. Some houses are faced
with brick. Although housing sizes vary in the neighborhood,
the majority are single-family, 2-4 bedroom units. Many of
these homes, however, are considered too small by today’s
standards as they contain only two bedrooms, a single bath,
and limited on-street parking.
LaSalle Park Homes is the only public housing resource
located in the neighborhoods.
Representative examples of

The LaSalle Park
Neighborhood
contains attractive
lots for new housing

 Vacant Lots
Sites for new construction are limited in the Westside and St.
Casimir’s neighborhoods. LaSalle Park, however, contains
approximately 180 vacant lots. These lots could be used for
new housing construction in order to provide opportunities
for existing residents to upgrade into new homes and
opportunities for the neighborhood to attract new residents.
Soil conditions in the LaSalle Park Neighborhood, however,
limit construction activity. As the diagram indicates, a vein
of “muck” soils runs through the neighborhood. Muck soil
is a soil type composed of decaying materials. As such, it
has very limited bearing capacity which makes it unsuitable
for construction. Muck soils literally move out from
underneath structures causing foundations to fail.
Alternative construction techniques, such as pilings or
caissons, can be used to anchor foundations on bedrock.
Unfortunately, this technique usually proves cost prohibitive
for conventional housing construction.

SHERIDAN ST.

NEIGHBORHOOD CONDITIONS

Muck soil limits construction in some areas of the
LaSalle Park Neighborhood

Assuming, though, that 50% of these lots are buildable, and
that double lot widths would be encouraged for new
construction, this represents a significant opportunity to
rebuild and strengthen the area. As many as 45 new homes
could be built in the neighborhood.
Ownership and upkeep of vacant lots that are not buildable
must be addressed too. Many vacant lots are overgrown and
need to be cleared and maintained. Where lots are
unbuildable, they should be split and given to adjoining
owner-occupied housing residents, free of additional
property tax assessment, in exchange for upkeep.

 Neighborhood Commercial
Both the Westside and St. Casimir’s Neighborhoods contain
mixed-use buildings with ground level shops and housing
above, a holdover from earlier days when such development
was commonplace in America’s neighborhoods. These shops
house small grocery stores, restaurants, taverns, a clothing
store, small gym, and other uses.

In most cases, these neighborhood commercial, mixed use
buildings occur in clusters which form activity nodes.
Together with churches, schools, and parks, these nodes
are recognized by residents as the centers of their
respective neighborhoods, as illustrated on the workshop
map above.

 Sample Street
Sample St. is another important corridor in the target area.
It defines the southern boundaries of the Westside and St.
Casimir’s neighborhoods, and defines the transition from
neighborhood-scale development to large-parcel, light
industrial/manufacturing development.
Small-scale commercial and office development is located
along this portion of Sample. Together with the Oliver

become a significant employment center for residents.

NEIGHBORHOOD CONDITIONS
 Recreational Amenities
The neighborhoods contain open space and related park
facilities. However, as the following section describes, much
could be done to improve them. These facilities include
LaSalle Park and Beck’s Lake in the LaSalle Park
neighborhood, Pulaski Park adjacent to the Westside and St.
Casimir’s neighborhoods, and play areas at Harrison School.

Parks & schools provide open space and play facilities for
the neighborhoods, though improvements are needed.

NEIGHBORHOOD CONDITIONS
Infrastructure Assessment
The condition of infrastructure within the neighborhoods
was consistently identified as a primary issue for residents.
Infrastructure needs include improvements to streets,
sidewalks, alleys and railroad corridors, as well as to
park/open space resources.

 Street Conditions
Streets within the neighborhood are primarily constructed
of asphalt, though a few brick streets are located in the St.
Casmir’s neighborhood. Though the condition of
neighborhood streets could not be described as dilapidated,
many are distressed. Residents report problems with
stormwater runoff due to the fact that multiple resurfacing
projects have raised the elevation of the streets to the top of
adjacent curbing. In problem areas, streets need to be
“milled” to remove layers of old asphalt so that new
surfacing material can be added at proper elevations.

Street conditions are distressed throughout the neighborhood.
Existing programs to improve streets and sidewalks in these
neighborhoods should be expanded.

 Sidewalk Conditions

 Alley Conditions

Given the concentration of young children and elderly
residents in these neighborhoods, continuous networks of
safe, well maintained sidewalks are important. In many
areas, sidewalks are crumbled and impassable. Painted
crosswalks are welcome safety features which should be
more fully incorporated into the neighborhoods.

The condition of neighborhood alleys is poor. Alleys are
difficult items to maintain and, consequently, they are often
left to residents to care for. Given the overall density of these
neighborhoods, however, abandoning alleys is not an option
because they provide a fine-grain circulation system which
allows large numbers of automobiles to be moved

NEIGHBORHOOD RESTORATION PLAN
South Bend, Indiana
Weed & Seed Program

Page 22

NEIGHBORHOOD CONDITIONS
and stored in the neighborhood, via garages and parking pads.
Many alleys are overgrown with brush that is unsafe for
motorists and unsafe for homeowners because it provides
hiding places for troublemakers.

 Parking
Parking is in short supply in these neighborhoods and a
constant source of aggravation for residents. Many residents
rely on on-street parking for their household and guest
vehicles. Others have parking pads or garages that are
accessed from alleys. Too often, residents simply park their
cars in their front yards, or even on public sidewalks.
Additional parking areas should be developed in the
neighborhood to mitigate the shortage.

 Railroad Corridors
The Westside and St. Casimir’s neighborhoods are separated
by the Grand Trunk Western railroad corridor, an active
freight line that brings heavy rail traffic through the
neighborhoods many times a day. The visual appearance of
the corridor, however, has a blighting impact on these
neighborhoods. The corridor is filled with old segments of
track and railroad ties, overgrown brush is a breeding ground
for insects and rodents, and illegal dumping occurs frequently
along its edges. This corridor should be cleaned and
maintained in the most visible locations to mitigate negative
impacts on the neighborhoods.

Alley restoration programs are needed to stabilize drive surfaces,
remove brush, and enhance lighting. Additional parking areas
should be developed to alleviate parking problems.
Railroad corridors should be cleaned and maintained.

Pulaski and LaSalle Parks could serve as community
development anchors to secure private sector reinvestment
in the area. Descriptions of these parks follow.

Pulaski Park
Pulaski Park is located on the northeast edge of the
Westside neighborhood, just north of the St. Casimir’s
Neighborhood. The park totals 6.32 acres and is
triangular in shape, as defined by two intersecting railroad
corridors. Access to the park is limited to one entrance
from Huron St. located on its western edge, and visibility
into the park is limited due to its position behind singlefamily homes fronting Walnut St.
Existing amenities include a soccer field, basketball
courts, playground equipment and a bathroom/picnic
shelter, though the majority of these facilities are either in
disrepair or are obsolete. Parking is limited to
approximately 20 cars in a small, on-site parking lot.

the

Walnut St.

These neighborhoods are fortunate to have two existing
parks though much could be done to improve existing
facilities. Given increases in family size and the more
than 3,000 residents of the area under the age of 20, open
space resources are in greater demand than ever.

The edges of the Pulaski Park are defined by chain link fencing
with random openings scattered around its perimeter. Large
canopy trees are located along the edges of the park but
playground and court game areas are not shaded from summer
sun.
During the planning workshops, residents were asked to define
a series of improvements they would most prefer for this park.
Their answers are as follows: 1) Increased visibility into park
and new gateway features; 2) Expanded parking lot with more
than one entrance; 3) New playground equipment; 4) New
soccer field equipment and bleacher seating; 5) Additional
canopy trees to shade play areas; and 6) New lighting to
improve safety.

Neighborhood
Western Ave.

Kaley St.

LaSalle Park is not without a history that has left questions that
must be fully answered if residents are going to embrace and
use this park. Community residents question the safety of two
of the park’s components, “the hill,” a 25-foot-high grass
covered mound that was formed by construction debris
dumping years ago, and Beck Lake, a small pond rumored to
be contaminated. Work is underway by City officials and the
EPA to test these conditions in order to provide answers to the
community and remediation solutions if contaminants are
found. Most anticipate that tests will determine these
components safe for public use.

Lin

Falcon St.

LaSalle Park is the centerpiece of the LaSalle Park
Neighborhood. It is located between Linden Avenue and
Kaley, Washington, and Falcon Streets. The park totals 39.8
acres and includes unique features such as “The Hill,” Beck
Lake and vast open space areas.

lk S

LaSalle Park

Playground equipment would be a nice addition for the facility
and should be located on a side of the building so that it is
easily accessed by neighborhood children and easily
monitored by parents and staff. Many such playgrounds are
being developed in garden-like settings around public
facilities. Such an addition would beautify the overall look of
the Black Center. Parking is provided in a lot accessed from
Washington St. for about forty cars.
Residents feel that the park is underused and welcome their
Weed & Seed neighbors to enjoy it too. The northwest
quadrant of the park is a large open grass field. A series of
new playfields could be established in order to expand

Page 26

NEIGHBORHOOD CONDITIONS
activities such as soccer or softball league play that could take
place in the park. Residents are quick to add that new parking
should be developed along Falcon St. and/or on Linden Ave. to
accommodate additional park patrons. This would also serve
to alleviate traffic congestion on neighborhood streets around
Washington St. when special events take place in the park.
The perimeter of the park needs to be enhanced with lighting
and sidewalk improvements and views into the park should be
enhanced. Views from the east are blocked by a vacant,
deteriorating commercial structure and a few vacant houses.
These structures should be purchased and demolished so that
the edge of the park can be extended to Kaley St., the busy
north-south street that takes large numbers of people through
the neighborhood each day. Residents are also concerned
about the neighborhood’s image along Linden Ave., the busy
east-west street on the park’s north edge. Frequent dumping
occurs along this road, and brush is overgrown. Beautification
of the park’s edges and enhancement of vistas to Beck Lake
would elevate the image of the LaSalle Park Neighborhood.
Improvement of LaSalle Park could serve to recreate the image
of this neighborhood in order to attract new private sector
investment in new home construction.

““MONEY
MONEY IN THE BUCKET
BUCKET””
A resounding theme throughout the planning process was the neighborhood’s desire to
relay to city leadership how exactly they would like to see municipal funds invested in
their neighborhoods. In response to this, each stakeholder was given a set amount of
“South Bend Dollars” which they could spend on particular neighborhood needs. More
options than money were provided so that choices had to be made. Actions in this plan
respond directly the neighborhoods’ priorities.

ILLUSTRATIVE
CONCEPT SKETCH

Pulaski
Park

Develop market pavilion & plaza for sale of produce and goods. These facilities are ideal
for special events related to the Western Avenue Corridor and all three neighborhoods.
Existing buildings and uses could remain or be incorporated into the concept.
Community play space & garden areas could be established and maintained by
neighborhood residents, and the produce could be sold at the market. Alleys could be
widened and parking added to accommodate market and garden patrons. High quality
visual screening would be provided to buffer homeowners from activity.`

INTRODUCTION
Over the past two decades the City of Carmel more than
tripled in population (25,380 in 1990 to 79,191 in 2010)
and evolved from a small suburban town to a nationally
recognized example of a new urban edge city. This
transition, as with any transition, has not been made
without controversy and a few missteps. While the
Indianapolis Star and the Indianapolis Business Journal
have reported on the debate over the redevelopment
process and financing strategies, there has not been an
objective documentation of the broader issues through
which redevelopment was pursued and achieved.
In 2014, the City of Carmel engaged the IU Public Policy
Institute (PPI) to undertake a case study of the city’s
core redevelopment strategies since 1995. Specifically,
PPI was asked to provide the following:
1. An overview of objective measures regarding
the redevelopment of City Center and Old
Town, examining investments made by the
public, private, and nonprofit sectors and
identifying the outcomes these investments
leveraged.
2. A qualitative assessment and evaluation of
the process by which the redevelopment
of City Center and Old Town was pursued,
examining public data and performing key
informant interviews, including proponents
and opponents of the redevelopment efforts,
to elicit a summary of common themes and
perspectives regarding the redevelopment
process.
3. Estimates of the outcomes realized, including
what might have happened but for the city’s
redevelopment efforts, the economic impacts
or contributions of various outcomes, and
other related measures.
4. A brief summary of lessons learned that might
be useful to policymakers and/or applicable
to other communities considering their own
redevelopment efforts.
For the purposes of this analysis, the boundaries of the
area studied are as follows:
Northern boundary: East/West Smokey Row
Eastern boundaries: 4th Avenue NE, 4th Avenue
SE, and roughly one lot’s width east of Range
Line Road south of 4th Street SE

1

Study Boundaries in Carmel

Southern boundary: East/West Carmel Drive
Western boundaries: 4th Avenue SW
(extended from north of Main to Smokey Row
NW), one block west of 4th Avenue SW (south
of Main), property boundaries between those
areas with egress to 3rd Avenue SW (between
3rd Street SW and City Center) and Carmel
Garden (extended south to West Carmel Drive).
The study is limited to those areas in which PPI was
provided, or otherwise able to secure, data to support
its findings. Additionally, recognizing the contentious
nature of the debate regarding the redevelopment
process and its outcomes, PPI sought outside verification
and outside data sources as often as possible.
The report is organized as follows:
• The Project Timeline section provides an overview of key events (plans and projects) starting
with the construction of the Carmel Government Center in the early 1990s and ending in
December 2014.
• The Baseline Data section includes an overview
of the timeline by which the redevelopment
efforts were undertaken, baseline outcomes
that can be reported, and examines comparative

•

scenarios of what might have happened but for
the redevelopment efforts.
The Process Evaluation section of the report
examines questions regarding visioning and
leadership, the role of government in spurring
the market, and other questions related to the
process by which the redevelopment efforts
occurred.

•

•

The Economic Outcomes section examines the
economic impact and contributions of various
aspects of the redevelopment effort, including
the Center for the Performing Arts, construction
activity, and the provision of infrastructure.
The final section offers key insights and considerations for policymakers and other communities in Indiana considering similar efforts.

PROJECT TIMELINE
While the Carmel Government Center was completed
before Mayor Jim Brainard took office, soon after his
tenure began in 1996, Carmel purchased land north of the
newly opened government center. In 1997, the Carmel
Plan Commission completed a new comprehensive plan
that estimated that by 2020 all land in Carmel would be
developed and that the city’s population would grow
from approximately 60,000 residents to 85,000 (the
2014 Carmel population was estimated to be 86,682
according to STATS Indiana).

•

These events, coupled with a concern that downtown
Carmel was being overrun by a collection of retail
centers and office parks, led to the creation of the Old
Town and 126th Street Economic Development Areas
(EDAs) in May 1997. While the 126th Street EDA focused
on streetscaping and the extension of 126th Street, the
Old Town EDA focused on infrastructure intended to
stimulate revitalization of the Old Town area. Perhaps
most importantly in the preamble to the plans for
the EDAs, the project consultant, Wabash Scientific,
suggested that the rate of growth in Carmel means that
the city’s leadership must be visionary and all projects
must be rooted in consensus.

•

These early events created an environment from which
in the summer of 1997 public discussion of City Center
began. With that early discussion, in an era when
most Indiana suburbs were focused on market-driven
subdivisions, strip centers, and regional malls, Carmel
took initial steps toward a downtown redevelopment
and urban place-making initiative. Over the next
two decades, Carmel’s efforts have born significant
success, with significant construction investment in
the redevelopment area. Among the accolades the
community has earned are:

•
•
•

Money Magazine identified Carmel as the best
place to live in the United States in 2012 (in
2014 Carmel ranked 3rd);
24/7 Wall Street Journal identified Carmel as the
12th best city to live in (2014);
Movoto identified Carmel as best place to live
in Indiana (2014);
Livability identified Carmel as 4th best city
for families (2015), while Single in the City
proclaimed Carmel as the 11th best city for
singles (2015).
Grey House Publishing selected Carmel as one
of two Indiana cities in their statistical rating of
126 of America’s Top Rated Smaller Cities (Tenth
Edition, 2014-2015)

Perhaps the single most important step taken by Carmel
was the January 1998 adoption of the City Center
Redevelopment Area Plan. The plan suggested that City
Center was to emerge as a focal point and gathering
place for residents of and visitors to Carmel. Among
the tasks described in the plan were the acquisition of
73 acres of land within the EDA, $500,000 of demolition
expenses, $400,000 dedicated to utility relocation,
and $1.5 million for parking facilities. Tax Increment
financing (TIF) was mentioned as a potential source of
funding the public investment necessary to stimulate
private sector interest.
The next major event, in January 2000, was the
consolidation of five RDAs and EDAs into the City Center
Redevelopment area. The consolidation expanded TIF
capacity and added the Performing Arts Center to the
project list.
In February of 2000, the Redevelopment Commission
entered into a project agreement with AMLI Residential

2

Properites for what was the first CRC mixed use
development project in the Arts & Design District.

In spring 2007, Mayor Brainard won the primary election
with 59 percent of the vote.

Over the course of 2000, the Carmel Plan Commission
and City Council adopted new zoning designations for
redevelopment districts, namely the C-1 City Center
District and C-2 Old Town District, and rezoned key
parcels to C-1 and C-2 that were designated by the CRC
for redevelopment.

In October 2008, the CRC established 3-year pooled
loan program of $15 million per year to assist overall
redevelopment effort.

In June of 2001 construction began on Carmel Bike Shop,
the first commercial building construction in City Center.
In May 2003, the consolidated City Center Redevelopment plan was re-amended, approximately $3.7 million
of new projects were added. Perhaps most importantly
the basic premise, that a vibrant and healthy downtown
Carmel was important to all of Carmel, was confirmed
by the Carmel Redevelopment Commission.
The consolidated City Center Redevelopment Plan was
next amended in February 2004, the area was expanded,
the use of TIF was confirmed, and the Performing Arts
Center budget increased by $15 million.
In fall 2004, Pedcor was awarded the bid for City Center
and in April 2005, the Carmel Downtown Redevelopment Plan was approved. A new TIF district was created
to support parking structures estimated to cost between
$35 and $55 million.
Pedcor broke ground on City Center in 2006, and in
spring 2007 construction of the Performing Arts Center,
now known as the Palladium, began.

3

In November of 2010, the CRC established the Arts
District Lofts and Shoppes Tax Allocation area, pledging
TIF revenue to Keystone Group for infrastructure
associated with the project.
In the post-recession economy of 2011, in response to
rising concerns about project financing, the consolidated
City Center Redevelopment Plan was amended to limit
TIF’s use and reflect a developer agreement to make
PILOT payments if TIF revenue was insufficient.
In spring 2011, Mayor Brainard won the primary election
with 62 percent of the vote.
In 2012, CRC approved Project Agreement for the
construction of Nash and Kent Buildings.
In 2014 six new City Center buildings were announced
with an estimated cost between $80 and $100 million.
Finally, in spring 2015, Mayor Brainard won the primary
election with 63 percent of the vote.

BASELINE DATA
STATISTICS
Jobs and Population
Using the On the Map tool available from the U.S. Census,
PPI was able to construct an estimate of the number of
jobs located and the number of employed individuals
living in the district in 2004 and 2011 (the most recent
year for which data are available through that tool), with
the latter being distinct from measuring population as
a whole. Jobs growth in the project area (13.2 percent)
was exceeded by job growth in Carmel and Hamilton
County (34.7 and 23.9 percent, respectively) (Figure 1).
The growth in the number of employed individuals living
in the project area, however, far outpaced Carmel and
Hamilton County (43.8 percent compared to 8.7 and 16.2
percent, respectively) (Figure 2). The relative growth
of the population measure (employed individuals)
compared with the growth in number of jobs is reflective
of the replacement of relatively low-intensity strip level
development with concentrated, mixed-use, relatively
dense and intense development.
In addition to creating a more dense, more concentrated
residential and commercial center, the On the Map data
suggests a larger share of the jobs within the district
are higher earning than jobs in Carmel or Hamilton
County as a whole. In 2011, 46.6 percent of the jobs
located in the project area were those categorized as

“higher earning,” meaning individuals earned more
than $40,000 year (threshold established by the On the
Map tool); those figures were 43.6 and 34.3 percent for
Carmel and Hamilton County, respectively (the jobs
within the project area were not subtracted from the
city and county numbers). The percent of higher earning
individuals living in the project area (49.3 percent) were
not as high as the percent of higher earning individuals
living in Carmel or the county (59.4 percent and 55.7
percent, respectively). However, the share of higher
earning individuals living in the district increased at a
faster rate between 2004 and 2011 (12.8 percent relative
change) than the city or county (10 and 7.3 percent,
respectively).
Physical Development
Using aerial photography available from Hamilton
County government, PPI was able to construct estimates
of the acreage of undeveloped property in 1994, 2004,
and 2014. PPI estimates that more than 23 percent of
the land within the boundary area remained in large,
undeveloped lots in 1994. By 2004, less than 10 percent
remained undeveloped; by 2014, slightly more than 2
percent of the land remained undeveloped (Figure 3).
Between 2004 and July 2014, 565 building permits were
issued by the City of Carmel within the project area and
904 additional building permits issued within a half mile
from the boundary of the project area; in comparison,
during the same period there were a total of 10,571
building permits issued throughout Clay Township. In
assessing the concentration and value of construction
activities across the three areas, the project area had
greater concentration of activity, greater construction
costs per permit, and higher value construction activity
per acre (Figure 4). Further, while the township as a
whole has experienced a decrease in building permits
relative to 2004 – having not had a single year in which
as many permits were issued as 2004 – the project area
and the area within a half mile of the project area have
exceeded the number of building permits in 2004 every
year but one through 2014 (Figure 5).

Fiscal Impact
The building activity experienced within the project area
drove growth in gross assessed value that outpaced the
rest of Carmel and Hamilton County (Figure 6).
An argument could be made that it is an unfair comparison to examine a concentrated downtown to entire
municipalities. In examining how Carmel’s downtown
faired relative to the larger cities and towns within
Hamilton County, PPI finds that the project area
outperformed those areas as well. Examining gross
taxable assessed value growth from 2004 to 2013 in a
one-mile radius from the center of Hamilton County’s
cities as well as Fishers, PPI found that increased value
within the project area greatly outpaced downtown
developments in other communities (Figure 7).1 In the
interest of normalizing a comparison, a one-mile radius
within Carmel is also included (which includes areas
within and outside of the project area) to make a fair
comparison between Carmel’s growth and these other
communities.2 Given the increased value within the
project area, with the Carmel radius being slightly more
than half that of the project area, we can assume that
much of Carmel’s dominance of its Hamilton County
counterparts is due to investment within the project
area.

7

Examining the fiscal impact of dense, mixed-use
developments, existing research suggests the costs
realized by the municipality to service the project area
is less than serving the same number of households and
businesses than more typical suburban development
patterns. Specifically, a series of models have examined
the fiscal impact to municipalities, modeling dense
development relative to more traditional suburban
patterns, when normalized (Robert Charles Lesser &
Co., LLC & Smart Growth America, 2015). Municipal
revenue (based on assessed value per acre within
property tax classes) is often higher in walkable urban
areas when compared to lower density development
(Figure 8). Additionally, the density of development has
been found to have beneficial impacts on reducing percapital municipal costs as well. Specifically, models have
examined the following areas:
Roads: Maintenance costs and the quantity of
roads (lane miles) are reduced as development is
more intense.
Water/Wastewater: Length of water and
wastewater pipes, and the costs of maintaining
those pipes are reduced as density intensifies.

of individuals (residences or businesses) served
within a response shed; costs remain roughly the
same over any given area (variable to a degree if
traffic congestion reduces response times); costs
are reduced by the number of individuals served
within a dense development, due to having more
individuals within those areas.
School Transportation: In many communities,
schools establish a “walk zone” where students
within that zone are expected to walk to school.
As more students live in that zone, a greater
proportion of the student population walks to
school, therefore reducing school transportation
costs.3
Solid Waste Collection: Lower-density development requires that trucks travel farther between
pickups, reducing efficiency and increasing fuel
costs.
In summary, the type of mixed-use development within
the City Center and the Arts & Design districts, relatively
dense housing, apartments/condos and townhomes, with
office and retail, is a fiscally-responsible development
style. Dense development requires fewer resources to
build and maintain infrastructure, and reduces the cost of
public safety.

DISCUSSION OF ALTERNATIVES
Almost certainly Carmel would have experienced
redevelopment within the City Center area. However,
without public intervention it is likely the development
character would have been more traditional suburban
in nature, and likely not as geographically concentrated
or happen as quickly. And without the increased density
there certainly wouldn’t have been the fiscal benefits
(without looking at costs) in terms of concentration of
property taxes, population, income, and employment.
In fact, researchers were unable to find any evidence
of dense new urban development occurring within the
suburban counties of the MSA without significant public
participation.

1 Fishers was a town during the majority of the study period.
2 One mile radii were measured from City Center and Range Line in Carmel,
116th and the Nickel Plate in Fishers, the Courthouse in Noblesville, and
the corner of IN-32 and Union Street in Westfield.

It is not clear that this applies in Carmel, however, as noted elsewhere an
analysis conducted by the city suggests that new developments within
the project area have fewer children per household than other areas
throughout Carmel, due to the household composition of the current
occupants. In the event that that should change, and the development
serve a number of children, even if the “walk-zone” concept did not apply
to this development.

PROCESS EVALUATION
Over the course of the summer and fall 2014, PPI
staff interviewed many of the key participants,
proponents, critics, and a few neutral observers to
gain an understanding of different perspectives related
to Carmel’s core redevelopment outcomes, process,
and financing strategies. While anyone who reads the
Indianapolis Star or IBJ surely recognizes that there has
been disagreement over the development process and
concern, on the part of some, regarding the financing
issue, the interviews revealed a general sense of agreement that a placemaking project, centered around the
arts and walkable, sustainable living was important,
ahead of its time, successful and transformational.
Those who support both the project and the
process argue that without intervention the type of
development the market has historically supported—
single story commercial and single family residential—
would have been much less dense and not at all unique
or transformational. In effect, they argue, without
intervention there would have been a continuation
of the single family residential and auto-based retail
that dominates much of suburban Indianapolis. Those
who agree with the general notion of the project
while criticizing the process ignore or discount the
commitment to placemaking, walkability, and density
while suggesting that absent any public involvement
the private market would have eventually revitalized
the area.
Carmel’s core redevelopment was a project that all
agreed was important and successful, yet there was
professional disagreement and personal animosity
occurring in the later stages of the project. The process
evaluation is intended to provide civic leaders in other
communities who are considering placemaking on a
large scale with a list of public policy issues to be carefully
considered as they attempt to create new walkable
and sustainable places in their automobile dependent
suburbs.
As one considers the following analysis of the public
policy ramifications of the Carmel development, it is
important to keep in mind the notion that there is no
absolute right or wrong when it comes to public policy.
What any individual finds to be right or wrong is a result of
their values and their interpretation of events/decisions.
Another element that affects interpretation of public
policy decisions is the time frame of the evaluator. If

one is focused on outcomes or rate of return in the short
term, any interpretation of a key decision may be much
different than if one is focused on outcomes or rate of
return by 2025. It is also important to keep in mind that
while the analysis treats the issues compartmentally
and presented in what the authors believe is the most
logical manner (for the sake of report organization), the
issues are inter-related.
Finally, the Carmel project, like virtually any other major
development, has been a long process with hundreds of
incremental decisions being made that eventually add
up to the development that is in place today. Thus, some
decisions, which likely seemed relatively minor at the
time, have become key points of contention.

PROCESS FINDING #1
The interviews revealed an outcome that was locally and
nationally recognized as highly successful in cementing
Carmel’s image as one of the nation’s best suburbs.
• The placemaking effort, based on arts and
walkable sustainable living, was important
and well ahead of its time. Carmel was the
first suburban community in central Indiana to
embrace placemaking and now most others
are trying to find their own unique version of
City Center and the Arts & Design District.
• The market, while favoring Carmel, would not
have delivered dense and vertical development
with integrated mutli-family housing, retail and
restaurant development. Instead, the market
would have continued to isolate single family
housing from retail, restaurants, and office
development.
• The walkable, sustainable, integrated multifamily approach to City Center and the Arts
& Design District provides a critical option for
empty nesters wishing to downsize yet remain
in Carmel, as well as a more affordable option
for younger workers, many of whom grew up in
Carmel, but previously could not afford to live
there.
• City Center, the Arts & Design District, and the
Monon Trail created iconic gathering places for
locals and an image that introduced Carmel to
the nation.

10

•

Regardless of any other issues that accompany
the process, the fact that Mayor Brainard
was able to anticipate the movement toward
placemaking, walkability, and sustainable cities and was able to lead Carmel to become a
nationally exemplary suburb is a testament to
his vision and leadership.

•

PROCESS FINDING #2
PPI analysts, based on interviews and external data
collection, believe that City Center and the Arts & Design
District redevelopments achieved subjective analytical
success including:
• Carmel anticipated a trend, placemaking, well
before most communities and thus became an
Indiana and national leader in quality of life and
livability rankings.
• Carmel’s placemaking efforts are now being
imitated by many other central Indiana
communities as well as other Midwestern
suburbs.
• In an era of increasingly timid, risk and cost
averse leadership focused on small government and low taxes rather than aspiration,
Carmel shows that aspirational forwardthinking leadership can not just survive but
thrive.
• The City Center and the Arts & Design District
projects’ short-term benefits may revolve
primarily around placemaking, quality of life,
and publicly supported private investment, but
in the longer term it will be about a sustainable
economy, with lower service delivery costs and
a high assessed value to citizen tax base.

PROCESS FINDING #3
The first question asked of each interviewee addressed
the overriding issue of the role local government should
play in economic development. All agreed that local
government had a role.
• The general consensus of those interviewed
was that local government can and should
provide aspirational leadership by identifying
thriving opportunities, developing plans
that fit with the community’s goals, and
supporting the implementation of projects
that fit within the goals and plan. In the case
of Carmel, it was generally agreed that a key
role for local government was to maintain

11

•

the city’s high quality of life and regional and
even national image of suburban splendor. It
was also generally agreed that providing the
infrastructure necessary to support economic
growth is a critical and minimum element in
local government’s economic development
effort.
Disagreement arose over what constitutes
appropriate support in Carmel as it does in
most communities. Specifically, there was
philosophical disagreement over how and
when it is appropriate for the government to
intervene in the market and heated discussion
over the amount of subsidy to be provided.
Some of those interviewed argued that the
role of government is to support the market
through basic infrastructure investment while
others suggested that to maintain a high
quality of life government should anticipate
and guide the market to achieve publicly
beneficial outcomes. In effect, some favored
letting the market dictate to Carmel while
others wanted Carmel to lead the market to
identified outcomes, specifically placemaking.
The discussion of the appropriate level of public
investment was directly related to the amount
of public money invested in Carmel and the
financial condition of the city. Some argued
that too much post-infrastructure subsidy had
occurred and that the city finances were at
risk. Others felt that the city was financially
sound and that the level of investment was
appropriate. In general, the financial argument
revolved around issues of quality versus cost.
Those who wanted less public investment argue
that the quality was excessive, while those in
favor of additional investment argue that high
quality is a key element in Carmel’s evolving
national brand and that settling for average
would not have enabled a transformation of
the city’s national image.

PROCESS FINDING #4
Any mayor or elected official who is aspiring to lead their
city forward should be aware of the tension between
the time-consuming, consensus-building process and
the need for timely decisions during the construction
process. The tension between consensus building and
project construction is not the only tension aspirational
leaders must be prepared to encounter. There will also
likely be conflict between those who are risk averse

and support the status quo and those who are agents
of change. Both groups want what is best for the
community; the disagreement is over risk and reward.
• In the Carmel case study, most of those
interviewed felt the early planning efforts
led by the mayor, the plan commission,
and the redevelopment commission were
well planned and implemented. There was
little disagreement over the quality of the
public discourse that led to the placemaking
intervention. In fact, even ardent opponents of
the mayor were in general agreement with the
overall strategy.
• The moment when the tension between the
inclusivity required to build ownership and
support conflicted with the immediacy to implement and construct was over a change order
for the Palladium. That small event, a change
order that required a decision regarding the use
of marble or carpeting, emerged as a symbol of
the disagreement and discord over the project
as a whole.
• From that moment forward there were two
levels of contention, one over policy and the
other deeply personal. Arising from the loss
of trust and confidence that resulted from
the change order was a public debate over
a wide range of cost versus quality issues,
financing strategies, and length of sustained
pubic investment that devolved into growing
resentment and personal friction between
opposing political leaders.
• Emerging from that contentious debate
was a concern by neutral parties that the infighting, over things that virtually every other
community in Indiana wishes they had, could
eventually start to reflect negatively on the
community.
• In the case of Carmel, that disagreement led
to a heated primary campaign, which Mayor
Brainard easily won. Post-primary, the heated
debate has substantially abated.
Among the key takeaways for other mayors considering
aspirational and transformative projects are:
• It is important to be mindful of the tension
between the minutia and immediacy of the
construction event and the broader, more
time-consuming consensus building effort. And
remember that consensus building continues
well after construction is underway.
• Ongoing communication, trust, mutual respect, shared credit, and ownership are essen-

•

•

•

tial elements to a civil and harmonious public
process.
Aspirational leadership is hard, the risks
are great, but rewards can be even greater.
Aspirational leaders are always vulnerable
to claims that things are good enough, that
too much attention is focused on a specific
place, that the project costs too much, and
disagreement over individual tastes and
preferences.
The rewards associated with being creative and
innovative can transform communities and, in
Carmel’s case, lead to a rapid rise in national
rankings.
It is difficult to determine when to begin to
reduce public involvement, while the risks
associated with too early withdrawal are
enormous. For example, a failed business and
projects that don’t occur can affect not only the
local economy and image but, when TIF is used,
may affect the ability to retire project-related
debt.

At the start of an aspirational project, no one can
confidently know the amount of time, effort, and money
required. Perhaps most importantly, it is almost certain
that the final result will not match the original plan –
aspiration and innovation can’t be comprehensively
planned, rather they are rationally and incrementally
developed. Project leaders have to constantly respond
to changing markets, new opportunities, and risks. The
process isn’t going to be smooth, there will be topics
of debate and instances of disagreement. The artful
mayor will try to determine when to compromise and
when the project requires steadfast and even obstinate
dedication. No mayor will get that right every time. It is
critical to realize that once ground is broken if the choice
is between being amenable/liked and the project, one
has to be true to the project.
In the final analysis, there was decidedly less disagreement over the project results than there was over
the process. While it is impossible to fully understand
exactly when and where relationships began to fray, it is
clear that better communication, shared risk and credit,
and collective ownership would have resulted in better
intra-government and inter-personal relationships. If
this occurred, the process may have been viewed as
favorably as the outcome of the project.

ECONOMIC CONTRIBUTIONS
The analysis of the economic contributions of
construction and operations within and around City
Center makes no attempt to determine the net new
investment within the study area. Rather, it is focused
on the gross amount of economic activity attributable
to specific projects, catalyzed by public investment, that
occurred within the district and on new residential that
has since occurred in territory immediately adjacent to
the City Center and the Arts & Design District.
Within the district, Carmel invested $17.35 million in
infrastructure and a total of $156.7 million of public
investment in facilities occurred. According to IMPLAN
input/output modeling, the investment of that $174
million leveraged an additional $110.2 million of
economic activity within Hamilton County. This means
that each dollar of investment resulted in an additional

63 cents of economic activity. A total of 3,336 (FTE) jobs
and nearly $140 million in employee compensation are
associated with the total investment within the district.
Approximately $32.3 million of new single family
construction and $117.8 million of multi-family housing
construction has occurred in the neighborhoods
surrounding City Center and the Arts & Design District
(Figure 9). While it is impossible to determine exactly
how much of the new investment only occurred because
of City Center and the Arts & Design District, using
IMPLAN we know that the approximately $150 million
of residential investment resulted in an additional
$96 million of indirect and induced economic activity.
There were 1,531 total (FTE) jobs and $106 million of
employee compensation associated with the residential
construction.

Finally, the annual contribution of The Center for the
Performing Arts, based on an operating budget of
$10.5 million, is nearly $18 million. There are 418 direct,
indirect and induced jobs (FTE) and $6.8 million of
employee compensation associated with The Center for
the Performing Arts operations. Visitors at The Center
for the Performing Arts are estimated to generate

over $635,000 of food and beverage related spending
annually. Based on total operating budgets of $5.1
million other arts organizations within the City Center
and the Arts & Design District generate a total economic
contribution of over $8.7 million and 205 jobs (FTE) with
and additional $3.3 million of employee compensation.

CONCLUSION
The City Center and the Arts & Design District projects are a testament to both the benefits
and the risks associated with projects intended to transform a community. Carmel invested
public resources based on the idea that placemaking and creating dense walkable places
are critical elements that help suburban cities remain competitive for jobs and residents
in conjunction with the changing demands of empty nester baby boomers and emerging
demands of the millennial generation. How civic leaders anticipated these events is unclear,
but by being ahead of the curve Carmel established its reputation as not just one of the finest
suburbs in Indiana but one of the best in the nation. It is now seeing its noble experiment,
duplicated by most every suburb within Central Indiana and the nation.
That said, the transformation from a statewide leader to a national leader didn’t come
without some very public and controversial debate that tested the commitment of the
mayor and the council. Those considering visionary and transformational efforts in other
communities should be aware of the community and personal risks and rewards inherent is
these undertakings. The democratic process means that every four years the community will
collectively weigh in on their perceptions of the project outcomes/progress. Commitment in
the face of challenge is essential to a project’s success as is developing a process that strives
to be inclusive in design, sensitive to community input, and sharing of credit (and risk and
blame).
There will not be unanimity of agreement over every decision. There are inherent risks and
challenges but the rewards can be substantial. While the project is yet to be completed and
final outcomes determined, the early returns indicate that Carmel has successfully built a
national reputation for itself and is positioned to gracefully transition along with the changing
tastes of millennials and boomers.

KEY EVENTS IN CENTRAL CORE REDEVELOPMENT
1990s
The 11-acre Carmel government center is completed.

1994
Old Town Carmel design charrette (BSU College of Architecture and Planning).

1995
Mayoral GOP Primary Election: Jim Brainard defeats Ted Johnson (incumbent).

1996
City Council adopts resolution to acquire Monon Trail right-of-way from 96th
street to 146th street.

1997
The Carmel Plan Commission approves a new comprehensive plan.
Projects were expected to be completed by 2020, which were estimated to increase
the Carmel population to 85,000. The Plan suggested that Carmel would emerge as
a regional employment center and recommended that U.S. 31 be converted into a
limited access freeway.

May 1

The Old Town and 126th Street Economic Development Areas (EDAs) are created.
Wabash Scientific assisted with EDA creation as lead consultant, while the Carmel
Redevelopment Commission (CRC) served as EDA plan administrator. EDA text
declared in its introduction that “the rate of growth in Carmel means that the city’s
leadership must be visionary.” The document also suggested that all “projects must be
rooted in consensus.” The EDA projects were funded using a municipal bond supported
by county option income tax revenue (COIT).
• 126th Street EDA: Created to support the extension of the 126th Street
Corridor into the science and technology park. The $3 million project plan
included streetscape throughout the 126th Street Corridor.
• Old Town EDA: Created to support infrastructure improvements and
stimulate revitalization, with an estimated infrastructure cost of $3.9 million.
оо Among the infrastructure items to be addressed were: road
resurfacing, drainage improvements, sidewalks (both new and
rehabbed), new curbs and gutters, and brick enhancements.
• Pennsylvania Street North & Pennsylvania Street South EDAs: Created
to support the widening of Pennsylvania Street. Wabash Scientific led
preparation of the economic development area plans. The plan intended to
support the widening and improvement of Pennsylvania Street from 103rd to
131st streets. Project cost estimated at $4.4 million.

Summer

General public discussions about early City Center Redevelopment Area
project ideas begin.

16

1998
Jan. 9

City Center Redevelopment Area Plan is adopted by CRC.
The City Center was intended to emerge as a focal point and gathering place for
residents and visitors of Carmel. It later became the center of government and
entertainment. Wabash Scientific developed the EDA Plan, while CSO prepared the
Architectural Plan.
The land acquisition list contained in the City Center Redevelopment Area Plan included 73 of the 88 acres designated to the redevelopment area. The two largest
land owners were Helen Mueller with 60 acres and CSX Transport with 9 acres. The
project’s total cost was estimated at $10.5 million (land acquisition $8.1 million,
demolition $500,000, utility relocation $400,000, and parking facilities $1.5 million).
The redevelopment plan mentioned the potential use of Tax Increment Financing (TIF)
to fund public investment in the redevelopment area.
The work in the City Center redevelopment area was proposed to link and synchronize
with the improvements made to the Old Town and 126th Street economic development
areas. The 126th Street EDA plan set out to establish a TIF district that would support
the City Center plan. The amendment changed the boundaries of the original 126th
Street Corridor. The boundary changes transferred some land to the Old Town RDA
and added some land within the Carmel Science and Technology Park.

July 9

Construction on 126th Street and City Center Drive begins.

1999
Carmel Redevelopment Commission authorizes purchase of Mueller property at
126th Street and Range Line Road for Carmel City Center project.

2000
Jan. 31

Amendments are made to the City Center Redevelopment Area.
Key adjustments to the City Center Redevelopment Area consisted of consolidating
the five RDA and EDA areas into a single plan and district, designating additional
territory, and providing an updated project list. The combination of the five RDA and
EDA districts and addition of new territory would consolidate planning efforts and
increase TIF capacity.

May 1

The consolidated City Center Redevelopment Plan amendment is confirmed and
re-amended.
At the time of their creation, the five areas were meant to be distinct and separate,
however their successful development resulted in them becoming largely contiguous.
The new amendment re-affirmed the original findings and importance of a vibrant and
healthy downtown to all of Carmel and suggested that the city center would be much
larger than originally planned.
New actions in the amendment included the following:
• Transferring parts of Old Town EDA into City Center RDA, including an
expansion of the allocation area, to capture new development around Main
Street and 1st Avenue SW;
• The consolidation of the Pennsylvania Street North and South EDAs and the
126th Street EDA and establishing the combined territory as an allocation
area.

2004
Feb. 10

Amendment is made to the Integrated Economic Development Area Plan and
Amended Redevelopment Area Plan.
Due to the substantial progress in achieving the original goals outlined in both plans,
amendments were added to capitalize on this success and to meet the evolving needs
and opportunities for the project. Primary work on amendments was provided by
Wabash Scientific.
The amendment declared that the “City Center Redevelopment Area directly benefits
all of the city’s Economic Development Areas,” therefore, the CRC could occasionally
consider using TIF and other revenue from the EDAs for projects in City Center.
Key changes include:
• Expanded boundaries of the Integrated 126th Street EDA, inclusion of the
Pennsylvania Street South EDA into the TIF allocation area;
• Adding Range Line Road parcels to City Center Redevelopment Area and
designating part of the Old Town Economic Development area as part of the
tax allocation area;
• Adding the C-210 Annexation Area in the North Illinois Street EDA (but not in
TIF allocation area);
• Adding the west side of U.S. 31 to the Illinois Street EDA.
Other territorial changes included:
• Inclusion of new and potential development along Hazel Dell Road to Hazel
Dell Parkway EDA;
• Including the 96th Street corridor into the Hazel Dell Parkway EDA (and as
part of allocation area);
• Expansion of the Old Meridian economic development area and designation
of EDA as an allocation area.

April 25

Carmel Downtown Economic Development Plan is approved.
Wabash Scientific prepared the Carmel Downtown Economic Development Plan with
the primary purpose of creating TIF allocation area. This would support Pedcor and
plans for the proposed Performing Arts Center. The new downtown areas would be
added to the Integrated Economic and Redevelopment Areas. However, there would
be no additional TIF revenues added to areas that were already supported by TIF.

19

Primary use of TIF would be parking facilities that were estimated to cost between $35
million and $55 million.

Old Town Shoppes Phase 1 begins construction on SE corner of Range Line Road
and Main Street.

2006
Aug. 23

Groundbreaking and construction for City Center development by Pedcor begins.

Oct. 31

Nov. 17

Amendment is made to remove Parcel 12 from the City Center Redevelopment
Area.
The amendment would remove Parcel 12 from the City Center Redevelopment Area
and create a stand-alone Parcel 12 Economic Development Area. This would allow
the CRC to capture TIF revenue from project developed on Parcel 12. The amendment
report was drafted by Wabash Scientific and the land was part of Pedcor’s project.

Wabash Scientific presents a supplement draft for the 116th Street Center and
Integrated Plan.
The supplement to 116th Project Area presented a project agreement to use TIF solely
for the apartments, which were substituted for townhomes due to economic changes.
The stated goal of the supplement was to provide project transparency and protection
for taxpayers.

20

The apartment developer committed to limiting TIF revenue use to $186,000 per year.
Developer also committed to a minimum apartment complex assessed value of $17.4
million. The developer agreed to make PILOT payment if there was not enough TIF
revenue.

March 27 Monon & Main townhomes are sold out.
