LOCAL HOMESTEAD CREDIT REVIEW COMMISSION
The Local Homestead Credit Review Commission, created by the City-County Council,
met on Monday, June 3, 2013 at the Library Services Center, 2450 N. Meridian Street.
Co-Chair Beth Henkel (Local Attorney, former Department of Local Government and
Finance Commissioner) called the meeting to order at 6:03 p.m. with the following
members present: Co-Chair James Steele (former City Controller and former Chief
Financial Officer for the City-County Council), City-County Councillor Vop Osili, Chris
Pryor (Metropolitan Indianapolis Board of Realtors-MIBOR), City- County Councillor
Jack Sandlin, Dan Sellers (Chief Financial Officer for the Health and Hospital
Corporation), and Jeff Spalding (former City Controller, serving as Controller‚Äôs
Designee). City-County Councillor Pamela Hickman (proxy for Councillor Frank
Mascari) and Joseph O‚ÄôConnor (Marion County Assessor/County Commissioner)
arrived shortly thereafter. City-County Councillor Robert Lutz was absent. General
Counsel Fred Biesecker, Chief Financial Officer Hope Tribble, and Fiscal and Policy
Analyst Ryan Kramer represented Council staff.
Co-Chair Henkel asked commission members to introduce themselves and indicate the
entity they represent on the commission.
Co-Chair Henkel explained how the commission was formed and the process they will
be undertaking. She explained the objectives of the commission and explained the
timeline to finalize recommendations to the City-County Council by June 27, 2013. The
recommendations will be presented in the form of a proposal for the Council to then
consider during their normal committee process, with a decision before the budget
proposal is submitted in mid-August. Co-Chair Henkel stated that there is a two-page
handout that attendees received upon entering the meeting which details the objectives
of the commission, lists its members and meeting dates, and provides a website
address where all information presented this evening is posted, along with some
supplemental information. She said that there is also an application on the website that
allows a taxpayer to enter their parcel number and compare their current property tax
bill to a possible future bill should the HSC be eliminated. This application will show the
taxpayer whether or not there will be any dollar change on their tax bill, should an
elimination take place.
{Clerk‚Äôs Note: Councillor Hickman arrived at 6:07 p.m.}
Co-Chair Henkel said that there will be two presentations offered this evening to detail
the City‚Äôs current budget situation and explain the homestead credit (HSC). The first
presentation will be offered by the City Controller and will give a brief overview of the
City‚Äôs finances and revenue streams. The second presentation will be offered by Policy
Analytics, LLC, a local fiscal research and analysis firm, and will explain the HSC, what
it is, how it was created, and what will happen to individual property tax bills and other
units of government if it is eliminated.
Jason Dudich, City Controller, Office of Finance and Management (OFM), provided a
2013 Fiscal Review of the Consolidated City of Indianapolis and Marion County.

Local Homestead Credit Review Commission

{Clerk‚Äôs Note: A copy of this presentation, along with all other presentations and
handouts, can be found on the Council‚Äôs Local Homestead Credit Review Commission‚Äôs
web page: http://www.indy.gov/eGov/Council/ Committees/Pages/Local-HomesteadCredit-Review-Commission.aspx.} Mr. Dudich stated that the City and County has a
roughly $1 billion budget, and the General Fund makes up approximately 54% of that
total budget at almost $540 million. He said roughly 84% of that total General Fund
operating budget comes from property tax or income tax revenue. The major income
tax revenue is generated by a 1.62% tax rate for Marion County, which is broken into
different pieces: the County Option Income Tax (COIT), the public safety tax, and the
property tax levy freeze. That income tax is allocated through a formula determined by
State law as to how much goes to the City of Indianapolis, Marion County and other
taxing units such as excluded cities. He reviewed the income tax revenue trends, with
some growth from 2008 to 2010, and then a drop from 2011 to 2013. He said that this
drop is related to the economic downturn, as well as a delay in property tax distribution.
He said that the way these taxes are distributed may not match the the current
economic trend, as they lag behind a year to two years in distribution.
{Clerk‚Äôs Note: Assessor O‚ÄôConnor arrived at 6:18 p.m.}
Mr. Dudich stated that the City and County have lost $164 million accumulatively in
revenue over the past few years, and they need to take action to try and maintain the
fiscal stability of the City. He said that while the surrounding counties have increased
their percentage of personal income in comparison with the total State income, Marion
County has remained relatively the same, and actually decreased a bit, in relation to the
overall percentage of personal income for the State of Indiana. They are trying to drive
that percentage up and encourage more citizens to stay in Marion County, so that more
dollars stay in the City. He said that property tax is the other major source of revenue
for the General Fund, which is affected by the fire consolidations, collections and the
circuit breaker, and it has remained relatively steady. He said that it is a daunting
picture that the City and County is realizing, and little to no growth in revenue sources
places a burden on the City to lower expenditures and deplete fund balances. While
they are assuming a slight uptake in revenue in 2014, that is not guaranteed, and will
still not bring them to previous revenue levels. Even with some one-time revenue
sources and reductions in expenditures, they are still faced with a structural deficit of
approximately $62.3 million at the end of 2013, with $26.2 million in cash on hand; and
a $55.5 million deficit projected for the end of 2014, with $29.3 million on hand. These
numbers do not assume the elimination of the homestead credit. He said that currently,
$12.5 million of COIT distribution is set aside off the top for the local homestead credit.
The elimination of the local homestead credit would allow that $12.5 million of COIT to
be put into the formula for tax distribution and would provide almost $8.3 million in
potential on-going revenue to the General Fund without an increase in income taxes.
He said that there will be a minimal impact on property tax for those homeowners who
are below the cap or are part of a referendum. Mr. Dudich concluded that while the
elimination of the homestead credit would not fix all their problems or solve the deficit,

Local Homestead Credit Review Commission

they need to look at all options available to them and look at the issue holistically with all
the tools they have at their disposal.
Jason O‚ÄôNeill, Policy Analytics, LLC, provided commission members and citizens with
an overview, history and analysis of the Local Homestead Credit, which is available to
an owner-occupied dwelling or residence. An individual can only claim HSC on one
property, the home which is their primary residence. Mr. O‚ÄôNeill stated that they are
speaking specifically of the COIT homestead credit, which does not include the Stateadministered homestead deduction or the smaller Local Option Income Tax (LOIT)
homestead credit. He said that HSCs become property tax revenue to be distributed to
all units in the County that levy property taxes, and essentially replace a portion of the
property taxes that residential taxpayers would otherwise pay. Mr. O‚ÄôNeill said that
eliminating the HSC will shift approximately $12.8 million in COIT revenue into
spendable general revenues for certain civil units. He reviewed the impact of
eliminating the credit on taxing units that experience a net revenue increase, as well as
those that experience circuit breaker losses. He explained that taxpayers already at
their circuit breaker maximum will see no impact, while taxpayers below that maximum
and those subject to a school referendum fund levy will see an increase in varying
degrees. Mr. O‚ÄôNeill gave some examples of different elimination scenarios. The
property tax increase with an elimination of HSC would be less than $30 annually for
81% of Marion County homeowners. He gave some analyses of taxpayer liability on
different-priced parcels in different townships. He concluded by showing a map with a
County overview of the impact of removing the HSC, and said that the website also
shows a breakdown of that impact by township.
Co-Chair Henkel said that she knows this is a lot of information to digest in one sitting,
as she has heard these presentations four times, now, and is finally beginning to
understand it. She said that this is basically $12.5 million of COIT money that has been
taken out of one tax bucket and put into another bucket of tax money, that of property
taxes. She said that this has been done to provide some relief and reduce some
homestead taxes. To eliminate the homestead credit, the City is proposing that these
COIT dollars not be taken out of the income tax bucket. She said that COIT revenue
goes to fund the City and County, and other excluded and included cities and towns; but
not to schools, and not much to the townships. Whereas, property tax revenue goes to
all those entities, including schools and townships. So, some tax-supported units would
lose revenue with this shift, while others would benefit from such a change. .
Councillor Sandlin asked since the State now funds most of the operating budgets of
schools, what these lost property tax revenues would be going toward in the schools,
where a loss might be felt. Mr. O‚ÄôNeill said that the property tax reforms in 2008 shifted
the full responsibility for funding school operations to the State, so that these operations
are no longer property tax-supported and are funded out of the State budget. There are
some aspects of school funding, however, that are still funded through property taxes:
debt service, transportation, bus replacement, pension debt, and capital projects.

Local Homestead Credit Review Commission

Those are therefore the areas where the schools will be hit if there is a reduction in their
property tax revenue.
Councillor Sandlin added that Channel 16 is taping and broadcasting each of these
community meetings, so if attendees are finding everything hard to digest in one sitting,
they can go to the indygov website and watch broadcasts of the meetings to get a better
understanding of all the issues.
Mr. Spalding asked how the advent of tax caps changed how the homestead credit
works. Mr. O‚ÄôNeill said that before the circuit breaker went into effect, this elimination
would not have had a negative impact on taxing units. Taxpayers would pay that
amount and there would be no revenue reductions for taxing units. Because some
taxpayers are already maxed out with regard to the circuit breaker, there is some
potential for revenue reductions for taxing units. Mr. O‚ÄôNeill added that before the circuit
breaker went into effect, 100% of the revenue in the HSC was used to reduce property
taxes for homeowners. Again, since some taxpayers are maxed out with regard to the
circuit breaker, that is why some will not see much of a liability reduction, because they
are already at the limit. Mr. Spalding said that the reality is that with the tax caps in
place, this income tax revenue that is distributed like property tax ends up being an
appropriation out to taxing units by continuing to have the credit function as it does.
Co-Chair Henkel asked for public testimony.
Tom Glass, Wayne Township resident, said that his focus is more about how the City
and County are spending his tax dollars, rather than the source of revenue streams. He
said that he believes they are going the wrong way in their spending. Councillor
Hickman asked if Mr. Glass has specific expenditures to which he is referring. Mr.
Glass said that it is the City‚Äôs spending in general, and he has nothing specific to share
at this time.
Paul Carpenter-Wilson, budget director for the Indianapolis Public Schools (IPS), said
that the elimination of the homestead credit will further burden township schools and
libraries who are already struggling because of limited revenue sources. He said that
this will also create an increase of taxes for over 75% of homeowners in Marion County.
At the schools, this action will affect capital projects and transportation. Because they
have to pay their debt service out of these funds, there will then be less money to
maintain their buildings and provide safe transportation for students. He said that times
are hard economically for all of Marion County, and the schools and other taxing units
are having to reduce their expenses, because there is no other revenue available to
fund everything they would like to do. He said that the City has had three meetings to
urge cooperation among all taxing units; yet the discussion of eliminating this credit flies
in the face of such cooperation, because it places the burden on some, while easing it
on others. He urged the commission not to support the elimination of the HSC.

Local Homestead Credit Review Commission

Jim Haworth, resident, stated that he has no real specific questions or comments, but
that he agrees with the comments made by Mr. Carpenter-Wilson.
Samuel Murray, resident, said that he opposes the elimination of the HSC, because it is
not clear how it will affect property taxes for those who are lucky enough in these
economic times to still have their homes. He said without more information about how it
will affect them, this elimination would not be fair to homeowners. He said that some of
the terminology used is confusing to him, and he cannot really digest it all in one
meeting to respond appropriately, and he would like more time to become familiar with
the information. He asked what would cause a taxpayer to pay at a rate that is below
the 1%. Co-Chair Henkel said that it is mostly because of the standard deduction and
the supplemental deduction. Co-Chair Steele said that the standard deduction is 60%
of the first $75,000 assessed valuation, which is $45,000. If a house was assessed at
$75,000, they would first subtract the $45,000. Then they would get a supplemental
deduction of 35% of the value between $45,000 and $75,000. Those deductions take
the net assessed value down to such a point that the tax rate times that net assessed
value would be less than 1% of the gross assessed valuation. Co-Chair Henkel said
that this was a very good question, because there is nowhere in Marion County where
the rate is less than 1%; but by factoring in all those deductions, it could very well be.
Mr. Spalding added that because of the nature of that deduction, it ends up taking off a
bigger percentage of the assessed value of lower valued homes than of a higher valued
home.
Mr. Murray asked how the change in parking affects this. Mr. Dudich said that the
parking fee revenue is deposited into a separate dedicated fund for roads, curbs,
sidewalks and other infrastructure, and is not part of this discussion. That revenue
does, however, help to address infrastructure needs that may free up funds for other
uses. Mr. Murray asked if public safety is a recipient of those parking fee revenues. Mr.
Dudich responded in the negative. Councillor Sandlin said that the parking revenue that
comes in goes to pay for streets and sidewalks where parking meters are located. Prior
to the parking meter agreement, the City generated very little cash flow out of parking
because what revenue did come in was used for personnel, maintenance and
administration of those meters. He said that there is now less money spent out of the
General Fund for those costs, thereby freeing up money to go to other things, like public
safety. Co-Chair Steele said that the revenues that are mostly available for public
safety are from property and income taxes, along with some fees they may charge.
Sheila Walkup, resident, said that while $28 to $33 seems insignificant at first glance,
they are not looking at the big picture, because this increase only compounds the
current economic climate for citizens. Everything else is going up, too, like gas prices,
and utilities, and this is just another item that adds to that problem. She said that they
need to look at a way to have churches, universities and other non-profits pay 10%,
instead of having individual homeowners bear all the brunt of taxation.

Local Homestead Credit Review Commission
June 3, 2013

Mary Hasenst, Meridian Highland Association, said that universities like Indiana
University-Purdue University of Indianapolis (IUPUI) has had a lot of devlelopment, with
billions of dollars invested, as have the hospitals; and she asked why they cannot get
some contribution from them, as they also use public services. She asked if all the
charter schools being added also increases taxes. Co-Chair Henkel said that they
would have to have a change in State law to tax tax-exempt entities like churches and
universities. She said that the Council does not have the power or authority to enact
such taxation. Mr. Spalding said that the charter schools help keep people in
Indianapolis because they provide families with more educational options. This, in turn,
would help increase income tax revenue, because the more working families staying
within the County help contribute to those revenues. He said that this is one way
charters help to build and increase the income tax revenue in Marion County.
Mr. Murray said that there seems to be a trend developing with more of the City‚Äôs higher
paid employees living outside of Marion County. Therefore, their income taxes go to
surrounding counties, but this places the burden of taxes and paying for public services
on lower-paid residents in Marion County. He asked why they do not consider an
occupation tax for those working in the County, but living outside county lines. Co-Chair
Henkel said that this is again a matter for the State to decide. Mr. Spalding said that all
local government units are a subdivision of State government, and all taxing structure is
set by the State. The State then gives the local governmental units tools to use to
manage their tax revenue as best they can. Mr. Murray asked if the City can make
recommendations to the State. Mr. Spalding said they can, and that has been done on
a regular basis. Co-Chair Henkel said that some surrounding counties, by adopting the
LOIT available to them, have kept some of these employees from helping to fund
Marion County. She said that all LOIT goes to the County that adopts it, and those
income tax revenues go to the County a person lives in. This is the statutory structure
that has been set up by the State. Councillor Hickman said that it could go in the
opposite direction, and folks could live in Marion County and work in another county.
Mr. Murray said that this does not allow for those who regularly use the County‚Äôs
infrastructure and public services to pay into it, and that is not fair for the residents to
bear that full burden. Councillor Hickman said that many people feel as Mr. Murray
does and there has been a lot of discussion on this issue at the State Legislature.
Councillor Sandlin said that at a previous meeting they discussed researching a list of
properties in Marion County that are not on the tax rolls. Co-Chair Henkel said that
Policy Analytics is working on that, but it is hard to get a true picture because most of
these properties are not assessed. Assessor O‚ÄôConnor said that it is tricky, because
some of the properties are non-taxable, while others are tax-exempt. It is hard to gauge
the full effect, because some of these sport stadiums or hospitals are taking prime real
estate spots that would normally be taxed. He said that he is not advocating for or
against a use tax, but the posture at the General Assembly seems to be going against
that for whatever reason. He said that previous to last year, a State government agency
leasing space in a private landlord building would have been denied an exemption
because the rent money was going to a private landlord. However, last year the State

Local Homestead Credit Review Commission
June 3, 2013
Page 7
passed a law that reversed that, and if the lessee is a government entity, they would
qualify for an exemption. Therefore, the posture of the General Assembly seems to be
against this suggestion, but citizen reaction and input could possibly change that.
Dan Henkel, resident, said that many of the comments and questions suggest that
many of these stakeholders are very interested in the general area of finance and
taxation issues. He said that this commission has a real task to keep the focus on this
one specific issue, when there is so much interest, in general, on revenue and tax
issues.
Co-Chair Henkel thanked everyone for their comments and said that this indeed is not
an easy decision, as there are many layers to this issue to consider.
Councillor Hickman said that she found the presentations very helpful, even though she
agrees some words are difficult to understand. She said that the misconception is that
this only affects homeowners, but she wants it to be clear that schools and other units
will also feel some impact.
Mr. Dudich said that there are some things that could be studied to help mitigate the
impact on other local units, and as part of the commission‚Äôs recommendation, they
might want to discuss and identify some ways that could be done.
Co-Chair Henkel said that in addition to the last two commission community meetings,
Councillor Marilyn Pfisterer will be hosting one additional meeting on June 18, 2013 at
7:30 p.m. at Ben Davis High School. She said that this would be one more opportunity,
after this series of community meetings, for some additional information, so that it will be
fresh in their minds when they meet to make recommendations on June 24th. She said
that tomorrow evening‚Äôs meeting will be at the Fay Biccard Glick Neighborhood Center,
2990 W. 71st Street, at 6:00 p.m. Co-Chair Steele thanked the Library for the use of
their facility this evening.
There being no further business, and upon motion duly made, the meeting was
adjourned at 7:34 p.m.
Respectfully Submitted,

Shortly aer taking oÔ¨Éce in 2012, Mayor Pete Bu&gieg convened a group of city and

working group to address the issue of vacant and abandoned proper,es. Co-chaired by
academic expert Jim Kelly from the Law School of the University of Notre Dame, this
group took on the dual challenge of analyzing the dimensions of South Bend‚Äôs problem,
and assessing the elements of a comprehensive solu,on.

This booklet provides informa,on to residents on how they can get involved in the
eÔ¨Äort to address vacant and abandoned proper,es in the community. You will learn:
‚Ä¢

What you can do to reduce the nega,ve impact of an abandoned property on your
neighborhood,

‚Ä¢

What processes exist for purchasing an abandoned property,

‚Ä¢

How to Ô¨Ånd property informa,on (such as address or owner) for a house or vacant
lot so you can report code viola,ons or contact the owner, and

‚Ä¢

What are poten,al reuses of an abandoned property once you purchase it.

GOOD SAMARITAN LAW
The City encourages neighbors to play an
ac,ve role in maintaining abandoned
proper,es within the conÔ¨Ånes of the Good
Samaritan Law. The City cannot give legal
advice to people seeking to maintain a
vacant and abandoned property, but can
suggest that any person concerned about
such a property refer to the Good
Samaritan Law and to contact the
Department of Code Enforcement at 574235-9486 about any property thought to
be abandoned.

Some neighbors of vacant and abandoned
proper,es have expressed an interest in
maintaining yards, securing buildings, or
gardening on the proper,es. Many have
asked City oÔ¨Écials for permission to take
these remedial ac,ons. It is important to
remember that the City does not own the
proper(es, and cannot give people
permission to enter onto them. As a
general rule, stepping onto a property
without the owner‚Äôs permission is
trespassing, and could result in civil or
criminal liability.
However, Indiana recently passed the
‚ÄúGood Samaritan Law,‚Äù (found in Indiana
Code Sec,on 34-30-26-5) which provides
limited excep,on to the trespassing law.
The Good Samaritan law allows a nonowner to lock or board an entry to a
building. It also allows a non-owner to
remove trash and complete simple yard
upkeep, including mow the property. If
the non-owner does these things without
gross negligence or inten,onal misconduct
the person will not be subject to liability.
The Good Samaritan Law does not allow a
person to enter the property of another
for the purpose of gardening, or to enter a
building on the property under any
circumstances.

HOW TO ACQUIRE AN ABANDONED
PROPERTY OR VACANT LOT
Tax Sales are an open auc,on format.
The minimum bid is adver,sed and is
the lowest amount that can be
accepted by law. The bidder or their
authorized representa,ve must aPend
the public auc,on to bid on proper,es.
Purchases are not permiPed by mail,
phone, or fax. The winning bidder will
be awarded a tax sale cer,Ô¨Åcate based
upon the highest bid and the
sa,sfactory form of payment. All sales
are Ô¨Ånal. Buyers are obligated to pay
within 24 hours of award by cer,Ô¨Åed
funds accompanied by the tax sale
cer,Ô¨Åcate.

Prior to purchasing any property you
should contact the City of South Bend‚Äôs
Department of Code Enforcement to check
if there are is a demoli,on order, ac,ve
code viola,on or code lien against the
house and/or vacant lot. You can reach
them at (574)235-9486 or by visi,ng its
oÔ¨Éces at 227 W. JeÔ¨Äerson Blvd., 13th Ô¨Çoor
County‚ÄìCity Building.
One of the keys to reducing abandoned
proper,es is changing ownership. There
are a couple ways that residents can buy
an abandoned property or vacant lot:
1. Through Property Tax Sale or
Commissioners‚Äô Cer,Ô¨Åcate Sale
2. Purchase directly from the property
owner
Tax Sale & Commissioners‚Äô Cer(Ô¨Åcate Sale
Property Tax Sale
Within the State of Indiana, when
property taxes or special assessments
from the prior installments are
delinquent, the property becomes
eligible for the county tax sale.
Coun,es may conduct up to one tax
sale during each tax year. These sales
are typically held in the fall. Tax Sales
and all eligible proper,es are adver,sed
in advance of the day of the sale.

The original property owner retains
ownership for a one year redempon
period following tax sale. This
redemp,on period permits the original
owner to pay all delinquent taxes and
associated penal,es plus an addi,onal
10 % and addi,onal costs that go to the
bidder.
It is important to know that unl a lien
buyer (successful bidder) is issued a tax
deed for the property pursuant to a
court order, he or she does not have any
right to either take possession of or
secure the property. If the lien buyer

PROPERTY REUSE OPTIONS
Once you purchase an abandoned home or vacant lot in your neighborhood there are a
number of things you can do with the property:
Rehabilitate the House

Urban Gardening

Not all homes that qualify as abandoned
need to be demolished. Rather, some
abandoned homes can, and should, be
rehabilitated.

Urban gardening oÔ¨Äers an opportunity for
neighbors to grow food either for
themselves or to provide to those in need.
If the garden will be open to the broader
community, you should consider

volunteers to manage gardens.
‚Ä¢ Evaluate the condi,on of the house to
determine the extent of repairs needed
and the associated cost.
‚Ä¢

Prior to hiring a contractor to complete
work on your newly purchased home,
contact the Building Department to
ensure they are licensed in
St. Joseph County.

Pocket Park

Pocket parks provide a small scale park
space to a neighborhood. They can take
the form of a small playground, a passive
park or even a dog park. Oen they are
owned and maintained by a neighborhood
group or other nonproÔ¨Åt organiza,on (for
insurance and maintenance purposes).

Many ,mes, a vacant lot lies between two
homes and neighbors agree to split the lot
so they both get some addi,onal space. If
you and your neighbor would like to split a
vacant lot, you can replat the land (this is a
process that divides the lot between the
two proper,es) by comple,ng the
following steps:
‚Ä¢

Come to an agreement with your
neighbor to split the property (consider
how much land you will each get, the
cost of spli&ng, etc.).

‚Ä¢

Hire a company to provide surveying
services. The company will complete
required legal documenta,on that will
denote the new boundaries of your and
your neighbors‚Äô property.

‚Ä¢

Both you and your neighbor Ô¨Åle the
legal paperwork with the County
Recorder‚Äôs oÔ¨Éce.

Side Lot

Once this is completed, instead of there
being 3 parcels (yours, the vacant lot and
your neighbors) there will be 2 larger
parcels (yours and your neighbors).

A side lot allows a property owner to have
a larger yard where kids can play, a garden
can be planted and/or they can get a bit
more space between them and their
neighbor.

‚ÄúSmart Streets‚Äù is an effort to improve the role of streets within South Bend.
Projects within this initiative utilize the ‚ÄúComplete Streets‚Äù philosophy which
advocates for the design of streets to enable safe access for all users, including
pedestrians, bicyclists, motorists and transit riders of all ages and abilities.

Western Avenue
Street Improvements Fact Sheet
Project Purpose
The City of South Bend is changing Western Avenue between William and Sheridan Streets into a street
that is safer and creates an environment more conducive to business and residential investment.
The changes to travel lane striping and related streetscape improvements will maintain a steady flow
of traffic at calmer speeds. Motorist, pedestrian, and bicyclist safety will be improved, while
businesses will have better visibility and the benefit of convenient, publicly provided on-street parking.
The proposed lane and streetscape changes will make the area more attractive to residents on or near
Western Avenue.
The improvements are one step in the implementation of the West Side Main Streets Plan, the plan for
Lincolnway West and Western Avenue completed in 2014. During the planning process, businesses
and residents stated they wanted a more walkable environment, which this project will help create.

Project Scope
The lane striping on Western Avenue will be revised so that this entire stretch of street clearly operates
as one lane in each direction with a left-turn lane. Some sidewalk replacements may be completed. As
space and demand dictates, on-street parking, bicycle facilities, and street trees will be added. These
changes are summarized in the table on the reverse.
Western Avenue carries about 10,000 to 16,000 vehicles per day, depending on the segment. Across
the country, similar three-lane reconfigurations have been successfully implemented on streets
carrying up to 20,000 to 25,000 vehicles per day. A traffic analysis completed for this project confirms
that intersections along Western Avenue will maintain acceptable levels of service with the lane
changes; that is, vehicles will be able to move through intersections without significant delay.

Also, the three-block section of Western Avenue between Dundee Street and Bendix Drive will receive
further streetscape improvements. The curbs, sidewalks, driveway approaches, and street pavement
will be replaced. Street trees, decorative lighting, and bus shelters will be installed. Pedestrian
bumpouts will be added at the corners.

Maintenance of Traffic & Property Access
The section of Western Avenue between Dundee Street and Bendix Drive will be partially or fully
closed at times during construction. The rest of Western Avenue will generally remain open to traffic
throughout the project, and work will be completed in phases. Every effort will be made to minimize
interruption to property access for residents, customers, employees, and deliveries.

Schedule
Contractor bids for these improvements will be opened in June. Work on Western Avenue is
anticipated to begin in early July and be completed by late October. All dates are subject to change.

Tree Maintenance
Pending available funding, the City may provide professional tree maintenance during the first three
years after planting, the critical period of establishment and growth. This maintenance would include
watering, fertilizing, and pruning.

Dear President Lewis,
In accordance with City-County Council Proposal 121, 2013, we are pleased to present to you the enclosed Report
of the Marion County Local Homestead Credit Review Commission (Homestead Commission). The report
summarizes the discussion and findings of the Homestead Commission. Additional details such as meeting
minutes and other supplemental data can be found on the Commission web page.
The Local Homestead Credit Review Commission is a bi-partisan study group that was enacted by City-County
Council Proposal 121, and appointed jointly by the Council and the Mayor, to review the Local Homestead Credit
and the potential impact of its elimination. The Commission, which consists of ten members, and two co-chairs,
no more than one from the same political party, had the following objectives:
ÔÇ∑
ÔÇ∑
ÔÇ∑
ÔÇ∑

Educate the community about the homestead credit;
Review the implications and effects of the local homestead credit on the budgets of all property tax
supported units;
Receive public input on these decisions;
Make a recommendation to the Council based on findings.

The Commission held seven public meetings in various locations throughout the community to ensure all
members of the public had the opportunity to attend and participate in public discussion about the Local
Homestead Credit.
We would personally like to thank all members of the Commission as they have devoted their time and
knowledge throughout the entire process. This would not have been possible without their diligence and
dedication to the Commission. We would also like to acknowledge members of the public and representatives of
various county, civil and school taxing units for their participation in the process and contribution to the
community dialogue.
Thank you for the opportunity to serve as co-chairs of this initiative. It has been our pleasure to lead the process
and we hope that the results will be useful to the decision making process in the upcoming budget and beyond.

Sincerely,

Beth Henkel

Background and Introduction
The Local Homestead Credit Review Commission is a ten-member, bi-partisan study group
appointed through joint agreement between the Indianapolis-Marion County City-County
Council and the Mayor. The Commission was enacted by Council Resolution Proposal No. 121,
2013 (Council Resolution No. 48, 2013). The objectives of the commission are as follows:
ÔÇ∑
ÔÇ∑
ÔÇ∑
ÔÇ∑

Educate the community about the local homestead credit (LHC);
Review the effects of possible elimination on the budgets of all property tax supported
units;
Receive public input on the issues and impacts regarding possible elimination;
Make recommendations to the City County Council regarding whether to maintain,
eliminate, or phase out the LHC;

To meet its responsibilities, the Commission
ÔÇ∑
ÔÇ∑

Held seven public meetings in various locations around the county;
Established a website that contains information, analyses and presentations regarding
the LHC. It also provides taxpayers a means to find out what the potential effect would
be on their bills if the LHC were eliminated.

City-County Fiscal Condition/Effects of Eliminating the Local Homestead Credit
One of the considerations in reviewing the effects of eliminating the LHC is the potential effect
on the City-County budget. Regarding the City-County financial condition and the fiscal
challenges the city and county face, the Commission found that:
ÔÇ∑

ÔÇ∑
ÔÇ∑
ÔÇ∑

ÔÇ∑

Page 3

Income tax revenue to the City/County has declined by a cumulative $164 million since
2010, from a high of $268 million to $209 million in 2013.
Property tax revenue has remained flat, or slightly declined since 2008.
Average net property tax revenue per year from 2008 to 2014 (est.) is $240 million.
Therefore, as to the major sources of revenue for City/County government -- have seen
a decline in general fund revenues of $64 million from 2010, with cumulative decline
over that period of $180 million.
At the same time, general fund expenses have not declined substantially, despite
several measures taken to cut spending.
By far the majority of expenses are in public safety and criminal justice expenditures, a
total of $507 million in 2012 (88% of budget); $530 million in the 2013 budget (89%).
As a result of these ongoing declines in revenue, general fund balances have declined.
o For 2013, the Controller‚Äôs office reported a structural deficit of $62.3 million,
with general fund balance estimated to be $26.2 million by the end of 2013.
o For 2014, if no actions are taken, the projected deficit is $55.5 million, with a
yearend GF balance in the red, at -$29.3 million.
Elimination of the LHC would not solve the city/county‚Äôs deficit.
o For 2014, an estimated $12.8 million of County Option Income Tax (‚ÄúCOIT‚Äù)
receipts would be set aside for LHC.
o Essentially take $12.8 million of funds that would otherwise be distributed to the
City, County, excluded cities and towns and certain township units and put that
money in the property tax bucket to offset property taxes otherwise due from
homestead owners ‚Äì thereby distributing COIT funds to schools and other units,
like IndyGo, the library, and Health and Hospital, that generally do not receive
COIT.
o Only $3.8 million of the $12.8 million LHC actually provides property tax relief to
homeowners.
o Elimination of the LHC would provide the City/County with a net increase of $8.3
million in potential ongoing revenue.
o Elimination of the LHC would also increase effective property tax rates and
increase the circuit breaker loss to taxing units that do not receive COIT -- towns,
schools, and municipal corporations by $5.3 million.

July 16, 2013

Local Homestead Credit Review Commission: Report of Proceedings and Recommendations

In our review of the effect that elimination would have on taxpayers in the county, we found
that:
o Of 220,000 homesteads in the county, elimination of the LHC would have no
effect on 56,000 homesteads‚Äì approximately one-quarter of all homesteads.
o If the LHC were eliminated, the property tax increase for 81% of Marion County
homeowners would be less than $30.
o For any one homestead, the maximum increase would not be more than 3.6%.
o The overall impact would be greatest on homeowners in areas of the county that
have low tax rates, or that have lower assessed values.
Proceedings Regarding the Elimination of the Local Homestead Credit
After these meetings and gathering additional information, the Commission met on June 24 to
vote on its recommendations regarding elimination of the LHC and also on making other
recommendations that the Commission had regarding ways to address the City/County deficit.
Nine members of the commission attended this meeting, with one member sending a proxy.
The members expressed concern for taxpayers whose bills would increase, even minimally, in
these difficult times.
The majority of members also expressed concern on behalf of the taxing units that would lose
revenue as a result of the elimination of the HSC.
Five members voted in favor of phasing out funding over a two-year period. Four members
voted in favor of retaining current funding.
The proxy member voted for a phase out, but that vote has not been counted, as General
Counsel has advised that the rules pertaining to the participation of proxies do not permit the
proxy to vote. Because the Commission rules require a vote of six members to approve
recommendations, the vote was inconclusive regarding a recommendation to rescind the Local
Homestead Credit.
While there was no conclusive Commission recommendation, there will be council
consideration of eliminating the Local Homestead Credit.
On July 8, Proposal 187, 2013 was submitted to the City-County Council, proposing a resolution
of the Marion County Income Tax Council, under IC 6-3.5-6-1.5 and IC 6-3.5-6-13, to reduce the
local homestead credit to 4% for calendar year 2014 and to rescind the local homestead credit
beginning in calendar year 2015. Proposal 187 has been assigned to the Administration and
Finance Committee. Final action is scheduled to be taken by July 29, before the Controller
submits the proposed 2014 budget to the City-County Council in August.

As a result of Commission deliberation and public inquiry, the Commission also considered
other recommendations that could assist with the financial issues raised in consideration of the
LHC. In all, there were seven additional recommendations:
1. All members voted in favor of continuing City/County efficiency efforts to reduce
spending.
2. All members also favored appropriating existing funds from taxes collected for the
Auditor‚Äôs Office to complete the homestead exemption review process and
recommended a change in State law to permit the excess funds collected to be returned
to local units of government. Through the Ineligible Homestead Program, the County
Auditor has collected more than $2 million from taxpayers who improperly received the
homestead designation.
3. Eight of nine members recommended that additional funding be provided to the
Assessor‚Äôs Office to resolve the pending backlogs of appeals in a fair and equitable
manner.
4. Eight of nine members voted in favor of implementing a TIF Assessed Value passthrough policy to insure continuity in the reduction of the circuit breaker loss to local
units of government.
5. Seven members voted in favor of further review of whether the County Income Tax
Council (CITC) should phase in and increase the Public Safety COIT rate to provide
additional funding for Public Safety staffing and operational needs. Two voted against
any increase.
6. Six members voted in favor of further review by the CITC of increasing the Local Option
Income Tax (LOIT) levy freeze rate to provide proper funding for local units of
government that had their levies frozen for three years; two voted in favor of
recommending increasing the rate and one disagreed with any increase.
7. Five members favored providing COIT funding to Library and Indy-Go to cover any net
funding loss due to HSC change and/or LOIT levy freeze rate change; three additional
members voted for further review of this issue; one disagreed with any additional
funding to offset the revenue losses.

Impact on Fund Balance
‚Ä¢

Little to no growth in major revenue sources place a burden on lowering
expenditures and depleting fund balances.

‚Ä¢

Even with one‚Äêtime revenue sources and reductions in expenditures during
2013, a structural deficit will occur.
‚Äì The structural deficit is based expected expenditures for a given year, net
of total revenue for a given year, adjusted for one‚Äêtime
revenue/expenditures or anticipated future revenue/expenditures.
While overall general fund expenditures have increased over the last 5 years,
an increase in public safety and criminal justice services have created
additional pressure on the annual budget.

‚Ä¢

‚Ä¢

Actions have been taken to address stagnant revenues by reducing
expenditures where possible, drawing down fund balances and identifying
potential revenue sources both ongoing and one‚Äêtime.

City/County General Fund Impact
2013 and 2014 Est. ($‚Äôs in millions)

9

Impact of Homestead Credit
‚Ä¢ Currently: $12.5M of county option income tax (COIT) is set aside
for Local Homestead Credit
‚Ä¢ Increased expenditures and stagnant tax revenues has created a
structural deficit and potential general fund cash reserve issue
‚Ä¢ Elimination of the Local Homestead Credit would provide the
city/county with almost $8.3M in potential on‚Äêgoing revenue
without an increase in income taxes
‚Ä¢ Creates minimal impact on property taxes (below the cap or part of a
referendum)

‚Ä¢ Elimination of the Local Homestead Credit is not a ‚Äúsilver bullet‚Äù
‚Äì However, this is one option to address the structural deficit and
general fund cash reserves

Overview of COIT
1.

COIT is the County Option Income Tax. It was adopted in the
1980‚Äôs. COIT is one of three types of local income tax imposed
in Marion County.

2.

COIT is spendable revenue for civil units of government to be
used for any valid budgeted purpose.

3.

The COIT homestead credit was established at the time COIT
was enacted.

4.

In 2013, $12.5M of Marion County‚Äôs $169M COIT distribution
was used to replace a portion of homestead property tax levies.

5.

This amount gets distributed as property taxes to all units in the
county that are able to levy property taxes.

2

Overview of the COIT
Homestead Credit
1. Currently, $12.5M of the $169M Marion County COIT distribution is
allocated as a homestead credit for Marion County homeowners.
2. A ‚Äúhomestead‚Äù is defined by Indiana law as an owner-occupied permanent
dwelling. An individual can only claim homestead status on one property
‚Äì the home in which they claim primary residence.
3. The COIT Homestead Credit is not the same as the ‚ÄúHomestead
Deduction.‚Äù The homestead deductions are administered by the State,
and are not local policy decisions.
4. Marion County has an additional small homestead credit ‚Äì the LOIT (local
option income tax) homestead credit, which is not part of this discussion.
5. COIT Homestead Credits ‚Äúbecome‚Äù property tax revenue by virtue of
replacing a portion of the property taxes that residential taxpayers would
otherwise pay.

Impact of Eliminating the HSC on
Taxing Units
1.

Eliminating the COIT homestead credit in 2014 will shift
approximately $12.8M in COIT dollars from property tax
substitution to spendable general revenues for certain civil
units (certified shares).

2.

This change increases effective property tax rates. The
result is a reduction in property tax collections for all
taxing units as taxpayers are moved further above the
circuit breaker rate caps.

3.

Additional COIT dollars, freed up from the homestead
credit will shift to those civil units that are eligible to
receive COIT distributions according to current law.

Descriptive Analysis of the Elimination of the
COIT Homestead Credit in Marion County
Impacts to Taxpayers and Taxing Units

Prepared for the:
Local Homestead Credit Review Commission

By:
Policy Analytics, LLC

May 28, 2013

Background on Marion County COIT Homestead Credit
Under IC 6-3.5-6, Marion County currently imposes a county option income tax (COIT) of 1%. The COIT taxing
option was made available by the Indiana General Assembly in the early 1980‚Äôs to provide diversification to the
revenue base of civil units of government. The revenue raised from the COIT is distributed to non-school taxing
units as prescribed by statute, and in the form of property tax relief to homeowners. The COIT property tax relief
component is known as the ‚ÄúHomestead Credit,‚Äù and in 2013, comprises $12.5M of the total $169M COIT
distribution to Marion County (7.4%).
The COIT homestead credit was instituted by the City County Council to complement the forms of property tax
relief already provided by the State at that time: the property tax replacement credit (PTRC) and the state
homestead credit. In 2008, the Indiana General Assembly enacted a wide range of property tax reforms. These
reforms eliminated the state PTRC, phased out the state homestead credit, and instituted a new series of rate caps
(known as ‚Äúcircuit breakers‚Äù) as the predominant form of property tax controls. These rate caps have since been
embodied in the Indiana Constitution.
A homestead is a special subclass of residential property under Indiana law ‚Äì defined as an owner-occupied
permanent dwelling. An individual taxpayer can only claim homestead status on one property ‚Äì the home in which
they claim as their primary residence. Rental homes, apartments and second homes are not eligible for the
homestead classification. The COIT homestead credit operates as a discount on a homestead property owner‚Äôs tax
bill (about 4%). The homeowner‚Äôs gross tax (net assessed value multiplied by tax rate) is discounted by the
homestead credit. If the resulting tax bill still exceeds the rate cap limit (1% of gross assessed value), then the tax
bill is further reduced until this maximum liability is reached.
The COIT homestead credit, to which this memo refers, is a different property tax relief mechanism than what are
commonly known as homestead deductions (the standard and the supplemental deductions). These deductions,
which provide substantially more property tax relief to taxpayers are in effect statewide, and are not local policy
choices.

The 2008 property tax reforms significantly altered the framework in which local fiscal policy decisions are made.
While the reforms reduced individual tax liabilities and made tax bills more consistent and predictable, the rate
caps resulted in reduced revenue and increased fiscal uncertainty for local governmental units. In 2013, the circuit
breaker rate caps reduce property tax net levies in Marion County by $158.7M (or 13%).

The altered mechanics of post-circuit breaker property taxation, and the fiscal challenges created by the circuit
breaker have necessitated a re-evaluation of the fiscal policies and assumptions that were in place in the precircuit breaker era. The objective of this analysis is to quantify the impacts to both taxing units and taxpayers of
eliminating the COIT homestead credit in Marion County.

Taxpayers: Impact of Eliminating the COIT Homestead Credit
For taxpayers, the implications of eliminating the homestead credit are complicated by the interactions of the
circuit breaker credit. The 2008 property tax reform instituted a rate cap (circuit breaker) of 1% of gross assessed
value for homestead property (except for property taxes related to a voter approved referendum ‚Äì as explained
below). Because of the circuit breaker rate cap, eliminating the homestead credit will affect properties differently
‚Äì depending on assessed value, eligible deductions, and the prevailing property tax rate. The impacts can be
broadly summarized into three situations ‚Äì though there are cases where more than one situation will apply to a
particular parcel.
Case A: The elimination of the COIT homestead credit causes no liability impact
The elimination of the homestead credit will have no impact on the non-referendum tax liability for
taxpayers who are already at the circuit breaker limit (net property tax liability is greater than 1% of
gross assessed value). These taxpayers are already paying their maximum property tax liability and
their tax bill would not increase as a result of the homestead credit elimination. For these taxpayers,
the effects of the COIT homestead credit elimination would be borne by the taxing units in the form
of reduced property tax collections, and not by the taxpayers themselves.

Case B: The elimination of the COIT homestead credit causes increased tax liability to non-referendum
taxes
Homeowners who are not yet at the circuit breaker rate cap would see increased tax bills if the COIT
homestead credit is eliminated. Because the tax liabilities for these parcels are not yet equal to 1% of
the homestead‚Äôs gross assessed value, there is still room for tax bills to increase before the circuit
breaker protection kicks in. For these taxpayers, property tax bills could increase by up to
approximately 4%, or until the net liability exceeds 1% of gross assessed value, whichever comes first.
The following table describes an example of a case in which the elimination of the homestead credit
causes an increase in tax liability ‚Äì but the increase is mitigated by the circuit breaker rate cap. In this
case, the elimination of the homestead credit pushes the tax liability above the circuit breaker
maximum, so the impact is shared between the taxpayer and taxing units.

Case C: The elimination of the homestead credit causes an increase to the liability resulting from a
voter approved referendum.
Tax rates for school capital projects or school operating funding that were approved by voter
referenda are exempt from the circuit breaker credit. Currently, these circuit breaker exempt rates
have been approved in the IPS, Beech Grove, Speedway, Washington Township, Perry Township, and
Pike Township school districts. The elimination of the COIT homestead credit would result in an
increase (approximately 4%) to the portion of the property taxes resulting from the referendum
process. This increase would apply to all homeowners with a referendum-approved tax rate,
regardless of whether or not the taxpayer is already at the circuit breaker rate cap. An illustration of
the impact of eliminating the COIT homestead credit on a taxpayer subject to the referendum rate is
shown below.

The effects of eliminating the COIT homestead credit vary based on location and property value. The impacts to
specific areas and classes of taxpayers are summarized in the findings, tables and maps that follow.

Taxing Units: Impact of Eliminating the COIT Homestead Credit
The Marion County COIT homestead credit is currently set at approximately 4% of a homestead‚Äôs gross liability
(defined as net assessed value times gross tax rate). In 2014, approximately $12.8M in COIT revenue will be
directed to homestead property tax relief. Eliminating the COIT homestead credit would have two effects on local
taxing units, which are explained below. First, general COIT distributions freed up from the homestead credit will
be shifted to civil units‚Äô budgets. Secondly, the circuit breaker rate caps will bite more deeply into all unit‚Äôs net
property tax revenue, as more taxpayers reach the circuit breaker limit (see table on page 9).
1.

Eliminating COIT homestead credit would result in some property tax revenue reduction for all
taxing units.
Removing the COIT homestead credit would lead to an increase in effective property tax rates
countywide. In general, as tax rates increase, taxing units lose more revenue to the circuit breaker
rate caps. As the COIT homestead credit is removed, the tax liability applicable for the 1% circuit
breaker rate cap would increase. This increase in homestead circuit breaker impact would cause a
reduction in revenue for taxing units. This impact would apply to all taxing units ‚Äì since all taxing
units have homestead parcels in their tax base, regardless of their eligibility to receive additional COIT
revenue.

2.

Eliminating the homestead credit would increase revenue to some taxing units by shifting COIT
revenue that is currently being applied as homestead credits to general certified shares (revenue
distributed to taxing units for any budgeted purpose).
In Marion County, the only units eligible to receive increases in COIT distributions are the Marion
County taxing unit, the Consolidated City of Indianapolis, Decatur, Pike and Wayne Townships, and
the cities of Lawrence, Beech Grove, Southport and Speedway. Upon the elimination of the COIT
homestead credit, the COIT distributions to these units would increase by a combined $12.8M (see
table on page 9). Units that are not eligible to receive additional COIT distributions will not see any
revenue increase resulting from the elimination of the COIT homestead credit.

The elimination of the COIT homestead credit would, after the property tax losses described above are taken into
account, provide for a net increase in the total revenue available to Marion County taxing units. For taxing units
that are eligible for an increase in their COIT distribution, the added COIT revenue would be greater than the losses
due to the circuit breaker. For taxing units that are not eligible for an increased COIT distribution, the elimination
of the COIT homestead credit would cause a reduction in revenue. The table below shows, in summary, these two
revenue outcomes.

Summary
1.

Eliminating the COIT homestead credit would result in revenue increases for nine taxing units, totaling
approximately $9M. It would result in revenue decreases of $5.3M to other taxing units within the
County. The elimination of the homestead credit would result in a net increase in local government
revenue available to all taxing units within the County of, in sum, $3.8M.

2.

Approximately 25% of homestead property tax owners would experience no change in property tax
liability due to the elimination of the COIT homestead credit. Approximately 18% would experience no
change in non-referendum taxes (the only increase, if any, would be in voter approved referendum
funds). Approximately 57% of taxpayers would see an increase in non-referendum tax liability.

3.

The median tax bill impact (including voter approved referenda) to taxpayers at various property values is

Descriptive Analysis of the Elimination of the
COIT Homestead Credit in Marion County
Impacts to Taxpayers and Taxing Units

Prepared for the:
Local Homestead Credit Review Commission

By:
Policy Analytics, LLC

May 28, 2013

Background on Marion County COIT Homestead Credit
Under IC 6-3.5-6, Marion County currently imposes a county option income tax (COIT) of 1%. The COIT taxing
option was made available by the Indiana General Assembly in the early 1980‚Äôs to provide diversification to the
revenue base of civil units of government. The revenue raised from the COIT is distributed to non-school taxing
units as prescribed by statute, and in the form of property tax relief to homeowners. The COIT property tax relief
component is known as the ‚ÄúHomestead Credit,‚Äù and in 2013, comprises $12.5M of the total $169M COIT
distribution to Marion County (7.4%).
The COIT homestead credit was instituted by the City County Council to complement the forms of property tax
relief already provided by the State at that time: the property tax replacement credit (PTRC) and the state
homestead credit. In 2008, the Indiana General Assembly enacted a wide range of property tax reforms. These
reforms eliminated the state PTRC, phased out the state homestead credit, and instituted a new series of rate caps
(known as ‚Äúcircuit breakers‚Äù) as the predominant form of property tax controls. These rate caps have since been
embodied in the Indiana Constitution.
A homestead is a special subclass of residential property under Indiana law ‚Äì defined as an owner-occupied
permanent dwelling. An individual taxpayer can only claim homestead status on one property ‚Äì the home in which
they claim as their primary residence. Rental homes, apartments and second homes are not eligible for the
homestead classification. The COIT homestead credit operates as a discount on a homestead property owner‚Äôs tax
bill (about 4%). The homeowner‚Äôs gross tax (net assessed value multiplied by tax rate) is discounted by the
homestead credit. If the resulting tax bill still exceeds the rate cap limit (1% of gross assessed value), then the tax
bill is further reduced until this maximum liability is reached.
The COIT homestead credit, to which this memo refers, is a different property tax relief mechanism than what are
commonly known as homestead deductions (the standard and the supplemental deductions). These deductions,
which provide substantially more property tax relief to taxpayers are in effect statewide, and are not local policy
choices.

The 2008 property tax reforms significantly altered the framework in which local fiscal policy decisions are made.
While the reforms reduced individual tax liabilities and made tax bills more consistent and predictable, the rate
caps resulted in reduced revenue and increased fiscal uncertainty for local governmental units. In 2013, the circuit
breaker rate caps reduce property tax net levies in Marion County by $158.7M (or 13%).

The altered mechanics of post-circuit breaker property taxation, and the fiscal challenges created by the circuit
breaker have necessitated a re-evaluation of the fiscal policies and assumptions that were in place in the precircuit breaker era. The objective of this analysis is to quantify the impacts to both taxing units and taxpayers of
eliminating the COIT homestead credit in Marion County.

Taxpayers: Impact of Eliminating the COIT Homestead Credit
For taxpayers, the implications of eliminating the homestead credit are complicated by the interactions of the
circuit breaker credit. The 2008 property tax reform instituted a rate cap (circuit breaker) of 1% of gross assessed
value for homestead property (except for property taxes related to a voter approved referendum ‚Äì as explained
below). Because of the circuit breaker rate cap, eliminating the homestead credit will affect properties differently
‚Äì depending on assessed value, eligible deductions, and the prevailing property tax rate. The impacts can be
broadly summarized into three situations ‚Äì though there are cases where more than one situation will apply to a
particular parcel.
Case A: The elimination of the COIT homestead credit causes no liability impact
The elimination of the homestead credit will have no impact on the non-referendum tax liability for
taxpayers who are already at the circuit breaker limit (net property tax liability is greater than 1% of
gross assessed value). These taxpayers are already paying their maximum property tax liability and
their tax bill would not increase as a result of the homestead credit elimination. For these taxpayers,
the effects of the COIT homestead credit elimination would be borne by the taxing units in the form
of reduced property tax collections, and not by the taxpayers themselves.

analysis.

Case B: The elimination of the COIT homestead credit causes increased tax liability to non-referendum
taxes
Homeowners who are not yet at the circuit breaker rate cap would see increased tax bills if the COIT
homestead credit is eliminated. Because the tax liabilities for these parcels are not yet equal to 1% of
the homestead‚Äôs gross assessed value, there is still room for tax bills to increase before the circuit
breaker protection kicks in. For these taxpayers, property tax bills could increase by up to
approximately 4%, or until the net liability exceeds 1% of gross assessed value, whichever comes first.
The following table describes an example of a case in which the elimination of the homestead credit
causes an increase in tax liability ‚Äì but the increase is mitigated by the circuit breaker rate cap. In this
case, the elimination of the homestead credit pushes the tax liability above the circuit breaker
maximum, so the impact is shared between the taxpayer and taxing units.

Case C: The elimination of the homestead credit causes an increase to the liability resulting from a
voter approved referendum.
Tax rates for school capital projects or school operating funding that were approved by voter
referenda are exempt from the circuit breaker credit. Currently, these circuit breaker exempt rates
have been approved in the IPS, Beech Grove, Speedway, Washington Township, Perry Township, and
Pike Township school districts. The elimination of the COIT homestead credit would result in an
increase (approximately 4%) to the portion of the property taxes resulting from the referendum
process. This increase would apply to all homeowners with a referendum-approved tax rate,
regardless of whether or not the taxpayer is already at the circuit breaker rate cap. An illustration of
the impact of eliminating the COIT homestead credit on a taxpayer subject to the referendum rate is
shown below.

The effects of eliminating the COIT homestead credit vary based on location and property value. The impacts to
specific areas and classes of taxpayers are summarized in the findings, tables and maps that follow.

Taxing Units: Impact of Eliminating the COIT Homestead Credit
The Marion County COIT homestead credit is currently set at approximately 4% of a homestead‚Äôs gross liability
(defined as net assessed value times gross tax rate). In 2014, approximately $12.8M in COIT revenue will be
directed to homestead property tax relief. Eliminating the COIT homestead credit would have two effects on local
taxing units, which are explained below. First, general COIT distributions freed up from the homestead credit will
be shifted to civil units‚Äô budgets. Secondly, the circuit breaker rate caps will bite more deeply into all unit‚Äôs net
property tax revenue, as more taxpayers reach the circuit breaker limit (see table on page 9).
1.

Eliminating COIT homestead credit would result in some property tax revenue reduction for all
taxing units.
Removing the COIT homestead credit would lead to an increase in effective property tax rates
countywide. In general, as tax rates increase, taxing units lose more revenue to the circuit breaker
rate caps. As the COIT homestead credit is removed, the tax liability applicable for the 1% circuit
breaker rate cap would increase. This increase in homestead circuit breaker impact would cause a
reduction in revenue for taxing units. This impact would apply to all taxing units ‚Äì since all taxing
units have homestead parcels in their tax base, regardless of their eligibility to receive additional COIT
revenue.

2.

Eliminating the homestead credit would increase revenue to some taxing units by shifting COIT
revenue that is currently being applied as homestead credits to general certified shares (revenue
distributed to taxing units for any budgeted purpose).
In Marion County, the only units eligible to receive increases in COIT distributions are the Marion
County taxing unit, the Consolidated City of Indianapolis, Decatur, Pike and Wayne Townships, and
the cities of Lawrence, Beech Grove, Southport and Speedway. Upon the elimination of the COIT
homestead credit, the COIT distributions to these units would increase by a combined $12.8M (see
table on page 9). Units that are not eligible to receive additional COIT distributions will not see any
revenue increase resulting from the elimination of the COIT homestead credit.

The elimination of the COIT homestead credit would, after the property tax losses described above are taken into
account, provide for a net increase in the total revenue available to Marion County taxing units. For taxing units
that are eligible for an increase in their COIT distribution, the added COIT revenue would be greater than the losses
due to the circuit breaker. For taxing units that are not eligible for an increased COIT distribution, the elimination
of the COIT homestead credit would cause a reduction in revenue. The table below shows, in summary, these two
revenue outcomes.

Taxing Unit

Net Impact of Homestead Credit Elmination

12,781,421

Summary
1.

Eliminating the COIT homestead credit would result in revenue increases for nine taxing units, totaling
approximately $9M. It would result in revenue decreases of $5.3M to other taxing units within the
County. The elimination of the homestead credit would result in a net increase in local government
revenue available to all taxing units within the County of, in sum, $3.8M.

2.

Approximately 25% of homestead property tax owners would experience no change in property tax
liability due to the elimination of the COIT homestead credit. Approximately 18% would experience no
change in non-referendum taxes (the only increase, if any, would be in voter approved referendum
funds). Approximately 57% of taxpayers would see an increase in non-referendum tax liability.

3.

The median tax bill impact (including voter approved referenda) to taxpayers at various property values is
as follows:

Homestead Gross AV
Less than 50,000
Between 50,000 and 100,000
Between 100,000 and 150,000

Descriptive Analysis of the Elimination of the
COIT Homestead Credit in Marion County
Impacts to Taxpayers and Taxing Units

Prepared for the:
Local Homestead Credit Review Commission

By:
Policy Analytics, LLC

May 28, 2013

Background on Marion County COIT Homestead Credit
Under IC 6-3.5-6, Marion County currently imposes a county option income tax (COIT) of 1%. The COIT taxing
option was made available by the Indiana General Assembly in the early 1980‚Äôs to provide diversification to the
revenue base of civil units of government. The revenue raised from the COIT is distributed to non-school taxing
units as prescribed by statute, and in the form of property tax relief to homeowners. The COIT property tax relief
component is known as the ‚ÄúHomestead Credit,‚Äù and in 2013, comprises $12.5M of the total $169M COIT
distribution to Marion County (7.4%).
The COIT homestead credit was instituted by the City County Council to complement the forms of property tax
relief already provided by the State at that time: the property tax replacement credit (PTRC) and the state
homestead credit. In 2008, the Indiana General Assembly enacted a wide range of property tax reforms. These
reforms eliminated the state PTRC, phased out the state homestead credit, and instituted a new series of rate caps
(known as ‚Äúcircuit breakers‚Äù) as the predominant form of property tax controls. These rate caps have since been
embodied in the Indiana Constitution.
A homestead is a special subclass of residential property under Indiana law ‚Äì defined as an owner-occupied
permanent dwelling. An individual taxpayer can only claim homestead status on one property ‚Äì the home in which
they claim as their primary residence. Rental homes, apartments and second homes are not eligible for the
homestead classification. The COIT homestead credit operates as a discount on a homestead property owner‚Äôs tax
bill (about 4%). The homeowner‚Äôs gross tax (net assessed value multiplied by tax rate) is discounted by the
homestead credit. If the resulting tax bill still exceeds the rate cap limit (1% of gross assessed value), then the tax
bill is further reduced until this maximum liability is reached.
The COIT homestead credit, to which this memo refers, is a different property tax relief mechanism than what are
commonly known as homestead deductions (the standard and the supplemental deductions). These deductions,
which provide substantially more property tax relief to taxpayers are in effect statewide, and are not local policy
choices.

The 2008 property tax reforms significantly altered the framework in which local fiscal policy decisions are made.
While the reforms reduced individual tax liabilities and made tax bills more consistent and predictable, the rate
caps resulted in reduced revenue and increased fiscal uncertainty for local governmental units. In 2013, the circuit
breaker rate caps reduce property tax net levies in Marion County by $158.7M (or 13%).

The altered mechanics of post-circuit breaker property taxation, and the fiscal challenges created by the circuit
breaker have necessitated a re-evaluation of the fiscal policies and assumptions that were in place in the precircuit breaker era. The objective of this analysis is to quantify the impacts to both taxing units and taxpayers of
eliminating the COIT homestead credit in Marion County.

3 of 15

Taxpayers: Impact of Eliminating the COIT Homestead Credit
For taxpayers, the implications of eliminating the homestead credit are complicated by the interactions of the
circuit breaker credit. The 2008 property tax reform instituted a rate cap (circuit breaker) of 1% of gross assessed
value for homestead property (except for property taxes related to a voter approved referendum ‚Äì as explained
below). Because of the circuit breaker rate cap, eliminating the homestead credit will affect properties differently
‚Äì depending on assessed value, eligible deductions, and the prevailing property tax rate. The impacts can be
broadly summarized into three situations ‚Äì though there are cases where more than one situation will apply to a
particular parcel.
Case A: The elimination of the COIT homestead credit causes no liability impact
The elimination of the homestead credit will have no impact on the non-referendum tax liability for
taxpayers who are already at the circuit breaker limit (net property tax liability is greater than 1% of
gross assessed value). These taxpayers are already paying their maximum property tax liability and
their tax bill would not increase as a result of the homestead credit elimination. For these taxpayers,
the effects of the COIT homestead credit elimination would be borne by the taxing units in the form
of reduced property tax collections, and not by the taxpayers themselves.

The LOIT (local option income tax) homestead credit is funded under a separate legal provision. Beause
of state rules regarding its administration, the elimination of the LOIT HSC is not considered in this
analysis.

4 of 15

Case B: The elimination of the COIT homestead credit causes increased tax liability to non-referendum
taxes
Homeowners who are not yet at the circuit breaker rate cap would see increased tax bills if the COIT
homestead credit is eliminated. Because the tax liabilities for these parcels are not yet equal to 1% of
the homestead‚Äôs gross assessed value, there is still room for tax bills to increase before the circuit
breaker protection kicks in. For these taxpayers, property tax bills could increase by up to
approximately 4%, or until the net liability exceeds 1% of gross assessed value, whichever comes first.
The following table describes an example of a case in which the elimination of the homestead credit
causes an increase in tax liability ‚Äì but the increase is mitigated by the circuit breaker rate cap. In this
case, the elimination of the homestead credit pushes the tax liability above the circuit breaker
maximum, so the impact is shared between the taxpayer and taxing units.

Case C: The elimination of the homestead credit causes an increase to the liability resulting from a
voter approved referendum.
Tax rates for school capital projects or school operating funding that were approved by voter
referenda are exempt from the circuit breaker credit. Currently, these circuit breaker exempt rates
have been approved in the IPS, Beech Grove, Speedway, Washington Township, Perry Township, and
Pike Township school districts. The elimination of the COIT homestead credit would result in an
increase (approximately 4%) to the portion of the property taxes resulting from the referendum
process. This increase would apply to all homeowners with a referendum-approved tax rate,
regardless of whether or not the taxpayer is already at the circuit breaker rate cap. An illustration of
the impact of eliminating the COIT homestead credit on a taxpayer subject to the referendum rate is
shown below.

The LOIT (local option income tax) homestead credit is funded under a separate legal provision. Beause
of state rules regarding its administration, the elimination of the LOIT HSC is not considered in this
analysis.

The effects of eliminating the COIT homestead credit vary based on location and property value. The impacts to
specific areas and classes of taxpayers are summarized in the findings, tables and maps that follow.

Taxing Units: Impact of Eliminating the COIT Homestead Credit
The Marion County COIT homestead credit is currently set at approximately 4% of a homestead‚Äôs gross liability
(defined as net assessed value times gross tax rate). In 2014, approximately $12.8M in COIT revenue will be
directed to homestead property tax relief. Eliminating the COIT homestead credit would have two effects on local
taxing units, which are explained below. First, general COIT distributions freed up from the homestead credit will
be shifted to civil units‚Äô budgets. Secondly, the circuit breaker rate caps will bite more deeply into all unit‚Äôs net
property tax revenue, as more taxpayers reach the circuit breaker limit (see table on page 9).
1.

Eliminating COIT homestead credit would result in some property tax revenue reduction for all
taxing units.
Removing the COIT homestead credit would lead to an increase in effective property tax rates
countywide. In general, as tax rates increase, taxing units lose more revenue to the circuit breaker
rate caps. As the COIT homestead credit is removed, the tax liability applicable for the 1% circuit
breaker rate cap would increase. This increase in homestead circuit breaker impact would cause a
reduction in revenue for taxing units. This impact would apply to all taxing units ‚Äì since all taxing
units have homestead parcels in their tax base, regardless of their eligibility to receive additional COIT
revenue.

2.

Eliminating the homestead credit would increase revenue to some taxing units by shifting COIT
revenue that is currently being applied as homestead credits to general certified shares (revenue
distributed to taxing units for any budgeted purpose).
In Marion County, the only units eligible to receive increases in COIT distributions are the Marion
County taxing unit, the Consolidated City of Indianapolis, Decatur, Pike and Wayne Townships, and
the cities of Lawrence, Beech Grove, Southport and Speedway. Upon the elimination of the COIT
homestead credit, the COIT distributions to these units would increase by a combined $12.8M (see
table on page 9). Units that are not eligible to receive additional COIT distributions will not see any
revenue increase resulting from the elimination of the COIT homestead credit.

The elimination of the COIT homestead credit would, after the property tax losses described above are taken into
account, provide for a net increase in the total revenue available to Marion County taxing units. For taxing units
that are eligible for an increase in their COIT distribution, the added COIT revenue would be greater than the losses
due to the circuit breaker. For taxing units that are not eligible for an increased COIT distribution, the elimination
of the COIT homestead credit would cause a reduction in revenue. The table below shows, in summary, these two
revenue outcomes.

Summary
1.

Eliminating the COIT homestead credit would result in revenue increases for nine taxing units, totaling
approximately $9M. It would result in revenue decreases of $5.3M to other taxing units within the
County. The elimination of the homestead credit would result in a net increase in local government
revenue available to all taxing units within the County of, in sum, $3.8M.

2.

Approximately 25% of homestead property tax owners would experience no change in property tax
liability due to the elimination of the COIT homestead credit. Approximately 18% would experience no
change in non-referendum taxes (the only increase, if any, would be in voter approved referendum
funds). Approximately 57% of taxpayers would see an increase in non-referendum tax liability.

3.

The median tax bill impact (including voter approved referenda) to taxpayers at various property values is
as follows:
