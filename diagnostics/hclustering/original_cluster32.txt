   2. City Completes $11 Million Automatic Meter Reading Project



****** City_Completes_$11_Million_Automatic_Meter_Reading_Project ******


Mayor Graham Richard today visited the City'Â€Â™s Water Maintenance Department
to mark the completion of the $11 million automatic meter reading (AMR)
project.

City Utilities customers have had a new water meter installed in their home or
business. The new meters transmit a customer'Â€Â™s water meter reading to a
computer stationed in a vehicle that drives by to collect readings without
walking on private property. AMR provides greater efficiency and accuracy. More
than 75,000 meters have been installed since January 2003.

&ldquo;We are pleased with the success of this program,&rdquo; said Mayor
Richard. &ldquo;We are a wired and inspired City that is using technology and
innovation to improve customer service. We look forward to continuing to find
new ways to enhance the delivery of services to customers.&rdquo;

AMCO/ITRON with the assistance of United Metering, Inc. installed 70 percent of
the meters. The City'Â€Â™s Water Maintenance Department installed the remaining
30 percent.

The new technology allows customers to get an actual meter reading each month
instead of an estimated read. In addition, AMR is intended to reduce call
center traffic and increase customer satisfaction.

City Water Maintenance staff presented Mayor Richard with a &ldquo;Golden
Meter&rdquo; to commemorate the completion of the project.

   2. Clinton Street Sidewalk Widening to Begin Next Week



****** Clinton_Street_Sidewalk_Widening_to_Begin_Next_Week ******


A project designed to improve pedestrian travel downtown will begin April 25.
The easternmost lane on Clinton Street from Superior Street to the Freimann
Square parking lot will be converted into a sidewalk. The width of the sidewalk
will be tripled and will include decorative pavement and trees.

Beginning April 25, the two eastern southbound lanes on Clinton north of
Superior will be closed. The lane closures will be in effect for approximately
three weeks, weather permitting. The entire project is expected to be complete
by mid-June, in time for summer festivals at Headwaters Park

Once the work is finished, the eastern lane of Clinton from the St. Marys
Bridge to Superior will become a dedicated left turn lane onto Superior. The
project is a key recommendation from the Downtown Blueprint plan to enhance
downtown. The cost is $115,000 and is funded through the Downtown CEDIT bond.

   2. City Completes Street Conversions for Renaissance Pointe Development



****** City_Completes_Street_Conversions_for_Renaissance_Pointe_Development
******


Progress continues to be made on the Renaissance Pointe development in
southeast Fort Wayne. Several streets in the development area have been
converted from one-way streets to two-way streets.

* Weisser Park Avenue
* John Street
* Gay Street
* Smith Street
* Oliver Street
* Bowser Avenue

A key component of the urbanist-style development is to promote walkability so
that residents can take advantage of the many amenities the neighborhood has to
offer. Two-way streets serve to slow traffic and discourage speeding and are
more suitable for pedestrian safety. 

Renaissance Pointe calls for nearly 400 new homes, the rehabilitation of more
than 100 existing homes, a greenway trail, and improved infrastructure. The
Renaissance Pointe area is bounded by Creighton Avenue on the north, Pontiac
Street on the south, Hanna Street on the west, and South Anthony Boulevard on
the east. The development is scheduled to begin this fall, with model units to
be constructed in spring 2007.

   2. Towpath Trail Task Force Created



****** Towpath_Trail_Task_Force_Created ******


Leaders of several local trail groups have formed a Towpath Trail Task Force to
promote the expansion of regional greenway connectivity.

Construction will begin this year on the Towpath Trail, a multi-use pedestrian/
bicycle pathway connecting Aboite Township with the Fort Wayne and New Haven
Rivergreenway system. The trail will be completed in the next two years.

The Towpath Trail will begin in Rockhill Park and extend from Engle Road to
West Jefferson Boulevard to a yet to be determined cross point. The trail will
ultimately connect to the trail system being developed by Aboite New Trails.
The trail will follow the old Wabash and Erie Canal towpath, which was the dirt
path along the canal used by mules to tow boats. The task force will meet
monthly to ensure the maximum utilization of resources and trail designs to
name a few.

Task Force members
* George DeRoche 'Â€Â“ Greenway Consortium
* Roger Goodland 'Â€Â“ Greenway Consortium
* Dawn Ritchie 'Â€Â“ City of  Fort Wayne Greenways Manager
* Paul McAfee 'Â€Â“ Executive Director of Little River Wetlands Project
* Lori Keys 'Â€Â“ Executive Director of Aboite New Trails
