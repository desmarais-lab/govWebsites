CARMEL HISTORIC PRESERVATION COMMISSION
QUARTERLY REPORT TO CARMEL CITY COUNCIL
OCTOBER 2015
JULY - OCTOBER 2015
During this quarter, the Carmel Historic Preservation Commission continued work towards
establishing key Commission related documents.
Over the three month period, the Commission reviewed various Certificate of Appropriateness
applications from across the state. The Certificate of Appropriateness (COA) application is the
official document used by the Historic Preservation Commission for individuals owning property
in historic and/or conservation districts seeking approval from the commission. Based on the
Commissioners feedback and utilizing other City of Carmel applications as reference, the
Commission developed a COA application that best fit the needs of Carmel. The application is
designed to be straightforward and simple. The Commission will approve the Certificate of
Appropriateness application at their next regularly scheduled meeting.
The Commission is working towards application as a Certified Local Government, a program
through the National Park Service and managed by the Indiana Division of Historic Preservation
and Archaeology. With this certification, it provides the City of Carmel additional financial
opportunities for grants and programs to support historic preservation throughout the community.
Commission staff Mark Dollase and Chairperson Carol Schleif met with Mayor Brainard to
discuss the Certified Local Government status and he expressed interest in supporting such an
application.
The Commission previously worked with the Plum Creek Homeowner’s Association (HOA) to
encourage the preservation of the Plum Creek Corn Crib. As a result, in September, the Plum
Creek HOA received a $10,000 Efroymson Family Fund grant via Indiana Landmarks’
recommendation to restore the roof of the Corn Crib.
During the Commission’s September meeting, the Commission staff prepared an education
session on infill design for the Commissioners. This education is important towards an engaged
and expert level Commission when they are tasked with approving new construction in a historic
district.

Respectfully submitted,
Mark Dollase, Carmel Historic Preservation Commission Administrator



For firefighters who work a 24-hour shift, the scheduled hours shall be an
average of 224 hours in a 28-day work period (112 hours bi-weekly).

iv) The formula for calculating the overtime rate of pay shall be:


For Fire Department non-exempt shift employees, hourly rate of pay (as
determined by formula in Section 12(h)(ii) above) x 0.5 for scheduled
overtime from 212-224 hours, and hourly rate x 1.5 for scheduled overtime
in excess of 224 hours and for all emergency call-outs, end-of-shift runs and
work-related court appearances.



For all other non-exempt City employees, hourly rate of pay (as determined

flow purposes; and
WHEREAS, the Common Council finds that certain funds have sufficient cash available

ORDINANCE D-2215-15
AN ORDINANCE OF THE COMMON COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF CARMEL, INDIANA,
REESTABLISHING THE TAX RATE FOR THE CITY OF CARMEL
CUMULATIVE CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT FUND AND REAFFIRMING
CARMEL CITY CODE CHAPTER 2, ARTICLE 4, SECTION 2-91, ACCORDINGLY

Whereas Indiana Code 6-1.1-41-1 et seq. and 36-9-15.5-1 et seq. permit the City of Carmel to
establish a cumulative capital development fund and to impose a property tax for the cumulative fund;
Whereas in or about 1990 it was the determination of the City of Carmel, Indiana, and its
Common Council, that a need existed for the establishment of the Carmel Cumulative Capital
Development Fund, such Fund being most recently re-established in 2011 by City Ordinance No. D-206711, pursuant to Indiana Code 6-1.1-41-2 and 36-9-15.5-2, for any and all uses and purposes permitted
under Indiana Code 36-9-16-3, for capital improvements; for any purposes permitted under Indiana Code
36-9-16.5, for public ways and sidewalks; for any purposes permitted under Indiana Code 36-9-26, for
sewers; for any purposes permitted under Indiana Code 36-9-17, for general improvement; for any
purposes permitted under Indiana Code 36-8-14, for firefighting building and equipment and police
radios; for any purposes permitted under Indiana Code 36-10-4-36, for parks; and for any purposes
permitted under Indiana Code 36-9-16-2 for public buildings and rights-of-way;
Whereas a need now exists for such Cumulative Capital Development to be used for any and all
uses and permitted under Indiana Code 36-9-26 for municipal sewers; for purpose permitted under
Indiana Code 36-9-27-100 for drainage; and for any purposes permitted under Indiana Code 36-10-3-21
for parks and recreation;
Whereas notwithstanding the above, under Indiana Code 36-9-15.5-8(c), funds accumulated in
the Carmel Cumulative Capital Development Fund may be spent for purposes other than those uses and
purposes stated herein, provided that the purpose of such expenditure is to protect the public health,
welfare or safety in a declared emergency situation or as otherwise authorized by law;
Whereas an ad valorem property tax levy was imposed and the revenues from the levy were
retained in the City Cumulative Capital Development Fund, with the maximum rate of levy so imposed
not to exceed the highest rate of levy allowed by Indiana law;
Whereas pursuant to Indiana Code 6-1.1-41-11, once the levy has been approved, the Common
Council may reduce or rescind the annual levy, if it considers it advisable;
Whereas pursuant to Indiana Code 6-1.1-41-13, once the Fund is established, a property tax may
be levied annually at the tax rate approved and advertised annually as other tax levies are advertised;
Whereas for taxes due and payable in the year 2016, the tax will be levied on all taxable real and
personal property within the taxing district and will not exceed $.05 per $100 assessed valuation; and
Whereas the policy of the Indiana Department of Local Government Finance is to require reestablishment of cumulative funds when the property tax rate in the ensuing year is to exceed the property
tax rate in the current year.

The Johnson Addition neighborhood is one of several post-war era neighborhoods built in
City of Carmel and Clay Township. It is one of the more unique neighborhoods of its era in
that it remains remarkably intact. As originally marketed in the 1950s, Johnson Addition
residents continue to enjoy its convenient location within walking distance to schools,
shopping, dining, work and a vibrant downtown.

43

It is the City’s intent to achieve the purpose of this overlay zone by:

RESOLUTION CC-10-05-15-01
A RESOLUTION OF THE COMMON COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF CARMEL,
INDIANA, TO SET TAXES PAYABLE IN 2016 AND AUTHORIZATION OF
BORROWING BETWEEN FUNDS
WHEREAS, it is the policy of the City of Carmel, Indiana (“City”) to keep City property
tax rates level for taxes payable in 2016; and
WHEREAS, the Indiana Department of Local Government Finance (“DLGF”) shall set
the total City tax rate for taxes payable in 2016; and
WHEREAS, the Common Council intends to levy for the 0708 Motor Vehicle Highway
Fund only the amount needed to fund appropriations, leaving no operating balance; and
WHEREAS, the Common Council intends to appropriate lease rental payments in the
2482 Road Bond Fund only to the extent consistent with the policy of keeping the total city tax
rate level, and intends any remaining lease rental payments to be appropriated in the General
Fund; and
WHEREAS, the Common Council intends to enhance funds in need of money for cash
flow purposes; and
WHEREAS, the Common Council finds that certain funds have sufficient cash available
to temporarily deposit to the credit of other funds.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the Common Council of the City of
Carmel, Hamilton County, Indiana:
Section 1. The DLGF is respectfully requested to set the total 2016 City tax rate, for all
City funds at exactly $0.7007 per $100 of assessed value.
Section 2. The DLGF is respectfully requested to set the 2016 property tax levy of the
0708 Motor Vehicle Highway Fund at a level no greater than the amount needed to fund

Section 3. After applying the maximum allowable property tax levy to the 0101 General
Fund, 0708 Motor Vehicle Highway Fund, and 2391 Cumulative Capital Development Fund, as

PROJECT UPDATES
Phase 1 – complete
1) Apartments – Apartment demand remains strong, which supports the occupancy and rental rates.
Current occupancy is at 96%.
2) Retail – Currently, Pedcor leases 95% of the total 79,570 in LSF. The remaining 5% (the old Mangia
and Holy Cow) of unleased space have future tenants for them, and are working through the space
planning process. A new Irish pub will be locating in the space next to Matt the Millers on the

multiple modes of transportation; with buildings and a streetscape which are attractive and safely
designed in order to enhance the livability of the city.
It is the City’s intent to achieve the purpose of this zone by:
 Providing a consistent urban design treatment for private and public properties in central Carmel;
 Providing additional opportunities for investment and reinvestment in real estate by encouraging
higher intensity of development;
 Minimize community infrastructure costs thru the more efficient use of land;
 Providing controls for architecture and landscape design to establish continuity of design between
projects and to improve the physical relationship between new buildings and overall community.

and which plan will serve as the basis for CBD Zone regulations.

forty (240) calendar days for injuries or illnesses incurred in the line of duty), as permitted by

WHEREAS, the Project Site is shown on Exhibit A, and is presently part of Hamilton
County Tax Parcel 17-09-35-00-00-014.000; and,
WHEREAS, the Company anticipates installing approximately One Million Three

36

Hundred Thirty-Seven Thousand Two Hundred Twenty-Eight Dollars ($1,337,228) of new

37

information technology equipment, (all of which is hereinafter referred to as “Eligible Personal

38

Property”); and,

39

WHEREAS, the Company anticipates adding approximately seventy (70) new employees

40

compensated at an average annual wage of Eighty Three Thousand Dollars ($83,000) per year

41

(excluding benefits) as a result of the Project. These new jobs are in addition to the ninety-five

42

(95) employees which will be retained in connection with the Project.

43
44
45

BASED UPON THE ABOVE, IT IS THEREFORE RESOLVED, by the Common
Council of the City of Carmel as follows:
1.

The application for economic revitalization area designation relative to the Project

46

was filed in proper form and the Statement of Benefits, Form SB-1, which was filed as of

47

January 28, 2016, is hereby approved by the Council.

48
49
50

2.

The Project Site is located in an area of the City where municipal services are

provided and no additional infrastructure will be necessitated by the Project.
3.

There is evidence provided which establishes that the subject real estate meets

51

with “undesirable for normal development” criterion of Indiana Code 6-1.1-12.1-1 due to the

52

following conditions:

53

a.

The Project Site, while visible from Meridian Street, is accessed from

54

Pennsylvania Street. Challenging access has previously limited the market

55

potential for redevelopment in favor of other better situated locations

56

along the corridor.

57

b.

The proposed reuse of the Project Site as a corporate headquarters for the

58

Company is consistent with the site’s existing zoning and represents a

59

superior use for the Project Site.

60
61

4.

Evidence has been submitted and considered which tends to establish that the

62

Project will further and promote municipal development objectives by expansion of the property

63

tax base through the purchase and installation of the Eligible Personal Property.

64

5.

The Council hereby designates the Project Site as an Economic Revitalization

65

Area for purposes of establishing a deduction to the assessed value of Eligible Personal Property

66

acquired and installed within the building located upon the Project Site, subject to the adoption

67

of a confirmatory resolution by the Council.

68

6.

The deduction provided by this Resolution shall be for the assessed value of all

69

Eligible Personal Property installed at the Project Site on or prior to January 1, 2022, and for a

70

period of ten (10) years from the date of the first full assessment of the Eligible Personal

71

Property located at the Project Site. The Council hereby finds, declares and determines that

72

deductions from the assessed value of the Eligible Personal Property approved by this Resolution

73

shall be allowed pursuant to the following ten (10) year phase-in deduction schedule, which the

74

Common Council hereby establishes, prescribes and adopts:

In support of the deductions contained in this Resolution, the Council makes the

following FINDINGS:

91

a. The Project meets the parameters set forth in Council Resolution No. CC-02-

92

05-01-02.

93

b. The estimated cost of the Eligible Personal Property investment presented by

94

the Company is reasonable for equipment of that type.

95

c. The estimate of the number of individuals who will be employed or whose

96

employment will be retained by the Company can be reasonably expected to

97

result from the installation of the Eligible Personal Property.

98

d. The annual salaries for the individuals who will be employed or whose

99

employment will be retained by the Company can reasonably be expected to

100

result from the installation of the Eligible Personal Property.

101

e. Based on the increased assessed valuation and the expansion of the

102

employment base within the City of Carmel, the benefits to the City are

103

sufficient to justify the granting of the deduction described in Section 6 above.

104

8.

The terms of this Resolution are subject to the adoption of a Final Resolution

105

confirming the terms and conditions herein after a public hearing to be held on [April 18, 2016,

106

at 6:00 p.m.], in the Council Chamber Room located at One Civic Square, Carmel, Indiana

107

46032.

9.

The deductions provided by this Resolution are subject to the Company’s

109

compliance with the terms of Indiana Code 6-1.1-12.1 and may only be modified or terminated

110

by the City by following the procedures contained in Indiana Code 6-1.1-12.1-5.9.

111

(excluding benefits) as a result of the Project. These new jobs are in addition to the ninety-five

42

(95) employees which will be retained in connection with the Project; and,

43

WHEREAS, the Council, on March 21, 2016, passed Preliminary Resolution CC-03-21-

44

16-03 which preliminarily designated the Project Site as an Economic Revitalization Area and

45

established schedules for deductions to the assessed value of Eligible Personal Property located

46

at the Project Site; and,

47

WHEREAS, a Notice of Adoption of the Preliminary Resolution and Notice of Public

48

Hearing to be held on April 18, 2016, was duly published in the Noblesville Times newspaper on

49

the 1st day of April, 2016; and,

50

WHEREAS, the public hearing advertised in the above notice has been held.

51

BASED UPON THE ABOVE, IT IS THEREFORE RESOLVED, by the Common

52
53

Council of the City of Carmel as follows:
1.

The application for economic revitalization area designation relative to the Project

54

was filed in proper form and the Statement of Benefits, Form SB-1, which was filed as of

55

January 28, 2016, is hereby approved by the Council.

56
57
58

2.

The Project Site is located in an area of the City where municipal services are

provided and no additional infrastructure will be necessitated by the Project.
3.

There is evidence provided which establishes that the subject real estate meets

59

with “undesirable for normal development” criterion of Indiana Code 6-1.1-12.1-1 due to the

60

following conditions:

61

a.

The Project Site, while visible from Meridian Street, is accessed from

62

Pennsylvania Street. Challenging access has previously limited the market

63

potential for redevelopment in favor of other better situated locations

64

along the corridor.

65

b.

The proposed reuse of the Project Site as a corporate headquarters for the

66

Company is consistent with the site’s existing zoning and represents a

67

superior use for the Project Site.

68
69
70

4.

Evidence has been submitted and considered which tends to establish that the

71

Project will further and promote municipal development objectives by expansion of the property

72

tax base through the purchase and installation of the Eligible Personal Property.

73

5.

The Council hereby designates the Project Site as an Economic Revitalization

74

Area for purposes of establishing a deduction to the assessed value of Eligible Personal Property

75

acquired and installed within the building located upon the Project Site.

76

6.

The deduction provided by this Resolution shall be for the assessed value of all

77

Eligible Personal Property installed at the Project Site on or prior to January 1, 2022, and for a

78

period of ten (10) years from the date of the first full assessment of the Eligible Personal

79

Property located at the Project Site. The Council hereby finds, declares and determines that

80

deductions from the assessed value of the Eligible Personal Property approved by this Resolution

81

shall be allowed pursuant to the following ten (10) year phase-in deduction schedule, which the

82

Common Council hereby establishes, prescribes and adopts:

In support of the deductions contained in this Resolution, the Council makes the

following FINDINGS:
a. The Project meets the parameters set forth in Council Resolution No. CC-0205-01-02.
b. The estimated cost of the Eligible Personal Property investment presented by
the Company is reasonable for equipment of that type.
c. The estimate of the number of individuals who will be employed or whose

105

employment will be retained by the Company can be reasonably expected to

106

result from the installation of the Eligible Personal Property.

107

d. The annual salaries for the individuals who will be employed or whose

108

employment will be retained by the Company can reasonably be expected to

109

result from the installation of the Eligible Personal Property.

110

e. Based on the increased assessed valuation and the expansion of the

111

employment base within the City of Carmel, the benefits to the City are

112

sufficient to justify the granting of the deduction described in Section 6 above.

113

8.

The deductions provided by this Resolution are subject to the Company’s

114

compliance with the terms of Indiana Code 6-1.1-12.1 and may only be modified or terminated

115

by the City by following the procedures contained in Indiana Code 6-1.1-12.1-5.9.

A copy of this Resolution shall be filed with the Hamilton County Assessor as

required by I.C. 6-1.1-12.1-2.5.
