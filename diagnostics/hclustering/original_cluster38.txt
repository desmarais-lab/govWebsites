PROPOSAL NO. 3, 2009. Councillor Smith reported that the Metropolitan Development
Committee heard Proposal No. 3, 2009 on January 21, 2009. The proposal, sponsored by
Councillor Plowman, reappoints Bradley A. Klopfenstein to the Metropolitan Board of Zoning
Appeals, Division II.
Mr. Elrod said that there are no partisan requirements for appointees to the zoning appeals board.
The Code simply indicates that two must be appointed by the mayor, two by the council and one
by the commission. Councillor Sanders asked if only the Commission is then required to have a
certain partisan makeup, and not the individual zoning boards. Mr. Elrod said that this is correct.
Councillor Mansfield said that she appreciates those serving on the board, but Mr. Klopfenstein’s
record on voting shows that he is putting development in place for development’s sake and is not
supporting existing zoning ordinances. She said that one example of this situation concerns
digital billboards, and she cannot support the appintment.
Councillor Coleman clarified that Libertarians do not vote in the primary elections, and therefore,
Mr. Klopfenstein is acutally registered as a Republican.
Councillor Plowman said that there are a lot of guidelines for members of these boards to follow
and training is required, and Mr. Klopfenstein has attended all of the training required. He added
that Mr. Klopfenstein has attended all meetings but one, and substituted for other board members
on other boards twice. He said that he supports the proposal.
Councillor Hunter said that these appointees represent the Councillors, who in turn represent the
citizens, and it concerns him when such appointees ignore Councillors who wrote them letters.

space and urban-style housing developed with a relatively continuous street wall creating a pedestrianoriented sense of enclosure and place with particular attention given to sidewalks, pedestrian pathways,
parking areas, streetscape, landscape continuity, and lighting; and one for the balance of the area which
facilitates significant employment generators comprised of a diverse mix of light and moderate industrial
uses, some automobile-related commercial activities, and commercial entertainment that are developed

SECTION 3. Chapter 735, Article VII of the “Revised Code of the Consolidated City and County,”
regarding the Special Districts Zoning Ordinances of Marion County, Indiana, hereby is amended by the
addition of the following language, to read as follows:
DIVISION 6. SPEEDWAY DISTRICT REGULATIONS
Sec. 735-760 Speedway District Regulations.

(a)

Statement of Purpose. The purpose and intent of these districts is to ensure that all development of
land in the Speedway Redevelopment Area 1 takes place in accordance with the principles set forth
in the Comprehensive Plan and the Speed Zone Master Plan. The Commission shall prescribe in its
rules of procedure the requirements for an approval petition for site and development plan
consideration which shall be filed. Where the Special Districts Zoning Ordinance directly conflicts
with other portions of the Zoning Ordinance, this code shall prevail; however, no development may
be approved that conflicts with the Comprehensive Plan.

(1) The Speedway Main Street District (SZ-1) is intended to serve as the primary identity for the
Town of Speedway.
The SZ-1 District is designed to permit and facilitate street-level activities focusing on
restaurants, personal services, and shopping while the upper stories provide a diverse range of
office space and urban-style housing. Due to the intensity, traffic generation, nature of
operation, or aesthetics of these uses, industrial uses, automobile service facilities, outside
storage, and other similar uses are prohibited.
The SZ-1 District is designed to permit and facilitate a healthy social and economic
environment for residents and visitors of all ages that is a pedestrian-oriented place with active
street life, healthy retail, as well as common space for community gatherings and racing-

48

January 26, 2009

season activities. All buildings within the SZ-1 District shall contribute to creating a relatively
continuous street wall and create a pedestrian oriented sense of enclosure and place. Building
heights and signs may vary from one property to the next; however a general consistency shall
be retained in order to create a continuous sense of character within the district. Sidewalks,
pedestrian pathways, and parking areas shall give particular attention to streetscape, landscape
continuity, and lighting.

(2) Speedway Industrial District (SZ-2) is designed to permit and facilitate uses that are significant
employment generators.
The SZ-2 District is designed to permit and facilitate a diverse mix of light and moderate
industrial uses, some automobile-related commercial activities, and commercial entertainment.
For illustrative purposes, such uses include wholesale activities, warehouses, manufacturing,
compounding, processing, packaging, assembly, or treatment of finished or semi-finished
products from previously-prepared material, as well as racing, sports and entertainment
operations. Due to the inherent risk, intensity, traffic generation, nature of operation or
aesthetics of these uses, residential uses, and commercial retail and service uses are prohibited.
The SZ-2 District is designed to permit and facilitate development that is entirely enclosed;
strictly adheres to the performance standards; provides sufficient space for current or future
needs for manufacturing and wholesaling or related uses while preserving the aesthetics of the
community; and utilizes sustainable development techniques to both reduce the environmental
impact and increase the intensity of development. In addition to the economic benefits of green
roof construction and the utilization of permeable pavement materials, structures utilizing
these design techniques realize ecological benefits by reducing the impervious surface area on
a site. The SZ-2 District development standards encourage these and other sustainable
construction and development practices.

(b) Permitted Uses in the Speedway Districts.
(1) Permitted Speedway Main Street District SZ-1 uses. All uses permitted within the SZ-1

materials that complement the design of the primary building. Chain-link fencing is
strongly discouraged. Barbed wire and razor wire shall be prohibited.

j.

Sustainability.
The purpose of this section is to promote health, safety, and welfare within the SZ-2
district and its environment by minimizing the harms and maximizing the benefits,
through provisions designed to allow alternatives to the traditional building design and
stormwater management. It is the intent of this section to encourage the use of Best
Management Practices (BMPs) which are structural, vegetative, or managerial practices
designed to treat, prevent, or reduce degradation of water quality due to stormwater
runoff as well as the environmental impacts of building construction. All development
projects subject to review under the requirements of this ordinance shall be designed,

59

Journal of the City-County Council

constructed, and maintained using BMPs to minimize environmental impacts while
maintaining and contributing to the aesthetic values of the project.

1.

Green Roof Construction. None of the building surface area under green roof
construction shall be counted towards the impervious surface cover calculations.

2.

Parking Lot and other surfaced elements. In order to break up or disconnect the flow
of runoff over impervious surfaces, the use of pervious pavement materials is
encouraged and includes, but is not limited to, pervious asphalt, pervious concrete,
grid systems, or block pavers. Surface areas constructed with pervious techniques
and materials, shall not be counted towards the impervious surface cover
calculations.

3.

The Commission may grant an increase in allowable impervious surface coverage
for projects utilizing some or all of the following types of elements of sustainability:
i.

Sustainable Architecture. Sustainable architecture design practice emphasizes
efficiency of heating and cooling systems, alternative energy sources such as
passive solar, appropriate building siting, reused or recycled building
materials, on-site power generation (solar technology, ground source heat
pumps, wind power), rainwater harvesting for gardening and washing, and onsite waste management such as green roofs that filter and control stormwater
runoff.

ii.

Nonstructural Stormwater Management Strategies. To the maximum extent
practicable, the stormwater drainage standards adopted by the Town of
Speedway shall be met by incorporating nonstructural stormwater management
strategies into the site design. The nonstructural stormwater management
strategies incorporated into the site design shall:

(a)

Protect areas that provide water quality benefits or areas particularly
susceptible to erosion and sediment loss;

(b)

Maximize the protection of natural drainage features and vegetation;

(c)

Minimize the decrease in the "time of concentration” from
preconstruction to post construction. "Time of concentration" is defined
as the time it takes for runoff to travel from the hydraulically most distant
point of the watershed to the point of interest within a watershed;

(d)

Minimize land disturbance including clearing and grading;

(e)

Minimize soil compaction;

(f)

Provide low-maintenance landscaping that encourages retention and
planting of native vegetation and minimizes the use of lawns, fertilizers
and pesticides;

(g)

Provide vegetated open-channel conveyance systems discharging into and
through stable vegetated areas.

iii.
Other sustainable strategies or practices that achieve the same intent
outlined above.

Section 4. Section 735-751 of the “Revised Code of the Consolidated City and County,” regarding the
definitions in the Special Districts Zoning Ordinances of Marion County, Indiana, hereby is amended by

SECTION 5. The expressed or implied repeal or amendment by this ordinance of any other ordinance or part
of any other ordinance does not affect any rights or liabilities accrued, penalties incurred, or proceedings
begun prior to the effective date of this ordinance. Those rights, liabilities, and proceedings are continued, and
penalties shall be imposed and enforced under the repealed or amended ordinance as if this ordinance had not

SECTION 6. Should any provision (section, paragraph, sentence, clause, or any other portion) of this
ordinance be declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid for any reason, the remaining
provision or provisions shall not be affected, if and only if such remaining provisions can, without the invalid
provision or provisions, be given the effect intended in adopting this ordinance. To this end, the provisions of
this ordinance are severable.
SECTION 7. This ordinance shall be in effect on January 1, 2009.
The foregoing amending ordinance, 2008-AO-02, to the Special Districts Zoning Ordinance of the
“Revised Code of the Consolidated City and County” of Indianapolis- Marion County, Indiana, was
approved by the affirmative vote of the Metropolitan Development Commission on the 5th day of
November, 2008.

PROPOSAL NO. 605, 2008. Councillor Lutz reported that the Rules and Public Policy
Committee heard Proposal No. 605, 2008 on January 20, 2009. The proposal, sponsored by
Councillors Speedy, Hunter and Plowman, amends the Code regarding possession and discharge
of weapons on property of the department of waterworks. By a 5-2 vote, the Committee reported
the proposal to the Council with the recommendation that it do pass.
Councillor Speedy moved to amend Proposal No. 605, 2008 due to several concerns that he has
had with this proposal. There is only one reservoir owned by Waterworks, and this only pertains
to that reservoir. He said that an issue was raised as to how Veolia functions as a private business
with this new language, but Waterworks has pledged with the CEO of Veolia to allow him to
operate his business like any other. The canal is not a part of the proposal anymore by amending
this language, nor is Eagle Creek, which is owned by the Department of Waterworks. He said
that the proposal was initiated due to the problem of the discharge of firearms for duck hunting on
property Waterworks owns that was causeing damage to private property. The new language
allows residents on one side of the county line to have the same freedoms as those on the other
half. This is a freedom issue for those who obey the law and have legal gun permits, and is not
for criminals, as they will violate whatever is put in place, anyway. Councillor Mansfield
seconded the motion to amend, and Proposal No. 605, 2008 was amended by a voice vote
Councillor Mansfield said that she is glad they decided to amend the proposal, because as
originally submitted, there were many issues created and this addresses those concerns for her.
Councillor McQuillen moved, seconded by Councillor Pfisterer, for adoption. Proposal No. 605,
2008, as amended, was adopted on the following roll call vote; viz:
22 YEAS: Bateman, Brown, Cardwell, Cockrum, Coleman, Day, Evans, Hunter, Lewis,

governing body of the Redevelopment District of the City of Indianapolis, Indiana (the “District”), has

63

Journal of the City-County Council

previously issued the “City of Indianapolis Redevelopment District Subordinate Tax Increment Revenue

WHEREAS, on January 7, 2009, the Commission adopted a Preliminary Bond Resolution
(Resolution No. 09B-001) (the “Preliminary Bond Resolution”) authorizing the issuance of special taxing
district bonds of the District, in one or more series or issues, in an aggregate principal amount not to

that the issuance of the 2009 Bonds should be approved; now therefore:
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CITY-COUNTY COUNCIL OF THE
CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS AND OF MARION COUNTY, INDIANA:
SECTION 1. The City-County Council does hereby approve (i) the Preliminary Bond Resolution, (ii)
the issuance of the 2009 Bonds of the District, in one or more series or issues, in an aggregate principal
amount not to exceed $234,000,000 and with a final maturity not later than February 1, 2030, for the

of this City-County Council.
SECTION 3. This resolution shall be in full force and effect upon adoption and compliance with
Indiana Code §§ 36-3-4-14, 36-3-4-15 and 36-3-4-16.

PROPOSAL NO. 18, 2009. Councillor Vaughn reported that the Public Safety and Criminal
Justice Committee heard Proposal No. 18, 2009 on January 14, 2009. The proposal, sponsored by
Councillor Vaughn, approves crime prevention initiative grant awards to specific organizations as
recommended by the crime prevention advisory board and as approved by the mayor. By an 8-0
vote, the Committee reported the proposal to the Council with the recommendation that it do
pass.
Councillor Brown asked if there is a review process in place for those who are unsuccessful in a
bid so that they can be successful next time. He added that there are issues with regard to the IDI
grant supplementing police work for the downtown district, but because IDI agreed to the youth
component of providing summer jobs for youth, he can support.
Councillor Sanders said that she supports what IDI does as an organization, but for them to pay
for police protection in a downtown area of a major city seems bizarre and seems to be
subsidizing the IMPD budget. This would otherwise be shown as overtime, but they are using
grant dollars to make it appear that police overtime costs are under control. She said that she will
not subterfuget the entire vote because of this one component, but she also feels concerns about
the Marion Superior Court allocation, and believes these grant dollars should be used for

64

January 26, 2009

programs that provide outreach to children and families at risk and ex-offenders to help break the
cycle of crime. At the end of 2008, money was moved from the courts to other budgets because
of excess, yet this allocates more to the agency. While she understands this program relates
directly to teen offenders and their turnaround, it seems to e subsidizing government functions
and this money was intended to go to organizations outside of city government. She said that she
applauds all these entities for their efforts in crime prevention, but regrets that this is an all or
nothing vote, as some of the money seems to be subsidizing government budgets.
Councillor Mansfield said that she supported the increase to help fund crime prevention grants
with an intent to provide tools and resources to children and families at risk and reduce
recidivism. She does agree with previous comments that some of these programs should have
been addressed within government budgets and are not what these grants were intended for. She
said that the council should maybe consider codifying what the intent is for true crime prevention
grants in the future. She said that she supports the proposal as a whole, but feels some of it does
not fulfil the true intent of this grant program.
Councillor Bateman agreed and said that many hands-on programs did not receive funds even
though they had a history and success of working in the community.
Councillor Oliver said that he sits on this board and many long hours are spent deliberating this
process. He said that he does have concerns about small neighborhood organizations going up
against IDI and other large companies to compete for these dollars, as they do not have the same
resources. He said that he supports the proposal because it has some good programs involved, but
he is surprised that IDI would even apply for these types of dollars or accept them.
Councillor Vaughn said that these grant award decisions are made by volunteer members meeting
over 15 times. He said that these individuals are dedicated to do the kind of hard work and
research required and make tough decision. Almost $27 million of requests were received, with
only $5 million in funding. That leaves 80% of those applicants unhappy with the outcome
because they did not receive funds. However, substantial discussion took place and all meetings
were public hearings, and he hopes councillors will honor that evaluation process.
Councillor Brown said that he agrees the committee did a good job, but feels the cost for more
police officers on the street should have been fudned by the COIT increase across the county, and
not just in one area.
Councillor Sanders asked what the time frame is for crime statistics to show whether a program is
successful or producing results in preventing crime. Councillor Vaughn said that he is not sure
when the measuring begins or ends, but the structure of the program is that these organizations
must provide quarterly updates, and they should start seeing results beginning in the third quarter.
Councillor Hunber said that as a matter of Council rules, he wants to disclose that he has a
relationship with the Peace Learning Center, who is receiving some of these dollars. Councillor
Lewis stated that she also serves on the LISK and Bethlehem house boards.
Councillor Malone said that it might be difficult to measure the outcome in the reduction of crime
with some of these programs.
Councillor Vaughn moved, seconded by Councillor Day, for adoption. Proposal No. 18, 2009
was adopted on the following roll call vote; viz:

NEW BUSINESS
Councillor Brown said that he asked for help last meeting to obtain some information he
requested from the Parks Department and still has not received it. President Cockrum said that he
did follow up on this issue and will follow up again.
Councillor Brown asked when Proposal No. 300, 2008 is going to be put on the Public Safety and
Criminal Justice Committee agenda. Councillor Vaughn said that Councillor Brown was charged
with the opportunity to work with Public Safety Director Scott Newman to do the work necessary
to have a hearing on this proposal. He said that there is no sense in putting it on the agenda if
they are not ready to hear it. Councillor Brown said that he is still working with Mr. Newman
and would appreciate it being put on the agenda to be postponed, so that it does not drop off the
calendar.
Councillor Hunter stated that the Public Works Committee was cancelled due to a death in the
family, and with IDEM no longer funding air pollution control, there will be a public hearing in
the Public Assembly Room on Wednesday at 6:30 p.m.to address this issue.

Signage

Much of the content of this document is designed to establish downtown Evansville as a
unique place that is very different from suburban places.

Signage is one component of the

environment that can quickly convey a suburban or urban setting depending on its
design. One of the goals of signage design in the Redevelopment Area is to distinguish
downtown as a place distinctly different from suburbia.

The intent of the signage chapter is to encourage the use of sign forms and materials that
will enhance the visual quality of the Redevelopment Area and help to create an exciting
atmosphere downtown. The guidelines have been developed to promote creativity and
originality within a framework that is intended to help avoid common problems.

Functions
Signage

Sign Functions
Signage serves three primary functions:


To identify a business



To promote merchandise or a service



Flush Mounted Wall Sign

Blade Sign

Projecting Sign

Window Sign

To attract customers inside

When designing and reviewing signs, these
functions should be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed solution.

Signage Types
The seven most common types of signs are:

No

Placement and Size
New signs on historic buildings should be designed
to enhance, yet defer to the building façade. In order
to accomplish this, it is important for the size and
placement of the sign to be influenced by the existng pattern of architectural elements on the building.
The arrangement and size of the windows, the division of the façade and the form of the base of the
building will all suggest logical places for signs. When
developing conceptual alternatives for your sign, determine what the existing façade design is suggesting your sign should look like, and where it should
go.

Applicants are encouraged to review old photos of
their buildings to determine where signage has been
placed historically. Many photos of the buildings
downtown are available for review at Downtown
Evansville, Inc.
The most common locations for signage on historic
buildings were:

Yes
Yes



Under the storefront cornice

Yes



Painted on the storefront glass



On the side of the building



Projecting from the building at the first floor



On the awning valance or return



On the canopy fascia

The existing pattern of architectural elements should be respected
when placing a sign on a historic facade. On this facade, several
appropriate and inappropriate sign locations are designated.



On the roof



Above the first floor

Signs in these locations tend to dominate the façade
when the façade should be the primary feature. In
the reasonably compact confines of the average urban street corridor, signage in these locations is often
more difficult to see anyway.
INAPPROPRIATE: This sign has been placed without regard to the
composition of the facade.

Generally, signage on historic buildings should not
be placed:

Size
Signage

Size
These guidelines do not establish maximum sizes for
signs. Generally speaking, business owners are encouraged to reduce the size of signs to the extent possible. The most common problem related to signage
in any given urban district is that it is too big, too
bold, and too brash. Consider that:

Appropriate placement.

Inappropriate placement.

The overall character of the area will benefit from restraint.
The entire building is a sign. The appearance of the
building can be more effective advertising than the
sign itself.
A general guideline for size is that the total surface
area of all signs on a building occupies no more than 15%
of the building façade.

City of Evansville Downtown Development & Design Guidelines

For window signs, the sign should allow a minimum
of 80% visibility through the window.

136

Window signs smaller than 1 foot square will not be
subject to review and approval by the Design Review
Committee. Window signs larger than 1 foot square
will be subject to review.

Appropriate placement.

Inappropriate placement.

Lighting
Signage

Lighting
There are generally two ways of illuminating signs –
directly, or indirectly. Directly-lit signs have the light
source contained within the sign. Indirectly-lit signs
are illuminated with an external light source. Please
note that indirect lighting should always be directed downward and not upward.

ENCOURAGED: Indirectly-lighted sign.



The scale and form of directly-illuminated
signs are generally not preferred. (Direct illumination is often achieved with fluorescent tubes
contained within a metal panel. The space requirements for the tubes and electrical components tend
to drive the width and shape of the panel as opposed to letting the design concept and business
identity drive the form.)



Indirect light fixtures are more accessible
and therefore easier to replace than internally-mounted tubes.



Indirect lighting is more consistent with the
way that signage was illuminated historically, and much of the Redevelopment Area
is within a historic district.



Indirect lighting is more urban in character
than internally illuminated signage.



Indirect lighting tends to suggest a more
human scale.



Specific design features of signs can be highlighted with spot-lighting.



More creative sign forms can be achieved
when the limitations imposed by internal
illumination do not need to be considered.

ENCOURAGED: Indirectly lighted sign.

DISCOURAGED: Directly illuminated sign.

©2003 RATIO Architects, Inc.

City of Evansville Downtown Development & Design Guidelines

In the Redevelopment Area, indirect lighting is the
preferred method of illuminating signs for the following reasons:

137

Neon
Signage

ENCOURAGED: The panels that the neon have been placed on in
this example relate to the neon forms. The sign would be less
successful if the tubes delineating the face had been placed on a
rectangular panel.

City of Evansville Downtown Development & Design Guidelines

ENCOURAGED:
more “urban.”

138

Highlighting the inside of channel letters feels

ENCOURAGED: Neon can be effective when used to compose words
and phrases.

ENCOURAGED: In this example, the neon becomes part of an overall
sculptural composition. It would have been less successful if the neon
forms had been composed on a large rectangular background.

Neon
Neon is often associated with the energy and vitality that is desired in healthy urban
districts. It is a common lighting device in urban areas, and was historically used abundantly in downtown Evansville. Neon is allowed, but it should be used with the following guidelines in mind. Neon is most effective when it is used to:


Spell words



Highlight the outline of sculptural sign forms



Internally illuminate channel letters



“Halo light” channel letters



Create graphics on a background

It is less effective when the neon is used to create graphics on a square, flat surface that is
otherwise not contributing to the composition of the graphic elements.

Sign Examples - Preferred
Signage

The following signs are all examples of
preferred sign styles for the Redevelopment
Area. Each is accompanied by an analysis
that explains why they are successful signs.
This section is followed with one that analyzes
discouraged sign styles.

Analysis:
The sign has a simple three-tone color scheme. It
makes use of a graphic to convey the service offered,
with just a minimum amount of text below. It is
mounted at a height that gets it out of the way of
pedestrian traffic. The connections between the sign
elements have been well-concieved and are derived
from the the overall form. The connection to the
building is handled sensitively and cleanly with components that are painted the same color as the body
of the sign. Finally, the sign is indirectly illuminated.

Analysis:
The connection to the building is substantial and
feels permanant. The way the lettering escaped from
the confines of the circular form creates a more interesting composition. The color scheme is simple
and composed of just three tones. There is a minimum of text. The letters are formed of internally
illuminated open-faced channels instead of plasticfaced channels.

The fact that the text is not confined to the circular form makes the
composition fun and exciting. The message is simple, and the color
scheme is limited to three colors.

©2003 RATIO Architects, Inc.

City of Evansville Downtown Development & Design Guidelines

Good composition, indirect illumination, high quality fabrication, welldetailed connection to building, simple message, good use of graphic
elements.

139

Sign Examples - Preferred
Signage

Analysis:
The text is kept to a minimum and again the color
scheme is composed of only three colors. The width
of the panel is substantial and suggests permanence
and stability. The raised letters in the middle suggest a higher quality than if they had just been
painted on. The sign is indirectly illuminated. The
criticism would be that the connection to the building is not consistent with the level of quality of the
sign. The conduit and junciton box servicing the
lighting could also have been handled more sensitively by pulling it from the second story and painting it to blend in with the brick.

City of Evansville Downtown Development & Design Guidelines

Sign is great, but the connection to the buiding and the electrical
service components could use work.

140

Analysis:
This is a nice use of neon on a simple form. The
message is concise. Note the absence of an address,
web site, phone number and other information that
just isn’t critical to bringing pedestrians to the restaurant. The connection to the building on this one
has not been given the same attention as the sign.
The mounting arm does not complement the sign
form, and the cables feel like an afterthought. Note
that the conduit serving the sign has been painted
to match the brick.
Another simple form with a concise message, but the connection to
the building could be improved.

©2003 RATIO Architects, Inc.

Sign Examples - Preferred
Signage

Analysis:
Awning signs don’t have to be painted onto the awning. Individually cut letters mounted on a glass
and steel awning strongly suggest an urban setting.
The thickness of the letters is also an important part
of the success of the sign. If they had been thinner,
it would not have looked as substantial and would
have felt temporary.

Individual letters suggest an urban setting.

Analysis:
This is an excellent hanging sign. The entire sign
has been conceived as a cohesive sculptural form.
Colors are simple and kept to a four-tone pallette.
The message is concise and includes a nice graphic.
The style and color of the bracket is consistent with
the sign. It is indirectly illuminated, and placed sensitively on the building. Note that the hanging sign
is part of an overall identity created with the transom panel signage and the sign just below the first
floor cornice.

Analysis:
The scale of the mounting plate is substantial and
suggests permanance and stability. The message is
simple, there are four colors, and the bracket and
sign have been conceived as one complete form. The
level of detail in the bracket and connections is excellent and conveys an appreciation for high quality
construction. This hanging sign is mounted on the
first floor, but high enough to be out of the pedestrian flow.

The character and quality of this sign is consistant with the building
facade.

©2003 RATIO Architects, Inc.

City of Evansville Downtown Development & Design Guidelines

The entire sign has been conceived as a cohesive sculptural form.

141

Sign Examples - Preferred
Signage

Analysis:
Another good example of the use of neon to profile
the text on this blade sign. The three forms have
been arranged to provide an overall balance, and
there is nice hierarchy of information. The scale of
the sign is appropriate for the location. Color pallette
is limited to four colors. There is a high contrast between the letters and the background, making the
text clearly legible. A criticism would be the way
that the cables have been added to stabilize the sign,
and the fact that the conduit serving the neon has
not been painted to match the brick.

City of Evansville Downtown Development & Design Guidelines

Good form, balance and message. The cables and conduit could
be improved.

142

Analysis:
One of a series of hanging signs advertising various
services in a market. Note how the bracket responds
to the implied curve of the top of the flower element,
resulting in a unified composition. The bracket is
heavy, suggesting permanence, durability and high
quality. It is mounted out of the way of pedestrians.
Note that there is no text on this sign, but it is clear
that there is a florist inside.

No text, but it is clear from this eye-catching sign that a florist is
inside. This is a wonderful addition to the urban environment.

©2003 RATIO Architects, Inc.

Sign Examples - Preferred
Signage

Analysis:
A nice awning sign that is more successful due to
the combination of the angled awning with the barrel-vaulted form. The added rain protection for the
pedestrian is a nice benefit. Simple message and
color scheme. The awning has been placed nicely
within the space between the columns and complements the overall facade design as a result. Indirect
lighting on the awning fabric as shown here is preferred over internally illuminated awnings.

Analysis:
This sign scored highest in the the visual preference
survey that was a part of the public input process for
the guidelines. It goes a long way toward creating a
high-energy entertainment district aesthetic. These
kinds of signs can be icons for a district, but should
be used sparingly and with an understanding of how
it will be perceived in the viewshed. In this example,
the scale of the building is such that the size of the
sign does not seem outrageous. The existing notch
in the corner of the historic building actually provides a nice alcove to receive the sign. It should also
be noted that there is not another sign of this scale
within view. Applicants interested in receiving approval for a sign of this scale should be aware that,
while not necessarily discouraged, it would receive a
great deal of scrutiny by the Design Review Committee.

A sign of this scale would reveive a great deal of scrutiny from the
Design Review Commitee.

©2003 RATIO Architects, Inc.

City of Evansville Downtown Development & Design Guidelines

Awnings create a human scaled sidewalk space, and provide
protection from the rain.

143

Sign Examples - Preferred
Signage

Analysis:
Another hanging sign that successfully communicates the services of the store with an eye-catching
sculptural form. The bracket is painted to match the
sign frame and is shaped to complement the sign
profile. The connections to the building are substantial and considerate of the historic materials Very
simple message and color scheme.

A great use of a sculptural element to convey the services offered.

Analysis:
The open channeled letters with neon internal illumination feel more urban than letters with a plastic
face over the channel. This sign is mounted above
the awning and below the first floor cornice, where
signage historically would have occured.

City of Evansville Downtown Development & Design Guidelines

Open-faced channel letters with internal illumination: more urban
than plastic faced.

144

Analysis:
A companion to the image on page 10. Included to
show how a series of signs of differing but complementary forms can be parts of a whole. The quality
of construction, level of detail, mounting height and
intent to communicate without words connects the
signs aesthetically.

The forms convey the service offered without words.

©2003 RATIO Architects, Inc.

Sign Examples - Preferred
Signage

Analysis:
The use of individual letters mounted to the transom panel over storefront windows is a very nice,
historically appropriate way of handling signage on
an older building. The indirect illumination is another nice touch. Imagine the difference if the text
had been laminated onto a flat plastic panel and directly illuminated from behind.

Historically-appropriate sign material, location and method of
illumination.

Analysis:
Another good example of internally illuminated
open-faced channel letters placed in the historicallycorrect location on the facade. The indirect lighting
of the awning is also preferred over internally-illuminated awnings.

Analysis:
In the Redevelopment Area, this sign would be more
successful as a hanging sign, but it is included here
to demonstrate the appeal of bolder colors, the raised
letters and the hat as a sculptural element that is
not contained within the boundary of the ellipse.
All of these qualities make this sign successful,
though a more urban approach would have been to
hang the sign from the building.

Raised letters, bold colors and the playful form relate to the services
offered.

©2003 RATIO Architects, Inc.

City of Evansville Downtown Development & Design Guidelines

Open-faced channel letters: more urban, less suburban than plastic
faced.

145

Sign Examples - Preferred
Signage

Analysis:
A good example of an appropriate hanging sign for
a historic building. Note that it is mounted at the
top of a pilaster, a location that feels decisive and
more appropriate than a random location on a lintel. The sign has been placed at the first floor, but
out of the pedestrian flow. The decorative bracket
that responds to the sign form is well-done. An
improvement might have been to raise either the
lettering or the mouth graphic.

City of Evansville Downtown Development & Design Guidelines

This sign is placed in a logical location on the historic facade.

146

Analysis:
Note that on this blade sign, the area of red backup
metal panel has been reduced to only that necessary
to support the letters. It seems logical, but the designer likely perceived that the letters would look
disproportionate if the background was any larger
than it is. The rounded top and bottom of the sign
is a soft detail that makes the shape a little more
appealing than it would otherwise be. Simple, highcontrast colors and a minimum of text also contribute to the sign’s success. Like the guitar sign on
page 143, a proposal for a sign of this scale will receive greater scrutiny by the Redevelopment Commission due to the visual impact.

Open channel letters, the strong connection to the building, hidden
electrical service and a simple color scheme contribute to the success
of this blade sign.

Sign Examples - Discouraged
Signage

The following signs are all discouraged for use
in the Redevelopment Area:

This sign could be improved by changing the panel to wood, simplifying
the message, and mounting it on a masonry base.

Analysis:
This is another directly illuminated, plastic faced
cabinet sign. It lacks the creative expression sought
in the Redevelopment Area, has more information
than necessary and is composed of drab, dull colors.
It should be considered too suburban in character.
A preferred style would be to change the metal cabinet to a sandblasted wood or simple cut stone panel,
set the panel on a masonry base, and light it indirectly. Pole signs, billboards and free-standing signs
are strongly discouraged in the Redevelopment Area.

Analysis:
Plastic-faced channel letters such as these are discouraged in the Redevelopment Area. While they
are not particularly un-attractive, they tend to suggest a more suburban aesthetic. A preferred style
would be open-faced channels with internal neon
lighting, halo-lit channel letters, or letters cut from
a sheet like the Borders signage at the top of page
141.

Directly illuminated plastic faced channel letters like these are
discouraged.

©2003 RATIO Architects, Inc.

City of Evansville Downtown Development & Design Guidelines

A directly-lighted sign. The style and placement are discouraged in
the Redevelopment Area.

Analysis:
The placement and style of this sign are both discouraged in the Redevelopment Area. It is a directly
illuminated plastic faced metal cabinet sign. The
sign does not occur in an appropriate location on the
building, and by partially covering the top of the
windows does not respond to the lines and proportions of the historic facade. This is a good example
of why directly-illuminated signage is discouraged
in the Redevelopment Area. The need to accomodate
flourescent tubes within the panel tends to result in
uninspiring forms that can be difficult to make work
on historic facades.

147

Sign Examples - Discouraged
Signage

Analysis:
These plastic faced letters tend to be the prevalent
style in suburban strip mall signing. They have been
designed to be visible from across large expanses of
parking and/or the closest major thoroughfare. This
style is not appropriate for the Redevelopment Area.

Typical suburban strip mall signing like this is discouraged in the
Redevelopment Area.

City of Evansville Downtown Development & Design Guidelines

Analysis:
Temporary signs tend to suggest a lack of commercial solvency. They convey the impression that a district is on it’s last legs, and they just look bad. The
temporary nature of the sign, the lack of appropriate
stabilization, lack of maintenance and the poor craftsmanship are strongly discouraged.

148

In the Redevelopment Area, this type of temporary signage is
strongly discouraged.

©2003 RATIO Architects, Inc.

Sign Examples - Discouraged
Signage

Analysis:
These handlettered paper notices taped to the windows detract from what is otherwise a nicely detailed storefront. This kind of temporary signage is
discouraged.

Avoid handlettered paper notices taped to the windows.

Analysis:
The awning is sized to be viewed from an interstate.
It would be considered far too big for the Redevelopment Area. The plastic awning material is also
discouraged. The suggested improvement would be
to substantially reduce the size of the sign and place
it above the main entrance. The awning material
could be changed to treated canvas, and the shape
of the awning would be more appealing as a mansard form like the Maggiano’s awning on page 143.

Analysis:
This sign would be discouraged because of the poor
graphic quality and the poor craftsmanship. Sidewalk menu boards can be attractive, attention getting tools, but they must be as carefully considered
as permanent signage. A better answer would be a
simple a-framed folding chalkboard with stainless
steel hardware to prevent rusting. Check with your
insurance carrier to make sure you understand the
risks associated with having a sign in the public rightof-way.
A nicer answer would be a folding black chalkboard-style menu board.

©2003 RATIO Architects, Inc.

City of Evansville Downtown Development & Design Guidelines

This awning would be considered far too large for use in the
Redevelopment Area.

149

Sign Examples - Discouraged
Signage

Analysis:
Temporary signs like this are discouraged for use any
longer than the bare minimum time needed to fabricate and install the permanent sign. Be sure to
check the zoning ordinance for specifics on allowed
amount of time temporary signs can be up. The
sooner these kinds of signs can go away, the more
financially stable the district will appear, and the
more attractive the space will be.

Temporary vinyl signs are discouraged beyond brief use prior to the
fabrication of permanent signage.

Analysis:
Another example of a directly-illuminated plastic
faced metal cabinet sign. The message on this sign
is also somewhat confusing...what is the name of
the business and how does the “C” logo relate? Compare this to the preferred examples shown on other
pages that reduce the text to the bare minimum.

City of Evansville Downtown Development & Design Guidelines

The style of the sign is discouraged. The text message is somewhat
confusing and demostrates the importance of carefully considering
the layout and graphics.

150

Analysis:
Here is a combination of several discouraged styles:
a plastic faced cabinet, too much information, plastic awning with direct lighting and a general lack of
sensivity to the historic facade. It’s not necessarily
the use that’s the problem - see the bonding company preferred example at the top of page 145.

Lots of discouraged practices conspire to make this an unpleasant
collage of forms and information.

©2003 RATIO Architects, Inc.

Sign Examples - Discouraged
Signage

Analysis:
Another example of directly-illuminated plastic faced
letters, that while reasonably attractive, do not convey the urban quality of some of the other preferred
letter styles (see pages 141, 144 and 145).

More suburban than urban.

Analysis:
The sign has been mounted to the building in a manner that completely disregards the design of the historic facade. It is larger than necessary and overdominates the viewshed. The building has become
completely subordinate to the sign.

Analysis:
This is an example of a sign with too much information on it, resulting in a cluttered, busy look. If someone is walking to this business, they probably don’t
need to know the phone number and web address.
If someone is driving by, they don’t have the time to
write this information down. The layout makes it
difficult to know what the most important piece of
information is. Simplify the message to the bare
minimum necessary as shown on some of the examples from the preferred section.
Too much information.

©2003 RATIO Architects, Inc.

City of Evansville Downtown Development & Design Guidelines

An over-dominating sign that could have been handled more
sensitively.

ENCOURAGED: Bold colors, simple text.

ENCOURAGED: Street signs can be an effective way to indicate to
a visitor that they are within a district.

ENCOURAGED:
actual City plan.

DISCOURAGED: This sign is mounted on a light post at a height of
ten feet, yet the text size and graphic have been developed as if it
would be placed at eye level. Wayfinding must be designed and
installed with an understanding of where the user will be recieving the
information (i.e., from the car or on foot).

Mapping should be a simplified version of the

Wayfinding
A desire for an improved wayfinding system was identified both in the Downtown
Master Plan of 2001 and through the public input process that shaped this document. These guidelines do not establish a specific wayfinding signage design, but
some general observations are included here to guide the development of one in
the future. First, many of the issues related to quality sign design pertain to
wayfinding systems as well: provide a minimum amount of information on each
sign, present it logically, use fonts and graphic elements that are easy to read, and
place so that the view of the sign is not obstructed by other elements. Signage
should be located ahead of where turns need to be made, and the overall system
must be cohesive. Above all, it is important to have the system created by a designer well experienced in the creation of systems for urban environments.

Preservation

The City encourages the preservation of the existing historic buildings within the Redevelopment Area. Preservation of many buildings in the Redevelopment Area is strongly encouraged through their inclusion in the Downtown Historic District. There are also environmental
benefits, cultural reasons and urban massing considerations that all support the preservation
and rehabilitation of contributing existing buildings in our City.

The intent of this chapter is to draw

special attention to the unique theories and

practices governing the manner in which buildings and cultural landscapes are
preserved, rehabilitated or restored.

Historic District
Preservation

The Evansville Downtown Historic District.

City of Evansville Downtown Development & Design Guidelines

The Evansville Downtown Historic District makes up a portion of the Redevelopment
Area that comprises the jurisdiction of these guidelines. The District was placed on the
National Register of Historic Places and the Indiana Register of Historic Sites and Structures in March of 2000.

14

This listing provides valuable state and federal economic incentives (grants and tax credits)
that owners of historic properties downtown can take advantage of that can make the
job of preserving, rehabilitating or restoring a building a little easier.
The Downtown Historic District contains many different properties. Chances are that if
you own a building within the area shown above, you are eligible to apply for these tax
credits, grants or special low interest loans (the low interest loans are available from
Historic Landmarks Foundation of Indiana). To find out if the building you own is eligible for these benefits, contact the City’s Historic Preservation Officer with the Department of Metropolitan Development at 812-436-7823, the Indiana Division of Historic
Preservation and Archaeology at 317-232-1646, or the Historic Landmarks Foundation
of Indiana at 317-639-4534.

Treatment Approaches
Preservation

Before any further discussion of preservation issues, it is important to know that there
are Standards for four distinct, but interrelated, approaches to the treatment of historic
properties — preservation, rehabilitation, restoration, and reconstruction.

“Preservation” means the act or process of applying measures to sustain the existing
form, integrity and materials of an historic property. Work, including preliminary measures to protect and stabilize the property, generally focuses upon the ongoing maintenance and repair of historic materials and features rather than extensive replacement
and new construction. New exterior additions are not within the scope of this treatment; however, the limited and sensitive upgrading of mechanical, electrical, and plumbing
systems and other code-required work to make properties functional is appropriate within
a preservation project.

”Rehabilitation” means the act or process of making possible a compatible use for a
property through repair, alterations, and additions while preserving those portions or
features which convey its historical, cultural, or architectural values.

“Reconstruction” means the act or process of depicting, by means of new construction,
the form, features, and detailing of a non-surviving site, landscape, building, structure,
or object for the purpose of replicating its appearance at a specific period of time and in its
historic location.

The majority of the alterations to historic structures in the Redevelopment Area will
likely fall under the “Rehabilitation” category. As such, these guidelines focus on that
treatment.

©2003 RATIO Architects, Inc.

City of Evansville Downtown Development & Design Guidelines

”Restoration” means the act or process of accurately depicting the form, features, and
character of a property as it appeared at a particular period of time by means of the
removal of features from other periods in its history and reconstruction of missing features from the restoration period. The limited and sensitive upgrading of mechanical,
electrical, and plumbing systems and other code-required work to make properties functional is appropriate within a restoration project.

15

Rehabilitation Standards
Preservation

Rehabilitation Standards
In order to be eligible for the use of tax credits, grants
or special low interest loans available through other
funding sources, rehabilitation projects must comply
with the Secretary of the Interior’s “Standards for
Rehabilitation,” listed on the opposite page.
The Standards are ten basic principles created to help
preserve the distinctive character of a historic building and its site, while allowing for reasonable change
to meet compatible new uses.

DISCOURAGED: An infill project that disregards the historic
proportions and relationships of windows and masonry that are present
nearby.

The Standards apply to historic buildings of all periods, styles, types, materials, and sizes. They apply to
both the exterior and the interior of historic buildings. The Standards also encompass related landscape features and the building’s site and environment as well as attached, adjacent, or related new
construction. The Standards are applied to projects
in a reasonable manner, taking into consideration
economic and technical feasibility.

City of Evansville Downtown Development & Design Guidelines

ENCOURAGED: This is a good example of an addition to an existing
building that is clearly contemporary, yet respectful of the lines, design
relationships and proportions of the original structure.

16

rehabilitation standards may contact the Technical Preservation Services of the National Park
Service at: (202) - 513 - 7270.

Definitions
Preservation

The Secretary of the Interior’s
“Standards for Rehabilitation”:
1. A property shall be used for its historic purpose or
be placed in a new use that requires minimal change
to the defining characteristics of the building and its site
and environment.
2. The historic character of a property shall be
retained and preserved. The removal of historic
materials or alteration of features and spaces that
characterize a property shall be avoided.

Another example of an expansion to an existing historic structure that
respects the original, yet is clearly a new piece. The original historic
building is to the right of the glass connector.

3. Each property shall be recognized as a physical
record of its time, place, and use. Changes that create
a false sense of historical development, such as adding
conjectural features or architectural elements from other
buildings, shall not be undertaken.
4. Most properties change over time; those changes
that have acquired historic significance in their own right
shall be retained and preserved.
5. Distinctive features, finishes, and construction
techniques or examples of craftsmanship that
characterize a historic property shall be preserved.
6. Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather
than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration
requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new
feature shall match the old in design, color, texture,
and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials.
Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated
by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence.
7. Chemical or physical treatments, such as
sandblasting, that cause damage to historic materials
shall not be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if
appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest
means possible.
8. Significant archeological resources affected by a
project shall be protected and preserved. If such
resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall
be undertaken.
9. New additions, exterior alterations, or related new
construction shall not destroy historic materials that
characterize the property. The new work shall be
differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with
the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to
protect the historic integrity of the property and its
environment.

10. New additions and adjacent or related new
construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that
if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity
of the historic property and its environment would be
unimpaired.

Know The Terms!
When discussing rehabilitation projects, it is important to know the terms for
the different elements that make up the facade of a historic building:

Cornice

City of Evansville Downtown Development & Design Guidelines

The cornice provides a “visual
termination” to the building.
Cornice materials might be
sculpted wood, brick, stone,
pressed metal or terra-cotta.

22

Lintel

Sash

Upper Facade

Window Mullion

The upper facade typically has
several identical windows
arranged in even horizontal
rows. Windows still make up
the majority of the facade.

Window Sill
Decorative Cornice
(Sometimes includes a sign
panel)
Transom

Storefront

Typically 80-90% transparent.
Structural beam spans the
opening supporting the upper
facade. This is sometimes
exposed, and sometimes
hidden with the decorative
cornice.

Display Window
Pilaster
Recessed Double
Doors
Kickplate or Bulkhead

Common Problems
Preservation

The Most Common Problems
Several practices were widespread enough that the
National Trust has published them as the six most
common design problems in downtowns:
Slipcovers
Perhaps the most obvious attempt to make downtowns
look like malls, “slipcovers” were usually metal or exterior
insulation panels placed over existing facades to create
one massive cohesive appearance. Simply put, this
shouldn’t be done anymore.
A typical “slipcover” application. It seemed like a good idea at the
time.

False Historical Themes
Attempts have been made time and again to try and create
interest in buildings or streetscapes by assigning them a
time period and basing improvement efforts on that theme.
Buildings and sites should be restored to the period of
significance for that building or place.

Separating the Ground Floor From
The Upper Facade
Though it was done with the best of intentions, our metal
canopy on Main Street is a good example of this common
problem. Many communities installed large contemporary
awnings and canopies at the first floor level to provide
comfort for pedestrians. We know now that historic facades
are meant to be appreciated as a single composition.

Filling in Display Windows, Transom Windows
and Doors
Filled in windows result in fewer “eyes on the street,” remove important
details from the facade, and allow less ambient light from the building
to illuminate the sidewalks.

No matter how tempting it may be to fill in existing
openings, it shouldn’t be done. The pattern of openings
in a facade is a critical component of the building design.
Filling in these spaces creates a monolithic street
environment and feels much less safe than transparent
windows. Tinting windows has nearly the same effect as
filling them in, and should also be avoided.
Sometimes, one paint color may be used for the facade
as well as the architectural trim, making it difficult to see
detail around windows, doors and the cornice. Other
times, bold colors are used that make a building standout
more than it should. Those undertaking rehabilitation
efforts are encourage to consult a preservation specialist
who can help identify appropriate palettes. One good
source of information for paint palettes is the Society For
The Preservation of New England Antiquities: http://
www.spnea.org/

Using Inappropriate Materials
A scene from a typical American downtown that experienced
“improvements” in the ‘50’s, ‘60’s and ‘70’s. In this one view, you
can appreciate the negative effect of wood shutters, plastic awnings,
wood shakes (on the canopy at right) and exterior insulation finishing
systems.

©2003 RATIO Architects, Inc.

Materials like cedar shakes, molded stone, rough-cut logs,
exterior insulation finishing systems, stained wood, and
thin set veneers should not be used to cover up existing
masonry or window openings.

Funding Sources
Preservation

Funding Sources
The following section describes in brief the most common funding sources for historic preservation projects. Schedules and general requirements for acquiring the funds should be confirmed with the funding agency as these items
tend to change from year to year. This is a very simple overview; the process of obtaining loans and tax credits can be
complicated, and space does not permit a detailed descrption of each opportunity. Contact the agencies listed or the
City’s Preservation Officer at 812-436-7823 for further information. Please note that not all grants and funds
are for privately-owned properties.

Indiana Division of Historic Preservation & Archaeology (DHPA)
Historic Preservation Fund (HPF) - Local governments and non-profit organizations can apply to the Division for
financial assistance to maintain, restore, and document historic properties. The Division, through the State Historic
Preservation Review Board, awards matching grants of federal funding each January. Some of the types of projects
funded in the past include:



Inventories of archaeological sites, historic buildings, or old structures such as bridges.



Acquisition and rehabilitation of public or non-profit owned historic buildings.



Preparing National Register nominations for historic districts.



Educational programs, such as conferences, special events, or research projects.

Amounts available for repairs and other projects vary. Typically, the DHPA can match 50-50 with projects costing
from $4,000 to $30,000. The Division makes grant applications available in July-August and complete applications
are due in October. The Indiana Historic Preservation Review Board makes the final award of grant funds based on
staff recommendations at their January meeting annually. For exact dates, and to obtain an application form,
contact the DHPA office (317/232-1646)

City of Evansville Downtown Development & Design Guidelines

Certified Local Government Grant Program (CLG) – This program is available only to the local governments
designated by the DHPA as having certified local preservation planning programs. A CLG is a city or town that has
decided to have an intensive local preservation program that enacts a special historic preservation ordinance, enforces that ordinance through a local preservation commission and meets minimum standards for CLG’s as determined by the DHPA.

24

A financial benefit of becoming a CLG is a special pool of competitive grant funds from federal allocations to the
DHPA. At least 10% of the federal allocation goes to the CLG program every year. The CLG grants are awarded for
survey work, planning and for education.

Downtown Revitalization Fund
The Downtown Revitalization Fund provides low interest loans for the rehabilitation of existing structures located in
the Downtown Redevelopment Area. Loan proceeds may be used to make improvements to existing buildings,
including facades. Loan proceeds are also available for acquisition, provided the use of funds includes the rehab or
renovation of the building. The Economic Development Loan Committee will evaluate all loan requests. The Department of Metropolitan Development (812-436-7823) provides staff support for the Economic Development Loan
Committee.

Funding Sources
Preservation

Historic Landmarks Foundation of Indiana (HLFI)

Statewide Revolving Loan Fund – Non-profit preservation organizations outside Marion County can borrow
money from this fund to purchase and restore historic properties. The agreement signed when one of these buildings is resold must contain covenants that will protect the building’s future. These low-interest loans generally must
be matched with local funding.
Indiana Preservation Grants Fund – Community preservation groups can apply to HLFI for matching grants for a
variety of uses, including conducting membership drives, producing promotional materials, and paying fees for
architectural or preservation consulting. The money from this fund may not be used to fund actual construction.
Guaranteed Loan Program – This program aids organizations that are having trouble getting conventional financing for a restoration project. In special cases, HLFI will place funds in a local lending institution to guarantee a loan
taken by a community preservation group or to help that group acquire long-term mortgage commitments or construction financing
Local Leadership Challenge Grant - $60,000 challenge grant from HLFI to fund a full-time professional staff. You
must match this amount with $40,000 for a total of $100,000 over a three-year period. Contact the HLFI Regional
Director for an application and preliminary discussion.

Indiana Department of Commerce (IDOC)
Tourism Information Promotion Fund (TIPF) - Administered by the IDOC’s Tourism Development Division, the
TIPF is a 1:1 matching cash grant program that provides reimbursable funding assistance to not-for-profit organizations in the areas of tourism marketing and research. This grant has two fundamental goals:



To act as seed money in funding a new promotional and/or research project.



To increase tourism visitation in the applying organization’s county and the State of Indiana.

Deadlines for completed applications and supportive data are June 15 and November 15. All materials must be
received in the Indiana Tourism Office by the close of business of the deadline date (or the next business day, if the
deadline falls on a weekend or holiday) to be eligible for consideration. $300,000 is available for disbursement on an
annual basis ($150,000 per cycle.)
All applicants must be an incorporated not-for-profit in good standing with the Indiana Secretary of State’s Office by
the time the application is due. Listed below are the types of projects that have been funded in the past. The TIPF is
not limited to these projects, however, other kinds of projects should be discussed with a member of the Tourism
Development Division prior to application.

Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT)
Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) – Signed into law in June of 1998, TEA-21 offers a six-year,
well-funded opportunity to achieve a wide variety of transportation-related historic preservation objectives. The
new law specifically enumerates historic preservation projects as an eligible activity for funding as transportation
enhancements if they meet the test of being part of a surface transportation project or being in the area served by a
project and related to surface transportation. Contact INDOT for details and application instructions.

Indiana Housing Finance Authority (IHFA)
Rental Housing Tax Credits (RHTC) - Rental housing tax credits are federal tax credits, which are competitively
allocated to for-profit and not-for-profit developers of affordable rental housing. RHTCs provide access to equity
capital, and demand for tax credits runs about four times higher than available resources.

National Trust for Historic Preservation (NTHP)
National Preservation Loan Fund – This program provides below-market rate loans of up to $150,000 to non-profit
organizations and public agencies to help preserve properties listed in or eligible for the National Register of Historic
Places. Funds may be used to create or expand local and statewide preservation revolving funds, for site acquisition,
or rehabilitation work. This year priority will be given to projects that (1) increases the capacity of state and local
preservation organizations, (2) assists properties damaged in natural disasters and (3) are included in the National
Trusts’ list of 11 Most Endangered Historic Places.
Preservation Services Fund – This program provides matching grants ranging from $500 to $5,000 to non-profit
organizations, universities and public agencies to initiate preservation projects. Funds may be used to support
consultants with professional expertise in areas such as architecture, law, planning, economics, and graphic design;
conferences that address subjects of architectural importance to historic preservation; and curriculum development
in preservation directed toward select audiences.

Federal Tax Credits
The Department of the Interior and the Department of the Treasury jointly administer a program offering tax credits
equal to a percentage of the money spent on a certified rehabilitation project for a certified historic property. For a rehabilitation project, the credit is 20%. There is also a 10% credit offered for rehabilitation of non-historic structures built before
1936. This is an excellent and much-used program. However, the process is complex and will likely require the
services of a preservation architect, accountant and tax attorney. See http://www2.cr.nps.gov/tps/tax/brochure1.htm
for detailed information.

State Tax Credits

26

Modelled on the federal program, the state program allows a taxpayer to take a state income tax credit for 20% of the
total qualified rehabilitation or preservation cost of a project, up to $100,000 per project. The program is administered
by the Division of Historic Preservation and Archeology, Indiana Department of Natural Resources (DHPA). For
futher information and specific requirements, contact DHPA at 317-232-1646.

Design Incentive Grant
The Design Incentive Grant is a facade and sign improvement program of Downtown Evansville, Inc (DEI). Applicants must submit an application (available at DEI) and color photos of the facade/sign to the Design Review Committee and explain the change they wish to make. Applicants must be members of DEI, and have passed Design
Review as well as the Redevelopment Commission for approval. The funds available consist of $1,000 maximum per
facade ($2000 if the building is on a corner)or $500 per sign. Matching funds are also available, with a minimum of
$1 matched per $1 of private funds spent.

Property Values in Indiana

Donovan D. Rypkema

Historic Landmarks Foundation of Indiana
Indianapolis

P R E F A C E
Historic Landmarks Foundation of Indiana has advocated local historic districts
as a method of revitalizing
and protecting landmark
neighborhoods for more than
30 years. Time enough to
develop a measurable track
record, and to evaluate the
bottom line.
We believed local district
designation was making a
difference because we could
see the positive changes.
Take Lockerbie Square in
Indianapolis, for example.
In 1974, boarded and dilapidated houses and unsightly
vacant lots dominated the
area around the preserved
museum home of James
Whitcomb Riley. Today,
Lockerbie is a charming restored neighborhood and a
highly desirable downtown
address where property
owners must receive prior
approval from the Indianapolis Historic Preservation
Commission for exterior
rehabilitation, new construction, and demolition. Virtually every house has been
restored, and nearly every
vacant lot filled by a new
home.
We concede that Lockerbie
had some early advantages,
not least of which was Historic Landmarks’ dramatic
transformation of a key property and a revolving fund we
operated there which caused
the timely restoration of
many houses. In an average
district, we wondered, what
hath local designation
wrought? Does the visual
and economic improvement
exist only in the eyes and
minds of preservationists?

I N T R O D U C T I O N
Historic Landmarks Foundation decided property values provided one concrete
measure of the effect of local
historic districts. To quantify
the impact of local districts
on property values, we
commissioned Donovan
Rypkema, a Washington,
DC real estate expert. We
collaboratively selected representative districts in Anderson, Elkhart, Evansville, Indianapolis and Vincennes
for the study. Rypkema’s
study methodology, detailed
on the next page, centered
on Multiple Listings Service
and U.S. census data.
I’m pleased to report that
our instincts are solidly verified by the numbers. As this
study shows, property values
rise with local historic district
designation, equaling if not
outpacing similar, undesignated areas and often the
performance of the city as
a whole. In addition to documenting the positive economic effect of such protective regulation, the study
reveals other benefits—we
call them “historic district
bonuses”—both for the residents and the community
as a whole.
We hope Preservation
& Property Values is useful
to communities throughout
Indiana as they weigh the
benefits of creating preservation commissions and
designating older neighborhoods as historic districts.

J. Reid Williamson, Jr.
President
Historic Landmarks
Foundation of Indiana

The question was straightforward—“What is the impact
on property values of local
historic districts in Indiana?”
Historic Landmarks Foundation of Indiana commissioned
me to answer that basic question, and to analyze the data
for other effects.
I collaborated with Historic
Landmarks in the selection
of local historic districts in
five cities, guided by the
desire to represent the geography of the entire state and
communities of various sizes.
We chose districts in Anderson, Elkhart, Evansville,
Indianapolis and Vincennes;
these districts also represent
variety in terms of building
size, age, price, architectural
quality and demographic
characteristics. Four districts
in the study are residential;
in one case, the study
focused on the predominantly
commercial area of a district.
Finally, we chose local historic districts which have
been in place long enough
for the impact on property
values to be measurable.
These findings reveal
that local historic districts
in Indiana not only provide
valuable protection for each
community’s historical resources but protect and enhance individuals’ financial
resources as well. In looking
at local historic districts in
five Indiana communities
we learned that:
In Anderson the values
of properties in the study
areas steadily appreciated
after the creation of the
historic districts.

In Elkhart the rate of
appreciation of properties
in the historic district, a particularly depressed area,
mirrored the rate of appreciation of the entire Elkhart
market.
In Evansville the appreciation of properties within
the local historic district outpaced both the surrounding
historic properties not included in the local district
and the overall Evansville
market.
In Indianapolis the property values in the local historic district increased at a
rate consistent with the metropolitan Indianapolis overall market and exceeded
the rate of both the adjacent
and highly similar neighborhood and the larger area
of Indianapolis within which
it sits.
In Vincennes, while the
amount of appreciation over
the fifteen-year period was
modest for both commercial
and residential properties,
commercial properties in
the downtown historic district
maintained a pattern of
appreciation similar to both
the rest of the commercial
properties and the overall
Vincennes real estate market.
The cities within which
the districts were located
varied widely in size, location within the state, and
health of the local real estate
market. In spite of these
variations the results were
remarkably consistent:
regardless of the historic
district, the community,

S T U D Y
the type of property, or the
condition of the local real
estate economy, no evidence
was found to suggest that a
local historic district adversely
affected property values.
The Multiple Listings Service
and U.S. Census data that
was analyzed also showed
several other substantial
benefits of local district status:

Buyers who choose historic districts often have
wider choices and get more

their money.

to impose?” In addition to
providing an authoritative
answer—“No, your property
values will not decline; in
fact, they will probably
rise.”—this investigation of
years’ worth of historic preservation commission records
suggests that commissions
neither prevent investment
in new construction nor routinely say “no” to the proposals before them.
These findings should
encourage communities to
create local historic districts.
In neighborhoods designated and regulated by historic preservation commissions, property values are
generally positively affected;
change that is positive for the
district is not only allowed
but actively encouraged;
and investment often takes
place when a neighborhood’s
assets are protected. The
mathematically demonstrable
evidence shows such districts
to be valuable tools for safeguarding and strengthening
the physical, economic and
social fabric of Indiana’s
neighborhoods and cities.

Historic downtown still
effectively serves its traditional multifunctional role
in a community.

Donovan D. Rypkema

Historic districts often
mirror the entire community
in terms of their economic,
educational and racial
diversity.
Historic districts promote
increased levels of home
ownership.
People moving into historic districts aren’t just passing through but tend to be
home owners for extended
periods, adding stability to
the neighborhood.

When the subject of historic district status is raised
in a city or neighborhood,
Historic Landmarks Foundation reports that the most
common, anxiously posed
question is “Won’t my property values go down if I
have to submit to whatever
requirements the preservation commission decides

M E T H O D O L O G Y

The criteria used to determine the cities and districts included in the Preservation & Property Values study were outlined in the introduction. After jointly selecting the geography
to be studied, a variety of methodological approaches was
used in order to learn as much as possible within the budgetary scope of the project. Multiple Listing Services (MLS) data
maintained by the local Boards of Realtors provided the base
data for all property value comparisons. However, also evaluated were census data, records of local preservation commissions, City Directories, and other public records.
Every sale reported in the subject districts was included for
evaluation, and contributed to the calculations and graphs
of the average yearly sales price for the fifteen-year period
from 1980 to 1995. Because of the relatively small number
of sales in any year in a given district (sometimes as few as
four or five) the unadjusted sales data do not provide an accurate reflection of changes taking place over time. Therefore
the graphs in this report depict the trend line, superimposed
over the raw data represented in the columns shown behind
the trend lines. The trend lines were created mathematically
by Microsoft Excel™ using the formula y = ce ^bx.
Where trend lines and narrative show property value comparisons to the city as a whole, they are based on a comparison
of MLS data for every sale (residential sales in four cities and
commercial sales in Vincennes) recorded during the study
period. In the case of Vincennes, MLS data was examined for
every commercial sale within the downtown Vincennes historic district between 1982 and the first quarter of 1996.
These figures were then compared with all of the commercial
sales outside of the downtown over the same period, as well
as the average MLS sales price of all properties sold during
the period.

Anderson
Anderson, (pop. 60,000) in
east central Indiana has two
historic districts—the West
8th Street Historic District
(WESHD) and the West Central Historic District (WCHD)
—both created in 1985 and
viewed with pride by the
community. In fact, Community Profile: A Vision for the
Future 20/20 Foresight proclaimed “the need to preserve
and protect the distinctive
qualities of historical, architectural and culturally significant buildings of the districts
is essential in enhancing the
quality of life in our City.” The
Anderson Historic and Cultural Preservation Commission carries out local design
review in the districts, including approval of proposed
exterior renovation and new
construction. Both districts
also are listed in the National
Register of Historic Places.

WHAT HAPPENED TO
PROPERTY VALUES?
From 1980 to 1995, both
the West Eighth Street Historic District and the West
Central Historic District experienced property value
appreciation. The trend
of appreciation accelerated
slightly after the creation of
the historic districts in 1985.

Street versus $32-37.80/
square foot in the newer
neighborhoods.
The Anderson historic
districts offered another
advantage over the other
neighborhoods (see charts
at right). Buyers could
choose from a substantial
number of houses at several
price points: they could
easily find a home for less
than $20,000 (23%) or over
$60,000 (19%), or somewhere
in between—$20,000-39,000
(41%) and $40,000-59,000
(17%). The range of housing
options was much narrower
in the three competing
neighborhoods, where only
5% of homes sold for less
than $20,000 and just 8%
could be purchased for over
$60,000.

In Anderson, real estate
professionals identified five
neighborhoods that offered
choices for first-time home
buyers and those looking
for housing in the more affordable range: the two historic districts and three newer
subdivisions (Hilltop, South
View and Meadowbrook).
While houses in the historic
districts fell in the middle of
the range of average selling
prices—from $52,853 in Hilltop to $32,171 in Meadowbrook—the homes are 79%
larger on average than homes
in the subdivisions. Historic
district buyers therefore got
much more house for their
money: $14.70/square foot
in West Central and $21.50/

Elkhart
The State-Division Street Historic District ranks as the
“first fashionable subdivision”
in the northern Indiana city
of Elkhart (pop. 45,000). First
developed in the 1860s and
1870s following the arrival of
the Lake Shore and Michigan
Southern Railroad shops, the
area housed an economically diverse population from
its earliest days; while singlefamily homes predominate,
the area also contains rowhouses, flats, and duplexes.
The Elkhart Historic & Cultural Preservation Commission locally designated the
near-downtown district in
1984 and exercises review
over renovation, demolition
and new construction in the
district. A nomination currently is being prepared to
list the district in the National
Register of Historic Places.

★

WHAT HAPPENED TO
PROPERTY VALUES?
The study produced two
conclusions: first, the rate
of appreciation within the
historic district paralleled
the appreciation rate in the
city of Elkhart as a whole
over the period from 1980
through 1995; and second,
the average values of housing in the historic district
were significantly below

HISTORIC
DISTRICT BONUS
The historic district reflects the breadth of the
community’s diversity.

Many neighborhoods,
particularly newer subdivisions, house narrow slices
of a community’s population. Few neighborhoods
reflect the economic, social,
racial, and educational diversity of the entire community.
This is true in small and
large cities alike, not only
in Indiana but throughout
America. However, every
residential historic district

displayed a greater range
of the community’s entire
population among its residents than other areas,
whether newer subdivisions
or older neighborhoods not
recognized as historic districts
(see chart on page 13).
Elkhart’s State-Division
Street Historic District serves
as a useful example. In three
demographic categories—
race, occupation and education—residents of the historic district closely reflect
the entire community. No
other neighborhoods in the
city came close to mirroring
the community as a whole.
The Elkhart historic district
is less reflective, however,
in one important area —income. The district encompasses a greater percentage
of both Elkhart’s high- and
low-income families (with
the spectrum in between
also represented) in a single
neighborhood. While there

are a variety of perspectives
on urban problems in
America, there is an almost
universal agreement that
isolating less well-to-do
citizens in exclusively poor
neighborhoods serves no
one well. That Elkhart’s
historic district—and every
other one in this study—
provides an economically
integrated neighborhood is
one of the most significant
contributions it makes in
its community.
People moving into historic
districts aren’t just passing
through but tend to be home
owners for extended periods,
adding stability to the neighborhood.
The study compared the
State-Division Street Historic
District with the city as a
whole. Slightly more than
50% of the homeowners
in the historic district had
been in the neighborhood
for twenty years or longer;
in the city, only 31% of
owners had a comparable
stable tenure.

quadrant but largely paralleled the rate of value growth
for the entire metropolitan
region—including Indianapolis’s booming suburbs.
As in Elkhart, the statistics
prove that both historic
neighborhoods are providing
quality housing across a
broad range of price levels
and attracting a more economically, socially and educationally diverse population
than is typically found in
neighborhoods and subdivisions in the Indianapolis
marketplace.

Historic districts promote
increased levels of home
ownership.
The investment protection
provided by a local historic
district may well be an overlooked catalyst for home
ownership, an aspect of the
American dream that has
been a long-standing public
policy priority of local, state
and national governments
for decades. In these sideby-side and almost identical
Indianapolis neighborhoods,
the 1980 ratio of home owners to renters was close—34%
of the residents in Fletcher
Place were owners and 29%
in Holy Rosary-Danish
Church. By 1990, while home
ownership increased to 38%
in Holy Rosary-Danish
Church, the ratio of owners
to renters had virtually
reversed in Fletcher Place,
moving to 66%.
While Holy Rosary-Danish
Church (below) saw an
impressive increase in home
ownership, the rise was
much more dramatic in the
locally designated Fletcher
Place historic district, where
rehabilitation of multi-family
structures (right), also
increased the number of
rental units for low- and
moderate-income residents.

owners as compared to the

HISTORIC

Historic downtown still
effectively serves its traditional role in a community.
Some think that downtown has been economically, physically and socially
replaced by the shopping
mall, the office park, and
the discount center. Property values in the historic
district covering downtown
Vincennes suggest otherwise. Downtowns traditionally have served three important economic roles in
a community: 1) as a geographically defined, multifunctional setting for a variety of economic activities;
2) as an informal incubator
for new businesses which
need both affordable space
and the interaction with a
number of other types of
activities; and 3) as the permanent home of institutions
and long-term businesses.

Historic downtown Vincennes continues to serve
all three functions. In addition to MLS data, the study
employed the Vincennes City
Directory to make a comparison of downtown Vincennes
in 1980 and 1995, with the
following key findings:
Nearly thirty percent of
the non-residential activities
in downtown Vincennes had
been in their current location for fifteen years or
longer.

Over the last decade, an

in downtown Vincennes.
The data showed a consistent pattern of downtown
businesses expanding to additional space or relocating
to a larger space within the
downtown as they became
more successful.

Commercial property in Vincennes’
historic downtown held its own, even
while rival development sprouted along
the highway on the outskirts of town.

Historic preservation
commissions are sometimes
viewed—usually by people
who do not live in historic
districts—as bureaucratic
naysayers, spoolers of red
tape and hassling regulation
that’s not worth the difficulty.
Resoundingly not true, according to this study. Investigation of case files for the
five cities covered in the
study show that the historic
preservation commissions
approved the applications
that came before them more
than 90% of the time.
Couple this finding with
the evidence showing that
property appreciates more
rapidly in local historic districts controlled by preservation commissions, and the

certificate of appropriateness
process followed by most
commissions begins to look
like a benign process that
puts money in the bank.
The buyer of property in
a local district trades total
freedom to do as he pleases
with the exterior of his property for the comforting assurance that property around
him will be renovated and
maintained in a manner that
is likely to enhance the value
of his own property.
A handful of other lessons
learned while undertaking
this analysis were less easy
to quantify and represent
in charts and graphs but are
important nonetheless:

Historic districts seem
to have the greatest positive
impact on property values
when the preservation commissions in control have effective communication of
their rules and clear guidelines, firmly and consistently
applied.
The existence of a strong
neighborhood organization,
whether created before or
after the establishment of the
historic district, has a positive impact—socially and
economically—on the district.
Investment will be attracted sooner and more consistently if there is a package
of incentives—“carrots” such
as design assistance, lowinterest loan programs and
the like—to accompany the
regulations or “sticks” of the
historic district commission.

The image of historic
district residents being rich
home owners displacing
poor renters was not found
to be true in any of the districts studied. In fact the reverse was often the case—
historic districts effectively
provide quality housing for
citizens of every economic
level.
Indiana has a wealth of
historic residential and commercial historic districts that
are not only providing a
good investment for this
generation, but conserving
man-made cultural and
physical resources for the
next generation. Cities and
towns in Indiana would do
well—for current citizens
and posterity—to create
preservation commissions
where they do not exist and
designate eligible areas as
local historic districts.
