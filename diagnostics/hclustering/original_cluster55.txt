INTRODUCTION
For many years, the Cities of South Bend and Elkhart have collected surface water
samples from our local rivers to determine pollutant concentrations. In 1998, the City
of Elkhart initiated biological community monitoring to compliment chemical and microbial sampling. The City of South Bend joined forces with Elkhart in 2001, and since
then both communities have gathered a great deal of information on the health of our
local waterways. Since the initiation of monitoring in 1998, chemical and biological data suggest that water quality is slowly improving on some local streams. There are
some issues that remain, which includes unstable drainage practices, sedimentation,
stormwater problems, and combined sewer overflows. However, through a series of
actions from government entities, watershed organizations, and the general public, the
quality of our local waterways should only get better as we move into the future.

Aquatic Community Monitoring 2012

In 2012, the Cities of Elkhart and South Bend,
through the City of Elkhart’s Aquatics Program,
continued to monitor local fish populations in area
rivers and streams. The information that wasgathered was integrated into an overall water
quality program for each City. While the cities
measure the chemical and microbial composition
of local stream water, having the additional biological data gives a more accurate representation
of the overall health of each stream. The way that
biological communities are assembled can change
as a result of a past or long-term disturbance.
Chemical and microbial testing, while very important in pinpointing contaminants, is simply a
snapshot of current conditions. In many cases,
having both sets of data can help determine the
cause and effect of disturbances to our local
streams.

on the fish communities that are present. The IBI
was modified by Dr. Thomas Simon in 1997 for
use in the St. Joseph River Watershed. The IBI is
a great tool in that complex biological information
can be analyzed to provide measurements of
stream quality for non-biologists and members of
the general public. The IBI is comprised of 3
broad categories (species composition, trophic
composition, and fish condition) which are broken
down into 12 smaller categories, known as metrics
(see Appendix A). These metrics are given a
score based on their similarity to least impacted
(reference) sites. One (1) of 3 scores can be given for each metric: 1 (not similar to reference
conditions), 3 (somewhat similar to reference conditions), or 5 (very similar to reference conditions). In general, the total score for a site will
range from 12 to 60, but in an instance where no
fish are present at a site, a score of 0 is given.
These scores can then be graphed and placed into
1 to 5 classifications (very poor, poor, fair, good,
or excellent), which describes the overall condition
of the fish community being monitored.

During the first 6 years (1998-2003), Elkhart’s
Aquatics Program established core fish sampling
sites on the St. Joseph River and many of its primary tributaries in the Elkhart area. For 3 consecutive years, data were collected from these sites
and a baseline was established for each stream.
Baseline data are now used to compare with current monitoring results to determine if impairments or enhancements are taking place in
Elkhart area streams.

Hester-Dendy Sampler Location on the
Elkhart River

In 2001, the City of South Bend combined forces
with Elkhart’s Aquatics staff, establishing a unique
biological monitoring partnership between municipalities. As with the Elkhart area, core sampling
sites were determined and similar baselines were
established for South Bend over a 6 year period
(2001-2006). This year (2012) was the sixth year
that the initial sites had been sampled since the
baseline period, providing the stakeholders of
South Bend with data to determine whether water
quality in their area is improving or diminishing.
The Aquatics Program consists of more than just
traversing through local streams collecting fish
data. A considerable portion of the Program is
education. The biologist travels to local schools
and watershed stakeholder group meetings, giving
presentations and demonstrations, in an effort to
increase awareness of, and promote conservation
for, the bountiful aquatic resources we have in this
area.

Indices
The Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) is the system
that is used to assess the local fish communities.
The IBI was developed by Dr. James Karr in 1981
as a tool for assessing water/stream quality based
Aquatic Community Monitoring 2012

conditions for 2012

Biologists recognize that fish community condition
is a product of the water quality and the habitat
that is available in any given area. Since 2003,
the Aquatics Program has been assessing available
habitat at all sampling locations using the Qualitative Habitat Evaluation Index (QHEI) (Rankin
1989). This index is similar to the IBI in its structure. It has 6 broad categories which are broken
down into 21 smaller categories or metrics
(Appendix A). This index will have a final score of
0 to 100 and the scores will be classified as excellent, good, fair-good, poor, and very poor. This
assessment will help determine to what extent the
IBI scores are being affected by habitat. It may
also show specific habitat degradation issues that
need to be addressed.

toring benthic (bottom dwelling) macroinvertebrates (visible animals without backbones). Fourteen (14) sites were sampled in 2012 and results
were compared to their respective baseline values.
The macroinvertebrate communities are assessed
with the Invertebrate Community Index (ICI) developed by the Ohio Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) (Ohio EPA 1987). This index is broken down into 10 metrics (Appendix A). Like the
IBI metrics, the ICI metrics are given a score
based on their similarity to relatively undisturbed
sites; 6 (comparable to exceptional community), 4
(comparable to typical community), 2 (slightly different from the typical community), or 1 (very different from the typical community).
The site
scores range from 0 to 60 and are classified similar to IBI scores. This combination of fish, habitat, macroinvertebrate, and chemical monitoring
provides the cities of Elkhart and South Bend with
the most comprehensive view of the health of our
streams.

Fish are not the only aquatic organisms that can
be monitored to determine overall health of rivers
and streams. Through a sub-contract with the
Midwest Biodiversity Institute (Figure 1) (MBI, Columbus, Ohio), the Aquatics Program is also moni3

species, the largest and smallest specimens are
measured to the nearest millimeter (mm), and all
fish are counted and then released. Index sites
are sampled twice during the season, with a minimum 5 week “rest” period between sampling
events. Individual species maximum and minimum lengths are recorded, all fish are counted,
and game fish are weighed and measured individually, while non-game fish are mass weighed.

The Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) has established guidelines to
determine if a body of water is impaired or if its
condition is supportive of aquatic life for the IBI
and QHEI (IDEM 2010). The ICI is not an index
used by IDEM, however, similar guidelines have
been established by OHIO EPA for a nearby region, and those values are being used with the
Elkhart and St. Joseph County data. Values of
36 or higher for IBI and ICI scores are indicators
of a stream with the ability to support aquatic
life.
QHEI scores of 51 or greater indicate
enough quality habitat is available to support
aquatic communities.

The length of stream sampled at an index site is
dependent on the wetted width of the stream.
The length of sites is 15 times this width, with a
minimum of 50 meters and a maximum of 500
meters. Differences in sampling and processing
(Foy 2004) have allowed multiple investigative
sites to be sampled in a day versus 1 or 2 index
sites. Every species collected at each site is verified either by retaining and preserving a small
specimen for the Public Works & Utilities voucher
museum or by photographing a large specimen.
This practice allows for the verification of the field
and lab identifications if needed.

In addition to performing water quality monitoring in the St. Joseph River basin, fish collections
are conducted to determine the overall species
diversity throughout the watershed. Walleye
(Sander
vitreus)
and
smallmouth
bass
(Micropterus dolomieu) populations are monitored from previous tagging events in cooperation with the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (IDNR). Tissue from 7 fish species was
collected and analyzed for mercury and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) content. Current Indiana Fish Consumption Advisory data for the
State of Indiana (Table 10) displays many species from the Indiana portion of the St. Joseph
River Watershed. The cities involved in the
Program believe it is vital to continually provide
local citizens with the most updated information
on fish consumption.

In 2012, 8 index and 3 investigative sites were
sampled in St. Joseph County and 12 index and 6
investigative sites were sampled in Elkhart County. Two (2) index sites on Baugo Creek were located right on the Elkhart/St. Joseph County border. (Figure 2 and Table 1). IBI scores were calculated for each of the index sites and an average
from the 2 visits was obtained to give the final
score (Table 1).
Fish were collected from all sites using either boat
mounted, tote barge, or backpack electrofishing
equipment. The type of gear used depended on
the size of the stream. The St. Joseph and Elkhart
Rivers were sampled with the boat.
Smaller,
wadeable streams were sampled with the tote
barge, unless the stream was extremely small and
shallow, in which case, the backpack was used.
Power output from the 3 devices differed. The
boat output was 8-16 amperes, the tote barge

Methods
For the past 14 years, the Aquatics staff has
used 2 collection protocols (investigative sampling and index sampling) to quickly catalog the
major fish species and to quantify water quality
in the St. Joseph River Watershed. Investigative
sites are sampled once during the season and
the fish collected at these sites are identified to

identified and specimens are counted. This information was then used to calculate ICI scores for
each site. Qualitative sampling also took place at
each site with the use of a kick net through all
available habitat near the location of the sampler.
This extra sampling is used to capture additional
species as well as provide information to make an
estimate of stream health in the case where an

During each fish sampling event, stream habitat
information was methodically collected using the
QHEI as developed by Ohio EPA (Rankin 1989).
Given that each index site was sampled twice,
scores were averaged to give a final score (Table
1).

Figure 3: Hester-Dendy sampler placed into
the stream bed.

In early July 2012, MBI personnel placed HesterDendy samplers (artificial substrates used to collect small aquatic organisms) (Figure 3) at 14
sites that were also sampled for fish (Table 2 and
Figure 4) following Ohio EPA macroinvertebrate
sampling procedures (Ohio EPA 1987, 1989). All
14 samplers were successfully retrieved approximately 7 weeks after being set and their contents
were preserved in alcohol for later identification.
The data gathered from the samplers is considered a quantitative sample where species are

Results and Discussion
During the summer of 2012, a total of 18,164 fish,
representing 16 families and 67 species, were collected in Elkhart County. The 2 sites along Baugo
Creek accounted for 4,668 of the fish that were
collected, most of which were small minnow species. In St. Joseph County, 5,685 fish, representing 13 families and 51 species were collected. In
total, 70 different species were captured from the
2 counties. Mimic shiners (Notropis volucellus),
white suckers (Catostomus commersonii), and
rock bass (Ambloplites rupterus) were the most
abundant species collected in Elkhart County,
while smallmouth bass, rock bass, and longear
sunfish (Lepomis megalotis) were the most abundant in St. Joseph County. See Appendix C for
more detailed information.

Long-term index monitoring consists of rotational
sampling of stream stations. Each station is visited at least once every 3 years to gather biological
and chemical data and to compare against previous sampling results.

Fish community conditions at the index
sites ranged from very poor (6) at Park

at Nibbyville (A) on the St. Joseph River.
Macroinvertebrate community
scores ranged from poor (20) at Grape

River.
Since the completion of baselines monitoring, fish IBI scores have been obtained 3 times over a period of 8 years
at most index sites in Elkhart County.
IBI scores can be influenced by natural
conditions such as flooding or drought
events and sometimes it can be difficult
to determine whether stream quality is improving
or diminishing because of natural variability. By
averaging IBI scores from the last 3 monitoring
events, variability can be reduced to give a good
overall picture of stream health since the completion of baseline sampling. In this report we will
present a comparison between baseline and postbaseline average IBI scores for several streams in
Elkhart County.

tion of the St. Joseph River at McNaughton Park is
where the river transitions into the impoundment
caused by the Twin Branch dam. Urban impacts in
addition to unnatural influences caused by the impoundment could have contributed to this low
score. However, it is likely that the drought conditions of 2012 also played a role.
In St. Joseph County, IBI scores for the St. Joseph
River remained good for the sites located downstream of the South Bend Dam. Brick Road (49)
did see a substantial drop from 2009 when the
site had an IBI score of 54, but the 2012 score
was still well above the baseline value of 46. The
macroinvertebrate community score was also
higher in 2012 compared to when it was last sampled in 2009. Similar reductions in fish IBI scores
were observed at other sites in relatively close
proximity to Brick Road; Darden Road in 2011
and Pinhook (B) in 2010 suggesting an issue in
the lower section of South Bend. However, not
too far upstream at Keller Park, fish species diversity was very high in 2012 promoting an almost
excellent IBI score of 54. Surprisingly, even
though the fish IBI score was up in 2012 at Keller
Park, the macroinvertebrate community score was
significantly lower than the last time it was sampled. Drought conditions in 2012 promoted excessive algae growth all along the river. These conditions made sampling shallow sites like Keller Park
for macroinvertebrates rather difficult because the
algae covered and clogged the sampling devices.
However, these conditions along with low flows
and high temperatures associated with the

St. Joseph River
The longitudinal trends in fish community condition for the entire Indiana portion of the St. Joseph River are displayed in Figure 6. Fish, macroinvertebrate, and habitat index scores are presented in Table 4. The Elkhart County portion of
the river continues to support good to excellent
fish communities.
The McNaughton Park site
scored the lowest of the 3 Elkhart County sites
which is consistent with past monitoring results.
Nibbyville (A) had an excellent IBI score of 56
which was up slightly from 2009, but the same as
the score from 2006. Lexington Avenue also had
an impressive IBI score for the third consecutive
time since the completion of baseline monitoring.
Macroinvertebrate community scores remained
relatively consistent at the Lexington Avenue site
with an ICI score in the very good range. However, the ICI score at McNaughton Park was significantly lower since the last time it was sampled
and just 3 points away from being considered an
impaired macroinvertebrate community. The secAquatic Community Monitoring 2012

solved oxygen (DO) concentrations were 8.86
milligrams per liter (mg/L). However, during the
second sampling pass at Jefferson Boulevard,
water temperatures rose to 82.5oF and DO concentration dropped to 5.36 mg/L. Monitoring this
upper section in South Bend in upcoming years
will help to determine the cause of the low IBI
scores in 2012, although temperature and dissolved oxygen data suggest that the drought
conditions were a major contributor.

drought may have also had a negative impact on
the macroinvertebrate community. The IBI score
at LaSalle Avenue (48) was good once again, but
was down slightly from the last time the site was
sampled in 2009.
The macroinvertebrate community was sampled for the first time in 2012
yielding a score of 42. It is assumed that this
score was also influenced by dry conditions in
2012.
The IBI score at Jefferson Boulevard (40) was significantly lower than the baseline value of 44.
When this site was last sampled in 2009, the IBI
score was 47. The Aquatics Program also completed index sampling at Sample Street (located
approximately 1.5 miles upstream of Jefferson
Boulevard) for the first time in 2012. This site also had a very low IBI score of 37 which is just
above IDEMs standard of attainment. These very
low scores do raise some concern, but are very
likely attributed to the drought conditions in 2012.
The total number of fish collected at the Jefferson
Boulevard and Sample Street sites were very low
in 2012. An average of 296 fish were collected at
Sample Street on both sampling passes. At Jefferson Boulevard, a relatively normal number of
594 fish were collected during the first sampling
pass and only 261 were collected during the second sampling pass. The first sampling pass occurred during the early part of the sampling season before the river levels dropped and water
temperatures increased significantly. Water temperatures during this time were 65oF and dis-

Elkhart River
All long-term monitoring sites along the Elkhart
River have been sampled 3 times since the completion of baseline monitoring in 2003. Figure 7
compares the average IBI scores since the completion of baseline monitoring to the baseline
monitoring results. Within Elkhart City limits minor fluctuations above and below the baseline
occur with significant improvement occurring at
Indiana Avenue and a slight drop occurring at
Studebaker Park. Ultimately this section of river
in Elkhart is maintaining fair to good stream
quality. It is apparent, however, that long-term
trends upstream of Elkhart suggest a decline in
stream quality particularly in the Oxbow Park area.
Macroinvertebrate community scores on the
Elkhart River plummeted from 2009 to 2012
(Table 5). Normally such a major decline would
represent a concern, however, drought conditions

were likely playing a role. Macroinvertebrates on the Elkhart River will be closely
monitored in coming years, particularly
upstream of Elkhart where stream integrity appears to have diminished.
Bowman Creek
The 2012 IBI score of 25 for Chippewa Avenue on Phillips Ditch was well above the
baseline value of 13 (Table 8 and Figure
6). While a score of 25 is still low and reflective of an impaired fish community,
this site also scored 25 in 2009 suggesting
a significant long-term improvement in the
fish community.
In years past, there were some significant
stream modifications to this section of
Phillips Ditch. However, in recent years
the City of South Bend worked with regulatory agencies to correct these issues,
which may be the reason for the boost to
the fish community. The fish communities
at this site in 2009 and 2012 reflect a
stream that is in the initial stages rejuvenation, with high numbers of fish being
collected, and the 3 most abundant fish
species being tolerant pioneering species.
This section of stream could, however, remain impaired due to agricultural influences from the upper reaches of the watershed where investigative sampling in
previous years revealed a low abundance
of fish and the presence of mostly tolerant
species.
Macroinvertebrate community
scores for this site also reflect a stream
impairment, however, the score in 2012
(32) was up significantly from 2009 and is
not too much lower than the stream quality attainment standard of 36. It will be
interesting to see how this site scores in
future monitoring events.

number is down significantly from 2009, however,
when the site had an IBI score of 35. Similar to
Grape Road and other Juday Creek sites, the
abundance of creek chubs has a strong influence
on the IBI score at this station, where the higher
the abundance the lower the score will be. This is
expected as creek chubs are a very tolerant fish
species.

In 2011, it was decided to report the IBI scores
using a Coolwater Index for Juday Creek. An
analysis of fish community data using the conventional IBI and the Coolwater IBI suggested that
the Coolwater IBI provides a more accurate representation of fish community integrity in this
stream (see 2011 report). IBI scores using the
conventional IBI are summarized in Figure 8 and
Table 6, and IBI scores using the Coolwater IBI
are presented in Figure 9 and Table 6. IBI scores
using the Coolwater IBI will only be discussed.

Myrtle Street had an impressive macroinvertebrate community score in 2012 of 50 which is considered excellent.
It is interesting that Juday
Creek has good to excellent macroinvertebrate
communities at most index sites, but has impaired
or barely attaining fish communities. Because of
the controversy we have expressed with the fish
IBI methods for Juday Creek, macroinvertebrate
community analysis has proven to be invaluable
for this stream and indicates that the stream is in
relatively good condition.

The 2012 IBI score for the Grape Road site was 36
which is up significantly from the baseline score
and slightly higher than the 2009 score of 35. The
fish community at Grape Road has changed slightly since baseline monitoring. The types of species
that have been collected has remained the same
since baseline monitoring, but there has been a
significant reduction in the abundance of creek
chubs in recent years. The Myrtle Street site has
also improved significantly since baseline monitoring by posting an IBI score of 30 in 2012. This

Investigative surveys along Juday Creek in previous years have illustrated that many of the
sources of stream degradation occur upstream of

tion of baseline monitoring. In 2006 and 2009,
this site had respective IBI scores of 50 and 51.
Upon arrival for sampling at this site in 2012, it
was observed that ditch “maintenance” work had
occurred at some point over the winter of
2011/2012. Removal of woody habitat from the
stream and riparian habitat from its southern
banks had occurred as a consequence of this
work. This lowered the habitat score at the site to
66, which has generally been between 70 and 80
in previous years. This alteration of stream habitat could be the reason for the reduced IBI score
in 2012. Average IBI scores since the completion
of baseline monitoring suggest significant longterm improvement at this site. However, the fish
community at the downstream Pine Creek site (US
20 Bypass) has diminished since the completion of
baseline monitoring (see Figure 10).

Figure 10: IBI scores for Pine Creek and Yellow Creek, Elkhart County

Yellow Creek

South Bend. Like most area streams, the headwaters have been heavily modified and straightened for drainage purposes. Even the site at
Grape Road has been significantly straightened
and suffers from habitat impairment. The stream
bed at this site is very uniform and is embedded
with fine sand and silt, which doesn't provide a lot
of habitat for aquatic organisms. This may be the
reason why this site had a poor ICI score of 20 in
2012, which is vastly lower than the macroinvertebrate community scores posted at upstream locations.
Given that this stream is mostly a
groundwater driven system, it is unlikely that the
drought conditions of 2012 played a major role in
the poor macroinvertebrate score. It is more likely that sedimentation issues are a limiting factor
on the health of the macroinvertebrate community.

IBI scores for Yellow Creek tend to fluctuate at all
sites that are monitored. There was no exception
to this rule at the Concord High School site in
2012 where the IBI score was 37 and higher than
the last time this site was sampled in 2009. Longterm monitoring suggests a slight increase in fish
community integrity and a slight decrease at the
downstream location at the US 20 Bypass (Figure
10). Of the 3 long-term monitoring sites on Yellow Creek, the only significant change has occurred at County Road 32, where the average IBI
score has fallen by 4 since the completion of baseline monitoring. Contaminant concentrations have
been shown to be extremely elevated in ditches
receiving septic effluent from rural communities
within the Yellow Creek Watershed. The Yellow
Creek Watershed has also been heavily modified
for drainage. Only the last mile and half contains
natural meanders, a good riparian buffer and relatively complex instream habitat. Due to substantial straightening and modification of the stream,
it is very hydrologically unstable which is why the
biological community scores continue to fluctuate
year after year. It is not uncommon for the water

Pine Creek
Pine Creek at State Road 120 had a decent IBI
score of 46 in 2012 which is well above he baseline value of 40 (Figure 10 and Table 7). This is

scores have not deviated too far from the baseline
at State Road 120 closer to the mouth of St. Joseph River (Figure 11). The macroinvertebrate
community score was significantly higher in 2012
compared to 2009. Macroinvertebrates represent
a more short term picture of stream integrity relative to the fish community. So, the high ICI score
in 2012 may be indicative of favorable conditions
from 2011 to 2012. Conservation agencies have

Lily Creek
Of the streams monitored by the Aquatics Program in Elkhart County, Lily Creek has the most
impaired fish communities (Table 7). The major
limitation for Lily Creek is its lack of water during
the dry summer months. There have been several
times throughout the years, that the Park Six
Drive site on Lily Creek has dried up by the second
sample pass. This year (2012), was no exception,
as the creek dried up by late June due to the
drought conditions. Lily Creek drains Simonton
Lake and enters the St. Joseph River just above
the Johnson Street Dam.

and the Little Elkhart River, Elkhart County

Christiana Creek
The IBI scores from the North Main Wellfield
(NMWF) site on Christiana Creek in 2006 to 2012
demonstrate a long-term improvement at this location (Figure 11 and Table 8). Significant improvement has also been demonstrated upstream
of the NMWF site at Willowdale Park in 2008 and
2011. Monitoring at the other sites along Christiana Creek (County Road 4 and County Road 6)
suggest little to no long-term improvement towards the edge of Elkhart City limits. However,
both locations have always had very healthy
aquatic communities since the inception of monitoring. In addition to the impressive fish community score at the NMWF site, the 2012 macroinvertebrate score of 52 along with the habitat score of
80 illustrate the superior quality of Christiana
Creek relative to other local St. Joseph River tributaries.

been spending a lot of time and effort reducing
agricultural impacts to the Little Elkhart River in
recent years, which may be the reason for the elevated macroinvertebrate score and slight improvements in fish community integrity since baseline
monitoring. It will be interesting to see if this
trend continues into the future.

In 2010, the Aquatics team initiated index sampling at 2 new sites on Baugo Creek. The Elkhart

in 2011. The ICI score dropped in 2012 to 44,
although this value was still well above the initial
score recorded in 2010. Future monitoring of the
fish and macroinvertebrate communities at this
site will help determine the long-term benefit of
these restoration practices.

Figure 12: IBI scores of Baugo Creek, Elkhart
and St. Joseph Counties

Fish Tissue
In 2012, tissue was collected from fish in both
Elkhart and St. Joseph Counties. Collections were
based on the current Fish Consumption Advisory
(FCA) for area streams and potential data gaps
within the FCA. The FCA provides guidance on the
rate of consumption of local wild fishes (Table 10).
Based on PCB or mercury concentrations, fish species within a certain size range will be placed within an FCA Grouping. Table 11 summarizes each
grouping and the associated guidance. It should
be noted that the State FCA has more restrictive
guidance for individuals that are considered to be
part of the “sensitive population.” Women who
are pregnant or are breastfeeding, women who
plan to have children, or children under the age of
15 are considered to be part of the sensitive population. For more information on local fish consumption, visit the Indiana State Department of
Health’s
website
(http://www.in.gov/
isdh/23650.htm).

Figure 12 illustrates the baseline that has been
established for Baugo Creek, which includes 3
years of baseline monitoring from 2010 to 2012 at
the restoration sites. Similar to streams like the
Little Elkhart River and Pine Creek, baseline data
show fish community integrity increasing in a
downstream direction as the stream becomes
larger and drains more land area. As you move
upstream in St. Joseph River tributaries, the
streams become smaller and are more modified
for agricultural land use which limits habitat availability and impacts water quality.

Many variables play a role in contaminant concentrations in fish. Our results have shown varying
contaminant concentrations from year to year and
among different sizes of fish. However, concentrations do not tend to vary that significantly and
an understanding of contaminant concentrations
can be determined by gathering data multiple
times. In general, larger fish will tend to have
higher concentrations of contaminants in their tissue.
The following narrative describes results
from the Aquatics Programs fish tissue collections
from Elkhart and St. Joseph Counties:

also performed at the Restoration Site on Baugo

In previous years, the State of Indiana published an annual Fish Consumption Advisory (FCA) providing
guidance for consuming fish for many water bodies throughout the state of Indiana. Indiana is no longer
publishing an annual report, but has shifted to presenting results on the Fish4Health website (http://
fn.cfs.purdue.edu/fish4health/). The former FCA reports also provided guidance groupings (see Table 12
for Groupings). Although these guidance groupings are not used on the Fish4Health website, we will
continue to use them for consistency in our report.

were 15.5-16 inches long and were in Group 2 for
mercury and Group 5 for PCBs. The Statewide
advisory currently does not list the redhorse species in South Bend. Given the high PCB concentrations in redhorse from downtown South Bend,
these fish should probably be listed in the State
FCA.

Elkhart. Smallmouth bass fell in Group 1 for mercury and Group 2 for PCBs, while rock bass fell in
Group 1 PCBs but Group 2 for mercury. These
species are both listed Group 1 in the statewide
advisory, although the rock bass collected by the
state were only 7 inches long.
Northern pike (26-28 inches) were collected for
tissue samples for the first time in 2012 above the
Elkhart dam on the St. Joseph River. Pike are a
commonly sought game species and are very
abundant on the St. Joseph River. Anglers sometimes compare the taste of the pike to that of a
walleye, although they can be difficult to clean because of their “y-bone.” Pike fell into Group 2 for
PCBs and Mercury which is relatively low given
their size and the fact that they are a top predatory species. The size limit for northern pike is 20
inches, so smaller legal size fish may have even
lower concentrations of PCBs and mercury.

Walleye were another species that were collected
in Elkhart and St. Joseph Counties. For the third
consecutive year, Walleye in the 15 inch size
range were collected in close proximity to downtown Elkhart. As with previous years, mercury
and PCB concentrations were relatively low and
fell in Group 1 for both contaminants. Walleye are
a very popular game species in the St. Joseph River and are commonly kept and consumed by anglers.
Walleye (15-16 inches) were also collected from LaSalle Avenue in downtown South Bend.
Similar to previous years, PCBs tend to be a little
higher in downtown South Bend with South Bend
walleye falling in Group 3 for PCBs. These results
are relatively consistent with walleye tissue results
from previous years.

Shorthead redhorse were collected from 3 locations in 2012. In Elkhart County, fish from 15-16
inches in length they were collected from Lexington Avenue close to downtown Elkhart. These fish
fell in Group 1 for mercury and Group 2 for PCBs.
The statewide advisory currently lists “redhorse
species” (17 inches or greater) in Group 3 for
PCBs. In St. Joseph County, shorthead redhorse
were collected from Logan Street (just upstream
of South Bend) and from LaSalle Avenue
(downstream of the South Bend dam). The Fish
collected from Logan Street were 17-17.5 inches
long and fell in Group 2 for mercury and Group 3
for PCBs. Those collected from LaSalle Avenue

Largemouth bass (14-16 inches) were collected
from the St. Joseph River above the South Bend
dam for the second straight year. Consistent with
2011, fish fell in Group 2 for mercury and Group 1
for PCBs, although the fish collected in 2011 were
slightly smaller. Largemouth bass, similar in size
to the those collected in 2010 were also collected
above the dam in Elkhart in 2012 and had very
similar concentrations of mercury and PCBs.
Based on these results, it appears that mercury
accumulation might be more of an
issue that PCB accumulation in
largemouth bass.

Steelhead trout (27-29 inches)
were also collected in 2012. Consistent with results from our programs testing from 2007-2009,
fish fell in Group 1 for mercury
and Group 3 for PCBs indicating
that consuming this species
should be limited to once per
month. The state advisory suggests limiting consumption to
once every 2 months, although
the States guidance pertains to
fish greater than 30 inches.

provided an overview of general pollutant concentrations in the Elkhart and St. Joseph Rivers. The
Cities of Elkhart and South Bend have been collecting water samples from local waterways for
many years. In addition, IDEM has also been
monitoring the Elkhart and St. Joseph Rivers upstream and downstream of Elkhart and South
Bend since at least 1990. IDEM has sampled for
numerous contaminants, from heavy metals to
pesticides.
However, their most thorough datasets are limited to general chemical parameters
like total suspended solids and nutrient pollutants
like nitrogen and phosphorus. IDEM has been
monitoring stations on the Elkhart River: US 33 in
Benton and SR 120 in downtown Elkhart. IDEM
also has 3 stations on the St. Joseph River: at the
Bristol Boat Launch, Merrifield Park in Mishawaka,
and Auten Road in South Bend. A review of
IDEMs general chemical data did not reveal any
surprises. In general, the Elkhart River has significantly higher concentrations of most contaminants compared to the St. Joseph River, which
confirms the results of the City of Elkhart’s chemical monitoring in the Elkhart area. Average concentrations of phosphorus (PO4) were significantly

higher at the 2 Elkhart River sites compared to the
stations on the St. Joseph River. EPA’s proposed
criteria for PO4 is 0.031 mg/L (Frakenberger &
Esman, 2012). Median concentrations of PO4 at
all stations on the St. Joseph and Elkhart Rivers
exceed this concentration, with the Elkhart River
sites having the highest median concentrations at
0.06 mg/L.
In addition, concentrations of total
kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), were significantly higher
at the Elkhart River Benton site relative to all other locations (Figure 13). TKN is a measurement of
the organic form of nitrogen plus ammonia. The
source of the higher TKN in rural portion of the
watershed is likely from fertilizer run-off or livestock operations.
Total suspended solids data confirm visual observations of sediment impacts in the St. Joseph River (Figure 15). Through surface water monitoring,
the City of Elkhart has demonstrated that the
Elkhart River Watershed contributes a significant
amount of sediment to the St. Joseph River
(Deegan, 2011). However, IDEM’s data shows
that suspended solids increase in the Mishawaka
section of the St. Joseph River and can be seen all

nificantly correlated with flow and
the amount of suspended sediment
in the Elkhart River. The bottom
line, as illustrated in Figure 14,
is that as river flow increases
resulting from a rain event, so
does the quantity of sediment
and other pollutants entering
the St. Joseph River from its
tributaries.

Conclusion
In recent years we reported
trends that support a slight increase in stream quality across
the Indiana portion of the St.
Joseph River Watershed. However, it is apparent, based on
incorporation of 2012 data that
not all streams are improving.
This year marked the first time
in which several Elkhart County
streams have been monitored at least 3 times
since the completion of baseline monitoring
providing enough data to gauge long-term trends
in stream quality. Streams like the Little Elkhart
River and Christiana Creek appear to have improved slightly since the completion of baseline
monitoring. However, streams like the Elkhart
River and Yellow Creek have not improved or have
declined at several sites. These streams are hydrologically unstable and can rise to flooding conditions following a heavy rain event carrying sediment and other pollutants to the St. Joseph River.

the way downstream of South Bend. In fact, suspended solid concentrations are actually higher on
the main stem of the St. Joseph River in
Mishawaka and South Bend than they are in the
Elkhart River.
Field observations in the
Mishawaka section of the river reveal significant
plumes of sediment entering the St. Joseph River
from Baugo Creek following heavy rain events.
These observations can also be confirmed by looking at select aerial and satellite imagery of Baugo
Bay. Sediment movement is essential for natural
maintenance of river habitat. However, in heavy
loads caused by runoff and erosion, it can have
detrimental effects. Excess sediment can have an
impact on the respiration, feeding, and reproduction of aquatic animals. Sediment particles can
also carry tightly bound contaminants including
nutrients, pesticides and many others.

Surface water monitoring data support the notion
that Baugo Creek is a significant detriment to the
improvement of the St. Joseph River, causing a
major spike in total suspended solid concentrations in the St. Joseph River.
Macroinvertebrate Community integrity at the
Grape Road site on Juday Creek dropped significantly in 2012. While drought conditions on other
streams may have played a role in reduced ICI
scores, Juday Creek is a coolwater stream that
maintains lower temperatures and stream base
flow levels, so the drought conditions should not
have been a major limitation in 2012. It is apparent, based on habitat analysis, that this section of
Juday Creek is significantly embedded with fine
sand and silt caused by sedimentation from upstream land use activities.

Figure 14, illustrates 1 of the biggest problems
facing the St. Joseph River system. As discussed
in our 2010 and 2011 reports, many St. Joseph
River tributaries have been highly modified for agricultural drainage. In addition, urban areas within the watershed provide an onslaught of stormwater from impervious surfaces like rooftops and
parking lots.
This causes tributaries like the
Elkhart River and Baugo Creek to have flashy flow
regimes accompanied with spikes in pollutant concentrations. The relationship between river discharge (the amount of water flowing in the Elkhart
River and suspended solids is significantly correlated (R2 = 0.504). Furthermore, nutrient pollutant concentrations (PO4, TKN, NO3) are also sigAquatic Community Monitoring 2012

was hampered by the moderate drought that occurred in 2012. Fish populations migrated to cer18

tain sections of river or deeper water to avoid extreme heat and low oxygen levels. This was particularly noticeable above the South Bend Dam,
where the total number of fish collected was cut in
half at the Jefferson Boulevard site between the
first and second sampling pass. Macroinvertebrate community surveys also showed major deviations from previous sampling events on the 2 rivers. Drought conditions may be a major reason
for the significant drops in macroinvertebrate
community integrity at several river sites, however, scores did not change significantly on the tributary streams. While biological integrity is ordinarily superior in the 2 main rivers compared to
most tributary streams, drought conditions may
have revealed stream integrity issues that are not
obvious under normal conditions.

Fish tissue preparation and results

Materials needed:
Reynolds aluminum foil
freezer wrap
deionized (DI) water
1/2 gallon, 1 gallon, and jumbo size freezer bags w/write-on labels
skinners
stainless steel fillet knives
knife sharpener
scalers
ice
cooler
A group of three fish per species was selected
based on size. The smallest fish in each group
was greater than or equal to 90% of the length
of the largest fish in that group. The largest fish
or fish that fell into a length range for species on
the advisory were selected. The fish were kept
as close in size as possible within a group because the tissue from the three fish in each
group was composited (mixed together) before
the analyses were completed.
All of the tissue was in the form of boneless fillets taken from the fish. All of the fish had skinon fillets taken. Before the tissue was removed,
the fillet knives, scalers and skinners were
cleaned and rinsed with DI water, and freezer
wrap was placed where the fish were to be processed. The knives, scalers and skinners were
washed in river water and rinsed with DI water
after each species was processed and new
freezer wrap was placed before another species

was processed.
For skin-on samples, the
scales were removed before the fillet was taken.
It was important to be consistent with where the
cut of the fillet ended and to not include any of
the body cavity or viscera. Once the fillets were
removed, they were rinsed in river water and
then rinsed with DI water before being placed
on aluminum foil. The foil was large enough to
hold the three fillets for each species at a site.
When all three fillets were placed on the foil, it
was then wrapped and placed in a labeled
freezer bag and placed on ice in a cooler. The
fish tissue was placed in a freezer upon returning to the lab, and kept frozen until sent to the
contract lab for analyses.

Appendix E

Summary of macroinvertebrates (insects) collected by site, 2012
Macroinvertebrates were collected in two ways to calculate the Invertebrate
Community Index (ICI). The first method employed a sampling device known
as a Hester-Dendy multi-plate sampler (HD sampler). Macroinvertebrates collected using this method were identified and counted (Quantitative column in
the following tables). The second method was a sweep with a net of all the
available habitat types in the area of the Hester-Dendy in an effort to identify
other macroinvertebrates in the stream that may not colonize the HD samplers. Macroinvertebrates collected in this way were identified and simply
counted as being present (Qualitative column).

INTRODUCTION
For many years, the Cities of South Bend and Elkhart have collected surface water samples
from our local rivers to evaluate pollutant concentrations. In 1998, the City of Elkhart initiated biological community monitoring to compliment chemical and microbial sampling and
to establish a robust long-term stream monitoring program. The City of South Bend joined
forces with Elkhart in 2001, and since then both communities have gathered a great deal of
information on the health of our local waterways.
Biological community monitoring in 2014 did not reveal any major surprises. The St. Joseph River Watershed in Elkhart and St Joseph Counties continues to support highly diverse
communities of fish and macroinvertebrates. While long-term trends indicate minor improvements in certain streams, some local tributaries to the St. Joseph River remain impaired or show little signs of improvement.

Aquatic Community Monitoring 2014

In 2014, the cities of Elkhart and South Bend,
through the City of Elkhart’s Aquatics Program,
continued to monitor local fish populations in area
rivers and streams. The information gathered was
integrated into an overall water quality program
for each City. While the cities measure the chemical and microbial composition of local stream water, having the additional biological data gives a
more accurate representation of the overall health
of each stream. The way that biological communities are assembled can change as a result of a disturbance, such as a chemical spill or alteration of
habitat. Chemical and microbial testing, while
very important in pinpointing contaminants, is
simply a snapshot of current conditions. In many
cases, having both sets of data can help determine the cause and effect of disturbances to our
local streams.

on the fish communities that are present. The IBI
was modified by Dr. Thomas Simon in 1997 for
use in the St. Joseph River Watershed. The IBI is
a great tool in that complex biological information
can be analyzed to provide measurements of
stream quality for non-biologists and members of
the general public. The IBI is comprised of 3
broad categories (species composition, trophic
composition, and fish condition) which are broken
down into 12 smaller categories, known as metrics
(see Appendix A). These metrics are given a
score based on their similarity to least impacted
(reference) sites. One of 3 scores can be given
for each metric: 1 (not similar to reference conditions), 3 (somewhat similar to reference conditions), or 5 (very similar to reference conditions).
In general, the total score for a site will range
from 12 to 60, but in an instance where no fish
are present at a site, a score of 0 is given. These
scores can then be graphed and placed into 1 to 5
classifications (very poor, poor, fair, good, or excellent), which describes the overall condition of
the fish community being monitored.

During the first 6 years (1998-2003), Elkhart’s
Aquatics Program established core fish sampling
sites on the St. Joseph River and many of its primary tributaries in the Elkhart area. For 3 consecutive years, data were collected from these sites
and a baseline was established for each stream.
Baseline data are now used to compare with current monitoring results to determine if impairments or enhancements are taking place in
Elkhart area streams.

to sample macroinvertebrates in Yellow
Creek

In 2001, the City of South Bend combined forces
with Elkhart’s Aquatics program, establishing a
unique biological monitoring partnership between
municipalities. As with the Elkhart area, core
sampling sites were determined and similar baselines were established for South Bend over a 6
year period (2001-2006). This year (2014) was
the 8th year that the initial sites had been sampled since the baseline period, providing the community of South Bend with data to determine
whether water quality in their area is improving or
diminishing.
The Aquatics Program consists of more than just
traversing through local streams collecting fish
data. A considerable portion of the Program is
education. The biologist travels to local schools
and watershed stakeholder group meetings, giving
presentations and demonstrations, in an effort to
increase awareness about the health of our local
streams.

Indices
The Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) is the system
that is used to assess the local fish communities.
The IBI was developed by Dr. James Karr in 1981
as a tool for assessing water/stream quality based

Biologists recognize that fish community condition
is a product of the water quality and the habitat
that is available in any given area. Since 2003,
the Aquatics Program has been assessing available
habitat at all sampling locations using the Qualitative Habitat Evaluation Index (QHEI) (Rankin
1989). This index is similar to the IBI in its structure. It has 6 broad categories which are broken
down into 21 smaller categories or metrics
(Appendix A). This index will have a final score of
0 to 100 and the scores will be classified as excellent, good, fair-good, poor, and very poor. This
assessment will help determine to what extent the
IBI scores are being affected by habitat. It may
also show specific habitat degradation issues that
need to be addressed.

toring benthic (bottom dwelling) macroinvertebrates (visible animals without backbones). Fourteen sites were sampled in 2014 and results were
compared to their respective baseline values. The
macroinvertebrate communities are assessed with
the Invertebrate Community Index (ICI) developed by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) (Ohio EPA 1987). This index is broken
down into 10 metrics (Appendix A). Like the IBI
metrics, the ICI metrics are given a score based
on their similarity to relatively undisturbed sites; 6
(comparable to exceptional community), 4
(comparable to typical community), 2 (slightly different from the typical community), or 1 (very different from the typical community).
The site
scores range from 0 to 60 and are classified similar to IBI scores. This combination of fish, habi-

Fish are not the only aquatic organisms that can
be monitored to determine overall health of rivers
and streams. Through a sub-contract with the
Midwest Biodiversity Institute (Figure 1) (MBI, Columbus, Ohio), the Aquatics Program is also moni3

from 4 fish species was collected and analyzed for
mercury and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) content. Current Indiana Fish Consumption Advisory
data for the State of Indiana (Table 12) displays
many species from the Indiana portion of the St.
Joseph River Watershed. The cities involved in
the Program believe it is vital to continually provide local citizens with the most updated information on fish consumption.

The Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) has established guidelines to determine if a body of water is impaired or if its condition is supportive of aquatic life for the IBI and
QHEI (IDEM 2010). The ICI is not an index used
by IDEM, however, similar guidelines have been
established by OHIO EPA for a nearby region, and
those values are being used with the Elkhart and
St. Joseph County data. Values of 36 or higher
for IBI and ICI scores are indicators of a stream
with the ability to support aquatic life. QHEI
scores of 51 or greater indicate enough quality
habitat is available to support aquatic communities.

Methods
For the past 17 years, the Aquatics staff has used
2 collection protocols (investigative sampling and
index sampling) to quickly catalog the major fish
species and to quantify stream quality in the St.
Joseph River Watershed. Investigative sites are
sampled once during the season and the fish collected at these sites are identified to species, the
largest and smallest specimens are measured to
the nearest millimeter (mm), and all fish are
counted and then released. Index sites are sampled twice during the season, with a minimum 5
week “rest” period between sampling events. Individual species maximum and minimum lengths
are recorded, all fish are counted, and game fish

In addition to performing water quality monitoring
in the St. Joseph River basin, fish collections are
conducted to determine the overall species diversity throughout the watershed. Walleye (Sander
vitreus) and smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) populations are monitored from previous
tagging events in cooperation with the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources (IDNR). Tissue

most non-game fish are mass weighed. Individual
length and weight data are also collected for some
of the important species like greater redhorse.

ty. One index sites on Baugo Creek was located
right on the Elkhart/St. Joseph County border.
(Figure 2 and Table 1). IBI scores were calculated
for each of the index sites and an average from
the 2 visits was obtained to give the final score
(Table 1).

The length of stream sampled at an index site is
dependent on the wetted width of the stream.
The length of sites is 15 times this width, with a
minimum of 50 meters and a maximum of 500
meters. Differences in sampling and processing
(Foy 2004) have allowed multiple investigative
sites to be sampled in a day versus 1 or 2 index
sites. Every species collected at each site is verified either by retaining and preserving a small
specimen for the Public Works & Utilities voucher
museum or by photographing a large specimen.
This practice allows for the verification of the field
and lab identifications if needed.

Fish were collected using either boat mounted,

tote barge, or backpack electrofishing equipment.
The type of gear used depended on the size of the
stream. The St. Joseph and Elkhart Rivers were
sampled with the boat.
Smaller, wadeable
streams were sampled with the tote barge, unless
the stream was extremely small and shallow, in
which case, the backpack was used. Power output
from the 3 devices differed. The boat output was
8-16 amperes, the tote barge was 4-6 amperes,
and the backpack was 0.5-1.5 amperes.
During each fish sampling event, stream habitat
information was methodically collected using the
QHEI as developed by Ohio EPA (Rankin 1989).
Given that each index site was sampled twice,
scores were averaged to give a final score (Table
1).

available habitat near the location of the sampler.
This extra sampling is used to capture additional
species as well as provide information to make an
estimate of stream health in the case where an
ICI score can not be calculated due to the loss or
vandalism of a sampler.

In early July 2014, MBI personnel placed HesterDendy samplers (artificial substrates used to collect small aquatic organisms) (Figure 3) at 14
sites that were also sampled for fish (Table 2 and
Figure 4) following Ohio EPA macroinvertebrate
sampling procedures (Ohio EPA 1987, 1989). All
14 samplers were successfully retrieved approximately 7 weeks after being set and their contents
were preserved in alcohol for later identification.
The data gathered from the samplers is considered a quantitative sample where species are
identified and specimens are counted. This information was then used to calculate ICI scores for
each site. Qualitative sampling also took place at

Long-term index monitoring consists
of rotational sampling of stream stations. Each station is visited at least
once every 3 years to gather biological and chemical data and to compare against previous sampling results.

Results and Discussion
During the summer of 2014, a total
of 18,733 fish, representing 17 families and 71 species, were collected in
Elkhart County. In St. Joseph County, 6,418 fish, representing 13 families and 49 species were collected. In total, 72
different species were captured from the 2 counties. Rock bass (Ambloplites rupterus), bluegill
(Lepomis macrochirus), and striped shiner (Luxilus
chrysocephalus) were the most abundant species
collected in Elkhart County, while longear sunfish
(Lepomis megalotis), rock bass, and smallmouth
bass (Micropterus dolomieu) were the most abundant in St. Joseph County. See Appendix C for
more detailed information.

be reduced to give a good overall picture of
stream health since the completion of baseline
sampling. In this report we will provide a comparison between baseline and post-baseline average
IBI scores for most streams in Elkhart County.
St. Joseph River
The longitudinal trends in fish community condition for the entire Indiana portion of the St. Joseph River are displayed in Figure 6. Fish, macroinvertebrate, and habitat index scores are presented in Table 4.

Indices
Fish community conditions at the index sites
ranged from very poor (6) at Studebaker Golf
Course on Bowman Creek to excellent (55) at High
Dive Park (B) and North Main Wellfield on Christiana Creek. Macroinvertebrate community scores
ranged from fair (34) at Studebaker Golf Course
on Bowman Creek to exceptional (54) at Angela
Boulevard on the St. Joseph River. Habitat quality
ranged from fair (29) at Main Street on Bowman
Creek to excellent (89) at the Elkhart Conservation Club on Cobus Creek.

The Elkhart County portion of the river continues
to support fair to excellent fish communities. IBI
scores remained at or above initial baseline values
at all sites. Post baseline average IBI scores suggest that fish community conditions have slightly
improved since the inception of monitoring in
1998. Macroinvertebrate community assessments
were performed at the Six Span and Bridge Street
sites on the St. Joseph River. The ICI scores for
both sites were up significantly from when they
were last sampled in 2011.
The Bridge Street
site also had a significantly lower ICI score in
2008 suggesting improvement at this site. Biological index scores at Bridge Street reflect diverse
and abundant communities of fish an macroinvertebrates which is very encouraging given the location of this site is in a highly urbanized area of
Elkhart.

Since the completion of baseline monitoring, fish
IBI scores have been obtained 3 times over a period of 10 years at most index sites in Elkhart
County. IBI scores can be influenced by natural
conditions such as flooding or drought events and
sometimes it can be difficult to determine whether
stream quality is improving or diminishing because
of natural variability. By averaging IBI scores
from the last 3 monitoring events, variability can

seph River. Habitat scores indicate that lack of
habitat in this section could be a major reason
for the reduced fish community score (Deegan,
2013), although urban pollution issues may also
be a major influence at this particular location.

In St. Joseph County, IBI scores were either at or
slightly above baseline values at all sites. In
2013, IBI scores were significantly higher than
baselines values indicating a strong year for fish
communities. IBI scores in 2014, however, were
not as good and suggest that there is still some
room for improvement in the South Bend area of
the St. Joseph River. Regardless, fish communities appear to be stable if not slightly stronger
since the implementation of this monitoring program. Sampling in 2014 marked the end of baseline monitoring at the Sample Street location. The
baseline value of 40 at Sample Street is the lowest
of all sites in the South Bend section of the St. Jo-

Macroinvertebrates were sampled at Angela
Boulevard and Darden Road in the South Bend
area, with respective ICI scores of 46 and 52.
ICI scores were significantly higher than 2011 for
both sites. It is interesting that macroinvertebrate scores at Angela Boulevard have increased
while fish community scores have decreased.
However, it is well understood by aquatic biologists that both communities of organisms react
differently to stressors. Of most importance,
both groups of organisms indicate that the St.
Joseph River at Angela Boulevard is doing well.

Figure 7: IBI scores for the Elkhart River,

Elkhart River
IBI scores for the Elkhart River were similar to
the St. Joseph River in that scores were close to
initial baseline values (Figure 7, Table 5). Scores
at American Park and CR 18 (Hively Avenue)
were actually slightly lower than initial baseline
scores, but not low enough to demonstrate a
downward shift in stream quality. Since the initiation of sampling in the St. Joseph River Watershed, IBI scores have improved slightly in some
streams including the St. Joseph River. While
the Elkhart River has had some strong years
which were likely influenced by natural variables,
there appears be little improvement in the fish

communities in the past 17 years. The Elkhart
River maintains high quality instream and riparian
habitat as indicated by its impressive QHEI scores.
However, many of the tributaries of the Elkhart
River have been modified significantly for drainage, causing unstable flow and associated water
quality issues in the Elkhart River.

Bowman Creek
In 2014, Bowman Creek was sampled at Studebaker Golf Course for the sixth time since the
initiation of sampling. During the first sampling
pass in 2014, no fish were collected at the site.
During the second pass only 10 juvenile largemouth bass and 5 creek chubs were collected. In
previous years sampling events, there were several occasions were no fish were collected. Bowman
Creek, above and below Studebaker Golf Course,
is ran underground and stream flow is significantly
altered. It’s not uncommon for this stream to run
dry. Although the habitat at the Golf Course is
limited (QHEI score 45), the lack of continuous,
adequate flow, and the fragmentation between
different stream sections, are serious detriments
to aquatic life in this stream.

The ICI scores for CR 18 and American Park were
both 40 in 2014, down significantly from when the
sites were previously sampled in 2011, but almost
identical to the initial sampling scores from 2008.
Interestingly, these 2 sites have scored identically
in all the years they have been sampled, despite
the fact that they are almost 6 miles apart. Furthermore, other sites on the Elkhart River that are
sampled in the same year also have ICI scores
that are identical or almost identical. These results suggest that stressors to the Elkhart River
are widespread at the watershed level and support
the idea that the river’s biggest challenge is its
unstable hydraulic conditions.

When comparing macroinvertebrate communities
to fish communities, it is understood that macroinvertebrates have shorter life-cycles and are
quicker to reestablish following a disturbance. ICI

scores at Bowman Creek in 2014 were 34 which is
relatively good for this stream. The ICI score for
this site was 36 in 2011 which is actually considered attaining. While the fish communities illustrate significant impairment in Bowman Creek, the
macroinvertebrate communities suggest that it
does have the ability to reestablish quickly following issues related to lack of flow. The ICI scores
also suggest that water quality in the Creek may
not be all that bad.

ent IBI methods for several years to assess Juday
Creek, and will continue to assess this stream using both methods. At this time, macroinvertebrate communities appear to provide a more
meaningful reflection of
the quality of Juday
Creek. In 2014, ICI scores at Kintz Avenue and
the IWL were 48 and 46 respectively, putting macroinvertebrates communities from both sites in
the exceptional range. The ICI score at Kintz Avenue dropped significantly from 2011, when a score
of 58 was recorded, and the score at the IWL increased significantly from the score of 40 recorded
in 2011. Much of Juday Creek has relatively poor
habitat due to historical modification and ditching
activities. However, it is a very stable stream and
flow does not fluctuate significantly like many other St. Joseph River tributaries. These stable conditions are likely one of the reasons why the macroinvertebrate communities thrive.

The Aquatics Program performed Index sampling
at Locust Road (S) on Auten Ditch for the second
time in 2014.
Initial baseline sampling commenced in 2013 and baseline sampling will be
completed during the summer of 2015. The IBI
score in 2014 of 13 was just slightly lower than
the score in 2013. This site, in the headwaters of
the Bowman Creek Watershed, is essentially a
small agricultural drainage ditch with very little
habitat for fish. The QHEI score for this site in
2014 was 38. IDEM considers QHEI scores below
51 to be inadequate to support aquatic life. Only
4 small tolerant fish species have been collected
at this site in the 2 years of sampling which supports the idea that habitat is inadequate. Water
quality issues related to agricultural drainage may
also be a limiting factor at this site.

Yellow Creek
The IBI score at the U.S. 20 Bypass on Yellow
Creek (40) was slightly above the baseline value
of 39 and significantly higher than score of 36 that
was obtained the last time it was sampled in 2011
(Table 7, Figure 10). This site underwent major
modifications for drainage purposes in 2003, dropping IBI scores to 31 at the time. The stream
channel was restored following 2003, but much of
the forest canopy and instream habitat at this location has not been replaced. Prior to 2003, this
site held large smallmouth bass that would migrate into the Yellow Creek from Elkhart River and
hold in the deep pools with dense vegetation.
While the IBI scores at this site appear to be slowly getting better with natural reestablishment of
habitat, the quality of the smallmouth bass population appears to be getting better as well.

Juday Creek
IBI scores for Juday Creek at the Izaak Walton
League (IWL) and at Kintz Avenue were in the
poor range and indicative of impaired fish communities (Figure 9 and Table 6). Because it is a
coolwater stream, we have assessed Juday Creek
using the conventional IBI system in addition to a
system that has been developed for coolwater
streams. Although both analytical methods provide different results, scores remain low. Our program has been experimenting with the two differ-

cent years, but the decline at SR 120 does represent a slight concern. This site offers exceptional
instream habitat (QHEI score 86) consisting of a
significant amount of woody debris, several riffle
and pool complexes, and highly variable substrates. The ICI score for this site (48) was down
significantly from the last time it was sampled in
2011, but still in the exceptional range. Macroinvertebrates were initially sampled at this site in
2008 producing the same ICI score of 48. Given
the lower index scores in 2014, the Aquatics Program will continue to pay close attention to this
site and the Little Elkhart River. It is our hope
that the reduced IBI score is merely a result of
natural influences.

Pine Creek
Pine Creek at the U.S. 20 Bypass continues to
have impaired fish communities (Table 7, Figure
10). This stream, while having relatively good
habitat at the U.S. 20 Bypass, has been highly
modified for drainage and is very unstable. Water
levels, flow and the input of sediment and other
pollutants will increase significantly in this stream
following a rain event. The Aquatics Program will
continue long-term monitoring of this stream.

Trout Creek
Little Elkhart River

IBI scores on Trout Creek at CR 2 have decreased
significantly since the completion of baseline monitoring (Table 8). While there does not appear to
be any obvious signs of water quality impairment
for this stream, there is an overabundance of sunfish, which negatively effects some of the IBI metrics. Trout Creek drains some relatively large

The Little Elkhart at SR 120 scored significantly
lower than its baseline value of 53 in 2014, posting the lowest score since the initiation of sampling at this site (Table 8, Figure 11). This stream

lakes in Michigan, connecting them with the St.
Joseph River in a little over a mile. Fish diversity
was also very low in 2014 relative to previous
years, which does present a slight concern. The
Aquatics Program will monitor this site closely in
the future.

Despite the restoration work that has been completed at this site, it is not very surprising that the
biological communities have not significantly benefited. Baugo Creek has an significant enrichment
problem (Deegan, 2014). It also has a very flashy
flow regime, meaning that water levels rise rapidly
following a rain event but will drop back to normal
levels relatively quickly. This instability in flow is
a result of how the watershed has been modified
for agricultural land use and drainage. According
to wetlands assessments of the Baugo Creek Watershed conducted by the Friends of the St. Joseph
River, approximately 90% of the wetlands in the
Baugo Creek system have been lost, resulting in a
loss of 90% of the watershed’s flood storage capacity (http://fotsjr.wildapricot.org/). Therefore,
when it rains, 90% of the water that was previously stored by wetlands is quickly sent to Baugo
Creek. Flooding events in Baugo Creek and other
local streams is strongly correlated with input of
sediment and other pollutants (Deegan 2013).

Puterbaugh Creek
Puterbaugh Creek at Reedy Drive has had relatively consistent scores since the initiation of monitoring at this location (Table 8). Since the completion of baseline monitoring, IBI scores have
been slightly higher than the baseline value.
Puterbaugh Creek has an interesting mix of both
warm and coolwater species. This creek has significant groundwater influences which help maintain cooler water temperatures. It drains Heaton
Lake to the St. Joseph River and is also connected
to East Lake in northeast Elkhart: all three bodies
of water are likely sources for the warmwater species found in Puterbaugh Creek.

Figure 12: IBI scores of Baugo Creek, Elkhart
and St. Joseph Counties

Baugo Creek
In 2014, Baugo Creek was sampled at the Restoration site for the first time since the completion
of baseline monitoring in 2012. The IBI score in
2014 was slightly lower than the baseline, while
the ICI score at the site was significantly lower
than the baseline. The Restoration site is a location where a significant amount of instream restoration work was completed in 2010 by the Elkhart
County Drainage Board in an effort to help stabilize the stream.
Several structures called “j
hooks” were placed in the stream and while the j
hooks have certainly promoted better instream
habitat, they do not appear to have significantly
benefited the biological communities at this location.

system and an indication that wetlands or some
form of water storage is needed to protect Baugo
Creek and the St. Joseph River downstream.

ble 10). This site has always scored very well and
hosts a high diversity of fish and insects. Fish
species such as the tadpole madtom and the river
chub, which are not common in other local
streams are abundant at CR 6. Hellgrammites
and other sensitive aquatic macroinvertebrates
are also abundant at this location.

Christiana Creek
In 2013 and 2014, the Aquatics Program sampled
multiple sites along Christiana Creek. The site at
County Road 6 was sampled as part of the ongoing long-term monitoring program. However, additional sites including Willowdale Park, North Main
Wellfield, and several investigative sites were
sampled as part of fish passage study of Christiana Creek. Results of 2013 and 2014 surveys confirm that dams and other barriers within the first
mile of Christiana Creek have a significant impact
on fish migration from the St. Joseph River. Being
the closest barrier to the St. Joseph River, the
dam at High Dive causes the greatest impact,
blocking about 15 species from swimming upstream. The Cassopolis Above site has very low

Macroinvertebrate sampling was conducted at 2
locations on Christiana Creek in 2014 (High Dive
Park and CR 6). ICI scores for High Dive Park (B)
and CR 6 were 46 and 50 respectively, putting the
macroinvertebrate communities for both sites in
the exceptional range.
Cobus Creek
Cobus Creek was sampled in 4 locations in 2014
to get a good overall picture of the health of this
stream (Table 11). Previously, Index sampling
has only occurred at CR 8 along Cobus Creek. IBI
scores were rather disappointing at the 4 sites
that were sampled, but all fell slightly higher than
the attainment value of 32 for coolwater streams.
Some interesting findings along Cobus Creek include naturally reproducing trout and high diversity of fish at the Elkhart Conservation Club
(Deegan, 2014.a). The Elkhart Conservation Club
(ECC) site is located close to its confluence of the
St. Joseph River. The ECC location is also located
downstream of at least three low head dams. Little fish diversity was observed at the locations upstream of the ECC suggesting that the dams might
be impacting fish movement into Cobus Creek.
Additional monitoring upstream and downstream
of the ECC will take place to see if that is the case.
The CR 8 site was also sampled in 2013 and at
that time, IBI scores were significantly lower than
the baseline. Results from 2014 indicate that the
site rebounded in 2014 with an IBI score falling
closer to the baseline.

three fish and compositing all fish into one sample. In addition, the Aquatics Program will often
sample the same fish species more than once to
get a more accurate understanding of contaminant
concentrations. The following narrative describes
results of the Aquatics Program’s fish tissue collections from Elkhart and St. Joseph Counties in
2014:

Fish Tissue
In 2014, tissue was collected from fish in both
Elkhart and St. Joseph Counties. Collections were
based on the current Fish Consumption Advisory
(FCA) for area streams and potential data gaps
within the FCA. The FCA provides guidance on the
rate of consumption of local wild fishes (Table 12),
based on the concentration of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) or mercury (Hg) concentrations in
their tissue. It should be noted that the State FCA
has more restrictive guidance for individuals that
are considered to be part of the “sensitive population.” Women who are pregnant or are breastfeeding, women who plan to have children, or children under the age of 15 are considered to be part
of the sensitive population. For more information
on local fish consumption, visit the Indiana State
Department
of
Health’s
website
(http://
www.in.gov/isdh/23650.htm).

Walleye, ranging from 14.3 to 15.1 inches long
were collected from the Elkhart River at Studebaker Park in Elkhart and Shanklin Park in Goshen. Walleye were stocked in the Elkhart River in
2012, by the Elkhart River Restoration Association, and have since grown to legal size for anglers to keep and consume. Results indicate very
low concentrations of both PCBs and Hg and there
should be no restrictions on consumption of walleye in this size range from the Elkhart River.
Black crappie are a species that are not listed in
the fish consumption advisory for the St. Joseph
River in Elkhart County. The Aquatics Program
collected samples of black crappie for the first
time in 2014. They have not been collected previously by our program for fish tissue because they
are difficult to collect with electrofishing equipment. However, three black crappie ranging from
10.2-10.8 inches were collected at the Six Span

Many variables play a role in contaminant concentrations in fish. In general, larger fish will tend to
have higher concentrations of contaminants in
their tissue. Concentrations of contaminants can
vary from one fish to another, so the methodology
for collecting tissue samples requires collecting

Sensitive Population— Women who are pregnant or are breastfeeding, women who plan to have children, or children under the age of 15, are considered to be part of the sensitive population. Future state

site in 2014. Based on low levels of PCBs and Hg,
the general population can consume unlimited
meals of black crappie in this size range.

we analyzed tissue from golden redhorse from
three different sections of the St. Joseph River in
South Bend. Our results for golden redhorse reflect lower concentrations in that species relative
to shorthead redhorse. It’s unknown as to why
shorthead redhorse accumulate more PCBs than
golden redhorse although it is likely related to
their feeding behavior.

Northern Pike, up to 30 inches, are listed in the
fish consumption advisory for the St. Joseph River
in Elkhart County. The advisory does not place
any restrictions on pike in this size range, with the
exception of the sensitive population, where the
guidance suggests limiting consumption to one
meal per week. In 2013 and 2014, the Aquatics
Program collected Northern Pike between 21 to 24
inches from the upper St. Joseph River in Elkhart.
Concentrations of Hg in the sample collected from
2014 were slightly higher putting them in the
range where recommended consumption would be
no more than one meal per week for the general
population and no more than one meal per month
for the sensitive population.
The Aquatics program will do follow up sampling with northern pike
in the coming years.

Figure 14: A shorthead redhorse (top) versus and golden redhorse (bottom). Note the
relatively “short” head and the red tail on
the shorthead redhorse

Bluegill, less than 8 inches long, were collected
from the Bridge Street site in Elkhart. Bluegill in
this size range are covered in the FCA with recommended consumption of 1 meal per week for the
sensitive population and no restrictions for the
general population. Our findings in 2014 were
consistent with the guidance in the FCA.
Bluegill in the 7 inch size range were collected
from Michigan Street in South bend in 2014. Our
data suggests that consumption of this species
should be limited to one meal every 2 months for
the general population and they should not be
eaten by the sensitive population. These results
concur with the state FCA.

Steelhead were collected from Darden Road. Our
program has collected steelhead on several of occasions because of their popularity as a sportfish
that are often kept and consumed by local residents and visiting anglers. Guidance for steelhead
over 30 inches in the state FCA is currently listed
as one meal every 2 months for members of the
general population and DO NOT EAT guidance for
sensitive individuals. Although the fish collected
by the Aquatics Program were slightly smaller
than 30 inches in 2014, our results agree with the
FCA.

Rock bass, approximately 8 inches in length, were
collected from Sample Street and Darden Road on
the St. Joseph River. Fish from both locations had
low levels of PCBs warranting restriction to 1 meal
per week for the general population and 1 meal
per month for the sensitive population. This guidance is consistent with the current FCA.

Conclusion

The Aquatics Program collected shorthead
redhorse from Michigan Street in South Bend. Our
program has collected several tissue samples from
this species previously, which have yielded relatively high PCB tissue concentrations. This years
tissue results were no different, and using FCA
guidance, shorthead redhorse should not be eaten
by the general or sensitive populations from this
section of the St. Joseph River. The FCA’s current
guidance for all redhorse species is 1 meal every
month for the general population and DO NOT EAT
guidance for the sensitive population.
In 2013,

Biological monitoring during the summer of 2014
suggests that the St. Joseph River continues to
thrive. Urban sites along the St. Joseph River at
Bridge Street in Elkhart and Angela Boulevard in
South Bend have highly diverse communities of
fish and insects reflecting the very high quality
and value of the St. Joseph River for residents of
both communities. As both communities continue
to implement their Combined Sewer Overflow—
Long Term Control Plans in the coming years, its
important to recognize that other efforts are also

and other impervious surfaces, which will also help
improve water quality in the St. Joseph River Watershed.

Our biological monitoring data suggest that while
the St. Joseph River is thriving and slightly improving, many of the tributaries to the St. Joseph
River continue to be impaired and show little signs
of improvement. The Elkhart River, for example,
has excellent habitat and some sensitive species
of fish and macroinvertebrates, but is continuously
suppressed by significant fluctuations in water levels and flow following storm events. Baugo Creek
is an extreme example of the same condition, a
result of wetlands loss, and symptom of a watershed that has been highly modified for draining
land quickly.

The solution to improving water quality in the St.
Joseph River Watershed is not an easy one. It’s
going to take across the board recognition that
what we do with our land affects the streams that
drain it. As it stands, most of the tributaries of
the St. Joseph River in both Counties are impaired
by E. coli bacteria, limiting their safety for recreational use through contact with the water. We’ve
come a long way in helping the St. Joseph River,
but we still have a lot of work to do.

Fish tissue preparation and results

Materials needed:
Reynolds aluminum foil
freezer wrap
deionized (DI) water
1/2 gallon, 1 gallon, and jumbo size freezer bags w/write-on labels
skinners
stainless steel fillet knives
knife sharpener
scalers
ice
cooler
A group of three fish per species was selected
based on size. The smallest fish in each group
was greater than or equal to 90% of the length
of the largest fish in that group. The largest fish
or fish that fell into a length range for species on
the advisory were selected. The fish were kept
as close in size as possible within a group because the tissue from the three fish in each
group was composited (mixed together) before
the analyses were completed.
All of the tissue was in the form of boneless fillets taken from the fish. All of the fish had skinon fillets taken. Before the tissue was removed,
the fillet knives, scalers and skinners were
cleaned and rinsed with DI water, and freezer
wrap was placed where the fish were to be processed. The knives, scalers and skinners were
washed in river water and rinsed with DI water
after each species was processed and new
freezer wrap was placed before another species

was processed.
For skin-on samples, the
scales were removed before the fillet was taken.
It was important to be consistent with where the
cut of the fillet ended and to not include any of
the body cavity or viscera. Once the fillets were
removed, they were rinsed in river water and
then rinsed with DI water before being placed
on aluminum foil. The foil was large enough to
hold the three fillets for each species at a site.
When all three fillets were placed on the foil, it
was then wrapped and placed in a labeled
freezer bag and placed on ice in a cooler. The
fish tissue was placed in a freezer upon returning to the lab, and kept frozen until sent to the
contract lab for analyses.

Appendix E

Summary of macroinvertebrates (insects) collected by site, 2014
Macroinvertebrates were collected in two ways to calculate the Invertebrate
Community Index (ICI). The first method employed a sampling device known
as a Hester-Dendy multi-plate sampler (HD sampler). Macroinvertebrates collected using this method were identified and counted (Quantitative column in
the following tables). The second method was a sweep with a net of all the
available habitat types in the area of the Hester-Dendy in an effort to identify
other macroinvertebrates in the stream that may not colonize the HD samplers. Macroinvertebrates collected in this way were identified and simply
counted as being present (Qualitative column).
