This resolution shall be in full force and effect upon adoption and compliance with IC 36-3-4-14.

PROPOSAL NO. 148, 2013. The proposal, sponsored by Councillors Adamson, Holliday, Lutz,
Hickman, Mansfield, Mascari, Moriarty Adams, Evans, Freeman, Pfisterer, Sandlin and Scales,
supports the decision of the Metropolitan Development Commission in Zoning Case No. 2011MOD-011 and urges the Indianapolis Airport Authority to terminate its present efforts to appeal
and overturn that zoning decision. Councillor Adamson said that the Airport and the Mayor’s
Office were opposed to this development and sought to overturn the ruling of the Metropolitan
Development Commission (MDC) in this zoning issue to prevent the project. He said that the
judge ruled against them, and they also received a second denial by two individual bodies. They
further appealed Judge Keele’s decision to the Supreme Court, and if they could not win, they
continued to delay the process through appeals until the proponents ran out of money to continue
to fight or until the land owner gave up. He said that it is a shame that it took a bi-partisan
resolution to prompt a new moment of clarity, and is a travesty as to how much time and dollars
have been wasted on this issue. He said that he did receive confirmation that the airport has
dropped their appeal and will finally allow the developer to get to work. It would be nice if they
would repay the developer the money they spent in litigation, but this is a start. He moved,
seconded by Councillor Lutz, to postpone the proposal indefinitely. Proposal No. 148, 2013 was
postponed by a unanimous voice vote.
Councillor Robinson reported that the Metropolitan and Economic Development Committee
heard Proposal Nos. 59 and 81, 2013 on April 29, 2013. He asked for consent to vote on these
proposals together. Consent was given.
PROPOSAL NO. 59, 2013. The proposal, sponsored by Councillor Lewis, reappoints Melissa
Coxey to the Metropolitan Board of Zoning Appeals, Division II. PROPOSAL NO. 81, 2013.
The proposal, sponsored by Councillor Lewis, appoints Vicki J. Wright as the large business,
Class I, representative to the Wellfield Education Corporation Board. By unanimous votes, the
Committee reported the proposals to the Council with the recommendation that it do pass.
Councillor Gooden asked for consent to abstain, as Ms. Coxey is a former member of the law
firm for which he works. Consent was given.
Councillor Robinson moved, seconded by Councillor Talley, for adoption. Proposal Nos. 59 and
81, 2013 were adopted on the following roll call vote; viz:
28 YEAS: Adamson, Barth, Brown, Cain, Evans, Freeman, Gray, Hickman, Holliday, Hunter,

during last year’s budget. The Mayor at that time said that it only impacted a few households, but
now they find out 200,000 homes will have to pay more property taxes. He said he was not in

of the study commission is to analyze the issue and have an honest conversation about how to
proceed. He said that they are not raising any taxes with this proposal. Councillor Oliver said

SPECIAL ORDERS - PUBLIC HEARING
PROPOSAL NO. 106, 2013. Councillor Moriarty Adams reported that the Public Safety and
Criminal Justice Committee heard Proposal No. 106, 2013 on May 1, 2013. The proposal,
sponsored by Councillor Moriarty Adams, appropriates $1,796,925 in the 2013 Budget of the
Department of Public Safety, Indianapolis Fire Department (Federal Grants Fund) to cover salary
and benefits of 30 new firefighters, financed by a SAFER grant. By a 7-0 vote, the Committee
reported the proposal to the Council with the recommendation that it do pass.
Councillor Brown said that this allows much needed recruits, and they have worked hard to
promote diversity. He said that the police department continues to lose staffing every day with no
plan to add officers.
Councillor Gray thanked Local 416 Firefighters Union past president Wayne Smith and his staff
for helping to secure this grant.
Councillor Mahern said that it is good to have more firefighters, but without enough police
officers to back them up, there will be more crime resulting in fires.

18

May 13, 2013

Councillor Oliver said that he wholeheartedly supports this proposal and admires IFD for
continuing to recruit and hire black firefighters. He said that he is happy to see this class moving
to increase the percentile of African American firefighters.
The President called for public testimony at 7:55 p.m. There being no one present to testify,
Councillor Moriarty Adams moved, seconded by Councillor Simpson, for adoption. Proposal

SPECIAL ORDERS - FINAL ADOPTION
PROPOSAL NO. 82, 2013. Councillor Robinson reported that the Metropolitan and Economic
Development Committee heard Proposal No. 82, 2013 on April 29, 2013. The proposal,
sponsored by Councillors Barth, Adamson, Cain, Moriarty Adams, McQuillen, Miller and Osili,
confirms the designation of certain real property as a high technology district area and that
qualified property owned by ExactTarget, Inc is exempt from property taxation. By an 8-0 vote,
the Committee reported the proposal to the Council with the recommendation that it do pass.
Councillor Gray asked where this project is located. Jack Sweeney, GINOVUS, said that there
are several facilities, including 20 N. Meridian and 433 N. Capitol. Councillor Gray asked how
many dollars will be given up in property taxes. Mr. Sweeney said that it is $4 million.
Councillor Gray asked if this is per year. Mr. Sweeney said that this is over the total 10-year
period of the exemption.

20

May 13, 2013

Councillor Mahern asked what the prior abatement amount was that was granted to ExactTarget,
Inc. Mr. Sweeney said that he is not sure. Councillor Mahern asked if it was similar to this. Mr.
Sweeney said that it would have been somewhat proportionate. Councillor Mahern said that they
just considered a proposal to study increasing residential property tax bills in a time when the
budget is tight and they cannot afford to hire more police officers. Yet proposals like these hand
out millions of dollars, with complete total tax forgiveness, when revenues are so scarce. He said
that there is already a tax increment financing (TIF) district downtown, and therefore, an already
heavy tax burden. He asked his colleagues not to support the proposal.
Councillor Miller asked how many jobs this proposal will bring or maintain and said if this does
not occur, Exact Target could take their dollars and investment anywhere, where deals might even
be better. Mr. Sweeney said that they created 500 jobs with their last project and propose 1,088
jobs will be retained and 500 new jobs created with this project.
Councillor Cain said that Exact Target has their world headquarters downtown, with 1500
employees, and they have invested in this City and are committed to staying downtown. She said
that this investment is sure to garner even more, and they will hire up to 300 employees this year
alone, keeping downtown viable.
Councillor Adamson said that they are committed to bringing 500 new jobs to Marion County at
an average salary of $49 an hour. This will help to stimulate the economy, and the abatement
does not exist, because property taxes on this do not exist yet. With the abatement, they are
essentially shoring up more tax revenue for the future.
Councillor Pfisterer asked if there is a clawback in the agreement if commitments are not met.
Mr. Sweeney responded in the affirmative and said that the abatement could be terminated or
repayment demanded if they fail to retain or produce the jobs or make the investments promised.
Councillor Pfisterer said that they will either get jobs or their money back, so it seems like a winwin situation to her.
Councillor Lutz asked if Exact Target reached their goals in the previous abatement. Mr.
Sweeney said that they reached their goals quicker than projected and exceeded their goal of 1088
jobs with 1100 jobs at an average of $80,000 per year.
Councillor Brown asked how many of those workers are Marion County residents. Mr. Sweeney
said that over half live in Marion County. Councllor Brown asked how many of the Marion
County workers are making the higher amounts if the total jobs average out at $49 an hour. Mr.
Sweeney said that he does not have that data with him, but there is not a big spread in the
employment ranges. Councillor Brown asked how much it would cost to move their company.
Mr. Sweeney said that it is not a matter of moving, because they want to continue to make
investments in downtown Indianapolis.
Councillor Mascari asked how people can go about applying for these jobs. Mr. Sweeney said
that he can get the information to the Council.
Councillor Mahern said that the government is run by property tax and income taxes. The
testimony has been that half of these jobs will not pay income tax in Marion County. That means
some will live in property whose taxes do not support the infrastructure downtown. He said that
it is nice to say so many jobs were created, but they need to hold these businesses’ feet to the fire.
He said that they have already partnered with them, and now as long as they are here, they will

21

Journal of the City-County Council

want the city to invest in them every time they want to create another job. He said that this is not
sustainable, and he strongly opposes the proposal.
Councillor Adamson said that the ratios of gain versus cost were talked about in committee, and
asked what the cost is versus the gain in income tax even with only 50% of these new employees
contributing in Marion County. Mr. Sweeney said that he does not have those numbers.
Councillor Adamson said that he thinks it was for every dollar they give up, they gain $3.
Councillor Hickman said that she is torn about abatements, but being realistic, they are spending
about $3,000 per employee.
Councillor Hunter said that the study commision has nothing to do with this proposal, and
Councillor Mahern has offered legislation for many bi-partisan study commissions. He said that
it is a good thing, and sometimes there is a fine balance when competing with the region for
economic development.
Councillor Barth stated that Exact Target is scattered all around downtown, and in many historic
buildings, keeping certain areas strong. They could move to other areas where there is more
engineering talent. There are other tangibles at play, because the feedback is that they are
attracting talent from the cost and keeping graduates from Indiana and Purdue University in
Indiana, when they might otherwise go elsewhere.
Councillor Sandlin agreed and said that the technical community is beating up the city all the time
for not protecting these technical companies in a very competitive environment. He said that just
this evening they honored young technical minds at Arsenal Tech High School, the reading rock
stars and through Tamika Catchings’ foundation. He said that they need to bring well-paying
jobs to Indianapolis to keep the brains from going elsewhere.
Councillor Gray asked what happens when they give up all their tax dollars and the streets
deteriorate and everyone moves out to Hamilton County. He said that this could happen if they
continue to give away tax dollars.
Councillor McQuillen asked what Councillor Hickman meant when she said it was costing them
$3,000 per taxpayer. Councillor Hickman said that it was costing them $3,000 for each
employee, based on 1500 employees.
Councillor Oliver asked if they will no longer pay taxes downtown. Mr. Sweeney said that they
will continue to pay taxes downtown, and the abatement is just for the additional investment. He
said that the estimated value in the new investment is $3.3 million. He added that 67% of current
employees are Marion County residents. Councillor Oliver said that he does not support the
proposal.
Councillor Cain said that the total COIT projected is $619,000 per year, and the investment is $35
million with the result of $14 milllon in assessed value in the first year of oeration. During the
abatement they will pay $10,4000 annually on their existing property, and then $329,500 annually
after the abatement expires. She said that what the city is gaining outweighs the spending.
Councillor Mansfield moved, seconded by Councillor Talley, to call the question and end debate.
Debate was ended on the following roll call vote; viz:

22

May 13, 2013

25 YEAS: Adamson, Barth, Brown, Cain, Evans, Freeman, Gooden, Gray, Hickman, Holliday,
Lewis, Mahern, Mansfield, Mascari, McQuillen, Miller, Moriarty Adams, Osili, Pfisterer,
Robinson, Sandlin, Scales, Shreve, Simpson, Talley
4 NAYS: Hunter, Lutz, McHenry, Oliver

Councillor Robinson moved, seconded by Councillor Moriarty Adams, for adoption. Proposal
No. 82, 2013 was adopted on the following roll call vote; viz:
24 YEAS: Adamson, Barth, Cain, Evans, Freeman, Gooden, Hickman, Holliday, Hunter,
Lewis, Lutz, Mansfield, Mascari, McHenry, McQuillen, Miller, Moriarty Adams, Osili,
Pfisterer, Sandlin, Scales, Shreve, Simpson, Talley
5 NAYS: Brown, Gray, Mahern, Oliver, Robinson

Councillor Mahern asked to explain his vote. Consent was given. Councillor Mahern told
citizens to brace themselves because there would be increased pressure on their taxes because of
the city giving their money away to businesses like this.
Proposal No. 82, 2013 was retitled GENERAL RESOLUTION NO. 9, 2013, and reads as
follows:
CITY-COUNTY GENERAL RESOLUTION NO. 9, 2013
PROPOSAL FOR A GENERAL RESOLUTION to confirm the designation of certain real property as a high

boundaries of the City and therefore qualifies as qualified property, as defined in the Act; and
WHEREAS, the Applicant has requested that the City-County Council take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary
pursuant to the Act to exempt the Qualified Property from property taxation; and

PROPOSAL NO. 85, 2013. Councillor Brown reported that the Public Works Committee heard
Proposal No. 85, 2013 on April 18, 2013. The proposal was postponed at the full Council on
April 22, 2013. The proposal, sponsored by Councillor Gray, authorizes parking restrictions on
Pennsylvania Street from 48th to 49th Street (District 8). Councillor Brown deferred to
Councillor Gray.
Councillor Gray said that this issue has become one of the greatest parking issues he has ever
encountered while serving on the Council. He said that this has become a battle between
businesses and residents, as to who was there first and a 25-year plan one of the neighborhood
associations did. He said that the Mayor has said he would veto the proposal if it passes, which
seems silly for a parking sign. Prior to tonight’s meeting, he spoke with the director of the
Department of Public Works, and they will be meeting with businesses and neighbors to come up
with an alternative plan. He moved, seconded by Councillor McQuillen, to return Proposal No.
85, 2013 to committee. Proposal No. 85, 2013 was returned to committee on the following roll
call vote; viz:
29 YEAS: Adamson, Barth, Brown, Cain, Evans, Freeman, Gooden, Gray, Hickman, Holliday,
Hunter, Lewis, Lutz, Mahern, Mansfield, Mascari, McHenry, McQuillen, Miller, Moriarty
Adams, Oliver, Osili, Pfisterer, Robinson, Sandlin, Scales, Shreve, Simpson
0 NAYS:

Councillor Barth said that he has also been engaged in these discussions, as he lives just down the
road, and he thanked Councillor Gray for his leadersship and is glad they will have additional
time to come up with a solution.
PROPOSAL NO. 108, 2013. Councillor Moriarty Adams reported that the Public Safety and
Criminal Justice Committee heard Proposal No. 108, 2013 on May 1, 2013. The proposal,
sponsored by Councillor Moriarty Adams, amends the Code to add a new member to the
domestic violence fatality review team from a domestic violence coordinated community
response organization. By a 7-0 vote, the Committee reported the proposal to the Council with
the recommendation that it do pass.
Councillor McQuillen asked if the current make-up of the team is fifteen members. Councillor
Moriarty Adams said that there are currently nine members, with the option to go up to 15
members. This change will make it 10 members.
Councillor Moriarty Adams moved, seconded by Councillor Talley, for adoption. Proposal No.
108, 2013 was adopted on the following roll call vote; viz:
29 YEAS: Adamson, Barth, Brown, Cain, Evans, Freeman, Gooden, Gray, Hickman, Holliday,

PRESENTATION OF PETITIONS, MEMORIALS, SPECIAL RESOLUTIONS, AND

PROPOSAL NO. 104, 2016. Councillor Oliver reported that the Parks and Recreation
Committee heard Proposal No. 104, 2016 on March 17, April 14, July 21 and August 18, 2016.

and Recreation. By a 7-0 vote, the Committee reported the proposal to the Council with the
recommendation that it do pass.
Councillor McQuillen asked when the Parks Committee is scheduled to hear the Parks Budget.
Councillor Oliver said that it is scheduled for their next meeting on September 29, 2016.
Councillor McQuillen asked if they are then adding another meeting after that for the review and
analysis. Councillor Oliver said that they are not and plan to both hear the budget and vote on it
at that same meeting. Councillor Adamson said that the budget has been presented to the Board
of Parks and Recreation, and the City website has archives of those meetings for committee
members to watch online. Councillor Oliver said that this is correct, and he does not believe
there is anything in the Code that prohibits them from hearing and voting on the budget on the
same evening. Councillor Biesecker added that the reason it was not heard on August 18, as
scheduled is because the Parks Board had not yet heard the budget. They had their hearing,
which was a public hearing, a week later, and this meeting is available in Channel 16’s archives.
He added that there will be a public hearing for all budgets at the September 26th Council
meeting, and the budgets themselves have been online for some time for review by the public.
Councillor Oliver moved, seconded by Councillor Gray, for adoption. Proposal No. 104, 2016

SPECIAL ORDERS - PUBLIC HEARING
PROPOSAL NO. 282, 2016. Councillor Simpson reported that the Administration and Finance
Committee heard Proposal No. 282, 2016 on August 23, 2016. The proposal, sponsored by
Councillor Simpson, approves an additional appropriation of $185,000 in the 2016 Budget of the
Information Services Agency (Enhanced Access Fund) to cover the cost of building a Reference
World Information and Simulation Environment (R-WISE) model. By a 6-0 vote, the Committee
reported the proposal to the Council with the recommendation that it do pass.
The President called for public testimony at 7:24 p.m.
Larry Vaughn, citizen, said that he was outside this evening downtown and there was a line of
folks with ankle bracelets on Delaware Street. He said that this is ridiculous, and the arbitrary
laws the Council continues to pass are just causing more and more arrests, and this is what this is
all about. President Lewis asked Mr. Vaughn to keep his remarks germane to Proposal No. 282,
2016. Mr. Vaughn said that they are paying $185,000 for a system from outside of the City when
they already have all the data they need compiled within the city.
Councillor Robinson asked for consent to abstain from voting on this proposal, as his employer is
also considering using a similar tool from Purdue. Consent was given.
Councillor Simpson moved, seconded by Councillor Adamson, for adoption. Proposal No. 282,
2016 was adopted on the following roll call vote; viz:

PROPOSAL NO. 285, 2016. Councillor Osili reported that the Metropolitan and Economic
Development Committee heard Proposal No. 285, 2016 on August 29, 2016. The proposal,
sponsored by Councillors Osili and Miller, approves the issuance of special taxing district
refunding bonds in an amount not to exceed $58 million to provide advance refunding of the 2008
Bonds and issuance of new bonds (including funding a reserve), for the J.W. Marriott hotel
project and related infrastructure, public spaces and other local public improvements, in order to
realize substantial savings. By an 8-0 vote, the Committee reported the proposal to the Council
with the recommendation that it do pass.
Councillor Pfisterer asked when the new bond will be paid off. Sarah Riordan, director of the
Indianapolis Municipal Bond Bank, stated that the current bond is callable in 2018, and they will
borrow money to refund that bond in 2018, and it will be paid off the same time as the originally
issued bond, 2028.
The President called for public testimony at 7:28 p.m.
Mr. Vaughn said that this program has cost this city over $300 million and left them open to
lawsuits. He said that J.W. Marriott has plenty of money, but are coming and asking the City to
give them more. He said that this is the same thing that happened to Detroit, with colored people
in charge bringing in defacto corporations that will never pay off their debt. He said that the
Council needs to stop this practice now.
Councillor Osili moved, seconded by Councillor Adamson, for adoption. Proposal No. 285, 2016
was adopted on the following roll call vote; viz:

2008 Bonds and (ii) issuing the Bonds, including funding a reserve for the Bonds, if necessary; and

PROPOSAL NO. 283, 2016. Councillor Simpson reported that the Administration and Finance
Committee heard Proposal No. 283, 2016 on August 30, 2016. The proposal, sponsored by
Councillor Lewis, expresses the intent of the Consolidated City and County to issue bonds in an
amount not to exceed $75 million to reimburse prior expenditures of various City departments
17

Journal of the City-County Council

and County agencies with bond proceeds. By a 6-2 vote, the Committee reported the proposal to
the Council with the recommendation that it do pass.
Chair Simpson asked Ms. Riordan and City Controller, Fady Qaddoura, to briefly explain the
intent of the proposal. Ms. Riordan said that this proposal does not issue bonds, but that is
something they hope to bring back to the Council to issue bonds before the end of the year. This
proposal is simply asking the Council to approve reimbursement of expenses on certain approved
projects if these bonds are eventually approved for issuance. Mr. Qaddoura said that they are
proposing a viable option for the budget to remove certain capital expenditures from the operating
budget. He said that they will introduce another proposal with the actual bond issuance and
projects detailed, and this proposal simply authorizes reimbursement if the bonds are ultimately
approved by the Council. Bart Brown, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) for the Council, stated that
these reimbursements are for expenses already approved through the budget process and are not
for any projects not already in the budget. He said that they are simply reimbursements for
projects such as the E-911 system, which is already in the Sheriff’s budget.
Councillor Freeman said that this makes absolutely no sense. He asked why they are considering
bonding for funding for projects that have already been approved. He said that this is not all
already approved spending. The Controller told him that the Indianapolis Fire Department (IFD)
was getting $7 million more to build two new fire stations. Yet, they are closing two fire stations
that are already paid for to build new ones, and these expenses are not already approved. The
Mayor likes to tout a balanced budget spending less money than last year, but they really cannot
say that they are spending less money or being fiscally prudent, when they are bonding $75
million in order to be able to sustain this lowered budget. He said that the City should not be in
the business of bonding. He said if they need to bond to fund specific projects that are
desperately needed, such as the CAD (computer aided dispatch) system, then they should come to
the Council, show them the need and the justification, and ask for approval. He said that this is
giving the administration a blank check, and he cannot support the proposal.
Councillor Miller said that he watched the committee meeting and was planning to support the
proposal, but he has some real concerns about the wording “official intent” in the proposal. This
is more than just saying they are okay with reimbursements should they choose to issue bonds.
He agrees they should be proactive and smart, and the reimbursement makes sense, but he does
not know why this wording is included. He said that if he agrees to “officially declare his intent”
to issue bonds, and then later finds out, once the details are provided, that he does not like the
idea of bonding for these particular projects, he feels he cannot go against the “official intent.”
He said that he would be able to support the proposal to allow for greater flexibility in
reimbursements if they could change that language. But with that language, he cannot support it.
Before saying he intends to do somethng he would like all information up front, and a one-page
description of possible projects is not enough information, and he feels strong-armed. He said
that he understands they may deal with the public works projects separately, and he does not
object to that, but these are still a part of the budget, as $20 million worth of projects are needed.
Fred Biesecker, General Counsel, said that this is not binding, and the proposal is phrased that
way because that is the way the Internal Revenue Service regulations are phrased. He said that
this proposal does not endorse or pre-approve the bonds in anyway; it simply says if and when the
bonds are passed, it is permissable to go back 60 days from today to reimburse such capital
expenditures as the voting machines, which have already been approved for payment.
Ms. Riordan said that this is not binding and it cannot be enforced, but simply sets it up so that
ongoing expenditures can be reimbursed if and when the Council decides to issue bonds, in order

18

September 12, 2016

to take pressure off budgets next year. She said that many of the projects will have to be paid for
anyway, but if they choose not to issue bonds, the expenditures will be paid out of operating
budgets and they do not have as much flexibility. Tenley Drescher-Rhodes, bond counsel, stated
that they are simply complying with Treasury regulations. In order to issue bonds, they will have
to come back before the Council with at least two, if not three, different resolutions and
ordinances, which will involve a lengthy process with several meetings and public hearings,
stretching into November in a best-case scenario. If this is passed this evening, and bonds are not
issued, then this proposal has no effect.
Councillor Gray said that all administrations and Council members have an opinion of how best
to do things, but this is a good deal for the city, as they are not creating any new debt. He
encouraged his colleagues to support the proposal and move forward with a flexible
reimbursement plan.
Councillor Coats said that he cannot support this proposal, specifically because of the inclusion of
$20 million bonding for public works projects. He said that the City received an additional
distribution from the State of $52 million, $39 million of which must be used for roads. In
talking to various legislators, he has no reason to believe they will back off the requirement that
this $39 million must be used for roads.
Councillor Gray said that they are talking about two different things and this has nothing to do
with the $39 million distribution.
Chair Simpson encouraged his colleagues to read the minutes of the meeting, as there are eight
pages dedicated to this proposal. He said that the committee did a good job in thoroughly vetting
this proposal and asking tough questions, and they did not short-change this Council.
Councillor Sandlin said that he cannot support this proposal. He said that this proposed bond
issuance is for $75 million, with an approximate 15-year bond life, as relayed in testimony at the
committee hearing. He said that the one-page document given to Councillors regarding what this
bond would fund includes the CAD system, which will cost $5 million for a system with a 10year life span. He said that the voting machines are on the list, and they have already been
financed and approved, but there is $3.4 million on this list for equipment with a 10-year life. He
said that he is not sure any technology equipment has a 10-year life expectancy anymore. He said
that there is $5.3 million for police vehicles and $3 millionfor fire apparatus. He said that the
proposed aerial truck is suggested to have a five-year life, but most have a 10-year life. He said
that he finds this list to be inaccurate, and they are talking about bonding for 15 years for things
that will not even last the length of the bonds. He said that they cannot pay bills today using
future dollars that outlast viable assets. He said he knows the City is in a tight financial situation,
and this is an attempt to be creative in solving some of those financial woes, but he cannot
support this solution.
Councillor Evans said that he will support this proposal this evening, but wants to go on record,
that as it has been presented today, he will be voting no on the issuance of bonds for roads
projects when they have $39 million already available to them for those projects.
Councillor Miller said that the committee did do a great job vetting this proposal, but he is not a
lawyer, and his constituents will not understand this kind of commitment, even if the IRS does
ask for that specific language. He said that something this important should go to all Council
members and not just one committee.

Journal of the City-County Council

Councillor Clay asked if he is correct in his understanding that this only provides a provision for
reimbursement and in no way binds the Council to issue bonds. He asked if the City will come
back later and drill futher down on particulars. Mr. Brown said that this is correct. He said that
this is not a fiscal ordinance and does not authorize the spending of any money. He added that
the term is not necessarily 15 years, and the Council will see separate bond issuances, and the
term life will depend on the life of the assets. Councillor Clay asked if when this comes back in
the form of a fiscal ordinance, if it will go through the normal committee process. Mr. Brown
said that it will, and that it can be amended, if the Council so wishes, throughout that process.
Councillor Coats said that he is fully aware that this proposal is not about the $39 million in the
Rainy Day Fund, but it makes no sense to borrow $20 million, which is proposed by this bond
issuance plan, for road infrastructure when they have $39 in the bank ready to go dedicated for
that purpose. He said that it makes no sense.
Councillor Jackson said that this does not authorize the Council or the departments to spend
money, and she supports it, as it will free up operating monies. She said most corporations spread
capital improvement projects out over several years and do not include them in their operating
budgets. She said that she agrees it would have been nice to have more details on the projects,
but if they do not approve this, they cannot reimburse monies for some much-needed projects.
She said if ultimately the Council does not agree with the bond issuance plan, they can scratch
this whole thing.
Councillor Pfisterer said that the plan proposes bonding $20 million for roads. She does not
understand why they would be willing to pay a debt service, when they already have money in
hand that could be spent without paying interest. She asked how much interest would be paid on
this $75 million bond over its lifetime. Ms. Riordan said that it would be difficult to precisely
calculate. She said that there is favorable borrowing right now, and it would depend on the
principal amount. Interest rates now are between 2 and 3%, but there are too many variables to
predict exactly, as the bonds could be structured in many different ways, such as paying more upfront or at the end. Councillor Pfisterer asked if issuing the bonds piece-meal for these projects
would increase the issuance costs. Ms. Riordan said that it would. Councillor Pfisterer said that
from her experience, the interest usually equates to the original amount of the bonds. She said
that this is like her daughter asking to borrow $1,000, but she does not know if she is going to
spend it at Tiffany’s or at Walmart.
Councillor Freeman said that he appreciates the need to come up with new ideas, but this is
wrong. He said that giving agencies the ability to spend money and tell them they will take care
of them later is not good practice. He said that some of these agencies have already spent the
money. He said that this reminds him of legislation back in February or March when they were
told they must pass the flood insurance proposal or citizens would lose their flood insurance. He
said that he does not want a gun pointed to his head making a decision down the road. They are
giving them the ability to spend money, and they will come back and say the Council told them of
their intent to reimburse them back in September, and then the Council will have to come up with
the money to pay the bill. That is why he opposes the proposal.
Councillor McHenry said that no one buys a car or house and then goes to the bank and asks them
to give them the money to pay for it after the fact. She said that the State already gave the City
money for roads, and she feels they could give some range of expected interest to be paid on
these bonds.

Councillor McQuillen said that what they are considering with this proposal is disgraceful. The
Mayor has been touting unprecedented budget savings, but nothing has really been cut. Now that
they see the full picture, the Mayor wants to spend an additional $75 million off the books in the
form of issuing debt. Ninety minutes ago, members were given one sheet of paper with a
thumbnail sketch of how these bond proceeds will be spent. One of those items is road
infrastructure. There is over $50 million in additional distribution from the State, with $39
million specifically earmarked for road infrastructure. It would be fiscally irresponsible for them
to mortgage their children’s future when they have the money in the bank. He urged his
colleagues to oppose the proposal.
Councillor Gray said that for four years the Republicans spent money like water, and they still do
not know how much was spent or where it all went.
Councillor Mascari agreed and said that this is about transparency, and the Council had no say in
money spent on BlueIndy or a Cricket field. He said that he supports the proposal.
Councillor Kreider said that this is not about past administrations, because if it were, they are still
paying on a $100 million debt from former Mayor Bart Peterson’s administration. It is best to
look forward, and it is not wise to take out bonds in this amount for something they already have
money for.
Councillor Adamson asked his colleagues to tread lightly on this new show of fiscal conservatism
by the Republicans, when it was absent the last four years. He said that this bond issuance will
come back in multiple proposals, and Councillors will get the opportunity to vote on each priority
as they see fit.
Councillor Gray moved, seconded by Councillor Simpson, to call the question and end debate.
Debate was ended on the following roll call vote; viz:
21 YEAS: Adamson, Clay, Coats, Cordi, Evans, Fanning, Freeman, Gray, Jackson, Johnson,
Kreider, Lewis, Mascari, McQuillen, Miller, Oliver, Osili, Pfisterer, Ray, Robinson, Simpson

PROPOSAL FOR A GENERAL RESOLUTION to confirm the designation of certain real property as a high

property taxation, pursuant to IC § 6-1.1-10-44.
WHEREAS, IC § 6-1.1-10-44 (the “Act”) allows an exemption of property taxes attributable to the installation of
enterprise information technology equipment which is purchased after June 30, 2012 (the “Qualified Property”) by an eligible
business; and
WHEREAS, the City of Indianapolis, Indiana (the "City") is a municipality located in the State of Indiana and the Act
empowers the City-County Council of the Consolidated City of Indianapolis and Marion County (the "City-County Council")
acting as the fiscal body and designating body of the City pursuant to the Act to designate an area located within the City’s
corporate boundaries as a high technology district area (“High Technology District Area”) thereby allowing the City-County
Council to specify that certain Qualified Property is exempt from property taxation and to determine the length of the
exemption period for such Qualified Property by following a procedure involving adoption of a declaratory resolution,
provision of public notice, conducting a public hearing, entering into an agreement between the City-County Council and the
eligible business concerning the property tax exemption, and adoption of a final resolution confirming, modifying or
rescinding the declaratory resolution; and
WHEREAS, the Applicant has submitted information to the City evidencing that the Applicant is an eligible business, as
defined in the Act, and that the equipment the Applicant intends to purchase and install on certain real estate located within the
corporate boundaries of the City (the “Applicant’s Qualified Property Sites”), as shown and described on Exhibit A, attached
hereto, is enterprise information technology equipment for use by the Applicant in its facilities located within the corporate
boundaries of the City and therefore qualifies as qualified property, as defined in the Act (“Qualified Property”); and
WHEREAS, the Applicant has requested that the City-County Council take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary
pursuant to the Act to exempt the Qualified Property from property taxation; and
WHEREAS, the City-County Council adopted General Resolution No. _____, 2016 (Proposal No. 266, 2016) (the
“Declaratory Resolution”) on August 15, 2016, pursuant to the Act, provisionally designating the Applicant’s Qualified
Property Sites as a High Technology District Area and specifying that certain enterprise information technology
equipment, more particularly described in Exhibit B (the “Applicant’s Qualified Property”), attached hereto, that the
Applicant intends to purchase and install on Applicant’s Qualified Property Sites, which are located in an area eligible
for designation as a High Technology District Area, is exempt from property taxation for an exemption period of ten
(10) years; and
WHEREAS, the City-County Council has caused to be published a notice (the “Notice”) pursuant to the Act and
IC Chapter 5-3-1 stating the adoption and substance of the Declaratory Resolution, including notice that the CityCounty Council would hold a public hearing in accordance with the Act on August 29, 2016; and
WHEREAS, the City-County Council, in accordance with the Act, has caused to be filed a copy of the Notice and
the Declaratory Resolution with the Marion County Assessor, each taxing unit in Marion County and the officers of
each taxing unit which is authorized to fix budgets, tax rates, and tax levies under IC § 6-1.1-17-5 in the City at least
ten (10) days prior to the date of the public hearing; and
WHEREAS, at the public hearing held on the date hereof (the “Public Hearing”), the City-County Council
received, heard and considered any remonstrances and objections from interested persons and heard evidence
concerning the proposed exemption of the Applicant’s Qualified Property; and
WHEREAS, after considering the evidence presented at the Public Hearing, the City-County Council desires to
take final action designating the Applicant’s Qualified Property Sites as a High Technology District Area and
determining that Qualified Property owned by Applicant shall be exempt from taxation for a period of ten (10) years;
now, therefore:
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CITY-COUNTY COUNCIL OF THE

the City-County Council is hereby authorized and directed to execute the Memorandum of Agreement on behalf of the

SPECIAL ORDERS - PUBLIC HEARING
PROPOSAL NO. 169, 2006. Councillor Bowes reported that the Community Affairs Committee
heard Proposal No. 169, 2006 on May 8, 2006. The proposal, sponsored by Councillors Bowes
and Conley, approves the issuance of Marion County, Indiana, Family and Children Fund General
Obligation Notes, Series 2006, in an original aggregate principal amount not to exceed
$32,250,000 and appropriating the proceeds of the borrowing. By a 4-0 vote, the Committee
reported the proposal to the Council with the recommendation that it do pass.
Councillor Salisbury said that he opposes financing an annual bill with a long-term bond, as it is
like paying a light bill with a credit card. He said that he also is opposed because it raises
property taxes.
Councillor Bowes stated that the Council voted last year to keep the appropriation for the Office
of Family and Children (OFC) at the 2004 level. However, they are forced under state law to
provide money to the OFC, or the federal government can takethe money anyway, which takes
money away from vital programs. He said that they had hoped that the General Assembly would
take action to help the counties not incur these increases, but that did not happen. This is a case
where the state decides how the local government spends their money.
Barbara Lawrence, executive director of the Indianapolis Bond Bank, stated that when they
realized there was a shortfall in OFC, they felt this was the best mechanism to pay it off with a
tax rate levied in 2007. Councillor Salisbury asked if this tax will only be levied for one year.
Ms. Lawrence said that this is correct. She said they are allowed by state law to issue bonds for a
10-year period, but it makes better sense to do it in one year. Councillor Salisbury asked if they
will have to do the same again next year. President Gray said that they may have to, unless
something changes in the State legislature.
Councillor Bradford said that they have been running OFC like this for many, many years. If the
Council cuts their budget every year, then they have to re-appropriate more money to make ends
meet, anyway. He said that he supports this proposal because he believes Juvenile Court Judge
Marilyn Moores is doing the best job she can with what she has been given. He said that this
problem is not going to go away, and the City has been going to the legislature for years to get
changes, but this is an issue with problems on both sides of the aisle.
Councillor Bowes said that they could have included extra funds in the budget last year, but
instead kept it level. He said that they could have still been short, because there is no way to
make a prediction. Because of the increase in people being serviced and the lack of control, even
an increase in appropriations might not have been enough.

275

Journal of the City-County Council

Councillor Mahern asked if there is any way to insure that this additional amount will be enough.
Councillor Bowes said that there is no way to accurately predict, depending on the number of
children OFC serves. If the numbers stay level, they will not have to ask for more.
Councillor Borst said that this is one area where both parties need to really work together on. He
said that dynamics are changing in the legislature, and they need to continue to dialogue with the
state regarding this matter. He said that it is not fair that the state spends the money, but the City
has to pay the bill.
Councillor Bradford said that he does not see the bills going down, as there is an increase in the
number of CHIN (Children in Need of Services) cases every year. He said that they need to be
prepared for the worst and save as much money in reserve as they can in case there are changes in
the law again.
President Gray called for public testimony at 8:25 p.m. There being no one present to testify,
Councillor Bowes moved, seconded by Councillor Conley, for adoption. Proposal No. 169, 2006
was adopted on the following roll call vote; viz:
23 YEAS: Abduallah, Borst, Bowes, Boyd, Bradford, Brown, Cockrum, Conley, Day, Franklin,

WHEREAS, the Council hereby finds and determines that the County will not have sufficient moneys
available or provided for in the existing budgets and tax levies which may be applied to pay for the
Project, making it a necessity for the making of the additional appropriation hereinafter set out; and
WHEREAS, notice of a public hearing on such additional appropriation has been duly given by
publication as required by law, and the hearing on said additional appropriation has been held, at which

“Director of the OFMC”), the County Executive, and the Bond Bank; provided, however, the Notes shall
have a final maturity which is no later than December 31, 2008; provided, further, however, at or after
the date such Notes are issued, the Director of the OFMC and the County Executive may extend the final
maturity of the Notes to a date which is no later than December 31, 2011, if the Director of the OFMC
and the County Executive determine extension of the final maturity is necessary or desirable. The Notes
may be subject to optional redemption prior to final maturity in accordance with the terms and conditions
identified in the Qualified Entity Purchase Agreement (as hereinafter defined). The Notes shall bear a
maximum interest rate not exceeding eight percent per annum (8.00%) (such rate to be determined
pursuant to negotiations with the Bond Bank), and will be purchased by the Bond Bank for a discount not
greater than one percent (1.00%); provided such discount shall not take into account any costs of the
Project paid by the Bond Bank prior to the issuance of the Notes and any costs related to the issuance of
the Notes paid by the Bond Bank. The Notes will be issued to the Bond Bank pursuant to the Qualified
Entity Purchase Agreement and be subject to the provisions set forth in this resolution and such
additional terms and conditions as agreed to by the the County Executive, the Director of the OFMC, the

accordance with their terms and the whole amount of the principal and interest so due and payable upon
the Notes or such portion thereof then outstanding shall be paid, or (1) sufficient moneys, or (ii) direct
obligations of, or obligations the principal of and interest on which are unconditionally guaranteed by the

moneys for such purpose, or (iii) time certificates of deposit of a bank or banks, fully secured as to both
principal and interest by obligations of the kind described in clause (ii) above, the principal of and
interest on which when due will provide sufficient moneys for such purpose, shall be held in trust for
such purpose, then and in such event the Notes or such portion thereof shall no longer be deemed
outstanding or an indebtedness of the County.
SECTION 4. In order to preserve the exclusion from gross income of interest on the Notes under federal
law, the County represents, covenants and agrees that, to the extent necessary to preserve such exclusion:
SECTION 5. No person or entity or any combination thereof, other than the County or any other

member of the general public; and no person or entity or any combination thereof other than the County

277

Journal of the City-County Council

or any other Governmental Unit will own any property financed out of the proceeds of the Notes or will
have actual or beneficial use of such property pursuant to a lease, a management or incentive payment
contract, an arrangement such as a takeor-pay or other type of output contract or any other type of
arrangement that differentiates that person’s or entity’s use of such property from the use of such
property by the public at large;

transferred directly or indirectly or deemed transferred to a person other than a Governmental Unit in a
fashion that would in substance constitute a loan of such Note proceeds;

would result in the loss of the exclusion from gross income for federal income tax purposes of interest on
the Notes pursuant to Section 103(a) of the Code, and the Council will not act or permit any actions by
officers or officials of the County that would in any manner adversely affect such exclusion; the County
further covenants that it will not make any investment or do any other act or thing during the period that
any Note is outstanding hereunder which would cause any Note to be an “arbitrage bond” within the
meaning of Section 148 of the Code and the regulations applicable thereto as in effect on the date of
delivery of the Notes; and the County shall comply with the arbitrage rebate requirements under Section
148 of the Code to the extent applicable;
SECTION 8. All officers, employees and agents of the County are hereby authorized and directed to
provide certifications of facts and estimates that are material to the reasonable expectations of the County
as of the date that the Notes are issued, and to make covenants on behalf of the County evidencing the

proceeds of the Notes; and
SECTION 9. The County is hereby authorized and directed to employ consultants and attorneys from
time to time to advise the County with respect to the requirements under federal law for the continuing
preservation of the exclusion of interest on the Notes from gross income for purposes of federal income
taxation.

authorizations contained in this Resolution (the “Tax Sections”) which are designed to preserve the
exclusion of interest on the Notes from gross income for purposes of federal income taxation (the “Tax

amount not to exceed Thirty Five Million Dollars ($35,000,000), are hereby appropriated in the Fund to
pay for the Project. A certified copy of this Resolution, together with such actions and other proceedings
as may be necessary, shall be filed by the Director of the OFMC, along with the proper report to the State
Department of Local Government Finance.
SECTION 12. The County Executive, the Director of the OFMC and any other officer of the County are
hereby authorized and directed, in the name and on behalf of the County, to execute and deliver such
documents and to take such actions as such person deems necessary or desirable to effect the purposes of
this Resolution, and any such documents heretofore executed and delivered and any such actions

Committee heard Proposal No. 241, 2006 on April 25, 2006. The proposal, sponsored by
Councillors Plowman and Sanders, approves an additional appropriation of $538,000 in the
Budget of the Marion County Election Board (Section 102 HAVA Reimbursement Fund) to pay
for expenses related to the refinance of the county's voting machines and to cover the estimated

Councillor Bradford asked if this is funding to pay for the current machines. Councillor Sanders
said that this is correct. Councillor Bradford said that he has no faith in the current contract or
vendor, and the machines they have are still not certified and are not handicapped accessible.
Councillor Sanders said that she also has a lack of confidence in the current vendor, but the City
must still live up to their contract. She added that there are many things going on behind the
scenes to correct the problems with the current machines and contract.
Councillor Cockrum said that after hand-counting school board ballots, which they were
originally assured these machines could handle, he is not confident in these machines either. He
said that he will support the proposal because of honoring the contract, but they need to resolve
the issue of ballot hand-counting.
Councillor Borst asked if there are two different funds for these machines or just one. He said
that he thought there was another grant and he asked if this is it. Councillor Sanders said that this
is a one-time distribution, and there have already been previous year grants. Councillor Nytes
added that this is the last grant from the HAVA fund. Councillor Borst asked if there is another
fund from which this project draws grant monies. Kobi Wright, Corporation Counsel, stated that
they are still waiting on a few more funds from the state.
Councillor Bradford said that the vendor has not honored their contract, and he does not therefore
see a reason for the City to have to honor it either. He opposes the proposal.
President Gray called for public testimony at 8:33 p.m. There being no one present to testify,
Councillor Sanders moved, seconded by Councillor Plowman, for adoption. Proposal No. 241,
2006 was adopted on the following roll call vote; viz:

SPECIAL ORDERS - UNFINISHED BUSINESS
PROPOSAL NO. 165, 2006. Councillor Nytes reported that the Economic Development
Committee heard Proposal No. 165, 2006 on April 12, 2006. The proposal, sponsored by
Councillor Nytes, is an inducement resolution for Camby Woods, L.P. in an amount not to exceed
$14,000,000 which consists of the construction of a 220-unit apartment complex to be known as
Camby Woods Apartments located at 7700 Camby Road (District 22). By a 4-3 vote, the
Committee reported the proposal to the Council with the recommendation that it do pass.
Councillor Cockrum said that the neighbors objected to the zoning case that made this property
multi-family. He said that Decatur Township is the smallest in population and already has more
government subsidized housing than there is demand for. He said that this area is not served by
IndyGo public transportation and he asked Councillors to oppose the project and support the
neighborhood’s wishes.
Councillor Speedy asked for consent to abstain to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest.
Consent was given.
Councillor Salisbury said that many Section 42 housing projects area appealing their assessed
value of properties based on rent levels, and someof these assessed values have been cut in half.
He said that this puts a bigger tax burden on other taxpayers in the community.

282

May 15, 2006

Councillor Nytes said that Councillor Salisbury is speaking mostly of Center Township where
assessments were lowered to help some stay fluid. She said that this development pro forma
meets the assessed value obligations. Councillor Cockrum asked if that commitment could be
made in writing. Dan Johnson, representing the developer, stated that he cannot make that
comment until an assessment has been done, and it would depend on the amount of the
assessment. Councillor Nytes asked if the property is appraised at a $15 million assessment, as is
projected in the pro forma, if the developer could honor that. Mr. Johnson said that they would.
Councillor Nytes moved, seconded by Councillor Sanders, for adoption. Proposal No. 165, 2006
failed due to the following indecisive roll call vote; viz:
14 YEAS: Abduallah, Bowes, Boyd, Brown, Conley, Gibson, Gray, Mahern, Mansfield,

President Gray stated that the proposal will remain on the Council calendar as unfinished
business. Councillor Bradford asked for clarification. He asked if 15 votes are needed either one
way or the other for the vote to be declared decisive. President Gray said that this is correct.
SPECIAL ORDERS - FINAL ADOPTION
PROPOSAL NO. 184, 2006. Councillor Brown reported that the Parks and Recreation
Committee heard Proposal No. 184, 2006 on May 4, 2006. The proposal, sponsored by
Councillors Moriarty Adams, Gray, Brown, Conley and Talley, amends Chapter 631, Article 1 of
the Revised Code to add a new section limiting access of persons required to and or listed on the
Indiana State Sex Offender Registry, as a result of a conviction of a child related offense, to
public park facilities and playground areas. By a 6-1 vote, the Committee reported the proposal
to the Council with the recommendation that it do pass.
Councillor Abduallah said that it is important to protect children, but he believes they are overreaching with this proposal. He asked how it will be monitored and enforced and if it will
withstand constitutional scrutiny without violating civil rights. Councillor Moriarty Adams stated
that the proposal was crafted by legal counsel and was reviewed by the Office of Corporation
Counsel. She said that she relies on them to draft language that will meet constitutional muster.
There have been three other pieces of legislation passed in the last few years that were appealed,
and two of the three passed constitutional muster. She said that she believes as it is written, this
would also meet constitutional requirements.
Councillor Schneider said that if the Indiana Civil Liberties Union (ICLU) wants to sue the City
for protecting its kids, let them sue. He said that he had some concerns about prosecutorial
options, but County Prosecutor Carl Brizzi answered his questions in committee to his
satisfaction. He supports the proposal whole-heartedly.
Councillor Bradford said that he appreciates the amendment that was made, and he would like to
see further amendments later, but he will support the proposal.
Councillor Pfisterer said that she had some issues with regards to double jeopardy and fining
instead of charging with a crime, but with the amendment offered by Mr. Brizzi, she is prepared
to support the proposal.

Councillor Speedy said that he would hope the passage of this proposal would not give parents a
false sense of security and he encouraged parents to watch their kids closely in public, regardless
of whether or not this passes.
Councillor Borst said that it is hard to see how this can be enforced, and said that the state law is
residential based and not based on public places.
Councillor Nytes said that there has been research to document that most sex offenders are let out
before the completion of their sentence, and many of the re-offending crimes are committed on
family members in their own homes. She said that she hopes steps can be taken to address these
statistics as well.
Councillor Gibson said that the Council needs to do what is right to protect children and it is
worth the risk in court.
Councillor Keller asked for an explanation regarding the notification procedure. Councillor
Brown stated that Sheriff Anderson will notify offenders along with the normal monthly visiting
procedures.
Councillor Brown moved, seconded by Councillor Talley, for adoption. Proposal No. 184, 2006

PROPOSAL NO. 170, 2006.
Councillor Conley reported that the Law Enforcement
Consolidation Committee heard Proposal No. 170, 2006 on April 26, 2006. The proposal,

designee to serve on the Advisory Committee. By a 7-0 vote, the Committee reported the
proposal to the Council with the recommendation that it do pass. Councillor Conley moved,
seconded by Councillor Brown, to return Proposal No. 170, 2006 to committee.
Councillor Keller asked why they want to return it to committee when it passed unanimously out
of committee. Councillor Conley said that he believes Councillor Borst should appear before the
committee instead of just sending a letter. Councillor Keller asked why a letter will not suffice
from a long-time respected member of this body.
Councillor McWhirter said that this proposal was discussed thoroughly in committee and it was
also discussed why Councillor Borst could not attend. There is no rule that says a Councillor
must appear before a committee for their proposal to be passed. Councillor Conley said that it is
not a rule, but is a matter of courtesy.
Councillor Borst said that he thought contacting the committee members was enough or he would
have been there. He said that he opposes the motion to return to committee.
Councillor McWhirter said that this was thoroughly discussed, and Councillor Borst had a
conflict with his veterinary practice and his livelihood and income is important and he
accommodated the committee to not have to change their agenda or meeting time by sending the
letter. Councillor Conley said that he is not disputing that Councillor Borst’s income is
important, but the committee would like him to appear before them as a courtesy.

PUBLIC SAFETY AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE COMMITTEE
The Public Safety and Criminal Justice Committee of the City-County Council met on
Thursday, January 31, 2008. Chair Ryan Vaughn called the meeting to order at 5:35 p.m.
with the following members present: Vernon Brown, Bob Cockrum, Ed Coleman, Mary
Moriarty Adams, William Oliver, Marilyn Pfisterer, and Christine Scales. Other
Councillors in attendance are as follows: Paul Bateman, Jose Evans, Robert Lutz, Brian
Mahern, Lincoln Plowman, Joanne Sanders, and Kent Smith.
PROPOSAL NO. 29, 2008 - appoints Jon M. Bailey to the Marion County Public
Defender Board
Chair Vaughn said that Mr. Bailey had a trial in Ft. Wayne, Indiana and is unable to

Councillor Cockrum moved, seconded by Councillor Pfisterer, to “Postpone” Proposal
No. 29, 2008 until February 13, 2008. The motion carried by a vote of 8-0.
PROPOSAL NO. 34, 2008 - appropriates $25,000 in the Budget of the Marion County
Justice Agency (Drug Free Community Fund) to fund a grant awarded to Drug Free
Marion County, Inc. to cover the administrative expenses of that organization
Chair Vaughn said this proposal is not ready to be heard this evening.
Councillor Cockrum moved, seconded by Councillor Scales, to “Postpone” Proposal No.
29, 2008 until February 13, 2008. The motion carried by a vote of 8-0.
Chair Vaughn asked for consent to hear Proposal Nos. 28 and 30, 2008 together. Consent
was given.
PROPOSAL NO. 28, 2008 - appoints Jennifer Lukemeyer to the Marion County Public
Defender Board
Ms. Lukemeyer said she is a practicing attorney in good standing with the Indiana Bar
Association since 1994. She said she started her career as a full-time public defender and
then went into private practice, where she was awarded a contract with the Marion
County Public Defender’s Office for five years. Ms. Lukemeyer said she has always held
her work as public defender as being some of the most important work that she has done
in her legal career. She said with her private practice, she focuses on criminal defense,
and it would be an honor to serve the community on the Public Defender Board.
PROPOSAL NO. 30, 2008 - appoints Paul Page to the Marion County Public Defender
Board
Mr. Page said he has been in private practice with Baker, Pittman, and Page for 17 years
and has focused on criminal law. He said he hopes to bring his 17 years of experience to

Public Safety and Criminal Justice Committee
January 31, 2008
Page 2
the Public Defender Board and help the agency become more efficient and effective.
Councillor Sanders asked how appointees feel regarding the problem of true assessment
with private litigation done by public defenders on public time, using public resources.
Ms. Lukemeyer said this is an extremely important area that has come to light over the
last couple of years. She said the law allows for full-time Public Defenders to have a
private practice, so long as there is no conflict. Ms. Lukemeyer said a true assessment is
necessary, and it needs to be curved tremendously. Mr. Page said a better job needs to be
done on whether public defenders qualify to represent a criminal case. He said if the
number of clients the Public Defender’s Office has could be diminished through
qualification or programs; perhaps a grasp could be obtained on whether there is a need
for public defenders that are also in private practice.
Councillor Moriarty Adams moved, seconded by Councillor Pfisterer, to send Proposal
Nos. 28 and 30, 2008 to the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion
carried by a vote of 8-0.
PROPOSAL NO. 33, 2008 - approves an increase of $266,667 in the 2008 Budget of the
Marion County Prosecutor (State and Federal Grants Fund) to fund salaries and fringes
for staff in the Community Prosecution Division, funded through a grant of Byrne
Memorial Funds by the Indiana Criminal Justice Institute
Lisa Bentley, Chief of Operations, Prosecutor’s Office, said this proposal is a renewal
grant for the Community Prosecution Division in the amount of $266,667 to fund four
paralegals and a prosecutor within the division (Exhibit A, attached). She said there is a
local match with this grant, which has already been budgeted in their Deferral Fund for
2008.
Diane Hannell, Administrator of the Community Prosecution Division, directed the
committee to a handout that details the Community Prosecution and its duties (Exhibit B,
attached). She said the Community Prosecution Division is a grass-roots effort to address
crime prevention, quality of life, and livability issues in the neighborhoods. She said this
is done in collaboration with residents, other agency members, and members of law
enforcement. Ms. Hannell said they have offices at the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police
Department (IMPD) roll call sites, where both a paralegal and prosecutor are at each site
to work directly with law enforcement, as well as with the residents. She said they
currently have 10 prosecutors and 13 support staff members to address issues involving
gangs, drug evictions, conflict resolution services, etc.
Councillor Oliver asked how many community prosecutors they have and what their role
is. Ms. Hannell said they have a paralegal and a deputy prosecutor at five of the

Public Safety and Criminal Justice Committee
January 31, 2008
Page 3
IMPD roll call sites. She said their role is to screen cases in the district with detectives
and attend meetings to hear concerns.
Councillor Pfisterer said she is pleased with the community prosecutor that is in her
district. She said she has been very effective in the community.
Councillor Brown said he would like to see some additional resources given to the
eastside to be proactive in providing resources to prevent tragedies and crime.
Councillor Oliver moved, seconded by Councillor Moriarty Adams, to send Proposal No.
33, 2008 to the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried by a
vote of 8-0.
PROPOSAL NO. 6, 2008 - amends the Code to establish the Indianapolis Metropolitan
Police Department as the police division of the department of public safety and makes
corresponding technical corrections
Scott Newman, Director of Public Safety, went over the details of the amendment to
Proposal No. 6, 2008 (Exhibit C, attached) and said consultation with the Sheriff was
added in Section 251-211. He went on to read each amendment in each section and noted
that, in most cases, the Sheriff has been substituted with the Public Safety Director in the
amendment. Key amendments are as follows:
•

Section 279-101. Definitions have been added to the proposal, which defines
advisory council, board, chief, and Sheriff. These changes in the definitions are
reflected by the General Resolution adopted by the Council last year.

•

Section 279-201. Recommendations from the Law Enforcement Advisory
Council would be made to the Public Safety Director.

•

Section 279-221. The Public Safety Director shall appoint a chief of the
metropolitan law enforcement agency who will serve at the pleasure of the Public
Safety Director. The Sheriff will be consulted about the chief and executive staff
of IMPD.

•

Section 279-233. The four members appointed by the Sheriff will be appointed by
the Director of Public Safety.

•

Section 251-135. The Director of Public Safety, after consultation with the
Sheriff, shall appoint a full-time executive director of the Citizens Police
Compliant Office.

Public Safety and Criminal Justice Committee

•

A new Section 18 has been added to show the change in authority for most of the
functions of law enforcement and further provides the date of February 29, 2008
for a transfer of the chain of command.

Councillor Cockrum moved, seconded by Councillor Pfisterer, to “Amend” Proposal No.
6, 2008 as per Exhibit C. The motion carried by a vote of 6-2; with Councillors Moriarty
Adams and Oliver casting the negative votes.
Mr. Newman said the transfer in the chain of command seemed like an intractable
problem, but with discussion, they found there was a lot of common ground. That
common ground was reflected in the amendments to the proposal. He said this transfer in
command will make them more effective law enforcement partners and help them work
as teammates. Mr. Newman highlighted the meaning behind the amendments of the
proposal as the Mayor and the Sheriff mutually acknowledging the authority of the other.
The Mayor has agreed not to seek further action in the state legislature regarding power
of the Sheriff. The Sheriff recognizes the immediate transfer of authority to the Mayor.
The Sheriff will be given consultation powers in many areas and will be appointed to the
IMPD Merit Board by the Public Safety Director. The Mayor will seek transfer authority
over the Juvenile Detention Center to the Sheriff, and the Mayor will support the creation
of a Sheriff’s division on warrants. Mr. Newman said they also hope to transfer the
failure to appear resources of 12 or more officers (mostly retired officers) who apprehend
fugitives. This would be a transfer from the Justice Agency to the Sheriff’s Department.
Mr. Newman said there will be a lot of discussion on procedural issues and fiscal
ordinances. Each party has appointed coordinators to ensure the transition is a smooth
one. He said the only issue that remains is communications. This is an area that, by
statute, is the concern of the Sheriff in Marion County. The Advisory Council is
proposed to be used to resolve operational issues about communications.
Councillor Moriarty Adams asked what role the Mayor will have with the police
department, as he is not mentioned in the amendment. Mr. Newman said he serves as the
Public Safety Director at the pleasure of the Mayor. He said the Mayor takes full
responsibility of the decisions that are made by the Public Safety Director. He said the
Mayor remains responsible in any emergency, as the Mayor is the commander of chief.
Councillor Moriarty Adams asked why the Mayor is not approving the new chief
(language found in Section 279-221). Mr. Newman said the language regarding the
Mayor was deleted because of redundancy.
Councillor Oliver said he would like to call into question the alleged statement that
Mayor Ballard is going to do what a particular group that does not support minority or
women recruitment wants him to do. Mr. Newman said he can only express his personal
commitment to the issue of race and gender, and he is not interested in seeing

Public Safety and Criminal Justice Committee
January 31, 2008
Page 5
progress roll back in this regard. He said the goal is to provide quality leadership and
fairness.
Chair Vaughn said the shift in authority will not affect the dissent decree and local
ordinances adopted. He said it speaks volumes when Mr. Newman uses his appointment
to the Merit Board to appoint Sheriff Anderson, who is currently in charge of a majority
of these functions.
Councillor Oliver asked if Mr. Newman is representing both sides. Mr. Newman replied
in the negative and said he is representing the Department of Public Safety and the Mayor
of Indianapolis. Councilllor Oliver asked if the concern of possible roll back of
affirmative action was discussed during negotiations. Kevin Murray, Counsel for Sheriff
Frank Anderson, said there were concerns with affirmative action and the reality that this
is a new police agency. He said the Law Enforcement Advisory Council (LEAC) was
established by the City-County Council specifically because of these concerns. Mr.
Murray said the Sheriff’s concerns in this regard are reflected in the agreement between
the Mayor and Sheriff. He said that is one reason the Sheriff is actively involved in
IMPD, the Merit Board, member of the LEAC, and involved with the selection of the
chief and executive staff.
Councillor Brown asked if they will proceed with the work of diversity within the police
department. Mr. Murray said that is the wide-spread notion and commitment both within
the police department and in the neighborhoods, to have a police force that reflects the
people it serves and protects. Councillor Brown said it is his belief that this proposal is
not based on race or the Sheriff’s qualifications, but about politics, power, and policy.
He said Marion County has a new political structure that has the ability to create policy,
and this is part of the effort to move forward with the Mayor and Council majority’s
initiatives. He said he continues to have grave concerns with officers having adequate
resources to address issues facing his district regarding crime and enforcement of the law.
He added that he would like to sign on as one of the sponsors of the proposal, as the
Mayor and Sheriff have come to an agreement.
Councillor Moriarty Adams asked if there is an allegation that police officers will
perform better or differently if they are reporting to the Director of Public Safety versus
the Sheriff. Mr. Newman replied in the negative and said the police department will
continue to perform better as plans and strategies are formulated. He said he believes the
Mayor will be able to bring all the resources of city government to the table, due to the
office that he holds. Councillor Moriarty Adams asked how the move of control from the
Sheriff to the Mayor will improve public safety on behalf of the public. Mr. Newman
said collaboration between the Mayor, the Prosecutor, and other public safety related
agencies will be streamlined. Councillor Moriarty Adams asked how the responsibility

Public Safety and Criminal Justice Committee
January 31, 2008
Page 6
will be divided with the auto desk, Information Technology (IT), Human Resources
(HR), and financial operations and additional personnel the Sheriff’s Department may
need. Mr. Murray said the Sheriff’s Department and IMPD still remain separate
departments and have separate administration divisions. He said during the course of
2007, the process was to begin to combine the administrative divisions. He said the
Mayor and the Sheriff understand the concern of this issue and realize there is no need to
have two of everything, but this is the detail that still remains for discussion during the
transition. Mr. Murray stated that he cannot address the financial impact, as he is not the
City Controller. Councillor Moriarty Adams asked what the financial impact to the
Sheriff’s budget will be. Mr. Murray said there will be a meeting tomorrow to discuss
the financial impact, and he will attempt to provide an update from that meeting.
Councillor Sanders asked if a fiscal impact statement was completed before the
introduction of this proposal. Mr. Newman replied in the negative and said that he
cannot speculate on the numbers, but will attempt to get accurate numbers to provide to
the Council. He added that there will be some type of financial impact with the Sheriff’s
Department and IMPD. Councillor Sanders said she would also like to see included in
the fiscal impact statement what funding will be allocated to ensure things are covered.
Mr. Newman said he makes it a point not to come before the Council without a proposal
on how something can be funded. Councillor Sanders asked what efforts have been made
to ensure they do not need to be concerned with bills currently before the legislature
involving the relationship of the Sheriff to law enforcement. Mr. Newman said the
agreement they have made with the Sheriff causes them to drop those provisions and urge
that it gets taken out of legislation. Councillor Sanders said this is not something the
Mayor or the Director of Public Safety can do. They have to ensure that someone in the
State House drops the provisions. Mr. Newman said they have requested that Senator
James Merritt drop the provisions. Councillor Sanders said she does not want the
committee to lose sight that at any given moment that language can be added, and she
hopes that will not be the case.
Councillor Brown asked for comments on the FBI study that indicated a city this size
needs additional police officers. Mr. Newman said he is skeptical of outsiders assessing
local conditions. He said he agrees that the city is under-resourced in certain areas and
can always use more, but they first need to be effective with the current level of police
officers.
Councillor Oliver asked if the current programs at the Juvenile Center will be carried on
through the transfer to the Sheriff’s Department. Gael Deppert, Juvenile Center, said she
was not personally involved in the transfer decision and cannot answer the question. Mr.
Newman said in most jurisdictions, the Sheriff administers the services given by the
Juvenile Center. He said he spoke with Judge Marilyn Moores, Juvenile Center, and she

Public Safety and Criminal Justice Committee
January 31, 2008
Page 7
does not favor the transfer in authority. Mr. Newman said Judge Moores' concern is that
people who operate adult jails do not have the right frame of mind to provide a different
environment for juveniles. He said they do plan to sit down and talk with Judge Moores
about her concerns.
Councillor Speedy asked if the Mayor has agreed to forego any lobbying directly or
indirectly for bills in the General Assembly that will impact the Sheriff. Mr. Newman
replied in the affirmative. Councillor Speedy asked if there is any obligation to defend
bills directly or indirectly that may arise after the passage of this proposal. Mr. Newman
replied in the affirmative.
Public Testimony
Robert Yahara, citizen, said he prays and trusts that the city will continue to work
through these issues that relate to the city. With the transfer of authority, it is the citizens
that have the power to vote on those in power. He expressed his appreciation for Sheriff
Anderson and said he is to be commended for his integrity, and he is looking forward to
the work of Mayor Ballard.
Larry Vaughn, citizen, said the only elected official in Marion County that can keep law
enforcement from becoming federalized is the Sheriff. However, the city no longer has a
Sheriff, due to the consolidation, and the police department is very federalized. Mr.
Vaughn said the City of Indianapolis is being used as a laboratory due to federal grants,
and IMPD is being run federally. He went on to say that this proposal is creating a new
taxing authority within IMPD which will pay for this new unit of government, and Mr.
Newman will be in total control of IMPD.
Chair Vaughn said they are not amending levy collection that funded the department
under the Sheriff and will continue to fund IMPD, and there are no tax increases in this
proposal.
Ernie Shearer, citizen, read a written statement expressing his disagreement on a couple
of points of the amendment. He said little has been done to address the issues that
concern citizens in regards to illegal gambling facilities that are closely associated with
prostitution and drug dealing. He said IMPD is critically short of police officers,
adequate vehicles, and equipment and has continued so under the leadership of Sheriff
Anderson. He said he is in support of transferring authority of IMPD to the Mayor and
does not want to see the Sheriff have any input in IMPD. Mr. Shearer said this proposal
is not about race, but about reducing crime in Marion County.
Jim Smashey, citizen, said nothing that the Council is doing this evening leads him to
believe that government corruption will be addressed.

Public Safety and Criminal Justice Committee

Bill Owensby, President of the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) Lodge 86, said the FOP is
in favor of this agreement between the Mayor and the Sheriff. He said the discussions
they have had were not about the individual person but the office of both. Mr. Owensby
said they feel that citizens will be better served when all their public safety resources are
under one roof.
Mark Hammer, citizen, said this committee had the responsibility to uphold three
objectives regarding police consolidation: make the department more effective, efficient,
and save money, which, in his opinion, none of those objectives have been accomplished.
He said the consolidation decreased public safety, raised taxes, and lowered morale with
no savings. Mr. Hammer said he does agree with the Sheriff when he says “there is no
room for politics in public safety”, but he finds that is all they have in public safety. He
said that he is in support of IMPD going back under the Mayor, where it has been for 150
years.
Rev. Byron Vaughn said it does not matter who is in charge of the police department as
long as there continue to be law breakers. He said he is a part of several organizations
that work to create building blocks to show that ex-offenders are people, too, that have
concerns and want to make a difference. Rev. Vaughn said he hopes that this Council
understands that Sheriff Anderson is the Sheriff and was elected to hold that position. He
asked the Council to leave Sheriff Anderson as the Sheriff and allow the Mayor to
appoint his chief of police.
Adam Longworth, citizen, said the merger of the police department has not worked as
expected. He said as a result of the merger, the run times increased and the beat districts
expanded. Mr. Longworth said the police department needs better resources, and that
should be what is important.
Councillor Cockrum moved, seconded by Councillor Pfisterer, to send Proposal No. 6,
2008 to the full Council with a “Do Pass as Amended” recommendation. The motion
carried by a vote of 6-2; with Councillors Moriarty Adams and Oliver casting the
negative votes.
Councillor Moriarty Adams said that although the Mayor and the Sheriff have reached an
agreement regarding Proposal No. 6, 2008, she cannot support this proposal. She said
she believes police agencies belong under those who have been trained extensively in the
law enforcement arena. She said she has not heard any evidence that IMPD officers will
perform better or differently if they report to the Director of Public Safety versus the
Sheriff. Councillor Moriarty Adams said, in her opinion, this is a political power grab
based upon the Council make-up. She said in order for the public to best be served by the
police department, a determination needs to be made through a referendum by the

Public Safety and Criminal Justice Committee
January 31, 2008
Page 9
citizens of Marion County. She said a referendum will prevent future Councils from
moving authority where there is different leadership. Councillor Moriarty Adams said
she is concerned about the fiscal impact to the Sheriff’s and City-County budget with the
change of control.
Councillor Cockrum said regardless of who is in charge, everyone must work together as
a team including the public. He said the only way to turn the crime problem around is by
working together and putting politics aside.
With no further business pending, and upon motion duly made, the Public Safety and
Criminal Justice Committee of the City-County Council was adjourned at 7:50 p.m.
Respectfully submitted,

Ryan Vaughn, Chair
Public Safety and Criminal Justice Committee

RV/as

(g) All disciplinary actions taken by anyone except the chief shall be forwarded in writing to the
disciplinary board of captains through the chain of command within three (3) working days of the action. The
disciplinary board of captains shall ensure due process and consistency of discipline throughout the

board shall be conducted in accordance with the written directives of the chief and the merit board. After the
hearing, the board of captains shall, upon majority vote, reduce to writing its findings of either guilty or not
guilty.
(i) The disciplinary board of captains shall report the results of its review and/or hearing to the chief for
determination. Included in this report shall be the disciplinary board's findings and recommendations. If the

(j) The disciplinary board of captains shall consist of three (3) officers holding the permanent merit rank
of captain, who shall serve for a period of three (3) months. Each captain shall be selected at random. The

administrative hearing. This hearing shall be de novo and shall be a hearing of record. In making an appeal,

of disciplinary action. The merit board then shall schedule the hearing, providing the officer with at least
fifteen (15) calendar days' notice prior to the hearing date; however, if there are criminal charges pending
against the officer that arose from substantially the same conduct, circumstances, or subject matter that gave
rise to the disciplinary action, then the merit board shall not conduct the hearing until after such criminal
charges have been resolved at the trial level. The evidence before the merit board shall consist of the written
charges and action taken on such charges, the findings of fact and recommendations from the chief and/or
the disciplinary board of captains, and any other evidence requested by the merit board or presented by the
charged officer.
(l) The officer requesting an appeal and the chief may be represented by legal counsel before the merit
board.
(m) After hearing the evidence, the merit board shall, by majority vote, reduce its findings and decision to
writing. The merit board may fully or partially affirm or reverse any portion of the chief's determination which is
appealable. In addition, the merit board may remand the action for further review by the chief.
(n) If the officer is found not guilty by the merit board, any pay he or she may have lost due to
suspension, or any rank lost due to demotion, shall be returned to the officer.
(o) Any officer who disagrees with the findings of the merit board shall have the right to file a verified
petition to the Superior or Circuit Court of Marion County for a review of the decision. The petition for review
must be filed within thirty (30) calendar days after the written decision of the board. The City of Indianapolis
shall be the sole defendant in the petition for review. Within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of a
summons, the city shall cause the merit board to file a true and complete copy of the transcript of the hearing
with the court. The court, without jury, shall review the record and render its decision as in other
administrative reviews. The clerk of the court shall send a copy of the court's decision to the metropolitan law

RULES AND PUBLIC POLICY COMMITTEE
The Rules and Public Policy Committee of the City-County Council met on Tuesday,
February 12, 2013 in Room 260 of the City-County Building. Chair Maggie Lewis called
the meeting to order at 5:32 p.m. with the following members present: Monroe Gray,
Robert Lutz, Brian Mahern, Angela Mansfield and Michael McQuillen. John Barth
arrived shortly thereafter. Vernon Brown was absent. Councillor Jeff Miller was also in
attendance. General Counsel Fred Biesecker and Counsel to the Minority Caucus
Robert Elrod represented Council staff.
Chair Lewis asked committee members to introduce themselves and indicate which
portion of the County they represent.
PROPOSAL NO. 458, 2012 - amends Sec. 951-301 of the Code pertaining to Flea
Market Sales to exempt sales in Special Event Zones established by licenses issued
pursuant to Sec. 956-102
Councillor McQuillen said that several months ago, the Council passed some rules
regarding flea market sales to try and clean up illegal activities taking place in these
types of venues across the County. He said that the new ordinance gave police an
extra tool to combat the sale of stolen goods. He said that after the ordinance was
passed, he was contacted by the antiques and collectibles community about being
exempted, like the fairgrounds and convention center. He said that this proposal
amends the list of exemptions under the flea market definition to add these special
events that have already secured proper licensing from the City.
Councillor McQuillen provided an amendment (Exhibit A) and moved, seconded by
Councillor Lutz, to “Amend Proposal No. 458, 2012 as per the exhibit.
Councillor Mahern asked if the idea behind this is that the fairgrounds and these special
event facilities already have things in place that provide safeguards against the sale of
stolen goods. Councillor McQuillen said that the fairgrounds were already exempted,
and this proposal only adds antiques and collectibles shows as exemptions from these
rules, since they already go through the licensing process with the City. Councillor
Mahern said that he is comfortable with the fairgrounds and other permanent facilities
like the convention center being exempted, but asked what rigors are associated with
this special events licensing that brings these shows under similar monitoring. Kate
Johnson, Deputy Director, Department of Code Enforcement (DCE), said that special
events requirements are found in Title IV of the Code, and there are many
requirements, such as insurance and bonds, which give the City many opportunities to
take action against them if there are violations. Councillor Mahern asked what in the
requirements would protect the City from the likelihood of stolen goods being sold. Ms.
Johnson said that the theory behind these additional regulations for flea markets was to
combat the problem of stolen goods. They have not found this problem taking place at
these types of special events, as these events usually bring a sense of community
togetherness. She said if they felt it was necessary or suspected stolen goods, they
could easily run background checks as a part of the licensing process.

Councillor Mansfield said that this amendment seems to address more than just the
addition of this exemption. She said that it strikes products with an expiration date from
the things that cannot be sold and adds an annual fee for flea market licensing. She
asked who prepared this amendment. Ms. Johnson said that when the flea market
ordinance was first enacted several months ago, a fee was referenced but never added
to the fees table. After accounting for the staff time and supplies associated with this
licensing process, they came up with a reasonable fee of $143 and recommended that
amount to General Counsel Fred Biesecker, who included that in the amendment he
drafted.
Councillor Mansfield asked who originated the removal of the expiration date language.
Ms. Johnson said that they do not object to that amendment, but this did not originate
with her office. Councillor Lutz said that he received calls from businesses located in a
flea market on Washington Street who stated that some of their largest product lines
were items with an expiration date, that were not necessarily food items, but things like
cleaners and beauty products. He said that they sold a very large number of these
types of items with significant discounts. Jeff Roeder, Mayor’s Office, Liaison to the
Council, stated that they have also received many phone calls asking for the elimination
of this language, and he spoke with Counsel Biesecker about it, who indicated that a
number of Councillors had been asking for the same thing. He said that these are not
items that are harmful, but with certain Federal laws in place, many of these still viable
goods are required to have an expiration date. However, there is no risk in selling these
items past that date in second-hand markets.
Councillor Mahern asked what the rationale was for adding this language in the original
ordinance. Mr. Biesecker said that he is not sure, because the proposal was drafted in
2011 before his time as counsel. He said that he was never able to really track down
the reasons behind including it, and the consensus was that the language does not
really further the purpose of the ordinance. Councillor McQuillen asked Chair Lewis, as
one of the originating sponsors of the first ordinance, if she remembers the rationale
behind this language. Chair Lewis said that she does not recall, and only remembers
that the whole impetus for the ordinance was due to conversations with law
enforcement. She said that she would not like to see these markets offering expired
foods, but sees no problem with the sale of other items like beauty products or
cleansers. Councillor McQuillen said that he and his wife are professional antique
dealers, and he sees a lot of hair dye and toothpaste, two specific items with expiration
dates, being sold at flea markets, and he has no problem in eliminating this language.
Councillor McQuillen’s motion to “Amend” Proposal No. 458, 2012 as per Exhibit A
carried by a vote of 6-0.
Councillor McQuillen moved, seconded by Councillor Mansfield, to send Proposal No.
458, 2012 to the full Council with a “Do Pass As Amended” recommendation. The
motion carried by a vote of 6-0.

PROPOSAL NO. 52, 2013 - amends the Code to adopt new provisions within Chapter
575 regarding the elimination of graffiti
Councillor Miller said that in the process of talking with neighbors in his district about
their concerns, he found that it was not illegal for an individual to leave graffiti on
property. He then began to research what other cities are doing with regard to graffiti,
and spent time talking to many individuals, neighborhood groups, and other
organizations such as the Metropolitan Indianapolis Board of Realtors (MIBOR) and
Indianapolis Downtown, Inc. (IDI). He said that in his research, he came across a
“model” ordinance to address graffiti, and there were some things in that ordinance that
did not really fit or make sense for Indianapolis at this time. However, there were some
key parts that he felt they could focus on, such as making it illegal to leave graffiti in
place. He said that, ideally, they would like to have an abatement system for graffiti, like
the City instituted for high weeds and illegal dumping; but the consensus was that an
abatement system is hard to start and has large costs associated with it; and at this
time, with the budget the way it is, may not be feasible. So at this point, they proposed
an ordinance that would look at addressing the problem of making it illegal. The
ordinance also attempts to address how owners are approached, the inspection
process, the time frame associated with the process, and ways in which DCE can work
with an owner to address the problem, without being a burden. He said that they have
talked about putting owners into contact with the TAG (taking away graffiti) team and
other resources to help get the graffiti removed. However, TAG is a volunteer program,
and so they may not always have resources available to them. He said that they are
also working with several private organizations about the possibilities for a mobile graffiti
van. Councillor Miller said that, unfortunately, they have no jurisdiction over CSX, who
is one of the biggest targets for graffiti art, or the Indiana Department of Transportation
(INDOT); but they have tried to make the ordinance as all-encompassing as possible.
He said that the biggest objection he has heard is that they are telling someone who
has been victimized that they now owe money if they do not address the result of that
victimization. He said that the problem is that they are so rarely able to identify the
source of the graffiti, and it is hard to catch those who are vandalizing property in this
way. However, similar to illegal dumping, it has become a problem and they have to
find a way to abate it. He said that it is an unfortunate negative aspect to owning
property. For owner-occupied properties, they believe they have set up a system to
allow more time to abate if needed. Councillor Miller said that this also becomes an
issue of economic development. The longer graffiti is allowed to remain, property
values become affected, the morale of the community goes down, and the area is seen
as an area of neglect, which then attracts crime. He said that he understands that there
are the “big brother” fears any time government tells someone what to do with their own
personal property, but the aforementioned reasons are why he is passionate about this
issue.
Carolyn Key, North Square Neighborhood Association, said that she has been active in
the crime watch program for five years and has noticed a lot of graffiti. She said that

Rules and Public Policy Committee
February 12, 2013
Page 4
she did a graffiti survey, which turned out to be almost 20 pages of information, that she
turned into TAG for them to address. She said that she has also done a peer review
search of literature on this topic and found that most graffiti is done on businesses or
public property, such as traffic signs, guardrails and bridges. She said that graffiti in an
area acts as a magnet for more graffiti and more crime, because it is seen as an area
where people do not care. She added that in her research, she found data that
suggested that men or boys do not tend to notice graffiti or feel any sense of harm if
they do notice it. Women and girls, however, feel differently, and view graffiti as a sign
of an area that is unsafe. She said that she knows everyone does not agree with her on
this issue, as some graffiti is looked at as art, or even murals dedicated to deceased
individuals; but she wholeheartedly supports the proposal.
{Clerk’s Note: Councillor Barth arrived at 6:00 p.m.}
Linda Perdue, Fletcher Place resident, said that she supports the proposal. She said
that Fletcher Place has a great neighborhood association, great restaurants and shops,
and now is part of the cultural trail. However, it is discouraging to have large vacant
buildings with absent landlords covered with graffiti. She said that some of these
absent landlords were contacted, and they live up on the north side and do not care,
because they are not affected by it on a daily basis. She said that approval of this
ordinance would make a statement that the City cares about neighborhoods, and she
would appreciate the committee members’ support.
Rhonda Pfeffer, Fletcher Place resident, said that abandoned buildings are being hit in
her neighborhood, with two prime spots very visible to high-traffic areas. She said that
they got the owner to cover up graffiti, and the artwork was immediately re-done. The
owner had to cover the graffiti three times, and now it seems to have stopped. She said
it may take time to get the activity to stop.
{Clerk’s Note: Councillor Gray left at 6:08 p.m.}
Rob Uppencamp, Bates Hendricks Neighborhood Association, said that graffiti is
annoying, but it exists and is necessary to address. He said that it has grown over the
years, and will continue to increase because nothing is in place to deter people from
doing it. He said that much of it is not necessarily gang-related, but instead is a matter
of boredom. He said that graffiti costs Americans $8 million a year and sends the
message that no one cares about the affected community. He said that the National
Parks Service is an expert on graffiti, and the remedy they swear by is to address the
graffiti as soon as it is tagged, and to keep covering it over and over again immediately
until the taggers are worn out or their chances of getting caught are increased. He said
that a rapid abatement program is the solution. He said that cities like Tampa, Florida;
Oakland, California and Houston, Texas have ordinances in place; and most of these
ordinances set deadlines to clean up the graffiti and prohibit the sale of markers and
spray paint to minors. He said that Indianapolis should look at some of these other

Rules and Public Policy Committee
February 12, 2013
Page 5
cities’ ordinances; as he is surprised that they are so far behind other cities by not
having something already in place.
Deborah Law, Prosecutor’s Office, said that the Prosecutor’s Office has a presence at
all community police locations and is a major player in crime prevention programs,
partnering with many other organizations and individuals. She said that TAG is a
Prosecutor’s Office-run program, and is not really a volunteer program, as their staff
does this work on government time. She said that they do partner with Probation and
others for community service opportunties. She said that graffiti falls under the broken
windows theory, that if they let it stay, the neighborhood will eventually fall into chaos
and decay. She said that they get graffiti complaints from every district, and referrals
come from many different sources. There are steps they must take before anything can
be addressed. They have to verify the graffiti exists. If it is gang-related, they alert the
Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department (IMPD) gang unit. They then notify the
owner and have to get their permission in writing before going onto their property to
abate it. Then they have to find the resources to actually do the work. She said that it
turns out to be an expensive endeavor; not necessarily in resources and supplies, but in
employee time. She said that they have gotten free paint in the past from the Tox Drop
program or hardware stores; and the support staff often buys supplies out of their own
pocket because of their strong desire to see neighborhoods stay in good shape. In
2011, TAG conducted 20 clean-ups, with 240 man hours and an additional 75 hours in
owner research, inspections, and getting permission to abate. In 2012, there were 11
clean-ups in 115 locations, with 150 man hours and an additional 40 hours in
preparation. She said that with funding limitations and an ever-increasing workload,
these efforts will be curtailed this year, simply because they do not have the funds or
the manpower to dedicate to this effort. She said that this ordinance is a first step in
eradicating this problem, but they really need an abatement program with the City’s
involvement. She said that from a Prosecutor’s perspective, this is the first step, but the
problem will not be solved until someone steps up to completely address the issue. She
said that it usually takes a second or third covering for the graffiti taggers to give up on
an area.
Councillor Mansfield said she believes it is necessary to do this as a first step, but she
does hope they proceed with an abatement program as part of the fix. She said that
they have had great success with the high weeds and grass abatement program, and
DCE has managed excellent follow-through. She said that there has been a history of
enforcement issues, and asked what would stop an owner from being lazy and not
wanting to cover it from saying they authorized it and view it as art. Councillor Miller
said that this was addressed in the model ordinance, and he took it out because he was
warned he would get a call from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). He said
that to avoid freedom of speech issues, they added language that required written preauthorization in order to claim the graffiti was art. Councillor Mansfield asked if the
amendment in front of them takes out that qualification. Councillor Lutz said that this is
his amendment, and he has not offered it yet, but it does propose to take out that
language.

Joe Jarzen, Keep Indianapolis Beautiful (KIB) community engagement program, said
that their Adopt-A-Block program and some other initiatives they have may help to
address this problem, as well as some other issues. He said that they have been
working closely with DCE on illegal dumping and high weeds, and are partnering with
neighbors to provide resources and tools to address some of the problems the
neighborhoods face. He said that he believes they could provide some tools to help
address graffiti through the Adopt-A-Block program and the Lilly Day of Service. He
said that this would also help build their partnership with DCE and the Department of
Public Safety (DPS). He said that KIB is excited about this ordinance to further their
efforts in the community, and aid in their exploration of alternative ways to deal with
vacant land. He said that there are programs out there that can help to address,
mitigate and abate these types of problems.
Councillor Miller said that he would like to see more done, but the cost associated with
the abatement program may not be feasible at this time. The first step is to make it
illegal to leave graffiti unaddressed, even if it just encourages an owner to ask to be
added to the TAG list of properties. He said that this is not the only step needed, but is
a good first step.
Councillor Mahern said that this is an important issue. However, he does not
understand why paint vendors would be reluctant to prohibit the purchase of these paint
items. Councillor Miller said that he spoke with former Councillor Cardwell, who is a
local business owner of a hardware company; and while local businesses may be
agreeable, chain stores might be a little more resistant to the government telling them
what to do. However, he agreed and said that he would like to see this regulated, but
felt at this time, it might not be feasible. Councillor Mahern said that medicines like
Sudafed were put behind the counter for more control over purchases when it was
found to be used in the making of methamphetamine. He asked how this is different,
and said instead, they are willing to impose an unmistakeable fee increase on a victim
of a crime, but reluctant to address the source of the paint and reduce the flow of a
product used to commit the crime. He said that he appreciates the information on the
abatement program costs, but they need to look at priorities. He said that he does not
understand why they do not have the money for the Prosecutor’s Office to prevent a
crime that would protect property values. Instead, they are asking the owners to put
their own resources toward correcting this problem. He said that this is an issue that
affects the quality of life in a neighborhood, and there is no greater disservice than
promising a service and then not providing it. He said that passing this ordinance, the
City would be able to say they did something to combat the problem, to relieve the
pressure on them from the community, yet, the problem still is not solved. He said that
the model ordinances of other cities at least put the paint behind the counters and make
certain requirements for purchase. He said, instead, this ordinance puts the
responsibility for correcting this problem on the backs of the individuals who have
already been victimized.

Rules and Public Policy Committee

Councillor Mansfield said that she is glad this ordinance does not put restrictions on the
sale of paints. She said that there are many responsible teens that parents send to the
store to purchase supplies for household repairs or school projects, and she does not
think she could support the ordinance if this language was added. It would also put the
responsibility on the hardware stores, and she feels a better solution would be to put an
abatement program in place. She said that she believes such a program could be
initiated easier than they think, because of the model already created with the high
weeds program.
Councillor Barth thanked Councillor Miller for his tenacity and for working very hard on
this issue for over a year. He said, as a former president of a neighborhood association
like Councillor Miller, he knows the realities of the impact of graffiti on a neighborhood.
He said that it is a consistent ongoing problem that is an indication of neglect or that the
residents in an area do not care. He said that he believes that Councillor Miller has
researched this very thoroughly and has come up with a good and right first step, and
he is happy to support it.
Councillor Lutz said that, while he has great respect for Councillor Miller’s approach to
this issue and strong appreciation for the TAG program, he has strong concerns about
this proposal. He said that he will be the first to admit that his district does not have
graffiti issues to the extent of some other districts, so it may not be as sore a subject for
him as for others. He said that having government telling a property owner who has
been victimized that they will now be victimized again really concerns him. He said that
this is further complicated because this type of crime usually takes place in the lower
economic areas of the City, and these individuals are the ones who can least afford for
that onus to be placed on them. He said that he also has a problem with the
government telling him how he must provide permission for someone to provide art on
private property. He said that many businesses have murals painted on the sides of
their buildings or on free standing walls or fences; and he feels requiring advance
written permission is contrary to property rights, and an individual could get around it by
saying they did it themselves. In that case, it would not be covered by this ordinance at
all, and there is no distinction between real or personal property. He said that if
someone keys his car, this is not covered by ordiannce, but if someone were to use a
screwdriver to do the same thing, it would be covered. He said that there is a difference
between illegal dumping and high weeds versus graffiti, because illegal dumping and
weeds also can bring health problems such as rats or other vermin. He said that one
neighbor may be obsessed with his lawn and his yard, yet another neighbor lives upwind of him and loves dandelions. This affects the other neighbor’s property, but
because of property rights, he cannot do anything about it. Councillor Lutz said that one
of his biggest problems with the ordinance is about how they respond to the
requirements with regard to the City’s own property. Some of the worst graffiti he has
seen has been on City property or school buildings. He said that with the high weeds
program, he constantly sees high weeds on City rights-of-way, yet they are citing private
citizens for this same offense. He said if they are going to do this, they need to put their

money where their mouth is. He said that he feels there is a better way to approach this
issue than saying a citizen has to remedy a situation in which they became a victim.
Councillor Lutz referred to his written amendment (Exhibit B), and moved, seconded by
Councillor Mahern, to “Amend” Proposal No. 52, 2013 as per the exhibit.
Councillor Mansfield said that she appreciates a number of points made by Councillor
Lutz, particularly with regard to the etching equipment used. However, she believes the
permission in writing requirement should remain. She said that she does not disagree
that the City should be as responsive as private citizens, but is not comfortable putting
the $1,000 amount into the ordinance with the City’s budget situation. She does,
however, think it would be worthwhile for the Mayor to issue an executive order to
address graffiti immediately. She asked if there would be any interest in working to
tweak some of the language. Councillor Lutz said that he has no problem taking the
dollar amount out, but he simply wanted to give the ordinance teeth to make sure the
City was held to the same standards as private citizens.
Councillor Miller said that he has no set timeline for this proposal, and he wants the
committee to feel comfortable. He said that he has no problem with continued
discussions, and would not have any problem removing those etching tool exclusions.
He agreed that the “in writing” language should remain, but said that he is okay with
more research on the remaining items, and feels Councillor Lutz makes some good
points regarding structured versus real property.
Councillor Mansfield asked if Councillor Lutz would be willing to withdraw his motion to
“Amend” so that she could offer a motion to “Postpone” the proposal for further
tweaking. Councillor Lutz withdrew his motion to “Amend” Proposal No. 52, 2013.
Councillor Mahern withdrew his second and said that he appreciates Councillor Lutz
bringing forth a well-thought-out and reasonable amendment. He said that he has not
had time to digest it all, but he feels it brings up some important issues, and if they are
going to do this, they need to do it right. He said that if the City is forced to grapple with
its own problem of abatement, maybe they would be more inclined to find an answer to
funding an abatement program. He said that IDI does a fine job with abatement
downtown, but they need to marshal the same kind of resources to the communities.
He said that he is supportive of the concept of this proposal.
Councillor Mansfield moved, seconded by Councillor McQuillen, to “Postpone” Proposal
No. 52, 2013 until March 12, 2013. The motion carried by a vote of 6-0. There being no
further business, and upon motion duly made, the Rules and Public Policy Committee
was adjourned at 6:50 p.m.
Respectfully Submitted,

(a) Any department of the city that receives a complaint regarding property within the city that is
defaced by graffiti shall forward that complaint to the Department of Code Enforcement, which shall make
a record of, and assign a case number to, such complaint. An authorized individual shall visually inspect
the property in question. If the authorized individual determines that the property has been defaced by

SPECIAL ORDERS - PUBLIC HEARING ON PROPOSED BUDGETS
President Cockrum called for public testimony on the proposed 2010 budget proposals. Public
testimony was accepted on the following proposals:
PROPOSAL NO. 313, 2009 - adopts the annual budget for the Indianapolis Airport
Authority for 2010. PROPOSAL NO. 314, 2009 - adopts the annual budget for the
Capital Improvement Board of Managers for 2010. PROPOSAL NO. 315, 2009 adopts the annual budget for the Health and Hospital Corporation for 2010.
PROPOSAL NO. 316, 2009 - adopts the annual budget for the Indianapolis Public
Transportation Corporation (IndyGo) for 2010. PROPOSAL NO. 317, 2009 - adopts
the annual budget for the Indianapolis-Marion County Public Library for 2010.
PROPOSAL NO. 318, 2009 - adopts the annual budget for the Police Special Service
District for 2010. PROPOSAL NO. 319, 2009 - adopts the annual budget for the Fire
Special Service District for 2010. PROPOSAL NO. 320, 2009 - adopts the annual
budget for the Solid Waste Collection Special Service District for 2010. PROPOSAL
NO. 321, 2009 - adopts the annual budget for Indianapolis and Marion County for
2010. PROPOSAL NO. 322, 2009 - adopts the annual budget for the Ben Davis
Conservancy District for 2010.
Janis Mikits, employee of the Parks Department, said that privatizing government services caused
many employees to lose their jobs, and then the City turned around and bought the Water
Company. He said that contractors cannot do the job for less than full-time employees, and the
Council needs to reconsider out-bidding services and contracts at the expense of city employees.
Patrick Brennan, employee of the Parks Department, said that it pains him to hear of privatization
and loss of employment in the media. He said that the employees are the last to learn of this, and
that is not good practice. He said that if the city goes the route of privatization, the bidding
process should be fair and employees should be allowed to bid on the jobs.
Shane Brinkman, president of AFSCME Local 87, stated that he represents maintenance and park
rangers for Indy Parks. He said that weekly salaries is proposing a cut of $866,913 for 2010,
approximately 29% of maintenance employees. Employees are already down 10 positions from
the former administration and this cut would leave only 52 employees to serve over 11,000 acres
in 206 parks. He said that cutting this amount from salaries would not be enough money for
contractors to do the job at the same level.
Ronald Asher, employee of the Parks Department, said that cutting this salary for bids that have
not been bid is not good practice. He said that he would guarantee that Parks employees can do
the job for less than any contractor.
Larry Vaughn, citizen, said that Mayor Greg Ballard is promoting slave labor to displace good
citizens who have been laboring in this community for many years. He said that slave labor has a
two-edged sword, and cuts both ways. He said that this Council granted millions of dollars to
bail out the Capital Improvement Board (CIB) at their last meeting, but cannot spend the money
to maintain the labor force. He said that bringing in Guatemalan laborers at $2.50 an hour to put
these men out of their jobs is slave labor in its purest form.
Cathy Burton, president of the Marion County Alliance of Neighborhood Associations
(MCANA), applauded the Controller’s Office for presenting a balanced budget and safeguarding
the city with a Rainy Day Fund and healthy fund balances. She said that they do not support the

10

Rainy Day Fund being raided for a CIB bailout. She said that they want to make sure the
Department of Metropolitan Development’s (DMD) core services are guarded if this ordinance is
not passed. She said that MCANA members are extremely concerned about the cuts to the Parks
Department budget, as they have already deferred maintenance and underfunded programs. She
said that the city could possibly look at restoring some of their funding through the Rainy Day
Fund. She said that she still has concerns about the clarification on the shortfall in the Sheriff’s
Pension Fund.
Clint Bolser, president and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Noble of Indiana, thanked the
Council for their past and current support of Noble and people with disabilities. He said that they
could not have served the people they have over the years without the City’s support. He said
that there are four who have come to testify, and they are just a small sample of those who these
funds have helped serve. He said that this funding is an investment in the well-being of the
community.
Sharon O’Brien, Noble of Indiana board member and parent advocate, said that she moved to this
city after her husband was named coach of the Indiana Pacers. She said that having a child with
developmental disabilities, Noble helped them maneuver through the process of applying for
benefits for their daughter, Caitlyn. She said that she was later asked to join the Noble board and
has been inspired by the compassion of the staff in providing hope and a sense of community to
this city’s most vulnerable citizens. She thanked the Council for their support.
Caitlyn O’Brien, Noble worker, thanked the Council for their support of Noble. She said that she
has lived in eight states, and the first friends she met in Indiana were from Noble. She said that
Noble helped her find a job at Marsh Supermarket and provided her with a job coach. She said
that she feels the city’s support of Noble has helped her have a great life in Indianapolis.
Dee Lloyd, Noble parent, and daughter Mya, stated that being at Noble has given Mya
confidence, friends, and accomplishments. She said that Noble has been a life-changing
experience for Mya and their family.
Barbara Mussler, employment consultant through Noble of Indiana, exchanged a brief question
and answer dialogue with Noble worker, Jeffrey Thomas Cornell, who has worked at Marsh
Supermarkets for 23 years as a utility clerk. Mr. Cornell said that Noble helped him find the job
and trained him to keep the job, resulting in winning citizenship and longevity awards. Ms.
Mussler said that Mr. Cornell is the first person in the state to get a job through supportive
employment through Noble.
Jill Ditmire, owner of Massachusetts Avenue Wine Shop and president of board of directors of
Indy Fringe, provided Councillors with handouts from IndyFringe and asked the Council not to
forget the arts organizations. She said that arts add to the quality of life in every city.
Reverend Mmoja Ajabu said that this appears to be a very hard-hearted budget, decreasing the
Parks budget and increasing the Police budget. Crime Prevention, for which taxes were raised
65%, has lost $1 million of what was promised each year for supposed administrative costs. He
asked if the city is more concerned with locking people up instead of using parks and crime
prevention to stop the crime. He said that this budget calls into question if there is anything good
in the city budget. He asked the members to not look at what is legal, but look at what is right.
Lettie Oliver, associate of AFSCME Local 62, said that she is appalled that the Council is looking
at taking $866,000 out of Parks. She said that when privatization took place under former Mayor

Steve Goldsmith, the Union employees bid on those jobs and won eight out of 10 contracts. She
said that they are not opposed to competing for the jobs, but the requests for proposals (RFPs)
will not go out until January, and yet the budget is being cut. This will cause 22 to 25 people to
lose their jobs. She asked how many would be opposed to losing world-class parks.

homeowners as a homestead credit.

PROPOSAL NO. 311, 2009. Councillor Pfisterer reported that the Administration and Finance
Committee heard Proposal No. 311, 2009. The proposal, sponsored by Councillors Pfisterer and
Moriarty Adams, provides for additional appropriations and transfers in the 2009 Budget for
various city and county agencies affecting various city and county funds to provide for continued
operations and services of agencies. By a 5-0 vote, the Committee reported the proposal to the
Council with the recommendation that it do pass as amended.
President Cockrum called for public testimony at 8:12 p.m.
Mr. Vaughn said that federal grants are still tax dollars, and they are lining the local budget with
federal grants. They are therefore taking over the operations of the city and deciding where local
tax money is spent.
Councillor Pfisterer said that the grant money the city receives is tax money sent to the federal
government and she is in favor of returning every dollar to the city to make Indianapolis a better
place to live.
Councillor Nytes asked if the amendment of dollars for the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police
Department (IMPD) is to cover the 27th pay, and if this is being addressed by moving money out
of the fuel budget. She asked if this will leave them with a new problem in funding fuel. Jason

14

August 31, 2009

Dudich, Deputy Controller, said that IMPD has worked to shift funds and find savings or cuts to
help fund this. He said that the fuel budget was based on previous fuel costs, and there is
significant overfunding. Councillor Nytes asked if handling the 27th pay in the 2009 budget will
allow them to process the salary at this year’s rate for a slight difference in pay, since salaries go
up next year. Mr. Dudic replied in the affirmative and it would cost them an extra percentage if
they waited to handle the 27th pay until 2010.
There being no further testimony, Councillor Pfisterer moved, seconded by Councillor Moriarty
Adams, for adoption. Proposal No. 311, 2009, as amended, was adopted on the following roll
call vote; viz:

SPECIAL ORDERS - FINAL ADOPTION
PROPOSAL NO. 237, 2009. Councillor Vaughn reported that the Public Safety and Criminal
Justice Committee heard Proposal No. 237, 2009 on July 1, 2009. The proposal received an
indecisive vote at the July 20, 2009 Council meeting, and then was amended and returned to
committee on August 10, 2009. The proposal then was heard again by the Public Safety and
Criminal Justice Committee at a special meeting on August 19, 2009. The proposal, sponsored
by Councillor McQuillen, amends the Code to restrict solicitation at intersections. Councillor
Vaughn deferred to Councillor McQuillen, who outlined his reasons for introducing the proposal.
By a 5-1 vote, the Committee reported the proposal to the Council with the recommendation that
it do pass as amended by the full Council.
Councillor Coleman said that he believes that this is sugar-coated class warfare and he does not
support it.
Councillor Brown stated that Councillor McQuillen testified that he did not speak to any poor
people or panhandlers and asked if he has since spoken to any panhandlers. Councillor
McQuillen said that a panhandler did attend the meeting and he did speak with him and with
several others. Councillor Brown asked how many of the panhandling arrests were for blocking
an intersection and which were aggressive. Councillor McQuillen said that he does not have that
information. Councillor Brown asked Councillor Plowman or Councillor Hunter if they have
issued any panhandling tickets. Councillor Plowman stated that his duties do not include
patrolling that, and he sent statistics to Councillors Brown and Oliver at their request after the last
meeting. Councillor Hunter said that his duties when he worked for IMPD were mostly
administrative and he did not write any panhandling violations, but blocking an intersection is an
arrest offense, not a ticketing offense. He said that he has made misdemeanor arrests for blocking
an intersection.
Councillor Mansfield said that it is already illegal to solicit in the intersection and streets. She
said that it is clear even some in the media have not read the current ordinance in place. She said
that this proposal is begging the city to lose money on lawsuits. She said it is fiscally
irresponsible and will affect church youth groups, sign holders and advertisers negatively.
Enforcement should be focused on the existing ordinance, and passing this will simply waste
valuable resources.
Councillor Plowman said that there was a law enforcement official at the Public Safety and
Criminal Justice Committee hearing. He asked what his testimony was. Councillor McQuillen
said that Commander David Pierce expressed concerns about dollars given to professional
panhandlers going toward drugs and alcohol and he was in favor of the proposal as a tool for
public safety.

24

August 31, 2009

Councillor Moriarty Adams said that she spoke with Chief Spears and Sargeant Hipple, and there
were only 63 arrests for panhandling in the downtown area, and the outlying four districts had no
statistics. She said that the new ordinance will give citizens a false sense of security, as past
performance for issuing tickets for panhandling has not been a priority, and their priorities make
sense. She said that enforcement statistics should bear out the need for this new ordinance.
Councillor McQuillen said that the 63 arrests only represent the downtown area, and many of his
constituents work downtown. However, panhandling is a problem across the county, and there
were 300 citations county-wide.
Councillor Nytes said that an employee at a pizza establishment is already prohibited from
standing in the street with a sign to advertise specials. However, a measuring tape would now be
needed to see if they are legal or not. She said it would also prevent the Right-To-Life marches.
She said that giving money to panhandlers is not helpful and simply encourages the problem, but
this ordinance seems counter-productive.
Councillor Sanders said that the 300 citations were not necessarily panhandling incidents but
were simply intersection violations.
Councillor B. Mahern said that citizens should not surrender more of their rights simply because
those who have enforcement tools have not used them to their fullest. He said that he has not
seen statistics that warrant those tools being widened. He said that rights should not be forfeited
in order to provide easier enforcement.
Councillor Bateman said that this is not about panhandling but is a violation of rights. He said
that this will simply encourage lawsuits.
Councillor Vaughn said that all 300 arrests to which Councillor McQuillen referred were actual
panhandling arrests in the last 18 months. He said that stating that they are not enforcing current
laws makes no sense on the face of 300 arrests. He said that this proposal gives officers a tool to
handle these issues quickly and move on to more serious crimes.
Councillor Hunter stated that it takes more effort to watch for traffic blocking than to handle other
crimes, and several appellate cases have upheld similar legislation in New York.
Councillor Oliver said that stopping cars 50 feet away from an intersection will cause more
problems. He said that he has received many calls and comments from his constituents, which
are predominantly black men, and the unintended consequences will be to discriminate and
promote selective enforcement.
Councillor Sanders moved, seconded by Councillor Gray, to call for the question. The question
was called by a voice vote.
Councillor Vaughn moved, seconded by Councillor McQuillen, for adoption. Proposal No. 237,
2009, as amended, was adopted on the following roll call vote; viz:

Proposal No. 237, 2009 was retitled GENERAL ORDINANCE NO. 85, 2009, and reads as
follows:
CITY-COUNTY GENERAL ORDINANCE NO. 85, 2009
A PROPOSAL FOR A GENERAL ORDINANCE amending the Revised Code of the Consolidated City
and County to restrict solicitation at intersections.
BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY-COUNTY COUNCIL OF THE
CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS AND OF MARION COUNTY, INDIANA:
SECTION 1. Sections 431-702 and 431-703 of the "Revised Code of the Consolidated City and County,"
regarding prohibited activities in roadways and interference with vehicular traffic, respectively, hereby are
amended by the deletion of the language that is stricken-through, and by the addition of the language that is
underscored, to read as follows:
Sec. 431-702. Prohibited activity in around roadways.
It shall be unlawful for a pedestrian to sit, stand or move within or upon a roadway, or a median
between two (2) roadways, or within the public right-of-way not exceeding fifty (50) feet from the
traveled portion of any intersection controlled by an automatic traffic signal or stop sign, for the purpose
of or while engaged in (by oral or written methods):
(1) Soliciting, or peddling, selling, advertising, donating, or distributing any product, property, or
service, including but not limited to tickets, handbills, newspapers, or other printed material, to or
from an occupant of a vehicle in the roadway; or,
(2) Conversation or discourse with an occupant of a vehicle in the roadway.
Sec. 431-703. Interference with vehicular traffic.
It shall be unlawful for a person (by oral or written methods) to solicit, or to peddle, sell, advertise,
donate, or distribute any product, property, or service, including but not limited to tickets, handbills,
newspapers, or other printed material, to an occupant of a vehicle within or upon a roadway, or to engage
in conversation or discourse with an occupant of a vehicle within or upon a roadway, or to engage in
conversation or discourse with an occupant of a vehicle within or upon a roadway or a median between
two (2) roadways, or within the public right-of-way not exceeding fifty (50) feet from the traveled
portion of any intersection controlled by an automatic traffic signal or stop sign, so as to:
(1) Endanger the safety or welfare of an occupant of a vehicle within or upon a roadway, or a
pedestrian on within the immediate vicinity;
(2) Impede the free flow of vehicular traffic on the roadway; or,
(3) Obstruct or distract the view of the driver of any such vehicle within or upon a roadway.
SECTION 2. The expressed or implied repeal or amendment by this ordinance of any other ordinance or part
of any other ordinance does not affect any rights or liabilities accrued, penalties incurred, or proceedings
begun prior to the effective date of this ordinance. Those rights, liabilities, and proceedings are continued, and
penalties shall be imposed and enforced under the repealed or amended ordinance as if this ordinance had not
been adopted.
SECTION 3. Should any provision (section, paragraph, sentence, clause, or any other portion) of this
ordinance be declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid for any reason, the remaining
provision or provisions shall not be affected, if and only if such remaining provisions can, without the invalid
provision or provisions, be given the effect intended by the Council in adopting this ordinance. To this end
the provisions of this ordinance are severable.

26

Journal of the City-County Council

SECTION 4. This ordinance shall be in full force and effect from and after adoption and compliance with
IC 36-3-4-14.

PROPOSAL NO. 292, 2009. Councillor Pfisterer reported that the Administration and Finance
Committee heard Proposal No. 292, 2009 on August 11 and 18, 2009. The proposal, sponsored
by Councillors Lutz, Mansfield and McQuillen, amends the Code to reduce the salaries for
elected township assessors whose responsibilities were transferred to the county assessor as a
result of HEA 1001, 2008 and the 2008 referendum. By a 4-3 vote, the Committee reported the
proposal to the Council with the recommendation that it do pass.
Councillor Sanders called for a point of order and said that she believes this proposal is not
properly before this body. She said that although the agenda reports the first action by the
Committee as indecisive, it was actually decisive. In order for it to pass out of committee, it must
pass with a majority vote. She said that the minutes clearly stated that the motion failed by lack
of majority. She added that an indecisive vote is only relative to a vote on the floor by the full
Council and it is against the Council Rules to have this item on the agenda this evening.
President Cockrum asked General Counsel Robert Elrod for an opinion on Councillor Sanders’
point of order. Mr. Elrod stated that a motion was made to send it to the Council with a “do pass”
recommendation. That motion mailed, but the item remains pending before the committee and it
is not in violation of the Rules to then make any other motion on that item. He said that the item
stays in Pending until a definitive recommendation comes out of the committee.
Councillor Pfisterer said that this matter was heard previously. Councillor Sanders called for a
point of order and stated that this is not the same proposal and is a new proposal. Councillor
Pfisterer said that this is correct, but that the issue is the same as a previous proposal, and this
prposal will save the city and county $38,000. She said that township assessors have had a year
to find work and are not providing any service to citizens, and the law allows the city to pay them
at their 1980 salaries.
Councillor Mansfield stated that in her opinion, the referendum settled this matter by voting the
township assessors out of office. She said that as far as she is concerned, this is simply ghost
employment, and Marion County is unfortunately different than other counties who were able to
zero out these salaries. She said that given the budget restraints, they need to be fiscally
responsible with taxpayer dollars and not pay any more than they are legally required to pay.
Councillor Lutz said that this is not meant to be a reflection on the job the township assessors
have done, but these individuals have not been in those positions for almost a year now, and this
is simply the Council doing it’s job of annually adjusting elected officials’ salaries. He said that
the legal logic says that if a person is not doing the work, they should not be paide. He said that it
is taxpayer money, and they ought to get something for it. He said he feels the citizens spoke
loudly through the referendum to eliminate the positions, and it seems the only reason the Council
is fighting over this matter is because some of these individuals are political insiders.
Councillor Hunter said that it is unfortunated that this is not a unanimous issue, as the voters have
spoken. He agrees that the amount should instead be zero, and although these are good people,
the Council is charged with being good stewards of the taxpayers’ money, no matter how painful.
Councillor Bateman said that state law requires that the assessors receive payment, and he is
taken aback that the Council would give the CIB all that money, yet try to save $38,000 by taking
money from people who were elected to fulfill a four-year term.

6

August 31, 2009

Councillor Nytes said that she takes offense to the remark that there is dissent over this issue
because individuals are political insiders. She said that the voters did speak, and every other
county actually were allowed to eliminate these salaries altogether. She said that she felt what
was decided last year with regard to these salaries was fair and consistent, and the 1980 salaries
do not relate to the work that has been done in the last few years. She said that they are being
asked by the State Legislature to condone ghost employment, and they need to treat all of these
individuals the same.
Councillor Malone said that she supports the proposal and said that last year her intent was for
fairness, compromise and equity, but this year is a different story. She said that these individuals
have had a year to find other employment, which many of them have, and it is time to pay only
what is required, no more and no less.
Councillor Vaughn said that he is appalled they are having this discussion, when no non-union
city or county employees will be receiving raises, yet they are contemplating paying people more
than the law requires who were essentially fired for not performing their job to standards.
Councillor Pfisterer said that the least amount paid to an individual would be $19,500 in addition
to benefits, and this is a more than fair compensation for not providing any service to the public.
Councillor Lewis asked if the $38,000 in savings will go back to the Assessor’s budget. President
Cockrum said that it will be savings in the general fund balance. Councillor Lutz said that this is
for 2010 and will not affect the 2009 salaries they are currently being paid. He said that the
reason for acting on this proposal now is so that they can re-direct those funds during the budget
process where they are needed. He added that the actual amount of savings is $36,980, and is not
much when they consider the fact that there are some employees working 40-hour weeks who do
not even make the federal poverty level.
Councillor Scales said that the assumption seems to be that these assessors are not work and need
these funds to survive, but most of them have found new positions, and this money is in addition
to new salaries. She said that it seems silly to squabble over this small amount after hearing
about Parks Department cuts.
Councillor Oliver said that he opposes the proposal and for consistency sake, if the CIB can
receive more money in their coffers when they are not showing up to work, then the assessors
need to be given the same lee-way.
Councillor Sanders asked for consent to abstain from voting on this proposal because of her
objection to the item not being properly before this body on the agenda. Consent was given.
Councillor Pfisterer moved, seconded by Councillor McQuillen, for adoption. Proposal No. 292,
2009 was adopted on the following roll call vote; viz:
17 YEAS: Cain, Cardwell, Cockrum, Day, Hunter, Lutz, Mahern (B), Mahern (D), Malone,
Mansfield, McHenry, McQuillen, Nytes, Pfisterer, Scales, Smith, Vaughn

CITY-COUNTY GENERAL RESOLUTION NO. 22, 2009
PROPOSAL FOR A GENERAL RESOLUTION to approve the statement of benefits of Rexnord
Industries, LLC (hereinafter referred to as “Applicant”) which is an applicant for tax abatement for
property located in an allocation area as defined by IC § 36-7-15.1-26.

redevelopment, rehabilitation activities or installation of new equipment in Economic Revitalization
Areas (each hereinafter referred to as a “Project”); and
WHEREAS, pursuant to IC § 6-1.1-12.1, the Metropolitan Development Commission of Marion
County, Indiana, acting as the Redevelopment Commission of the City of Indianapolis, Indiana
(hereinafter referred to as "MDC") is empowered to designate Economic Revitalization Areas; and
WHEREAS, IC § 6-1.1-12.1 requires an applicant for Economic Revitalization Area designation to
provide a statement of benefits and requires the MDC, before it makes a decision to designate the area as
an Economic Revitalization Area, to determine that (i) the estimated value of a Project is reasonable for
projects of that nature, (ii) the estimated employment at the indicated annual salaries for a Project
indentified in the statement of benefits can reasonably be expected, (iii) a Project can be reasonably
expected to yield the benefits identified in the statement of benefits and (iv) the totality of benefits arising
from a Project is sufficient to justify Economic Revitalization Area designation; and
WHEREAS, pursuant to IC § 6-1.1-12.1-2(l) (as amended, effective July 1, 2008), a statement of
benefits for property located within an allocation area, as defined by IC § 36-7-15.1-26, may not be

SECTION 2. This resolution shall be in effect from and after its passage by the Council and compliance with

PROPOSAL NO. 344, 2009. The proposal, sponsored by Councillors Moriarty Adams and
Hunter, approves the first and second amendments to the agreement for the operation and
maintenance of the advanced wastewater treatment facilities and wastewater and stormwater
collection facilities between the Department of Public Works and White River Environmental
Partnership (d/b/a United Water Services Indiana).
Councillor Hunter said that this was heard by the Public Works board and they have asked the
Council to hear this tonight in order to start saving monthly almost $50,000 to $60,000. He said
that that this authorizes United Water to own and lease the vehicles per the 2007 agreement.
Councillor Sanders asked why the Council just received this information on their desks this
evening, when it was first proposed in September of 2008 and signed in February of this year.
She said that they have had six to eight months to provide detailed information, yet the Council is
given ten minutes to digest this information and make a decision. Councillor Hunter said that he
was originally approached in April, and the delay continues to cost the city. He said that the

11

Journal of the City-County Council

board has acted and all of those hearing are public meetings and are aired with appointees who
act on the Council’s behalf. Councillor Sanders said that someone’s lack of preparation does not
constitute an emergency on her part and this is inappropriate, and she feels it should go through
the proper vetting process of the committee. Councillor Hunter said that he is not totally in
disagreement of Councillor Sanders’ concerns and he asked Council Liaison, Jeff Roeder,
Department of Public Works (DPW) to explain why this matter is so time sensitive. Mr. Roeder
said that he takes full responsibility and should have given the Council more time. He said that if
it were not such a substantial savings, he would not have a problem letting it go through the
normal committee process. .He said that the cost they are seeing is two-fold: vehicles not being
replaced in a sufficient manner and the lack of proper vehicles causing them to not meet quotas
and goals. He said that they want to fix this problem tonight. He said they should have come to
the Council sooner, but there was quite a bit of discussion as to whether or not this needed to
come before the Council, and the Controller’s Office felt that a cost analysis was needed, but then
DPW ran into a legal hurdle where it was not allowable for them to purchase vehicles, and all of
these factors caused delays. He apologized and asked the Council to support the measure this one
time tonight in order to save taxpayers another $50,000.
Councillor Brown said that the Council argued for 20 minutes this evening about saving $36,000,
yet wasted $50,000 a month for six motnhs. He said that he will support the proposal, since
$350,000 has already been wasted and he would like to stop that waste.
Councillor D. Mahern said that he will support the proposal, even though he shares some of the
same concerns. He said that he trusts Mr. Roeder and the chairman that this is the best thing to
do, and he said that if this happens again, however, he will probably not support it
Councillor Coleman moved, seconded by Councillor Bateman, to return the proposal to
committee.
Councillor Vaughn asked for consent to abstain. He said that he is not sure that he has a conflict,
as he did not know this would be on the agenda for action and did not have time to check, but in
case he does have a conflict with his employment, he would prefer to abstain. Consent was
given.
The motion to return to committee failed on the following roll call vote; viz:
9 YEAS: Coleman, Evans, Gray, Lewis, Mahern (B), Mahern (D), Nytes, Oliver, Sanders
18 NAYS: Bateman, Brown, Cain, Cardwell, Cockrum, Day, Hunter, Lutz, Malone, Mansfield,
McHenry, McQuillen, Moriarty Adams, Pfisterer, Plowman, Scales, Smith, Speedy
1 NOT VOTING: Vaughn
1 ABSENT: Minton-McNeill

Councillor Gray asked why it took City Legal six months to decide if this was a good or bad
move. Mr. Roeder said that he will take responsibility for the delay, but there were many delays
through DPW, the Controller’s Office and City Legal.
Councillor Plowman said that in the past seven years, there have been many items passed through
in a rush due to timing issues under the administration of both parties, and he feels the Council
should just adjust to do the best thing for the taxpayers.
Councillor B. Mahern said that it is unfortunate that they have not been considering this issue for
the last six months, and he will oppose the proposal because the process needs to be preserved.

12

August 31, 2009

He said that Councillor Vaughn does not even know if a conflict exists for him because of this
quick passage, and convenience is not something he considers relevant.
Councillor Nytes said that she hopes present discussion with th Advanced Wastewater Treatment
facilities and the Water Company are looking for efficiencies and contract changes. She said that
these are vital public services and these should be brought to the Council for careful and public
discussions through the committee process. She said that she is uncomfortable moving quickly
through high-level decisions, and this is a wake-up call that if the Council is to be responsible for
voting on contracts, then they should be party to them from the beginning and hopes they will not
have similar issues with other modifications.
Councillor Hunter moved, seconded by Councillor Mansfield, for adoption. Proposal No. 344,
2009 was adopted on the following roll call vote; viz:
19 YEAS: Brown, Cain, Cardwell, Cockrum, Day, Hunter, Lutz, Mahern (D), Malone,
Mansfield, McHenry, McQuillen, Moriarty Adams, Nytes, Pfisterer, Plowman, Scales, Smith,
Speedy
8 NAYS: Bateman, Coleman, Evans, Gray, Lewis, Mahern (B), Oliver, Sanders
1 NOT VOTING: Vaughn
1 ABSENT: Minton-McNeill

Councillor Sanders asked for consent to explain her vote. Consent was given. Councillor
Sanders said that she is not opposed to saving the taxpayer money, but since she abstained on the
last vote because of the process, she has the same concerns regarding the deterioration of their
own rules and process. She said that they need time and opportunity to review large items like
this to make good decisions.
Proposal No. 344, 2009 was retitled GENERAL RESOLUTION NO. 23, 2009, and reads as
follows:
CITY-COUNTY GENERAL RESOLUTION NO. 23, 2009
PROPOSAL FOR A GENERAL RESOLUTION approving the First and Second Amendments to the

WHEREAS, the Department and United Water wish to reduce the Department’s cost by amending
the insurance and security requirements of the Agreement while still providing the City with sufficient

ADOPTION OF THE AGENDA
The President proposed the adoption of the agenda as distributed.
Councillor Hunter moved, seconded by Councillor Lutz, to add Proposal No. 22, 2015 to the
agenda this evening for action.
PROPOSAL NO. 22, 2015. The proposal, sponsored by Councillors Moriarty Adams and
Pfisterer, appropriates $12,930,158 in the 2015 Budgets of Marion Superior Court, Marion
County Sheriff, Community Corrections, Marion County Prosecutor, Public Defender Agency,
Forensic Services Agency, Marion County Coroner, and the Department of Public Safety, IMPD
and Animal Care and Control Divisions (IMPD General, Public Safety Income Tax, Consolidated
County, County General and Guardian Ad Litem Funds) for various public safety initiatives.
Councillor Hunter said that under Sec. 151-74 of the Revised Code, an article that was properly
introduced and sent to committee and advertised for public hearing, shall be labeled and placed
on the agenda under Public Hearing at the advertised meeting, as per Sec. 151-76. General
Counsel Fred Biesecker said that because a ten-day notification is needed for a public hearing,
fiscals often need to be advertised before any action is taken by the committee. The committee
postponed the fiscal, and that is the reason it has not been placed on the agenda. He said that this
issue has come up before, and this has been the same procedure with at least four fiscals over the
last six months. Under Sec. 151-75, a Councillor may move to advance such items on the
agenda, but it does not automatically go on the agenda. Councillor Hunter said that the language
in the code is “shall,” not “may,” and therefore he would disagree that it is a choice. He said that
this body should do what their rules prescribe, and he would respectfully disagree with the ruling.
Mr. Biesecker said that he believes Councillor Hunter is over-thinking the rule, but the item is
eligible for a motion to advance if there are sufficient votes.
Councillor Moriarty Adams said that this proposal was heard on January 21, 2015 in the Public
Safety and Criminal Justice Committee, and it was postponed because of questions regarding the
hiring of 115 recruits. She said that she has scheduled individuals to come to the February 18,
2015 meeting of the committee to address these concerns and she would prefer it remain
postponed until that time.
Councillor Hunter said that he will not go into his reasons for disagreeing with the ruling again,
but he has already made the motion to advance Proposal No. 22, 2015 to the agenda for action,
and it has been seconded.
The motion to advance Proposal No. 22, 2015 for action failed on the following roll call vote; viz:
13 YEAS: Cain, Evans, Freeman, Gooden, Holliday, Hunter, Lutz, McHenry, McQuillen,
Miller, Pfisterer, Sandlin, Shreve
16 NAYS: Adamson, Barth, Clay, Gray, Hickman, Jackson, Lewis, Mansfield, Mascari,
Moriarty Adams, Oliver, Osili, Robinson, Scales, Simpson, Tew

Without futher objection, the agenda was adopted.

SPECIAL ORDERS - PUBLIC HEARING
PROPOSAL NO. 300, 2014. Councillor Robinson reported that the Metropolitan and Economic
Development Committee heard Proposal No. 300, 2014 on December 8, 2014 and it was
postponed by the full Council on January 12, 2015. The proposal, sponsored by Councillors
Miller, Osili and Pfisterer, approves an amendment to the declaratory resolution and development
plan for the West Washington Street Corridor Economic Development Area. By a 4-2 vote, the
Committee reported the proposal to the Council without recommendation.
Mr. Biesecker stated that the reason for the postponement was a procedural matter, and the
proposal needed to be scheduled for publlic hearing. The committee took no further action on the
proposal. Councillor Hunter asked if the proposal was advertised for the January meeting. Mr.
Biesecker said that this is correct, and it was continued and postponed until this evening.
Councillor Adamson said that the postponement was done to give the administration time to
explain the status on the Meadows Tax Increment Financing (TIF) district. He asked if they
could have a brief update on this status so that he can support this additional TIF. Rick Mays,
Department of Metropolitan Development (DMD), said that the Meadows TIF will be brought
back to the Council at the next meeting in order to revised the boundaries. Mr. Mays asked why
the boundaries need to be revised. Mr. Mays said that the original boundaries did not meet the
statutory requirements for a development area. Councillor Adamson said that he would like that
information to be provided sooner on items such as these in the future, instead of having to
postpone items in order to get an answer six months later.
Councillor Hickman said that she met with the staff and they have explained the various issues,
and the new timeline has been accepted and is moving forward, and she is satisfied with the
process.

February 9, 2015

Councillor Gooden said that he would have preferred to send the proposal to the Council with a
“do pass” recommendation, but because of outstanding issues, they did not. He said that he
supports the proposal.
Councillor Pfisterer said that this item was on the agenda in 2003, when she first ran for Council,
and all Community Development Corporations (CDCs) and Neighborhood Associations in the
area are in favor of the proposal, and she strongly supports the initiative.
Councillor Miller said that this impacts his district, and the We Care Neighborhood is ecstatic
about it. He said that it is in a qualified census tract and there is a great need for this. He thanked
Councillor Adamson for staying on the Meadows TIF issue, and this is a prime example of the
good use of a TIF for depressed area neighborhood development.
Councillor Osili said that the majority of this is in his district, and he is most eager to see it pass.
The President called for public testimony at 8:09 p.m. There being no one present to testify,
Councillor Robinson moved, seconded by Councillor Adamson, for adoption. Proposal No. 300,
2014 was adopted on the following roll call vote; viz:

person and he would speak in opposition to this amendment. He siad that if Councillor
McQuillen wished to honor the other Nobel award recipients, he is free to craft a proposal to do
so.

McQuillen should have spoken to Councillor Oliver prior to this evening’s meeting to amend it if
Councillor Oliver was so inclined.

proposal for recognition be adjusted like this. He said that he questions the motive of anyone

honor all the recipients. He said that if Councillor Oliver is offended, then he will withdraw his
motion to amend.

November 30, 2009

4 NAYS: Cain, Scales, Speedy, Vaughn
1 NOT VOTING: Cockrum
1 ABSENT: Mansfield

Councillor Coleman asked for consent to explain his vote. Consent was given. Councillor

appropriate.
Proposal No. 256, 2009 was retitled SPECIAL RESOLUTION NO. 48, 2009, and reads as
follows:
CITY-COUNTY SPECIAL RESOLUTION NO. 48, 2009
A SPECIAL RESOLUTION calling upon the hospitality industry to reduce the negative impact of
outsourcing jobs on the community.
WHEREAS, Marion County taxpayers have already paid $970 million to subsidize the downtown
convention center and stadiums; and
WHEREAS, the downtown hotels such as Westin, Hyatt, and Marriott continue to earn profits that
would not have been possible without our public investment;
WHEREAS, the only significant benefit to the community is the quality of the jobs created; and
WHEREAS, Indianapolis hotel workers earn significantly less for work that these same companies
pay in Minneapolis, in Detroit, or in St. Louis; now; therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CITY-COUNTY COUNCIL OF THE
CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS AND OF MARION COUNTY, INDIANA:
SECTION 1: The Indianapolis City-County Council recognizes tourism as a growing and booming
industry in Marion County and wants to ensure the safety of visitors, the rule of law, and high standards

SECTION 4: This resolution shall be in full force and effect upon adoption and compliance with IC 363-4-14

PROPOSAL NO. 417, 2009. Councillor Lutz reported that the Rules and Public Policy
Committee heard Proposal No. 417, 2009 on November 17, 2009. The proposal, sponsored by
Councillors Malone, Pfisterer, B. Mahern, Lutz, Smith and McHenry, requests the General
Assembly to amend existing statutes to provide that the Council has binding authority on reviews
of township budgets in Marion County. By an 8-0 vote, the Committee reported the proposal to
the Council with the recommendation that it do pass.
Councillor Oliver asked what the statute says now with regard to who has authority over the
budgets. Councillor Lutz said that the township advisory boards do review budgets, but the
township trustees have the ability to circumvent the process. Councillor Oliver said that in
Marion County, the township boards seem to be doing a good job and he does not understand the
problem. Councillor Lutz said that during the budget process, the Council now has to perform a
non-binding review, and it was frustrating to get information in a timely fashion and in detail. He
said that they then made recommendations that the boards could either incorporate or not
incorporate. This requires a lot of work on the Office of Finance and Management and the
Council committee, but was a waste of time when it produced no results. He said that with
property tax caps now in place, there needs to be one local body looking at how those caps are
spread out. He said that non-binding reviews are ridiculous. He said that he is apprehensive
about sending anything to the other end of Market Street.
Councillor B. Mahern said that this proposal is about local decision making. He said that he
believes this body is elected to make tough decisions with the pool of money given. He said that
the townships are doing their job, but they are only looking at their township, and do not see the
big picture.
Councillor Minton-McNeill asked if township boards are elected officials. Councillor Lutz said
that they are. Councillor Minton-McNeill asked if the process has changed with trustees.
Councillor Lutz said that there is no change that he knows of, but that there is not communication
that he knows of between the trustees to see what others are doing.
Councillor Malone said that they wasted a lot of time on a ceremonious review of township
budgets, and none of the information received was consistent. She said that this body is penalized
if they do not timely review these budgets, and they are stuck with the prior levy, yet there is no
impetus on these boards to make sure they provide the information in a timely manner. She said
that it is not in this body’s best interest to continue to review budgets over which they have no
authority or regulation. She said that in the future, she would also like this body to look into the
surplus in some of these budgets.
Councillor Pfisterer said that the funds right now are very limited, and one fiscal body needs to
review all budgets to make sure priorities are covered.
Councillor Coleman asked to be added as a co-sponsor on this proposal.
10

November 30, 2009

Councillor Lutz moved, seconded by Councillor Pfisterer, for adoption. Proposal No. 417, 2009
was adopted on the following roll call vote; viz:
CITY-COUNTY SPECIAL RESOLUTION NO. 49, 2009
A PROPOSAL FOR A SPECIAL RESOLUTION requesting the Indiana General Assembly to amend
existing statutes to provide that the Indianapolis Marion County City-County Council has binding
authority on reviews of townships budgets in Marion County.
WHEREAS, current state law, IC 6-1.1-17-3.5, authorizes the City-County Council to review the
annual budgets and tax levies of townships located in Marion County but permits the Council to only
make nonbinding recommendations as to those budgets and levies; and
WHEREAS, the tax levies imposed by the townships can have an adverse effect on city and county
levies under the current property tax control limits; and
WHEREAS, the budgets and tax levies of the townships are not subject to any other local oversight;
and
WHEREAS, the City-County Council determines that the taxpayers of Marion County would be
well served by the Council having final authority with respect to township budgets, rate and levies; now
therefore:
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CITY-COUNTY COUNCIL OF THE
CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS AND OF MARION COUNTY, INDIANA:
SECTION 1. The City-County Council petitions and requests the Indiana General Assembly to amend
the necessary statutes to provide for the budgets of the townships be subject to approval under IC 36-3-69 rather than IC 6-1.1-17-3.5.
SECTION 2. The Clerk of the Council is directed to send copies of this resolution to all state senators
and representatives who represent Marion County and to the governor of the state of Indiana.
SECTION 3. This resolution shall be in full force and effect upon adoption and compliance with IC 36-34-14.

Councillor Brown asked for consent to explain his vote. Consent was given. Councillor Brown
stated that township officials are elected by their community, and they need to respect those
decisions. He said that until township governments are done away with, they need to be left
alone to do their job.

this is the second time they have attended the Council meeting to see a resolution take place. He
said that he has been receiving e-mails non-stop on this matter and has copies of petitions with
over 770 signatures against the measure, and the Council simply needs to vote on the matter and
dispense with it.

Councillor Vaughn said that he respects Councillor Coleman’s position, but that they should not
continue to consider the matter and have the public continue to attend hearings when there are not
enough votes to dispose of the matter either way. He said that to continue the matter on the
Council’s agenda is not responsible, and allowing it to return to committee will allow for more
pulbic input.
Councillor Speedy asked if a motion to strike would take precedence over a motion to return the
proposal to committee. Robert Elrod, General Counsel, stated that the motion to return to
committee was made first, and therefore would have priority.
Councillor Gray said that he supports the motion to return the proposal to committee as one of the
key sponsors is not in attendance this evening due to circumstances beyond her control. He said
that sponsors should be afforded the courtesy to champion their cause.
Councillor Mahern asked for consent to abstain from voting on the motion to return Proposal No.
371, 2009 to committee. Consent was given.

WHEREAS, the City of Indianapolis, Indiana (the "Issuer"), is authorized by IC 36-7-11.9 and 12

WHEREAS, the diversification of industry and increase in job opportunities (approximately 4 new fulltime equivalent jobs and 11 retained full-time equivalent jobs) to be achieved by the acquisition,
renovation and equipping of the Project will be of public benefit to the health, safety and general welfare
of the Issuer and its citizens; and
WHEREAS, it would appear that the financing of the Project would be of public benefit to the health,
safety and general welfare of the Issuer and its citizens; and
WHEREAS, it is tentatively found that the acquisition, renovation and equipping of the Project will not

SECTION 2. It approves, determines, ratifies and confirms that the issuance and sale of economic
development revenue bonds in an amount not to exceed $22,500,000 of the Issuer under the Act for the

equipping of the Project will serve the public purposes referred to above, in accordance with the Act.
SECTION 3. In order to induce the Applicant to proceed with the acquisition, renovation and equipping
of the Project, the City-County Council of the Issuer hereby approves, determines, ratifies and confirms
that (i) it will take or cause to be taken such actions pursuant to the Act as may be required to implement
the aforesaid financing, or as it may deem appropriate in pursuance thereof; provided that (a) all of the
foregoing shall be mutually acceptable to the Issuer and the Applicant and (b) subject to the further
caveat that the proposed inducement resolution expires on October 31, 2010, unless such bonds have
been issued or an Ordinance authorizing the issuance of such bonds has been adopted by the City-County
Council of the Issuer prior to the aforesaid date or unless, upon a showing of good cause by the
Applicant, the Issuer, by official action, extends the term of the inducement resolution; and (ii) it will
adopt such resolutions and authorize the execution and delivery of such instruments and the taking of
such action as may be necessary and advisable for the authorization, issuance and sale of said economic
development revenue bonds provided that at the time of the proposed issuance of such bonds the
inducement resolution is still in effect; and (iii) it will use its best efforts to assist the Applicant in
procuring the issuance of additional economic development revenue bonds, if such additional bonds
become necessary for refunding or refinancing the outstanding principal amount of the economic
development revenue bonds, for completion of the Project and for additions to the Project, including the
costs of issuing additional bonds (provided that the financing of such addition or additions to the Project
is found to have a public purpose (as defined in the Act) at the time of the authorization of such

PROPOSAL NO. 404, 2009. The proposal, sponsored by Councillor Moriarty Adams,
determines the need to lease approximately 2,525 square feet of commercial office space at 7363
E. 21st Street for use by the Marion County Assessor. By a 6-0 vote, the Committee reported the
proposal to the Council with the recommendation that it do pass.
Councillor Brown asked where the other satellite offices will be located. Councillor Pfisterer said
that they are negotiating other places. Councillor Brown asked why they are moving out.
Councillor Pfisterer said that this is a better lease, and is $1,000 less. Councillor Brown said that
this does not seem to be a significant enough savings to move. County Assessor Greg Bowes
stated that they are shrinking eight offices down to four and wanted the offices centrally located
in four quadrants.
Councillor Moriarty Adams stated that the office was also leasing space at Lawrence, and are no
longer paying that $122,000, so that saves a lot of money. Councillor Brown asked if they are
moving the Lawrence offices as well as Franklin, Perry and Warren. Mr. Bowes said that the
Lawrence lease has already been terminated. Councillor Brown asked what others are beign
closed. Mr. Bowes said that they intend to bring Perry’s offices and consolidate into others.
Councillor Brown asked if they did not just dump $44,000 into this site, only to close it next
month. Mr. Bowes reminded the Council that as a former Councillor he fully understands the
position in the appropriating process, and he did not intend to spend money that was not
appropriated, as they had money to spend. However, they would have had to delay other
expenditures if the money was not transferred. Councillor Brown asked if the west office is also
going to be closed. Mr. Bowes said that this is not in the plans today, but they are inheriting an
old building, and it may be too expensive to maintain. .
Councillor Lutz asked if Mr. Bowes is saying he is considering closing the Wayne Township
Office. Mr. Bowes said that he did not say that, but they are looking at options in maintaining the
current facility. Councillor Lutz said that it is only 10 to 15 years old. Mr. Bowes said that it has
undergone two major floods, and roof needs extensive repair, and they are taking all things into
consideration.
Councillor McQuillen asked how much they anticipate saving from this consolidation. Mr.
Bowes said that from the 2009 to 2010 budget, they are saving approximately $200,000 in rent,
by reducing eight offices to four. .
Councillor Vaughn said that $44,000 was in this character and spent to remodel a current
building, and this digest needs to more accurately reflect what this money is being used for.
Councillor Lewis asked for consent to abstain from voting on this proposal. Consent was given.
Councillor Pfisterer moved, seconded by Councillor Moriarty Adams, for adoption. Proposal No.
404, 2009 was adopted on the following roll call vote; viz:

Pfisterer moved, seconded by Councillor Moriarty Adams, to return Proposal No. 405, 2009 to

it is not productive to take them piecemeal.

PROPOSAL NO. 419, 2009. Councillor McQuillen reported that the Municipal Corporations
Committee heard Proposal No. 419, 2009 on November 23, 2009. The proposal, sponsored by
Councillors McQuillen and Nytes, approves the purchase, construction or acquisition by the
Indianapolis-Marion County Building Authority of all or any portion of the Wishard Hospital
project and a proposed lease or leases between the Building Authority and the Health and
Hospital Corporation to finance all or any portion of the Wishard Hospital project. By a 6-1 vote,
the Committee reported the proposal to the Council with the recommendation that it do pass as
amended.
Councillor Gray asked who is in charge of the money, and who writest the checks, Building
Authority or Health and Hospital Corporation. Mr. Elrod said that it would depend what the
check was for. Councillor Gray asked who ultimately has the authority. Mr. Elrod said that
Wishard contracts with Building Authority. Matt Gutwein, Health and Hospital Corporation,
stated that Health and Hospital is responsible for the construction and would therefore write the
checks.
Councillor B. Mahern asked if after construction, the property will then belong to Building
Authority and not Health and Hospital. Mr. Gutwein said that Building Authority will be the
owner, but Health and Hospital will have all the responsibility for the property through the lease
agreement. Councillor B. Mahern asked if there is savings in doing it this way. Mr. Gutwein said
that it involves lower interest rates and the moving up of construction by taking advantage of the
favorable conditions in the market. Councillor B. Mahern asked why Health and Hospital cannot
just borrow the money. Mr. Gutwein said that they will borrow some, but the total is more than
their cap, and they would like to borrow all of it up front at low interest rates.
Councillor Hunter asked why they are bonding $703 million, when they have $150 million cash
on hand and only need $750 million instead of $853 million. Mr. Gutwein said that they will
actually borrow the least amount they can, but $703 million allows the ability to do the entire
project without a tax increase. It is not, however, necessarily the amount they will borrow, and
they hope it will be less.
Councillor Coleman stated that Health and Hospital owns some long-term senior communities,
and he is employed by one of them. He asked for consent to abstain from voting. Consent was
given.
Councillor Plowman stated that this is a great opportunity for the city to get a better county
hospital. He added that with the economic development aspects of jobs initiated, this is a winwin situation, and he encouraged Councillors to support the proposal.

38

November 30, 2009

Councillor Bateman asked how many jobs will be created. Mr. Gutwein said that there will be
4,000 jobs at the height of construction.
Councillor Minton-McNeill asked if the construction employees will be from Indianapolis. Mr.
Gutwein said that it is their focus to hire Marion County workers, and they take a series of
approaches and procedures to make the money stay in Marion County.
Councillor Evans asked about minority and women owned business (MBE/WBE) goals. Mr.
Gutwein said that they use the city’s goals, at 15% MBE and 8% WBE. It is their best practice to
meet those goals as a floor, and not a ceiling, and they hope to exceed those goals.
Councillor Pfisterer said that she supports the measure in light of voters overwhelming supporting
the project. She said that she would like to see periodic updates since this is a very large amount
of money. Mr. Gutwein said that they are eager to provide updates.
Councillor Gray said that this will be a highlight project for the city in MBE/WBE participation
and local businesses, and he believes it will be monitored closely.
Councillor Brown congratulated Mr. Gutwein on educating the pbulic and living within their
means over the years. He said that he expects continued good work from HHC.
Councillor Lutz said that he supports this project, even though he cast a negative vote in
committee. He said that his concern is about rolling $60 million of debt into this debt. He said
that he has faith in Mr. Gutwein and the HHC, and congratulates them on finding creative ways to
raise money (nursing home income). He said that the city is in some of the messes they are in
financially at this time because they did not ask questions. He said that he will vote against the
measure because they are approving a debt in the amount of $703 million, even though they have
$150 million on hand, and the project only costs $750 million.
Councillor McQuillen moved, seconded by Councillor Plowman, for adoption. Proposal No. 419,
2009 was adopted on the following roll call vote; viz:
23 YEAS: Bateman, Brown, Cardwell, Cockrum, Day, Evans, Gray, Hunter, Lewis, Mahern

WHEREAS, using class activities and games, Ms. Rutz helps her students learn without even realizing
it; and

8

October 30, 2006

WHEREAS, Ms. Rutz views teaching as more than just a person in front of a blackboard talking to a
group of listening students, but views herself as somewhat of a parent figure and an advocate for children
to let them know how amazing they are; and
WHEREAS, the award brings a $10,000 educational grant to the Guion Creek Middle School in Pike
Township where Rutz teaches science to 155 sixth-graders; and

A COUNCIL RESOLUTION recognizing the 15-year anniversary of Hollywood Bar & Filmworks on

WHEREAS, when Hollywood Bar & Filmworks first opened, it was the first new downtown movie
theater in over half a century, with no other theater even being open for over two decades in downtown
Indianapolis; and
WHEREAS, Union Station had just collapsed and Circle Centre was not even a hole in the ground,
when Hollywood Bar & Filmworks opened, to become one of only a handful of downtown businesses to
be open past 8:00 p.m. every day of the week;and
WHEREAS, business for the theater increased by double digits every year (by 35% the year Circle
Centre opened, despite the presence of another downtown cinema there); and
WHEREAS, over the past 15 years Hollywood Bar & Filmworks has received lots of recognition
through favorable articles and stories from every form of media with consistent local awards for Best
Theater, Best Service, Service Excellence, Best Menu, Best Pizza, Best Popcorn, Best Margaritas, Best

the amount of downtown Indianapolis visits that the Colts generate – all without a taxpayer subsidy; and

9

Journal of the City-County Council

Los Angeles to New York, and various national television programs including the Food Network just last
month. During the Final Four, USA Today touted Hollywood Bar & Filmworks as a “must-see” in
Indianapolis for out-of-town guests; and
WHEREAS, since expanding to Chicago, the national publication Restaurant Business Magazine
called them one of the top new concepts in the country (somehow missing that they had been open in
Indianapolis for over a decade), and, because of the new Chicago operation, the Indianapolis Business
Journal just named them the eighth fastest growing private company in Indianapolis; now, therefore:
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CITY-COUNTY COUNCIL OF THE
CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS AND OF MARION COUNTY, INDIANA:

PROPOSAL NO. 535, 2006. Councillor Conley reported that the Public Works Committee heard

Mansfield, Abduallah and Bradford, approves an appropriation of $700,000 in the 2006 Budget of
the Department of Public Works, Operations Division (Transportation General Fund), for
anticipated overtime, snow and ice removal expense in late 2006 and other supplies. By a 5-0
vote, the Committee reported the proposal to the Council with the recommendation that it do
pass.
Councillor Schneider said that it is unusual to ask for money before the snow season hits, and
asked what the reason is for asking for the funds in advance. Michael Williams, Chief Financial
Officer, Department of Public Works, stated that it is not easy to predict snowfall, but if they have
an unanticipated storm mid-December, they would not be able to get an appropriation before the
end of the year, and this will just help them to be prepared in case. Bart Brown, Council Chief
Financial Officer, stated that they had asked the Department of Public Works to start anticipating
these expenses before the season instead of asking for funds after the fact.
President Gray called for public testimony at 7:46 p.m. There being no one present to testify,
Councillor Conley moved, seconded by Councillor Moriarty Adams, for adoption. Proposal No.
535, 2006 was adopted on the following roll call vote; viz:
