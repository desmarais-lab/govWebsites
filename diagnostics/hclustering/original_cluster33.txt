CARMEL HISTORIC PRESERVATION COMMISSION
QUARTERLY REPORT TO CARMEL CITY COUNCIL
JULY 2015
APRIL – JULY 2015
The Carmel Historic Preservation Commission’s work in this period includes establishing
several new documents to clarify procedures of the Commission. It is the goal of the
Commission to streamline and simplify the processes under their jurisdiction so that maximum
transparency and ease of interaction with the Commission is realized.
In May, the Historic Preservation Commission adopted a new Historic/Conservation District
Application Form and Instruction Sheet which clearly outlines the process for neighborhoods,
individuals, or other parties to seek historic and/or conservation district status for a property or
district. The Commission researched other communities’ applications while referencing
procedural documents utilized by other Carmel departments, boards, and commission. The
Commission adopted the new application and instruction sheet at their May 14, 2015 meeting.
The Historic Preservation Commission examined potential fees for Certificate of
Appropriateness applications. Commission staff researched the fees charged by Historic
Preservation Commissions statewide to inform the decision making of the Commission. The
Commission establishing this fee structure can help inform potential historic and/or conservation
district applicants of the potential financial burden. This filing fee would only be required if an
applicant is seeking a Certificate of Appropriateness within a designated historic and/or
conservation district. At the Commission’s May 14, 2015 meeting, the decision was reached to
adopt a $25.00 filing fee for any Certificate of Appropriateness. The Commission is working to
establish the Certificate of Appropriateness Application and will receive a draft at their August
meeting.
Throughout this period, the Commission worked to revise their Rules of Procedure. After
utilizing the rules document for a period of time it was determined changes were necessary to
clarify the actions of the Commission. The Commission adopted revised Rules of Procedure at
their July 9, 2015 meeting.
The Commission is exploring application as a Certified Local Government, a program through
the National Park Service and managed by the Indiana Division of Historic Preservation and
Archaeology. With this certification, it provides the City of Carmel additional financial
opportunities for grants and programs to support historic preservation throughout the community.
Staff is working alongside the Commission members to compile the necessary documentation.
Respectfully submitted,
Mark Dollase, Carmel Historic Preservation Commission Administrator

(b)
In order to evidence such modification of the Call Rights and receipt of such Call

of the Original Qualified Obligations, in whole or in part, for purposes of the laws of the State.
(d)
Notwithstanding anything in the Original Ordinance, the Original Purchase
Agreement or the Original Qualified Obligations to the contrary, the Amended Qualified
