                                      Wastewater treatment is the last line
                                      of defense against water pollution. It
                                      involves cleaning used water and sewage
                                      so it can be returned safely to our
                                      environment. While our lakes and
                                      streams clean water in much the same
                                      way, water treatment plants are faster
                                      and can handle more water. This makes
                                      treatment plants essential in areas
                                      where there's too much wastewater for
                                      nature to handle alone.

                                      Importance of Wastewater Treatment
                                      Plants
                                      Wastewater treatment plants protect
                                      public health from disease-causing
                                      bacteria and viruses. Today's treatment
                                      plants actually disinfect wastewater,
                                      eliminating many of these harmful
                                      organisms, and they protect water
                                      quality so we can enjoy clean oceans,
                                      lakes, streams, and rivers. In this
                                      way, wastewater treatment helps us
                                      enjoy life to the fullest.

                                      Wastewater Payments

                                      About Wastewater

                                      Where Wastewater Comes From 
                                      Each person in the U.S. contributes 50
                                      to 100 gallons of wastewater every day.
                                      It can come from: 
                                          * Homes: Human and household wastes
                                            from toilets, sinks, baths, and
                                            drains
                                          * Industry, schools, and
                                            businesses: Chemicals and other
                                            wastes from factories, food
                                            service operations, airports,
                                            shopping centers, etc.
                                          * Storm runoff and groundwater:
                                             Water that collects in street
                                            drains during a storm, as well as
                                            groundwater that enters through
                                            cracks in sewers

                                      How Treatment Plants Protect Our Water 
                                      A wastewater treatment plant protects
                                      our water in three ways:  
                                         1. Reducing organic matter and
                                            pollutants: Helpful bacteria and
                                            other microorganisms are used to
                                            consume organic matter in
                                            wastewater. The bacteria and
                                            microorganisms are then separated
                                            from the water.
                                         2. Restoring oxygen: Treatment
                                            facilities help ensure that the
                                            water put back into our lakes or
                                            rivers has enough oxygen to
                                            support life.
                                         3. Removing solids: This includes
                                            everything from rags and sticks
                                            to sand and smaller particles
                                            found in wastewater.

                                      How You Can Help Improve Wastewater
                                      Treatment 
                                      By using water wisely. Practice water
                                      conservation at home and at work by
                                      following these tips: 
                                          * Be aware of how much water you
                                            use in your household
                                          * By disposing of household
                                            products and other waste safely
                                          * Fix leaks, and install water-
                                            saving devices and appliances
                                          * Properly dispose of pet waste
                                          * Use fertilizers and pesticides
                                            carefully, following the
                                            product&rsquo;s instructions

Former Animal Care and Control Officer charged with animal torture
Ashley Chastain charged for illegal ear cropping on dogs in her home

(Indianapolis, Ind.) Marion County Prosecutor Terry Curry announced today that charges
have been filed against Ashley Chastain for conducting unauthorized and illegal ear cropping
on dogs in her home. Chastain was employed as an Animal Control Officer with Indianapolis
Animal Care and Control during the time of the alleged violations. She has been charged
with three counts of Torturing or Mutilating a Vertebrate Animal (Level 6 Felony).
According to the probable cause affidavit, the charges are a result of an investigation by the
IMPD Special Investigations Unit prompted by a report made to Indianapolis Animal Care
and Control that an employee was performing illegal ear cropping on dogs.
It is further alleged in the probable cause affidavit that detectives were told of an incident in
which Chastain and a friend attempted to crop a dogâ€™s ears without sedation and taped the
dogâ€™s muzzle shut. During the procedure, the dog suffocated and died. The dog was buried
in Chastainâ€™s backyard. During the execution of a search warrant on Chastainâ€™s residence, a
bag was recovered in the backyard containing the carcass of a puppy and items that
appeared to have been used in an ear cropping procedure.
Chastain was arrested this morning. The case has been assigned to Criminal Court 25, and
an initial hearing has not yet been scheduled.
A charge of a crime is merely an accusation, and the defendant is presumed innocent until
and unless proven guilty.

Public Works Committee
The Public Works Committee of the City-County Council met on Thursday, May 6, 2010.
Chairman Mike Speedy called the meeting to order at 5:34 p.m. with the following
members present: Ginny Cain, Ben Hunter, Brian Mahern, Dane Mahern, Janice
McHenry, Mary Moriarty Adams and Christine Scales.

PROPOSAL NO. 243, 2009 - approves and authorizes execution of an agreement
between the City of Indianapolis and Hamilton County, Indiana, for the exercise of
eminent domain authority and the construction of highway and drainage improvements
in Marion and Hamilton Counties
Brad Davis Hamilton County Highway Director stated that they feel that their proposal
mitigates most of the concerns that have been expressed previously. He stated that
this proposal will shift the roundabout to the north and to the east. He stated that this
completely avoids any right of way needed from the southwest corner. He stated that
about ninety percent of the right away needed for this project will be on the Hamilton
county side, and nine percent on the southeast corner. He stated that there are
considerable additional expenses; they will need to buy some additional total right away
and relocate a utility lift station.
Councillor Speedy stated that they have answered the concerns of the people involved,
and that he is grateful for the time spent to continually massage and come up with the
current proposal. He stated that he is sure that it is a considerable cost but feels that
the values and quality of life in the area will more than justify that.
Councillor Cain asked if they would be purchasing the home on the north east side of
the street. Mr. Brad Davis clarified that the person who owned the house is now
deceased and that they will be negotiating with his estate.
Mr. Davis stated that the exhibit has changed some, the limits of their project have
change some due to some issues with the Carmel annexation agreement, which
prohibits road widening, they are going to delete that work at this time, however it does
allow for intersection improvements so they will be continuing with that portion of the
overall project.
Public Comment
Julio Tierno stated that as a member of the board at North Willow Woods, stated that
they greatly appreciate Hamilton county highway engineers and staff for heeding their
concerns, and expects that they will abide by those conditions. He stated that there is
still a concern as to where the Pike township school bus will stop to pick up their
children. He stated that they urge the Hamilton County Highway engineers and staff to
seriously and responsively take the required measures to consider this important item in

their project in order to safeguard their children, it is the responsible thing to do.
Susan Blair, President, Pike township residence association, thanked the Hamilton
County representatives for the compromise and for working with the neighbors, the
residence association and the City County Councillors. She stated that Mr. Davis
contacted her with the revised plan, and that she has received no negative comments
regarding it. She stated that she would appreciate if the committee makes certain that
the plan is drafted into the final agreement so that they will know for certain what the
residences will have at the end of the day.
Ellen Dollennair thanked Hamilton County and the council for listening to their concerns.
Councillor McHenry stated that exhibit A showed 96th street as being straight like it
currently is, but that on exhibit B it shows it going further north and then coming back
down. Mr. Neal stated that exhibit A is a conceptual to show the general limits, East
West, North, South along 96th street and Township Line Rd, they just wanted to show
that they were shortening the length of work along 96th street. He stated that Exhibit B
displays the way the roundabout is being designed. Councilor McHenry asked if they
had been working with Pike Township Schools as to how they will safely pick up and
discharge the students. Mr. Davis stated that they discussed the issue with the Pike
Township transportation department, and they sent an email stating the following â€œNo
turn lane is necessary or wanted into the condo complex on the southwest corner of the
intersection. Due to the law stating that buses must pull to the far right of the roadway,
they would be required to make our student stops in the turn lane causing us hardships
in pulling back into traffic and also taking the risk of traffic not stopping for our stop arm.â€
He stated that their desire is to stop, put out arm and stop traffic. Councillor Speedy
clarified, that Pike township transportation feels it is safer not to have a turn lane,
because they expect traffic to stop, and if they had a turn lane it may encourage illegal
maneuvers that could be dangerous to the students.
Councillor Moriarty Adams moved, seconded by Councillor Cain, to send Proposal No.
243, 2009 to the full Council with a â€œDo Passâ€ recommendation. The motion carried by
a vote of 8-0.

PROPOSAL NO. 128, 2010 - appropriates $90,000 in the 2010 Budget of the
Department of Public Works (Federal Grants Fund) to fund activities related to the
development of rain gardens in the city, a tree planting and maintenance program at the
IREF, and an energy-efficiency retrofit program
Councillor Hunter moved, seconded by Councillor Moriarty Adams to amend Proposal
No. 128, 2010. The motion carried by a vote of 8-0.
Councilor D. Mahern asked for what reason they needed to split the money into two
different categories. Mr. Michael Williams, CFO, Department of Public Works stated
that it was a mistake that happened, putting all the money in character 3, the proposal

Members of the Public Works Committee

calls for supplies to build the rain gardens, which should come out of character 2 as
they go thru the procurement process, it needs to be in the proper category. John
Hazlett, Project Manager, Office of Sustainability, stated that they submitted this grant
application in December 2008, and (EPA) Environmental Protection Agency finally
decided to fund this program in the fall of 2009. He stated that this spring they were
notified that they were one of the three awards in the country under this program. EPA
sustainable skylines is a voluntary program for cities that promote best practices in air
and water quality, with an emphasis on innovative projects to educate the public and
engage the nonprofit sector as much as possible. He stated that with that in mind they
focused on rain gardens and tree planting. Rain Gardens are low lying landscape
depressions where storm water is directed towards them, they are planted with deep
rooted plants that are going to be able to remove pollutants from storm water. He
stated that they came up with a few projects for the grant proposal; one was a rain
garden educational program at Tech High School, where students can learn the how
and why of rain gardens. They also had an enhancement to an existing street scape
improvement project on Alabama street, basically bringing a rain garden component into
an existing plan project. He stated that also in this grant is money to fund rain garden
and rain barrel workshops for citizens. He stated that they also have a worker reentry
tree planting and maintenance program, working with the John Boner community center
as well as Indianapolis Re-entry educational facility (IREF), and with Keep Indianapolis
Beautiful neighborhoods program that has a goal of planting 2012 trees on the near
eastside by 2012. This grant would create a program with IREF to plant trees and
maintain trees in that area.
Councillor Speedy asked when they learned that they had received the grant.
Mr. Hazlett stated that they were notified in the fall of 2009, their original application
asked for 123,000 and they were asked to reduce that back to 90,000. He stated that
they received the official assistance agreement document in April 2010.
Councillor Speedy asked how quickly they could get the projects going. Mr. Hazlett
stated that they have proposed a start date of spring 2010.
Councillor B. Mahern moved, seconded by Councillor Scales to send Proposal No. 128,
2010, to send Proposal No. 94, 2010 to the full Council with a â€œDo Pass as Amendedâ€
recommendation. The motion carried by a vote of 8-0.
PROPOSAL NO. 129, 2010 - authorizes parking restrictions on the north side of
Brookside Avenue at Newman Street (District 9)
Nathan Sheets (DPW) stated that this proposal authorizes the department of Public
Works to implement parking restrictions on the north side of Brookside Avenue, west of
Newman Street. He stated that they received a request from Ellen Robinson, Executive
Director, Face Animal clinic. He stated that they are undergoing some renovations and
in order to provide a safe crossing for the patrons, they are recommending that slight
parking restrictions be installed. He stated that this will open up the sight distance
triangle and allow individuals to see the cars that are coming.

departmental review atleast_ten_(10)_days_prior_to_the_filing_deadline. This
allows staff time to review the project and request additional information
before the filing deadline. Failure to submit your application at least the
(10) days prior to the filing deadline may result in your application not being
on the next Madison Historic Board of Review agenda. After departmental review,
city staff will inform the applicant of the filing deadline for submittal of
fees and any additional information required. If that tenth day falls on a
holiday or weekend, the deadline will be the following business day.
The board wants to be able to visualize the project by reading your application
and its attachments and visiting the property. A_complete_application_includes
photographs,_and_often_drawings,_sketches,_and/or_product_samples_and
information._Applications_which_are_not_complete_will_not_be_accepted. Thus,
before you go to the board, please do the following: 
    * Plan Ahead - The board only meets once a month. Applications are due the
      first Wednesday of the month, with the meeting occurring on the fourth
      Monday (except when holidays interfere).
    * Have a Plan - Please don&rsquo;t commit to a contract or purchase
      materials until you are approved. Know what you want to do before
      applying to the board as you will be held to your application once
      approved. However, during the meeting things can change. You might find
      that the board will not approve your replacement windows unless they are
      the exact size of the original windows. If you have already purchased the
      windows, you could find yourself in a bind. 
    * Take Photos of Your Property as it Exists - Take both overall photos
      (front and back) and close up photos of areas that will be changed or
      that can demonstrate structural problems with the house.
    * Make Drawings of How the Structure Will Look - These drawings or sketches
      do not have to be technically perfect by any standard but should
      demonstrate your planned work.
    * Write a Detailed Description of the Materials You Will Be Using - Tip:
      Investigate staying true to the existing materials and sizes. Failing
      that, try to reproduce the look of the original materials as much as
      possible.

   2. CITY STREET DEPARTMENT SNOW RESPONSE - UPDATE, SUNDAY, DEC. 11, 7 P.M.



****** CITY_STREET_DEPARTMENT_SNOW_RESPONSE_-_UPDATE,_SUNDAY,_DEC._11,_7_P.M.
******


December 11, 2016 - The City of Fort Wayne Street Department crews are
continuing 24-hour plowing and salting tonight in an effort to keep the City
moving. Crews are concentrating on main arterial roads and connector streets to
keep them as clear as possible for emergency vehicles. 
Tomorrow, crews will begin plowing neighborhood streets. Residents who have an
option of off-street parking should use that parking option to assist crews by
allowing them to get closer to the curb as they work in neighborhoods that
typically have narrower streets.   
 
Plowing in the more than 400 City neighborhoods should be completed by Tuesday.
If there is additional rain or snow tomorrow, the plow trucks will move back to
the main roads.

PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT
From: Richmond Sanitary District
Contact: LuAnne Holeva, Conservation Education Coordinator
For use: Immediately through January 31, 2013

PSA: Out with the old and in with the new
Now that the holidays are over you may have new things. It might be time to go
through the cupboards and closets and clear out some of your unused items.
Many items that you no longer need may still have lots of good wear left in them.
Consider taking clothes you no longer wear that are in good shape to a thrift
store, charity, or church clothes closet for others to use. Perhaps you have extra
patio furniture, a ping pong table stuffed away in the garage, or even a stereo
system that still works that just takes up space. Consider selling them or
donating the items to a group that would use them. By choosing to pass on
items in good condition rather than tossing them out you save space in our
landfill and give someone else the opportunity to get some good use out of them.
Keep on Reducing, Reusing, and Recycling!
If you are in Richmond and need a container for your recyclable materials call
the Richmond Sanitary District at 765-983-7450 and request a blue Richie Roller
for your curbside pickup.

PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE
The Public Works Committee of the City-County Council met on Thursday, December
16, 2010. Chairwoman Ginny Cain called the meeting to order at 5:31 p.m. with the
following members present: Ben Hunter, Bob Lutz, Brian Mahern, Dane Mahern, Janice
McHenry, Mary Moriarty Adams and Christine Scales. Angela Mansfield was absent.
PROPOSAL NO. 300, 2010 - authorizes a traffic signal at the intersection of Blackford
and North Streets (District 15).
Nathan Sheets, Project Manager, Department of Public Works (DPW), stated that this is
on the outskirts of the Indiana University-Purdue University of Indianapolis (IUPUI)
campus. He stated that IUPUI has recently built a substantial parking lot on the corner
of North and Blackford Streets, and as a result they have determined that a traffic signal
is warranted there. Mr. Sheets stated that they have entered into a signal installation
agreement that spells out the responsibilities. IUPUI is responsible for the study,
design, construction and inspection cost. They will also be responsible for the energy
cost associated with the traffic signal; the City will pick up the maintenance of that signal
once it is installed.
Councillor D. Mahern asked if the city is comfortable with the study that was done. Mr.
Sheets stated that they do not see any potential negative impacts with the placement of
this signal.
Councillor Lutz asked what the cost of the signal is. Mr. Sheets stated that he is not
sure about the cost of this particular signal, but that a signal is generally around
$100,000. He stated that IUPUI is picking up the bill for the signal.
Chairman Cain clarified that the district Councillor has been informed and is okay with
the traffic signal. Mr. Sheets answered in the affirmative.
Councillor McHenry moved, seconded by Councillor D. Mahern, to send Proposal No.
300, 2010 to the full Council with a â€œDo Passâ€ recommendation. The motion carried by
a vote of 8-0.
PROPOSAL NO. 369, 2010 - reappoints Kenneth Hughes to the Board of Public Works
Councillor Hunter stated that Ken Hughes has been a long time appointee to the Board
of Public Works and he has not heard any complaints on Mr. Hughes and he has
worked well with Director Sherman.
Councillor Lutz moved, seconded by Councillor McHenry, to send Proposal No. 369,
2010 to the full Council with a â€œDo Passâ€ recommendation. The motion carried by a
vote of 8-0.

PROPOSAL NO. 370, 2010 - reappoints Robert Parrin to the Board of Public Works
Director Sherman stated that Mr. Parrin has been very helpful to the Board of Public
Works.
Councillor Hunter moved, seconded by Councillor Lutz, to send Proposal No. 370, 2010
to the full Council with a â€œDo Passâ€ recommendation. The motion carried by a vote of 80.
PROPOSAL NO. 371, 2010 - reappoints Dennis Rosebrough to the Board of Public
Works
Chairwoman Cain read the following email from Mr. Rosenbrough: â€œI am flattered to be
considered for reappointment to the Board of Public Works. I have enjoyed serving on
the board and being a part of some of the most innovative and successful projects in the
history of our city. I know that the Mayor and Director Sherman have great plans for
2011 and I am eager to support their efforts to serve the citizens of Indianapolis. Thank
you for your consideration.â€
Councillor McHenry stated that Mr. Rosenbrough is a neighbor of hers and she feels
that he is a very dedicated person and that he serves the community well.
Councillor D. Mahern stated that he was a little concerned with Mr. Rosenbroughâ€™s
attendance. He stated that he would like to postpone this, to give Mr. Rosenbrough an
opportunity to come before the committee to make sure that he will be able to have
better attendance next year.
Chairman Cain stated that she has talked to Mr. Rosenbrough, and he is willing to serve
and is aware of the calendar.
Councillor B. Mahern stated that one of the only criteria the Council has for people
being reappointed is attendance at meetings. He stated that he does not think that it is
out of order to expect an explanation of why someone missed 1/3 of the meetings.
Councillor Hunter stated that this has been one of the best Boards of Public Works in a
long time, and he would hate to delay moving forward on this appointment.
Director Sherman stated that he really likes the current Board of Public Works, and feels
that Mr. Rosenbrough is dedicated in getting the job done.
Councillor B. Mahern stated that he would be willing to accept further information before
the Council meeting, so as to not hold up the reappointment. He stated that if they
reached the Council floor and information is a clear indication that Mr. Rosenbrough
could not be effective as a participant of the board, he may possibly change his support
of the reappointment.

Chairwoman Cain stated that she has not gotten that indication, and they also need to
remember that these are volunteer positions and people are giving their time, but their
family and jobs come first.
Councillor Lutz moved, seconded by Councillor McHenry, to send Proposal No. 371,
2010 to the full Council with a â€œDo Passâ€ recommendation. The motion carried by a
vote of 8-0.
Councillor B. Mahern asked if it would be possible for Mr. Rosenbrough to send an
email to the members with an explanation of his attendance. Chairman Cain stated that
she will ask Mr. Rosenbrough to do that.
Councillor Moriarty Adams stated that she has known Mr. Rosenbrough a long time and
knows that he is a great asset to the Board of Public Works. She stated that her caution
is that in prior administrations she has seen board members not being able to show up
to the extent that it prevents work from being approved. She stated that it is important
to her that board members be able to show up so that they can approve the contracts
that need to be approved.
Councillor D. Mahern stated that he feels that Mr. Rosenbrough is an asset. He stated
that he wants to stress the importance of attendance. He stated that the Council does
get paid little money, but they do it for the good of the public because they want to serve
and help their community. He stated that he wants to make sure that they have people
on the board that have time to do the same.
PROPOSAL NO. 372, 2010 - reappoints Gary W. Whitmore to the Marion County
Stormwater Management Technical Advisory Committee
Councillor McHenry stated that Mr. Whitmore is a very energetic and dedicated person
who seems to care about the community and doing his job.
Councillor B. Mahern stated that he will support this reappointment, but would like to
have attendance records.
Councillor Hunter clarified that this committee has only met maybe once a year.
Director Sherman stated that in 2011, should the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission
(IURC) approve the transfer of Citizens, they will be refocusing on the stormwater
system, and then it will be more active.
Councillor McHenry moved, seconded by Councillor Lutz, to send Proposal No. 372,
2010 to the full Council with a â€œDo Passâ€ recommendation. The motion carried by a
vote of 8-0.

PROPOSAL NO. 373, 2010 - approves the Mayor's appointment of David Sherman as
the Director of the Department of Public Works
Director Sherman stated that, as of yesterday the Amendment 2 came out of the 30-day
filing register, so that will be signed and is done. He thanked the board members and
the staff, because most of them talk to him pretty frequently, and he appreciates the
comments, good, bad or indifferent. Director Sherman stated that he has had a great
crew and has been a lot of fun. He stated that they have three years in and are doing
pretty well, but plan to do better next year. He stated that next year Sustainability and
Parks are in his bullâ€™s-eye.
Councillor Hunter thanked Director Sherman and asked to be added as a co-sponsor on
his re-appointment.
Councillor D. Mahern thanked Director Sherman for his service and stated that he has
been doing a wonderful job.
Councillor Lutz asked how many snow removing trucks DPW has. Director Sherman
stated that they have 95 and 77 are in pretty good shape. Councillor Lutz asked if all of
them have snowblades and salt spreaders on them. Director Sherman answered in the
affirmative.
Councillor Lutz asked if there is a plan for rotating replacement of those vehicles.
Director Sherman stated that over a five-year period of time they should have
everything upgraded to decent shape. Over a 10-year period of time they should be on
a pretty good cycle. He stated that $2.5 million a year comes in from the funds from the
Covanta burning, and they are using that for vehicles of all kinds.
Councillor McHenry thanked Director Sherman for his service. She also commended
his staff and stated that they are a pleasure to work with.
Councillor McHenry read a note left by Councillor Scales, stating that she gives her
endorsement for this reappointment.
Councillor B. Mahern asked if there are any snow removal trucks out, and if they will be
going into the neighborhood streets. Director Sherman stated that the policy is that if it
is four inches or more and a storm is coming, they will hit everything, go into the
neighborhoods and everywhere.
Councillor Moriarty Adams asked if that is per event. She stated that she was told that
they would come into the neighborhoods at six inches. Director Sherman stated that
they look for a four to six-inch storm, because the neighborhoods get compacted and it
makes it hard for the trucks to get into the neighborhoods.

Councillor D. Mahern asked if there is any information they can give them regarding
parks maintenance or sustainability plans for next year.
Director Sherman stated that they all have the responsibility to rebuild the city, and that
the city needs some help. He stated that he met with the Park Foundation, and they are
looking at how to work together and get things done.
Councillor Moriarty Adams moved, seconded by Councillor McHenry, to send Proposal
No. 373, 2010 to the full Council with a â€œDo Passâ€ recommendation. The motion carried
by a vote of 8-0.
Presentation Irvington Streetscape Project- Mr. Patrick Sullivan and Ms. Margaret
Banning

Ms. Margaret Banning, Board President, Irvington Development Organization, stated
that the Irvington Development Organization (IDO) was formed in 2002, to promote the
unique attributes of Historic Irvington, to attract positive development and create a
balance of businesses in the area, to focus on maintaining a vital main street corridor
and thriving neighborhood to insure that the revitalization efforts are compatible with the
character of the community, and to enhance the quality of life for the Irvington and
Indianapolis residents. She stated that one of the first things they took on was the
streetscape project. She stated that they have been working on recruiting businesses
to the area. She stated that in 2006 they were able to get a grant working with the city
and the local initiative support corporation. They were designated a focus corridor
which is fostering commercial urban strategies, which has helped to pay for an
executive director for the neighborhood. Ms. Banning stated that through (LISC) Local
Initiatives Support Corporation and the focus initiative they have granted over $200,000
in facade grants, that has leveraged another $300,000 of private investments which has
totaled half million dollars in their neighborhood within the last four years, something
they are extremely proud of. She stated that their priority going forward is to start
securing grants to purchase and redevelop properties, so that they as an organization
can become a developer in the neighborhood.
Mr. Patrick Sullivan thanked the committee and the city for all the support and reviewed
the following. See exhibit a.

been scheduled for Thursday, August 7, 2008 at 6:00 p.m., and he would like to see this
proposal postponed until that meeting.
Councillor Plowman moved, seconded by Councillor Mansfield, to â€œPostponeâ€ Proposal
No. 141, 2008 until August 7, 2008. The motion carried by a vote of 6-0.
DIGITAL GOVERNANCE AWARD FOR LEADERSHIP IN DIGITAL ACCESS â€“ Rick
Maultra, Director, Telecom & Video Services Agency
Mr. Maultra introduced Channel 16 Station Manager Ken Montgomery, who will
navigate the website presentation. He said that the Telecom and Video Services
Agency (TVS) received second place in the national Governance Award for Leadership
in Digital Access for their webcast solutions and use of online archiving and video
archiving. The awards will be given out during an event on August 6 and 7, 2008
sponsored by Microsoft in San Francisco, which celebrates government entitites for
using technology in efficient ways. He said that TVS has produced and provided
several video-on-demand training programs, such as training for poll workers, where a
couple of thousand people were trained online at their convenience. He said that these
training webcasts were produced at TVSâ€™s facilities, and volunteers accessed the
training through the website of the Clerkâ€™s Office. He said that he believes these
webcasts contributed to a smooth election day process. Since launching the service for

Rules and Public Policy Committee
July 29, 2008
Page 2
video-on-demand in February of 2007, they have had over 110,000 online hits through
July of this year of people viewing public meetings, such as Council meetings,
committee meetings and neighborhood forums.
Mr. Montgomery gave a quick presentation of the website and showed a webcast of a
Parks and Recreation Committee.
Councillor Mansfield said that she is excited about some features of the webcast, like
being able to go directly to the discussion regarding a certain proposal in the meeting
without listening to the entire meeting. Mr. Montgomery showed how to skip to a certain
portion of a meeting. Chairman Lutz said that he also uses this function quite often, as
he cannot attend all the meetings, but is interested in certain proposals that might be
more controversial or have more public interest.
Mr. Maultra said that meetings can also be accessed through each department or
agencyâ€™s website from a link, instead of having to go to Channel 16â€™s website.
Chairman Lutz asked who gives this award. Mr. Maultra said that Granicus is a
company that serves over 400 municipalities doing like services, covering 39 states and
involving 29% of the population. They asked TVS to put together a presentation
because of what they were doing locally, and this is a national award that garners
recognition for the city. He said that some of the top programs viewed on their website
are the courtsâ€™ pro-se program, jury duty notices, and the December 17, 2007 Council
meeting. Mr. Montgomery added that these webcasts are available shortly after a
meeting is concluded, whereas the meeting will not begin replaying on cable television
until much later.
Councillor Speedy asked if meetings can be watched live. Mr. Montgomery said that
they can be viewed live on the main page of Channel 16, and he showed a live
webstream of this committee hearing.
Councillor Mansfield stated that there was one meeting in which the audience was
being completely disruptive and she could not hear what other Councillors were saying,
but she could hear all the comments clearly when watching the meeting later on
webcast. Mr. Maultra said that these webcasts can help the media or clerks responsible
for meeting mintues, as well, to provide a great public record. He added that the other
benefit to webcasts is that if someone lives outside of Marion County or is travelling and
cannot access local cable television channels, they can still have accessibility to
community meetings.
Councillor Plowman asked if the video webcasts are edited. Mr. Montgomery said that
they are not and are typically recorded gavel to gavel. He said that sometimes the
cameras are live in the room before a meeting is called to order, but that is trimmed off
of the archived webcast. He said that they do, however, leave any recesses in place on
archived versions. He said that they record four different versions of the meeting as it

Rules and Public Policy Committee
July 29, 2008
Page 3
takes place: one to replay on Channel 16, one for Granicus, one on DVD for archival
purposes, and one back-up tape. He said that state law requires them to retain these
public records for 10 years, and they keep a DVD version, as well as online archived
versions.
Chairman Lutz asked how far back they go with the recorded meetings. Mr.
Montgomery said that they have VHS tapes from 2000, but last year began saving
meetings on DVD. He said that video-on-demand extends back to April of last year.
Contractually, they are required to carry archives for a year with Granicus, but they pay
for that storage amount and are looking to extend. They will, however, keep DVDs
available beyond that.
Councillor Speedy congratulated TVS and Channel 16 on their award and stated that it
is nice to be recognized as a leader in the digital realm. Mr. Maultra added that they try
to model city television like C-Span in order to deliver information to the citizens, such
as evidenced with the state of the city address. He thanked the staff members of
Channel 16 and also recognizeed the Information Services Agency for helping to push
this effort forward. He said that he hopes the program continues to grow and the public
is made aware of this service. He asked Councillors to share this feature with the
neighborhoods and market it to constituents, to help with the Mayorâ€™s philosophy of
transparency in local government.
PROPOSAL NO. 348, 2008 -amends the Code to restrict the use and discharge of
consumer fireworks
Chairman Lutz recognized Councillor Coleman as the lead sponsor for this proposal.
Councillor Coleman said that in the weeks leading up to July 4th, he received so many
phone calls and e-mails about fireworks disturbing sleep and being a nuisance in the
community, that he looked into the current regulations. He said that state law allows
counties to amend the law within their county, except for certain dates. This proposed
ordinance would allow for use on certain dates, which includes New Yearâ€™s Eve and
several days before and after July 4th. The ordinance sets up a fine if the ordinance is
broken, with the first offense being $100, going up to $500, and then $2,500. He said
that this would not affect church groups, ball teams or large community functions, as it
does not cover commercial grade fireworks, which requires a permit process through
the Fire Marshallâ€™s office. He said that this only covers consumer grade fireworks.
Councillor Mansfield stated that she wholeheartedly supports the proposal and
considered proposing something similar last year, but found some restrictions in doing
so. She said that Senate Bill 9â€™s passage by the General Assembly allows for this type
of ordinance. She said that there does not seem to be a problem in using these
fireworks for a few days for a few hours, but using them constantly or during hours when
people sleep in residential areas causes the complaints. She said that there have been
many violations of fireworks use, including firing them off in the street, which is against
the law, and police should be called in this instance. She said that she also has a

Rules and Public Policy Committee
July 29, 2008
Page 4
related concern about temporary fireworks shops showing up in places that are not
zoned for the sale of fireworks, and they are gone before the violations process can be
enacted. She said that there needs to be discussion about how this process can be
sped up, and the ordinance should be looked at more closely to eliminate some of these
nuisances in the neighborhood. She said that this proposal is a good first step.
Councillor Speedy said that these seem to be reasonable restrictions, and he thought
they were already in place, so he generally supports the proposal, but wants to make
sure all interested parties are aware of it. He asked if there have been any calls
opposing the measure. Councillor Coleman said that he has not had any opposition
calls directly. He said that he appeared on a radio show recently to talk about the
proposal, and most of those who called in opposing the measure were simply opposed
to more regulations and laws in general. He said that no one has approached him with
the opinion that this is a bad idea. Councillor Speedy asked if the passage of the
ordinance will cause an unreasonable burden on law enforcement. Councillor Mansfield
stated that some of this should be considered a violation of the noise ordinance that
already exists, which is not very well enforced. She said that she does not think it would
be any more of a burden on law enforcement than the laws that currently exist in the
noise ordinance.
Chairman Lutz stated that the statute refers to counties, and the city should probably
not tread on the rights of the excluded cities to enact their own regulations. He said that
he would like to see the proposal amended in Sec. 407-201 (a) to read â€œany place in the
consolidated cityâ€ instead of Marion County.
Councillor Mansfield moved, seconded by Councillor Speedy, to â€œAmendâ€ Proposal No.
348, 2008 to delete â€œMarion Countyâ€ in Sec. 407-201 (a) and replace it with the words
â€œthe consolidated city.â€ She added that the word â€œCityâ€ was left out of the paragraph in
Section 1 and asked if it should readâ€consolidated city and countyâ€ or just â€œconsolidated
city.â€ Mr. Elrod stated that this refers to the title of the Code and not the boundaries it
affects and therefore should read â€œRevised Code of the Consolidated City and County.â€
Councillor Mansfield amended her motion to include the addition of the word â€œCityâ€ in
Section 1 after the word â€œConsolidated.â€ The motion carried by a vote of 6-0.
Councillor Coleman said that he believes most people in this city are polite and
considerate, and this proposal only is offered to address those few citizens who are not
good neighbors.
Councillor Plowman asked if this just governs consumer fireworks and asked what is
classified as consumer fireworks. Chairman Lutz said that he believes consumer
fireworks are defined in the statute. Councillor Plowman asked if sparklers and snakes
that make smoke are classified as consumer fireworks. Councillor Mansfield said that
she did read the statute and believes that consumer grade fireworks is somehow
defined by the amount of explosive material involved. Councillor Coleman said that he
is not sure that the type of small fireworks thrown on the ground such as these would

Rules and Public Policy Committee
July 29, 2008
Page 5
even qualify, but he is not sure. He said that commercial grade are considered C-4 and
above. Chairman Lutz asked if the consumer fireworks definition does include
sparklers, does the committee really want to limit their use and say that citizens cannot
use these types of products in birthday celebrations or other events throughout the year.
Mr. Elrod said that there appears to be a distinction in the law between consumer and
other fireworks such as cone fountains, sparklers, and wheels, but it appears they might
be considered banned by this proposal. He said that he can research the issue and
write an exception into the proposal if the committee so wishes. Councillor Mansfield
said that noisy fireworks are really the issue. Mr. Elrod said that he could provide an
amendment to exclude items that are not projectile in any way, such as cone fountains,
wheels, cylindrical fountains, and ground spinners. While these may.make some
squealing or rushing noises, they do not create the loud â€œpopsâ€ associated with many
fireworks that disturb the peace.
Councillor Cockrum stated that he would like to see this issue researched and an
amendment drafted, if needed. He said that since July 4th has passed, there does not
seem to be a time sensitivity. He moved, seconded by Councillor Mansfield, to
â€œPostponeâ€ Proposal No. 348, 2008 until August 7, 2008. The motion carried by a vote
of 6-0.
There being no further business, and upon motion duly made, the meeting was
adjourned at 6:09 p.m.
Respectfully Submitted,

Robert Lutz, Chairman
RL/ag

RULES AND PUBLIC POLICY COMMITTEE
The Rules and Public Policy Committee of the City-County Council met on Monday,
January 9, 2012 Chairman Brian Mahern called the meeting to order at 7:47 p.m. with
the following members present: John Barth, Vernon Brown, Monroe Gray, Maggie
Lewis, Robert Lutz, Angela Mansfield and Michael McQuillen. General Counsel Robert
Elrod represented Council staff.
Chairman Mahern asked committee members to introduce themselves and indicate
which portion of the County they represent.
Senior Staff Appointment Recommendations
Assistant Clerk
Chief Financial Officer
General Counsel
Chairman Mahern said that senior staff recommendations are as follows: Angela
Gonzalez as Assistant Clerk, Hope Tribble as Chief Financial Officer and Fred
Biesecker as General Counsel. He said that Ms. Gonzalez has worked in the Council
office since 1995, being promoted to Assistant Clerk in 2004. He outlined some of her
past and present job duties. He stated that Ms. Tribble has worked as a fiscal analyst
for the Ways and Means Committee of the Indiana House of Representatives since
2008, and served prior to that as a budget analyst in the cityâ€™s Office of Finance and
Management. Chairman Mahern stated that Mr. Biesecker served as chief counsel to
Governor Frank Oâ€™Bannon, where he drafted and reviewed legislation and advised on
legal issues. He added that Mr. Biesecker recently retired from private practice as a
partner at Ice Miller LLP.
Councillor Lutz moved, seconded by Councillors Gray and Mansfield, to approve the
recommendations of Angela Gonzalez as Assistant Clerk, Hope Tribble as Chief
Financial Officer and Fred Biesecker as General Counsel.
Councillor McQuillen said that he is impressed with the list of recommendations and
their qualifications, but is given pause because of the situation that occurred previously
in the Committee on Committees, where the minority members of this committee were
limited to two individuals instead of the traditional three. Chairman Mahern stated that
Councillor McQuillen is out of order and asked him to keep his remarks germane to the
motion on the table. Councillor McQuillen said that it is a shame that only two minority
members were allowed to support the appointment of these qualified individuals.
