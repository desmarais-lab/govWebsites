     are asking all Frankfort residents to take advantage of this public
     safety communication service. Information about local emergency
     situations, advisories and community news will be sent to their
     phones, so thereâ€™s no reason not to register and every reason to be
     in the know about whatâ€™s happening in our city especially regarding
     emergencies and everyoneâ€™s safety,â€ Bacon said. â€œWe are pleased
     to partner with Nixle to offer this secure, reliable and easy to

MINUTES OF THE BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS AND SAFETY
BRAZIL, INDIANA
FOR AUGUST 17, 2016
A Public Hearing was opened at 10:00 a.m. on August 17, 2016 with the Board of
Public Works in the Council Chambers of the Brazil City Hall to discuss the
Cityâ€™s trash service and proposals received.
Steve Wetnight, city resident, asked if residents can opt out of the trash
service, and rate changes. Mayor Wyndham explained that the customers are still
City customers, so they cannot opt out of the trash service. Mayor Wyndham also
explained that there may be a slight rate increase, but it will be less than
the possible rate increase if the City maintains the trash service. The City
will still control the rates. Mr. Wetnightâ€™s wife expressed concerns about
limb pickup and totes. Mayor Wyndham explained that limb pickup will continue,
and City residents will still have totes. Representatives from Gator Trash
Service asked about residents being able to choose their own trash service.
Mayor Wyndham explained that will not be an option.
Other residents had concerns about the length of the contract. Mayor Wyndham
explained that there are state recommendations for contracts, and we are within
that range.
Clerk-Treasurer Karen McQueen explained that finances of the Sanitation
Department, and the need to outsource the trash services in order to avoid
large rate increases.
