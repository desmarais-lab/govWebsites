LETTER TO THE COMMUNITY
The River District Revitalization Plan points the way forward for our downtown, toward
an even better and brighter future. The characteristics of this future were developed
through deliberate conversations between the residents of Elkhart, area stakeholders, and
the Planning Committee. This work builds upon and will leverage the significant publicprivate investments planned within the planning area. These catalyst level projects are an
incredible opportunity towards the District’s revitalization by leading economic and physical
development.
The plan recognizes the complexity of the issues facing the River District as well as the
opportunities that the area and it’s existing infrastructure provides. The plan proposes a
set of principles and recommendations that will build on the cooperation and leadership
developed within the planning process, and should forge new connections necessary for
the realization of the community’s goals. The effectiveness of the Revitalization Plan will be
measured in the success of its implementation. To that end, the implementation process will
identify recommended steps toward development, funding strategies, and phasing.
Developing the Revitalization Plan has demanded a great deal from all of us. The process has
proven that the people who make up our community care deeply about its future. They want
to see a City where they and their children can thrive. They want a District that is unafraid to
address its most pressing issues, and is inspired by strong and effective leadership.
We extend our appreciation to all the individuals, organizations and businesses that have
supported the plan-making process with their time, energy and facilities. Most of all, we
would like to thank every participant who has invested their time, energy and ideas into this
important process. A bright future is on the horizon for the City of Elkhart. Now let’s get
started!
Sincerely,
The River District Planning Committee

RIVER
DISTRICT

INTRODUCTION

The River District will become a more
attractive place to live, visit and invest.
The Revitalization Plan provides the framework for creating a unique and cohesive
place in the eastern part of downtown. Significant public and private investment is
anticipated in this area and this plan seeks to leverage it to the greatest extent possible.
Next phase of a larger process.
The River District Revitalization
Plan process comes from three
years of fundamental public
engagement, takes comments from
the SoMa plan and builds on the
momentum created by the Elkhart
Health, Fitness and Aquatic Center.
Leveraging this major investment
and additional funding from the
Regional Cities Initiative is critical
for the City and District. City
leaders and community members
understand they must provide
careful stewardship and adapt
to changing circumstances. The
planning process sought to uncover
and accentuate the strengths of
the area and, at the same time,
understand weaknesses in order to
address them.

RIVER DISTRICT REVITALIZATION PLAN

Collaborative effort.
A nine-member planning
committee was created to guide
the process. The committee
represented a wide range of
interests including business
leadership, developers,
philanthropic leadership, and
government officials. These
members provided invaluable
insight into the community. Area
stakeholders and the general
public were also engaged to gain
additional insight from a broader
spectrum of the District.

Planning process.
The eight-month planning process
included rigorous technical
analysis of the challenges and
opportunities. The planning team
gathered data for the planning
area to determine assets and
opportunities within the River
District. A market analysis was
performed with a focus of retail
and housing potential. These
findings were used by the planning
team to inform the process and
help develop recommendations.

Plan organization.
The Revitalization Plan has seven
District-wide principles, nine
recommendations, and 20 specific
capital improvement projects.
Principles are statements of
intent for the preferred physical
character for the River District.
Recommendations are ideas that
aim to physically transform the
area. Several recommendations
are short-term and can be
implemented immediately. Longterm recommendations may take
up to 20 years, but will help realize
a vision for the River District.

In the future, the River District will have:

Walkable, urban and
connected developments.
An integrated mix of uses
both horizontally and vertically.
Abundant access to
attractive waterways.
High quality design of both
public and private spaces.

Diversity of users
and residents.
Safe and attractive connections
to adjacent neighborhoods.
A signature street that is ideal for walking,
biking and attracting investment.

AREA HISTORY
Once a marshy confluence of two rivers the area was transformed into an
industrial area (at the start of the 20th century). The area included many
mills and factories on the land form we now refer to as the River District.
Industrial background.
The very earliest days of
Elkhart’s development,
the area had been
an industrial focus.
Steamboats plied the
St. Joseph River as early
as 1835, tying up to
wharves at the end of
Sycamore Street just
opposite the end of
Island Park.

Mills directed land transformations.
Raceways/canals were constructed on both sides of the rivers, which powered
mills and factories in the 1800s. The main race was a large basin in the shape of
an “L” at the north end of the River District, adjacent to Elkhart Avenue. From this
head race, flumes carried water to the mills and factories and then down the tail
races to both the St. Joseph and Elkhart rivers. Six paper mills, planing and board
mills, flour mills, distilleries, foundries, and Conn’s Horn Factory all took advantage
of the water power made available by the head races. In 1955, the last water rights
within the River District were sold and the last raceway what filled, which was
located behind the Elkhart Foundry property.
Drawing displays area’s industrial background

River realignment.
The hydraulic system was initiated in 1870 shortly after the first
dams were built across the St. Joseph and Elkhart rivers. Where
the present dams and hydroelectric plant are located. Before
1889, the Elkhart River flowed within southern half of the River
District area. Sometime between 1885 and 1889 the Elkhart River
was realigned to its current configuration and a north-south
race was extended from the Elkhart River to the St. Joseph River
through the middle of the development area. The existing lowflow dam located southeast of the Elkhart Avenue bridge was
constructed between 1901 and 1910 to provide additional water
to the factories located along what is now called Nibco Parkway.

Change throughout the years.
In addition to changing shape physically, the area has seen regeneration and
change throughout the years, fluctuating land uses and residential populations.
This planning process ushers in the next phase of revitalization to the River District.

RIVER DISTRICT REVITALIZATION PLAN

PAST PLANNING
The importance for an area plan was outlined in recent
planning efforts. Several regional initiatives laid the groundwork
to potential funding sources and development interests.
Downtown comprehensive plan.
The Supporting our Main assets
(SoMa) plan studied three downtown
districts; Garden, RiverWalk and Arts
& Entertainment. The year-long study
involved comprehensive research and
analysis of downtown Elkhart. The work
built upon the HyettPalma and 400
Block Studies. SoMa was a citizen led
group that directed recommendations
for energizing downtown to encourage
investment, community pride, and
continued development of a unique
Elkhart. This new downtown comprehensive plan aims to attract
people downtown to live, work and play.
Regional cooperation.
In 2015 Elkhart and several other area governments submitted
a regional development plan to the Indiana Regional Cities
Initiative. The members of the Regional Development Association
(RDA) includes: South Bend; Mishawaka; Elkhart; Goshen; and
Elkhart City. The RDA was awarded $42 million towards creating
a strong economic foundation. These funds provide initial
support to large projects in the River District such as the Elkhart
Health, Fitness and Aquatic Center and Martin’s Super Market
redevelopment sites.

PAST PLANNING
A county-wide plan was recently completed that included specific actions to improve the
quality of life for the communities of Elkhart County. The River District Revitalization Plan takes
on several actions and builds on the momentum created through thousands of participants’.
Building on the momentum.
The Vibrant Communities plan
was created in 2015. The work
brought together communities
within Elkhart County to create
an action agenda. These actions
were organized by community,
the City of Elkhart being one. The
River District Revitalization Plan
targets several of these actions
and looks to build on the planning
momentum that was created
through Vibrant Communities.
Public interaction.
SoMa gathered over 300
participants to provide input
and prioritize recommendations.
Vibrant Communities garnered
insight from 2,000 individuals
across the county. This public
interest shows important these
communities are to its residents
and ensures the plan is created for
the people and by the people.

Downtown connections.
This area is a continuation of
downtown. The walkable connections
offer the ability to quickly reach many
of Downtown Elkhart’s facilities; such
as parking, restaurants, hotels, etc.
Jackson Boulevard.
The four lane roadway is the main
corridor through the planning area,
but with a traffic volume of 11,000
average annual daily vehicles, the
road width’s design is excessive.
Features along Jackson include two
shopping centers and widely varying
commercial uses.

N

JOH

Focus area.
The overall planning area is bounded
by the St. Joseph River, Elkhart River
and Glendale Avenue to the east;
forming a peninsula totaling 155 acres.
The Revitalization Plan will focus on
the 105 acres west of the railroad
tracks, preserving the residential
community to the east.

AREA CHARACTER
The natural setting enriches the area offering both passive and active
recreation opportunities, but only at the perimeter of the District. The interior
built environment features wide streets and many gaps in development.
Car oriented development.
Many properties along Jackson
Boulevard feature parking lots as
frontage with little soft-scaping
or screening requirements. Few
buildings are oriented toward
the front lot line, with typical
setbacks at 50 feet or higher. This
appearance and design encourages
users to pass through the space
with less opportunity to spend
their time and money.

Neighborhood stakeholders.
A number of businesses have served
as important stabilizing influences
in the neighborhood even during its
transition period. These businesses
have helped to create a sense
of activity while demonstrating
the potential for future business
investment. The successful business
operations stand in contrast to the
disinvestment that was inevitable
as more industrial properties were
shuttered.

Natural amenities.
With two rivers bounding
the District, there are plenty
of opportunities at a natural
connection. Boat launches, a
plethora of pedestrian bridges
and fishing spots are well
maintained and a point of
pride in the community. The
RiverWalk provides much of the
vegetation as the interior street’s
lack consistent streetscaping.
Few pedestrian amenities.
The interior of the District
does include sidewalks,
but crosswalks at major
intersections are less prominent.
The street lighting that does
exist in the area is scaled to
the vehicular street and strictly
serves a utilitarian use, not
promoting pedestrian activity or
aesthetics. The RiverWalk has
been successful with amenities
such as benches and public art.

Assembled land.
An opportunity for the River
District is that several large parcels
have been assembled, streamlining
the redevelopment process. The
Martin’s Super Market site at the
eastern edge of the Focus Area
is an example of how the area
is primed for redevelopment,
reducing the need for land
acquisition and assemblage.

Parking drives suburban pattern.
A suburban development
pattern has proliferated by giving
prominence to surface parking lots.
Parking lots front the street and
are site specific with no shared
parking opportunities and little
street parking. Buildings sit up to a
couple hundred feet back from the
street. These site designs prioritize
automobile use and increase the
number of trips required for area
residents.

The District’s land use patterns, street alignments and building placements present numerous
challenges for future investment and development. Industrial land configurations should be
re-designed to support a more urban program that complements the central business district.

Many recreation amenities.
Perhaps the most recognizable
amenity in the River District is
the Nibco Water and Ice Park.
Along both the St. Joseph and
Elkhart rivers are several kayak/
canoe access points and fishing
opportunities. Several pedestrian
bridges provide opportunities to
connect with other parks.

Perimeter parks.
Four parks are located within the
District, each offering different
opportunities at both passive and
active recreation. There are no
centrally located open spaces, as
all are along the circumference
of the District. Expansion of the
perimeter trail continues but does
not allow for a complete loop. The
RiverWalk follows the Elkhart River
and provides an opportunity to
interact with and learn about the
river.

MARKET ANALYSIS
Elkhart’s existing market conditions provide the framework for Downtown and the
River District’s improvements. It is important to plan to what the market can currently
sustain while redefining the market to provide the housing the community desires.
Growing and aging population.
The City of Elkhart saw a decline
in population between 2000 and
2010 but this trend is expected to
recover after 2020. The 55 and older
population is expected to increase at
a higher rate than in Elkhart-Goshen
and South Bend-Mishawaka, although
a prime workforce age cohort (25-34)
is projected to decline.
Healthy economic recovery.
With increased visitor spending
and manufacturing jobs peaking,
the area has recovered since the
last recession. Wholesale and retail
jobs are also on the rise and ElkhartGoshen’s unemployment rate is much
lower than both state and national
averages. Elkhart’s economy averaged
a 7.7% growth from 2010-2015.
This growth rate out-performs both
Indiana and the country within the
same time frame. The current threat
to this recovery is a lack of qualified
workforce to fill available jobs.

Household market growth.
Elkhart County is seeing modest
household growth rates.
Though the City of Elkhart’s
growth is virtually non-existent,
it could compete for portions
of this growth by offering
housing types not available in
much of the county. This would
specifically target the less than
25 and over 65 who are a more
transient population.
Aging housing inventory.
With a much older housing
stock within the City, compared
to the county at large, housing
values are lower than the
area’s average. This provides
opportunities for reinvestment
and a strengthening of
neighborhoods. A more
contemporary and diversified
housing stock could serve to
attract both younger working
households as well as a growing
empty nester age group.

can be found in the appendix.
Commuter market.
Due to the lack of quality housing
options, there is a large population
commuting daily into Elkhart
County. This is a large potential
market for the City of Elkhart and
River District housing.

Retail market potential.
Two markets will serve to support the District’s retailers, residents and
employees within a 10 minute walk and households and businesses within
a 10 minute drive. Historically the area has not been organized to support
a burgeoning retail hub. Issues related to traffic patterns, site visibility,
land use and development patterns combined with incompatible uses
have created psychological barriers to attracting retailers to this location.
The opportunity exists to create retail nodes with a reconfigured district.

Residents spending elsewhere.
A few notable sectors of the retail market are seeing residents spend
their dollars in locations outside of Elkhart. Gaps in retail coverage are
seen the most in; shoes, books and music, office supplies, and appliances.
Conversely, there is a surplus of retail supplied in; motor vehicles,
furniture, full-service restaurants,
and auto parts stores.

COMMUNITY INPUT

PLANNING COMMITTEE & STAKEHOLDERS
The planning team met with over a dozen community stakeholders to gain insight
about the area. The stakeholders included business owners, school and government
officials, and residents. Through these conversations several themes emerged.
Redevelopment of Jackson, Elkhart and Prairie streets is essential.
The revitalization of these corridors are critical to the growth of the area
and upscale improvements are needed. Improvement of the supporting
street network is desired by community members. With enhancements
to the streetscapes, traffic should slow down. Several owners would like
to personally take these agendas on but do not own frontage. They hope
for a potential partnership with the city to enact these initiatives.
Community health and quality of place.
The core of the downtown is critical to Elkhart’s overall health. The
regional asset of the health and wellness facility will be positive for the
River District and seems logical. Developing a healthy lifestyle in this
area will have a positive impact of the rest of downtown. Stakeholders
see the River District as key to downtown’s sustained success and a
high quality of place is paramount. There is currently concern over the
lack of care shown to the City’s public spaces.
Land use needs to diversify.
Additional residential and office uses are seen as positive additions to
the District. This area should be seen as a destination similar to Main
Street and providing residential options is important to maintaining
activity at all hours of the day. An office market is non-existent at this
point and without walkable amenities, offices likely will not want to
locate here. Drawing businesses and residents to the area will leverage
Elkhart’s success.

RIVER DISTRICT REVITALIZATION PLAN

“The revitalization of Jackson Boulevard is
critical, upscale improvements within the
street corridor are essential as support
elements to the private investments that
are planned within the River District.”
Dallas Bergl, President, INOVA Credit Union

“The core of the City is critical to the
health of the community. We need to be
aggressive with this plan and demand
more than we have in the past from the
City and the private partners.”
Tom Borger, The Borger Group

“Be creative with planning! If wholesale
change is not a part of the scheme,
success is doubtful!”

Carl Tiedeman, CEO, F.M. Stone/Lexington Business Incubator

Recommendations

River District Revitalization Plan
Open House

Vision: The River District will be a more
attractive place to live, visit and invest.
Principles
In the future, the River District will have:

Recommendations

An integrated mix of uses both horizontally and vertically. Mixing
of uses will occur within city blocks and even buildings with
complimentary uses such as; office, retail, residential and/or civic
uses. For example, vertical inclusion may include residential on upper
floors above retail storefronts.

River District Revitalization Plan

Open House

Building on the River District’s Principles, nine major recommendations

Abundant access to attractive waterways. The Elkhart and St. Joseph
rivers encapsulate the District and provide a unique amenity to
the area. Multiple access points and canoe / kayak put-in’s should
be created to increase interaction. A fully connected trail network
adjacent to the rivers would link these amenities and provide a
recreational loop for cyclists and other trail users.

Diversity of users and residents. To accommodate the growing
number and diversity of demographics and user groups, the
District will provide multiple forms of housing, retail and office
land uses. Adding accessible and attractive housing

will provide a demographic range to City of Elkhart residents as
well as a draw for Elkhart County.

A signature street — Jackson Boulevard — that is ideal for
walking, biking and attracting investment. An attractive
and fully functional street accommodating both pedestrian,
cycling and vehicular traffic sets the tone of the District.
This driving force places an emphasis on the streetscape
and guides development and private investment in the area.
Properly scaled lanes and sidewalks alongside an abundance
of supportive amenities such as lighting, trees, and street
furniture provide pedestrian amenities which slow vehicular
traffic and drive economic development.

Walkable, urban, and connected developments. These will come
in the form of sidewalks and trails. Street character should include
building oriented toward and closely lining the street. Development
should occur in a grid or rectangular block structure to efficiently
maximize space and allow for pedestrian access. Paths, sidewalks and
trails will connect multiple nodes.

The two dozen comments indicated general support for the plan and its
recommendations. Participants were interested in seeing an integrated

On January 10th, 2016, members of the community gathered in the
lobby of the Lerner Theatre in Downtown Elkhart to provide their
feedback on the draft plan. Close to 60 people attended the meeting
and shared their input. The open house began with a presentation from
the planning team outlining the key highlights from the research and
recommendations. This was followed by an interactive period where
participants were asked to share their comments and priorities directly
on large presentation boards.

RIVER
DISTRICT

REVITALIZATION
PLAN

The River District will become a more
attractive place to live, visit and invest.
The River District Revitalization Plan represents a deliberate and well thought-out intervention by
the Elkhart community to invigorate the district and through a concerted effort, create a geography
capable of jump starting the City’s business and residential growth for future decades to come.

22

RIVER DISTRICT REVITALIZATION PLAN

DEVELOPMENT CHARACTER
Building form and character are depicted in the rendering
below. This provides a framework of development following
the River District’s principles and recommendations.
Long term vision.
It is important to keep in mind
that this plan is a 20 year vision
for the River District. Existing
tenants are not being forced to
vacate. As development occurs or
when redevelopment takes place,
it is critical that the principles set
forth in this plan are held in place.
These changes will not take place
over night, but as the River District
transforms, this Revitalization
Plan gives property owners,
developers and city officials a set
of guidelines to ensure the District
becomes what stakeholders and
community leaders envisioned.
These guidelines will include
buildings fronting on major streets
with parking as a secondary use
giving prominence to pedestrians.
Vertically mixing uses to
accommodate different uses on
the ground floor adds functionality
to the District.

Buildings engage the street and river.
Buildings and streets should be designed towards
pedestrians as opposed to vehicular thru-traffic.
An engaged streetscape slows traffic and creates
a more walkable environment. Buildings framing
the street enclose the space and inherently create
a more walkable neighborhood. When applicable
buildings should engage the river, providing access.
Signature street.
Jackson Boulevard will be transformed to be the
primary location for initial development. This
redesigned street features medians and reduced
traffic lanes with on-street parking.
Masked parking.
Surface parking lots are placed behind buildings
to reduce the amount seen from the major road
network. This combined with fewer curb cuts in
each city block helps to reduce congestion and
wayfinding.

ELKHART, INDIANA

23

PRINCIPLES
The principles for the revitalization plan were established by
the planning committee. These have directed and informed the
process throughout the plan’s creation and project identification.
IN THE FUTURE, THE RIVER DISTRICT WILL HAVE:

1

2

24

3

Walkable, urban, and connected
developments. These will come in
the form of sidewalks and trails.
Street character should include
buildings oriented toward and closely
lining the street. Development should
occur in a grid or rectangular block
structure to efficiently maximize
space and allow for pedestrian
access. Paths, sidewalks and trails
will connect multiple nodes.
An integrated mix of uses both
horizontally and vertically. Mixing of
uses will occur within city blocks and
even buildings with complimentary
uses such as; office, retail, residential
and/or civic uses. Providing a
combination of different uses within
the same building. Lower floors being
directed towards public use while
private uses exist on the upper floors.

RIVER DISTRICT REVITALIZATION PLAN

OFFICE
RETAIL

Abundant access to attractive waterways.
The Elkhart and St. Joseph rivers surround
the District and provide a unique amenity to
the area. Multiple access points and canoe /
kayak put-in’s should be created to increase
interaction. A fully connected trail network
adjacent to the rivers would link these
amenities and provide a recreational loop for
cyclists and other trail users.
High quality design of both public and
private spaces. An emphasis on wellconsidered and appropriate architecture
in new development and redevelopment
is imperative. Installing and maintaining
abundant and attractive landscaping in
public and private spaces will create a
sense of place. In developing a consistent
brand and identity for the district, physical
improvements must be applied to the
District’s gateways, signage, street furniture,
advertising and beyond.

PRINCIPLES CONTINUED

IN THE FUTURE, THE RIVER DISTRICT WILL HAVE:

5

6

Diversity of users and residents.
To accommodate the growing
number and diversity of
demographics and user groups,
the District will provide multiple
forms of housing, retail and office
land uses. Adding accessible and
attractive housing options will
provide a demographic range to
City of Elkhart residents as well
as a draw for Elkhart County.
Safe and attractive connections
to adjacent neighborhoods.
Acknowledge multiple
gateways and access points
into and out of the District.
Scaled improvements along
connecting streets similar to
Jackson Boulevard. Increasing
connectivity will increase
opportunities for residents of
the District as well as providing
another set of amenities to the
Downtown Elkhart experience.

7

A signature street — Jackson
Boulevard ­— that is ideal
for walking, biking and
attracting investment. An
attractive and fully functional
street accommodating both
pedestrian, cycling and
vehicular traffic sets the tone
of the District. This driving
force places an emphasis on
the streetscape and guides
development and private
investment in the area. Narrower
travel lanes will slow vehicular
traffic. This in combination
with wide sidewalks and an
abundance of pedestrian
amenities such as lighting, trees
and street furniture will help
drive economic development.
These attributes together create
a place that people want to not
only pass through, but spend
considerable time in.

Leverage major investments.
Building upon the success of proximate prolific projects, the
area should leverage the development focus. The Elkhart
Health, Fitness and Aquatic Center (A) and potential ice
sports facility (B) will provide event based surges of spending
and area visitors. While a redeveloped Martin’s Super Market
(C) and Foundry (D) residential development will bring
sustained populations and investment. Maximizing this
potential through public and private partnerships, such as a
parking garage (E) will be important in the development of
this unique and exciting neighborhood. As the District grows
there will be other large scale investments, this document
provides the framework to capitalize on those opportunities
when they surface while maintaining the desired intregrity of
the area.

Strengthen the supportive street network.
Jackson Boulevard will have physical changes with significant
impacts to the existing traffic pattern. To alleviate an increase
in pressure on Jackson, a supportive street network is critical.
Streets other than Jackson Boulevard should help circulate
traffic and alleviate pressure from the District’s east-west
signature street. These side streets will accommodate street
parking adding to the area’s capacity and maintain the design
standards of Jackson Boulevard. The supporting roads will be
appropriately scaled to deter through traffic. Development
will focus first on Jackson Boulevard and Elkhart Avenue,
the signature streets, before moving to the supportive street
network. Traffic studies are currently underway throughout
downtown on the impacts of the changing traffic patterns. The
figures at the right visualize how a secondary street network
would support the signature streets. The section diagram is an
example of how a signature street will function.

with unique and abundant access points. With the removal
of a lowhead dam along the Elkhart River, space for water
amenities will be created. Recreational examples would
include; a white water park, kayak obstacle courses, additional

variety of choices in both products and price points should be
provided. All housing options will follow the design guidelines
and development regulations to ensure neighborhood
cohesion and efficiency. Proposed housing will front streets
and give privilege to pedestrians with vehicles the secondary
mode. Residential units may also be located above other
commercial establishments with a vertical mix of uses.

Create a branding initiative.
Establishing physical evidence of the area’s unique persona
will be obvious and of a high quality. This brand will follow
through in many facets of the District including; signage,
wayfinding, street furniture, advertisements, website,
letterheads, clothing, and more. Prominent entrances into the
District offer the chance to create neighborhood thresholds
through roadway arches or standing signs.

Prepare appropriate development regulations.
A key implementation tool will be development regulations
that clearly articulate expectations for private development.
Regulation standards will be created as an initial step for the
District as these will guide development. These will outline
design standards for the following; land use configurations,
building setbacks, street dimensions, District materiality,
stormwater management strategies, parking requirements,
and more. A distinct strategy in the River District’s design
will visually hold the neighborhood together and provide a
pleasant and functional place for visitors and residents to live
and work.

Provide internal greenspaces.
Currently all of the District’s recreation areas are on the
perimeter. An internal greenspace would serve as a central
gathering area and provide a destination along Jackson
Boulevard from the proposed development pattern. There
will be pedestrian and multi-use path connections from this
central greenspace to the exterior ribbon of amenities. By
connecting the perimeter pathways across the peninsula, a full
recreation multi-use loop will be created. Additionally, interior
greenspace offers an opportunity to increase the number
of street trees which aid in stormwater management and

RIVER
DISTRICT

IMPLEMENTATION

OVERVIEW
The following chapter provides a framework for the full realization of the River District Revitalization Plan
including responsibilities for the various public and private sector actors. It is important to understand
phasing, funding opportunities and community capacity to assure overall success.
The City of Elkhart is a community that has been
in transition for over 30 years. It like many midwestern cities has experienced the contraction
and exodus of many of its larger industrial
employers. What is unique about Elkhart is
there has been a steady persistent response by
local entrepreneurs and investors to re-establish
the community as a dynamic business center.
The economic dislocation has taken its toll
but the on-going response has created many
successes and a sense of optimism regarding
the future. The River District Revitalization
Plan is designed to take advantage of both the
Partners in revitalization.
The River District Revitalization
Plan is first and foremost designed
to demonstrate the potential to
attract significant new investment
by both the private and public
sector. Investment designed to
strengthen the heart of the Elkhart
community ultimately expanding
into near-by neighborhoods and
business clusters.
34

RIVER DISTRICT REVITALIZATION PLAN

recent and future economic opportunities and to
encourage re-investment in one of Elkhart’s first
industrial districts yet to find its new purpose in
the community – the River District.
This plan recognizes that Elkhart must continue
its transition from a mid-twentieth century
industrial hub to a 21st Century business center
capable of competing nationally for finite
opportunities. A revitalized River District will
play a significant role in assuring a successful
competition. Elkhart’s history has been to
respond to its challenges.

The River District Plan is ambitious and will
require the coordination of a network of public
and private partners. Large investments
like the Elkhart Health, Fitness and Aquatic
Center demonstrate a commitment by
committed public and private leadership to
the revitalization program. Their projects can
be leveraged for even greater impact if future
investments focus on improving the vitality of
the district as a whole.

Public sector investments.
The public investments focus primarily on three general categories of investment.
>> Upgrading and/or replacing infrastructure;
>> Creating River District Area amenities designed to encourage resident, visitor and
business growth; and
>> Improving the River District transportation logistics and connectivity to downtowns
existing neighborhoods and area business clusters.
These activities are almost exclusively the purview of the public sector. For purposes of this
discussion, public sector investment assumes a local (City of Elkhart) financing commitment
but also other governmental involvement including at the State and Federal levels.

Private sector investments.
The private sector investment
focuses on replacing
underperforming real estate with
new, market driven developments
which will serve existing residents,
grow the number of households
and population and serve to
retain, expand and attract new
businesses. Both the proposed
public and private investments
have been viewed through the
scope of what will support the
local and regional market. More
importantly, a deliberate effort
has been made to position these
markets to help revitalize a City
that wishes to control its destiny
and offer new opportunities for
its citizens. The investments
represent a combination of quality
of life amenities, new housing to
address a changing population
and household formation, and the
inclusion of new businesses that
provide services and employment
diversity.

Projects and timing.
It is important to be clear on
project phasing, private and
public resources needed to
implement each of the initiatives,
and then steps that should be
considered to assure that the
community and its leadership has
organized to successfully carryout this exciting, and at the same
time, demanding mission.
Prioritized investments.
Table 1 lists the major projects
for the River District in order of
priority. They are separated into
public and private investments
and outline the timing in years
when planning and development
for each project would happen.

PHASE 1 - SETTING THE TABLE
A clear program for realizing the investments identified
as part of the Plan is critical if the City of Elkhart and its
residents both prosperity and growth moving forward.
Early and achievable outcomes.
Table 1 identifies key investments or initiatives to be made by the public and private sectors (10 each) considered essential in charting a new and
resurgent course for Elkhart. Each investment type involves some combination of planning and development which is slated to occur over the next 20
years. Certain investments are good short term opportunities while others require more planning and will take time to implement (see later tables). It
is possible that the timetable for some of the initiatives may be changed according to economic conditions and/or local needs. It is believed that the
short term initiatives identified in Table 2 represent early and achievable outcomes that set the table for more significant investment opportunities
going forward. Funding responsibility is identified for each project with primary and supporting funds through local government, non-local government
(ie federal, state governments), non-government organizations (NGO) or private entities.

PHASE 2 - RIVER DISTRICT DEFINED
The second round of projects will provide the development fabric and scale
needed to define a dynamic mixed-use district capable of attracting new
business investment and residents that are looking for an active lifestyle.
Building momentum.
Mid-term initiatives will take advantage of a renewed interest and
the momentum that will be generated by those projects that were
implemented in the “Table Setting Phase”. This phase will involve
over $150,000,000 in new investment which includes approximately
$31,000,000 of public investment over a seven year period. Up to
$9,000,000 of the public investment could be raised from non-local
sources.

Array of investment. Securing a broader array of non-local public
investment will be easier during this phase given the extended time
period to do so and the progress that will have already been made in
realizing elements of the River District Revitalization Plan. Just over 12%
of the budget for the River District Defined Phase will be comprised of
local funds. Each $1 dollar of local funds is projected to generate $7.26
dollars in additional investment along with significant growth in the
property tax base, jobs and new residents.

A Catalyst for Private Investment.
Over a 10-20 year period it is believed that on average, for every
$1 dollar of public investment made another $6 to $10 dollars of
private investment will occur – resulting in additional tax base,
job growth and modernized public and private facilities. By way
of example only, if the public sector averages $5,000,000 a year
in investment over the next 20 years, the City would experience
approximately $1 billion dollars in additional private investment.

PHASE 3 - REVITALIZED RIVER DISTRICT
These are initiatives that will improve the manner in which the
River District works for its visitors, businesses and residents but are
not seen as essential components of the early revitalization efforts.
Leveraging private investment.
There are a series of projects that may take some time to realize or
could be implemented earlier subject to economic conditions and the
involvement and wishes of community leadership. As can be seen in
Table 4, the “Revitalized River District Phase”, these projects are slated
to occur anytime from years 4 through 20. These initiatives represent
approximately $35,000,000-$40,000,000 in additional investment. The

total public investment anticipated for these activities is approximately
$4,400,000 of which $3,400,000 is expected to be generated from
local public sources or not quite 10% of the total investment assuming
a $35,000,000 budget. In this instance the leveraging ratio on these
projects now benefitting from a revitalized District is approximately
$9.29 dollars of private investment for every $1.00 dollar of City or local
investment.

Mixing of uses.
As demonstrated in the principles
and recommendations, mixing
of land uses both vertically and
horizontally is paramount to the
area’s success. This land use map
shows several different types of
mixed-use land types and each
will vary in their density and
proposed structures. The character
of development will be guided
by the this land use map but
not restricted to its boundaries.
As developers approach the
District with proposals, this map
will likely change over time. A
planning overlay area is currently
in development to suport the
proposed redevelopment efforts.

FUNDING STRATEGIES
The full realization of the vision for the River District will take place over a
series of development phases. The scale of the District and the realities of
the short-term market demands insist on a phased approach to development.
Innovative financing.
It is important to stress that most
communities involved in the
business of revitalization have
been both astute and innovative
in identifying local and nonlocal sources of financing to
accomplish their objectives. The
Elkhart community has proactively
established a number of funding
tools that can be utilized to
assist in accomplishing the River
District agenda. In addition there
are external funding sources
that should be considered to
assist the community with its
financing needs. Table 5 offers
a potential funding plan for over
$110,000,000 in River District
Initiatives to be implemented
between 2017-2021.

Spectrum of funders.
These projects will both change the perception,
reality and long term role of the River District once
they are put in place. While expensive it is clear that
the broad project scope for this 3-5 Year Program will
create funding eligibility across a broad spectrum of
private and public funders. The City’s percentage of
investment for this major revitalization program is
estimated to be just over 22%. Other non-local public
revenues will make up almost 11% with the private
financing covering 67% of the cost. An ambitious
redevelopment program with a daunting price tag
attached to it becomes manageable due to the
partners the City will be able to attract to participate.
In fact, for every $1 dollar that the City invests in
upgrading its infrastructure, reclaiming industrial
brownfields and investing in new long term land uses
will generate at a minimum another $4.50 dollars in
new investment during this Table Setting Phase – all
in an area that has seen little new investment for over
30 years.

Business plan development.
The goal of a public-private investment
program will be to attain the optimal
leveraging ratio for the local public
dollars invested. Having said this the
ultimate goal is to create a dynamic
geography that is capable of attracting
significant new mixed-use investment
and by doing so impacting adjacent
neighborhoods and business clusters.
By achieving this outcome, the City
will transform from a no-growth
economically vulnerable community
to one with an expanding tax base, a
diversified business sector with new
population growth. These outcomes
will be accomplished as a result of a
well thought-out business plan that
had input and more importantly buy-in
from Elkhart’s public and private sector
leadership.

River District emerging
business revolving loan program
(Proposed).
Existing businesses with 50
fewer employees and/or less
than $1,000,000 in annual gross
revenue could qualify for a loan of
up to $15,000 which will serve as a
subordinate loan to a conventional
loan from a local participating
bank. The small business would
have to document that it is unable
to get a conventional loan for
required capital and/or operational
investment. The emerging business
revolving loan fund would be used
to facilitate a smaller conventional
loan with the revolving loan fund
serving to close the gap required
to satisfy the documented need for
funds.

River District facade improvement
loan program (Proposed).
The Façade Improvement Loan
provides up to $10,000 to the
owner(s) of a building for the
purpose of enhancing its building
façade or corridor adjacent site
aesthetic features, compatible
with the Plan. Repayment is
required only if the owner(s) sells
the building within ten years after
disbursement of funds.
Program dollars must be matched
by private funds at 1:1 ratio. Up to
one-half of the private match may
be in the form of in-kind donations.
Funds will be distributed on a
reimbursement basis, following
submission of a proof of payment
for completed work.

River District green fit loan
program (Proposed).
The Green Fit Loan provides up to
$10,000 to businesses to install
storm water treatment ‘best
practice’ features, green energy
and energy efficiency projects.
Public dollars must be matched
by private investment at a 1:2
ratio. Funds will be distributed on
a reimbursement basis, following
submission of a receipt or invoice.
Repayment is required only if
the company relocates out of
the development area, or ceases
existence, within ten years after
disbursement of funds.
Gateway mile loan fund
(Existing).
Downtown Elkhart Inc. works in
partnership with local financial
institutions and the Aurora Capital
Development Corporation to offer
this resource. The fund provides
capital to creditworthy businesses,
in a designated area of Downtown
Elkhart’s Main Street corridor

and the immediately adjacent
neighborhoods. Eligible loans may
be made for commercial real estate
and general business purposes.
Loans may be made to either the
real estate owners or the lessees,
and can assist with collateralized
mortgages up to $200,000
and small business loans up to
$50,000. It is recommended
that this program be expanded to
include the River District area.
River District innovation grant
program (Proposed).
The Innovation Grant Program
provides up to $5,000 to
businesses developing new
services or introducing a new
business use to the corridor.
Public dollars must be matched by
private investment at a 1:1 ratio. Up
to one-half of the private match
may be in the form of in-kind
activities. Funds will be distributed
on a reimbursement basis,
following submission of receipt or
invoice.

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
The economic development objectives suggested below are
recommended as potential responses to these questions while also
helping to structure a part of the River District Revitalization Plan.
Expand business base and tax
generating capacity.
Historically both the City and County
have enjoyed an organically grown
industrial base. Starting in the 1960’s
moving into the first years of the
21st Century entrepreneurs and new
businesses have found opportunity in
Elkhart and the surrounding Region. It is
clear that the market place for industry is
becoming more competitive and sensitive
to “business logistics” with factors such
as transportation variables, workforce,
and access to materials and inventory
impacting short and long term business
strategies. Even during the pre-recession
years there was some decline in
industrial employment due to a dynamic
and competitive business climate. Elkhart
with its strong industrial base and RV
and automotive clusters has numerous
advantages but also must be sensitive to
other factors if it is to remain competitive

44

RIVER DISTRICT REVITALIZATION PLAN

with other locations regionally and
nationally. While both the community
and the State of Indiana have been
attentive to the existing business base, a
re-assessment of current impediments
and opportunities for the retention,
expansion and continued creation of
new businesses should be performed.
On a national level there is an emerging
attention being given to re-investing in
the nation’s industrial capacity. How does
the national discussion benefit the NorthCentral Region and more specifically an
already well-established manufacturing
center like Elkhart?
Recommendation. Update current
impediments and opportunities which
impact the community’s ability to
encourage the retention, expansion and
continued creation of new businesses.

Expand local workforce and enhance skills
and training.
There is substantial evidence that finding
qualified and available workers to fill industrial
positions, both entry level and skilled, is an
increasing problem for local employers. This fact
is reinforced by the 28,000 + working commuters
that travel into the County each work day. Access
to an able and ready workforce is as important
a resource in the production process as there is.
The inability to effectively recruit and retain a
workforce is a very real issue impacting the cost
of doing business for Elkhart’s businesses. Couple
this with the likely importing of employees from
outside Elkhart County and the industrial leakage
referred to previously is clearly exacerbated.
Recommendation. That this issue be revisited by
community leaders and a discussion focused on
identifying innovative approaches for remediating
this issue be undertaken. One possible response
is offered as part of the fourth economic
development objective listed below.

Establish River District and Downtown as business service
center.
The River District and downtown in the future will serve as
an important regional mixed-use center providing essential
services to an expanding customer base. As already stated,
one of the stronger existing market opportunities is the 400+
manufacturing firms with their 22,000+ employees within
10 minutes of Elkhart’s Central Business District. The Central
Business District (CBD) is in the best position geographically
and as an already existing well-organized services hub to
meet the diverse needs of the near-by business clusters. In
business activity areas that are a part of the indirect or nonmanufacturing process such as; business supplies, hospitality,
food and entertainment, meeting, medical and training
services, etc., a centralized well equipped location could serve
as a highly valued business amenity currently not available
in the market place. By organizing and focusing on this nontraditional market, the CBD is expanding its market and also
increasing the ability to diversify its role in the general market
place. For example, the market viability of a hotel, or office and/
or furniture center may be improved if the business community
is an additional driver for such services
Recommendation. A more in-depth analysis of the demand
levels of the businesses within the 5 mile radius should
be undertaken in order to document how to maximize
the untapped market potential represented by Elkhart’s
manufacturing firms and business community.

Revitalize targeted Elkhart neighborhoods utilizing workforce housing
development strategy.
Many of Elkhart’s neighborhoods have experienced economic distress as
the housing stock has become older and the households increasingly are
characterized by lower incomes and increasingly renter versus owner occupied.
While much of Elkhart’s housing stock is well designed and well-built there are
signs of deferred maintenance and neglect. Almost one-half of the City’s housing
stock is now rental with single-family conversions to rental housing being the
largest contributor to the multi-family inventory.
A possible neighborhood revitalization strategy could include targeting specific
neighborhoods for the inclusion of quality “workforce housing” opportunities
– potentially accomplishing two objectives with one program. The demand for
an increased workforce to satisfy employer demand has already been identified
as a pressing local economic need. It is also clear that a significant number of
employees are commuting from beyond Elkhart County’s borders to get to work
each day. A program which provides quality, affordable housing to the workforce
could accomplish two important objectives: 1) attract workforce households to
a perceived housing opportunity; and 2) through existing housing re-investment
upgrade and transition vulnerable neighborhoods from distress to revitalization.
Across the country there are similar efforts in communities that are suffering
a workforce shortage, in part due to a scarcity of and/or inadequate housing
options. Quite often the public sector and private sector (employers) partner to
structure housing programs that are designed to attract a workforce to an area
while at the same time satisfying a community’s redevelopment objectives.
Recommendation. To establish a public-private partnership that focuses on
utilizing the provision of workforce housing to incentivize the workforce to live
closer to available jobs and to revitalize neighborhoods in need of revitalization.

ELKHART, INDIANA

45

Partner with State of Indiana using long range economic
development incentives.
It is important not only for the Elkhart community, but
the North-Central Indiana Region and the State of Indiana
to realize the significance of the business clusters that
serve as essential economic engines generating significant
local and state economic impact. Not only should local
leadership explore innovative methods for retaining and
expanding these clusters, the State has just as much
vested in assuring success on this front. It is believed that
Elkhart is in a unique position with the presence of these
strong and mature clusters. The opportunities presented
by the clusters should be fully understood and steps taken
to take full advantage of either business expansion and/
or creation. If there are threats to the clusters these also
should be researched and fully understood. Creating a
business climate that supports the continued investment
by these and new firms should be a defined priority
including looking at issues like workforce development
and concentrating business services as identified in earlier
objectives. Establishing a resource pool that can be used to
either incentivize businesses and/or support programs and
initiatives which enhance the economic climate should be
considered.
Recommendation. To explore the creation of a State/Local
partnership by using existing TIF Legislation to generate
resources that will support relevant economic development
objectives.
46

RIVER DISTRICT REVITALIZATION PLAN

Next Steps.
The River District Revitalization Study has demonstrated that the surrounding
neighborhoods and the near-by business clusters can play a substantial role in
helping to attract new market opportunity to the River District as well as the
City of Elkhart. There is a synergy that can be leveraged between the CBD (River
District and Downtown), City of Elkhart neighborhoods, and the City’s-County’s
strong manufacturing base. It is believed that taking advantage of this synergy will
serve both the River District program as well as broader Elkhart community in a
manner that will prove difficult to ignore.
Recommendation. To the extent that leadership has the time and capacity
to add to an already full agenda it is recommended that a 30 day analysis be
undertaken to document the opportunities which exist with a business cluster
retention-expansion program. Its early objectives would identify short-term
business investment opportunities, business support programs (i.e. workforce
development, workforce housing, business support services, etc.) and potential
State-Local partnership opportunities. A review of existing TIF Legislation should
occur to determine if minor amendments should be undertaken in order to include
these existing programs as part of a potential partnership element. Following the
30 day analysis an action plan designed to create a State-Local partnership as
well as a work program focused on the broad synergies should be at the very least
outlined.

LETTER TO THE COMMUNITY
The River District Revitalization Plan points the way forward for our community, toward an
even brighter and more prolific future. The characteristics of this future were developed
through deliberate conversations between the residents of Elkhart, area stakeholders,
and the Planning Committee. This work builds upon and will leverage the significant
public-private investments planned within the planning area. These catalyst level projects
will initiate the District’s revitalization, are expected to lead economic and physical
development, and complement Downtown Elkhart without competing against Main Street.
The plan recognizes the complexity of the issues facing the River District. It proposes a
set of principles and recommendations that will build on the cooperation and leadership
developed within the planning process, and should forge new connections necessary for
the realization of the community’s goals. The effectiveness of the Revitalization Plan will be
measured in the success of its implementation. To that end, the implementation process
will identify recommended steps toward development, funding strategies, and phasing.
Developing the Revitalization Plan has demanded a great deal from all of us. The process
has proven that the people who make up our community care deeply about its future.
They want to see a City where they and their children can thrive. They want a District
that is unafraid to address its most pressing issues, and is inspired by strong and effective
leadership.
We extend our appreciation to all the individuals, organizations and businesses that have
supported the plan-making process with their time, energy and facilities. Most of all, we
would like to thank every participant who has invested their time, energy and ideas into
this important process. A bright future is on the horizon for the City of Elkhart. Now let’s
get started!
Sincerely,
The River District Planning Committee

RIVER
DISTRICT

INTRODUCTION

The River District will become a more
attractive place to live, visit and invest.
The Revitalization Plan provides the framework for creating a unique and cohesive
place in the eastern part of downtown. Significant public and private investment is
anticipated in this area and this plan seeks to leverage it to the greatest extent possible.
Motivation for the process.
The River District Revitalization
Plan process comes from the
success of the SoMa plan and
builds on the momentum created
by the Elkhart, Health, Fitness and
Aquatic Center. Leveraging this
major investment and additional
funding from the Regional Cities
Initiative is critical for the City
and District. City leaders and
community members understand
that they must provide careful
stewardship and adapt to changing
circumstances. The planning
process sought to uncover and
accentuate the strengths of
the area and, at the same time,
understand weaknesses in order to
address them.

2

RIVER DISTRICT REVITALIZATION PLAN

Collaborative effort.
A nine-member planning
committee was created to guide
the process. The committee
represented a wide range of
interests including business
leadership, developers,
philanthropic leadership, and
government officials. These
members provided invaluable
insight into the community. Area
stakeholders were also engaged
to gain additional insight from a
broader spectrum of the District.

Planning process.
The planning process lasted
eight months and included
rigorous technical analysis of the
challenges and opportunities. The
planning team gathered data for
the planning area to determine
assets and opportunities existing
within the planning area. A
market analysis was performed
with a focus of retail and housing
market forecasting. These findings
were used by the planning team
to inform the process and help
develop recommendations and
strategies.

Plan organization.
The Revitalization Plan has seven
District-wide principles, nine
recommendations, and 20 specific
capital improvement projects.
Principles are the statements
of intent for the preferred
character for the River District.
Recommendations are ideas
that aim to physically transform
the area. Some are small items
immediately implementable in the
short-term while others are large
long-term objectives or ways to go
about development.

In the future, the River District will have:

RIVER
DISTRICT
EXISTING
CONDITIONS

AREA HISTORY
What started out as a marshy confluence of two rivers, the land was quickly
transformed at the start of the 20th century into an industrial park. The area housed
many mills and factories which formed the shape we now know as the River District.
Industrial background.
From the very earliest
days of Elkhart, the
River District area has
been an industrial park.
Steamboats plied the
St. Joseph River as early
as 1835, tying up to
wharves at the end of
Sycamore Street just
opposite the end of
Island Park.
River realignment.
The hydraulic system was initiated in 1870 shortly after the first
dams were built across the St. Joseph and Elkhart rivers where
the present dams and hydroelectric plant is located. Before 1889,
the Elkhart River flowed within southern half of the River District
area. Sometime between 1885 and 1889 the Elkhart River was
realigned to its current configuration and a north-south race was
extended from the Elkhart River to the St. Joseph River through
the middle of the development area. The existing low-flow dam
located southeast of the Elkhart Avenue Bridge was constructed
between 1901 and 1910 to provide additional water to the
factories located along what is now called Nibco Parkway.
6

RIVER DISTRICT REVITALIZATION PLAN

Mills directed land transformations.
Raceways/canals were constructed on both sides of the rivers, which powered a
series of early mills and factories in the 1800s. The main race was a large basin
in the shape of an “L” at the north end of the River District, adjacent to Elkhart
Avenue. From this head race, flumes carried water to the mills and factories
and then down the tail races to both the St. Joseph and Elkhart rivers. Six paper
mills, planing and board mills, flour mills, distilleries, foundries, and Conn’s Horn
Factory all took advantage of the water power made available by the head races.
In 1955, the last water rights within the River District were sold and the last
raceway what filled, which was located behind the Elkhart Foundry property.
Change throughout the years.
In addition to changing shape physically, the area has seen regeneration and
change throughout the years, fluctuating land uses and residential counts. This
planning process ushers in the next phase of revitalization to the River District.

PAST PLANNING
The importance for an area plan was outlined in recent
planning efforts. Several regional initiatives laid the groundwork
to potential funding sources and development interests.
Downtown comprehensive plan.
The Supporting our Main assets
(SoMa) plan studied three downtown
districts; Garden, RiverWalk and Arts
& Entertainment. The year-long study
involved comprehensive research and
analysis of downtown Elkhart. The work
built upon the HyettPalma and 400
Block Studies. SoMa was a citizen led
group that directed recommendations
for energizing downtown to encourage
investment, community pride, and
continued development of a unique
Elkhart. This new downtown comprehensive plan aims to attract
people downtown to Live, Work and Play.
Regional cooperation.
In 2015 Elkhart and several other area governments submitted
to the Indiana Regional Cities Initiative. The members of the
Regional Development Association were awarded access to $42
million towards creating a strong economic foundation. These
funds provide initial support to large projects such as the Elkhart
Health, Fitness and Aquatic Center and Martin’s Super Market
redevelopment sites.

Downtown districts outlined in the SoMa plan.

PAST PLANNING
County-wide regional planning was recently completed to provide specific actions
for communities. The River District Revitalization Plan takes on several actions and
builds on the momentum created through thousands of participants’ excitement.
Building on the momentum.
The Vibrant Communities plan
was created in 2015. The work
brought together communities
within Elkhart County to create
an action agenda. These actions
were organized by community,
the City of Elkhart being one. The
River District Revitalization Plan
targets several of these actions
and looks to build on the planning
momentum that was created
through Vibrant Communities.
Public interaction.
SoMa gathered over 300
participants to provide input
and prioritize recommendations.
Vibrant Communities garnered
insight from 2,000 individuals
across the county. This public
interest shows important these
communities are to its residents
and ensures the plan is created for
the people and by the people.

PLANNING AREA

CONTEXT MAP

Located adjacent to Elkhart’s Downtown core, the River District is surrounded by two rivers
with Jackson Boulevard serving as the main arterial roadway. A continuation of Downtown,
the area offers direct access to several neighborhoods and many natural amenities.

Jackson Boulevard.
The four lane roadway is the main
corridor through the planning area,
with a traffic volume over 11,000
average annual daily vehicles.
Features along Jackson include
two shopping centers and widely
varying commercial uses.

Downtown connections.
This area is a continuation
of downtown. The walkable
connections offer the ability to
quickly reach many of Downtown
Elkhart’s facilities; such as parking,
restaurants, hotels, etc..

JOH

Focus area.
The overall planning area is
bounded by the St. Joseph River,
Elkhart River and Glendale Avenue
to the east; forming a peninsula.
This area totals 155 acres. This
document will focus on the
105 acres west of the railroad
tracks, preserving the residential
community to the east.

AREA CHARACTER
The natural setting enriches the area offering both passive and active
recreation opportunities, but only at the perimeter of the District. The interior
built environment features wide streets and many gaps in development.
Autocentric development.
Many properties along Jackson
Boulevard feature parking lots as
frontage with little soft-scaping
or screening requirements. There
are only a few instances in which
buildings stand on the street with
typical setbacks more than 50
feet. This appearance and design
encourages users to pass through
the space with less opportunity to
spend their time and money.

Neighborhood stakeholders.
A few local businesses have been
in the neighborhood for several
decades with continued success.
The uses of these business varies
but their commitment to the
area has remained. Other more
transient commercial businesses
have proven successful in providing
services without investment into
their properties.

Natural amenities.
With two rivers bounding
the District, there are plenty
of opportunities at a natural
connection. Boat launches, a
plethora of pedestrian bridges
and fishing spots are well
maintained and a point of pride
in the community. The RiverWalk
area provides much of the
vegetation as the interior street’s
lack consistent streetscaping.
Aging street amenities.
The interior of the District
includes deteriorating sidewalks,
many vacant parcels and aging
structures. Many side streets
have fallen into disrepair with
above grade utilities aging and
disorganized. The lighting that
does exist in the area is scaled to
the vehicular street and strictly
serves a utilitarian use, not
promoting pedestrian activity.

Assembled land.
An opportunity for the River
District is that several large parcels
have been assembled, streamlining
the redevelopment process. The
Martin’s Super Market site at the
eastern edge of the Focus Area
is an example of how the area
is primed for redevelopment,
reducing the need for land
acquisition and assemblage.

Parking drives suburban pattern.
A suburban development
pattern has proliferated by giving
prominence to surface parking lots.
Parking lots front the street and
are site specific with no shared
parking opportunities and little
street parking. Buildings sit up to a
couple hundred feet back from the
street. These site designs prioritize
automobile use and increase the
number of trips required for area
residents.

Av
and
Howl

Grove Street

There is a wide variety of uses, odd lot shapes, inconsistent
building placements and orientations. This area has a distinct
suburban character and pattern, contrary to its downtown setting.

ZONING
The large North-South roadway of Prairie Street serves as a dividing line
between residential and commercial zoning. Current zoning does not match the
proposed mixed-use density which would be an expansion of Downtown Elkhart.
Commercially oriented.
The majority of land within the
focus area is zoned, Commercial
Business District (CBD), with the
two large shopping centers as the
outliers. Several developments
located on smaller parcels
zoned Residential may be noncompliant in their zoning. The
existing residentially zoned parcels
would require rezoning as other
redevelopment opportunities arise.

Residential neighborhood.
East of Prairie Street is almost
solely residential with single family
north of Jackson Boulevard and
several multi-family developments
south of the boulevard. These
areas will be preserved in terms
of zoning and their aesthetics.
As future redevelopment takes
place, it should follow the design
guidelines established by the
Revitalization Plan.

Disorganized network.
The supporting, secondary street

Current sewer and water main utilities meet demands but new development would impact service
coverage. Much of the stormwater is directed towards combined facilities before treatment at the city’s
waste water facility. As is typical, some private development stormwater is routed to the area rivers.

with many private stormwater
systems releasing into the
surrounding rivers. A subsurface

exists on the West side of
the Elkhart River. This facility
temporarily holds water before
releasing into the existing system.
Future developments offer an

The area’s natural features complement several parks lining much of the River
District’s riverfront. Connections between these open spaces and the neighborhoods
are sporadic but several pedestrian bridges offer a multitude of options.

Many recreation amenities.
Perhaps the most recognizable
amenity in the River District is
the Nibco Water and Ice Park.
Along both the St. Joseph and
Elkhart rivers are several kayak/
canoe access points and fishing
opportunities. Several pedestrian
bridges provide opportunities to
connect with other parks.

Perimeter parks.
Four parks are located within the
District, each offering different
opportunities at both passive and
active recreation. There are no
centrally located open spaces as
all are along the circumference
of the District. Expansion of the
perimeter trail continues but does
not allow for a complete loop. The
RiverWalk follows the Elkhart River
and provides an opportunity to
interact with and learn about the
river.

MARKET ANALYSIS
The City’s economic indicators offer an uncertain future. Employment and business
investment has impressive momentum - although not yet at 2006 peak levels.
Housing and incomes are under performing. Workforce development is a critical need.
Growing and aging population.
The City of Elkhart’s saw a decline
in population between 2000 and
2010 but this trend is expected to
recover after 2020. The 55 and older
population is expected to increase at
a higher rate than in Elkhart-Goshen
and South Bend/Mishawaka, although
a prime workforce age cohort (25-34)
is projected to decline.
Healthy economic recovery.
With increased visitor spending
and manufacturing jobs peaking,
the area has recovered since the
last recession. Wholesale and retail
jobs are also on the rise and ElkhartGoshen’s unemployment rate is much
lower than both state and national
averages. Elkhart’s economy averaged
a 7.7% growth from 2010-2015.
This growth rate out-performs both
Indiana and the country within the
same time frame. The current threat
to this recovery is a lack of qualified
workforce to fill available jobs.

Household market growth.
Elkhart County is seeing
modest household growth
rates. Though the City of
Elkhart’s growth is virtually
non-existent, it could compete
for portions of this growth by
offering housing types not
available in much of the county.
This would specifically target
the less than 25 and over
65 who are a more transient
population.
Aging housing inventory.
With a much older housing
stock within the City, compared
to the county at large, housing
values are lower than the area’s
average. A more contemporary
and diversified housing stock
could serve to attract both
younger working households as
well as a growing empty nester
age group.

Downtown Elkhart is a large driver for development, building on the City’s job market growth.
However, a large population commutes into the area from outside the county. Importing
Additional and more detailed

can be found in the appendix.
Commuter market.
Due to the lack of quality housing
options, there is a large population
commuting daily into Elkhart
County. This is a large potential
market for the City of Elkhart and
River District housing.

Retail market potential.
Two primary markets will be served with any proposed retail
development; those within a 10 minute walk, and those within a 10
minute drive. Currently there are several factors limiting retail viability
and perception including; site visibility, land uses poorly organized;
transportation network, no direct access to regional markets;
psychological barriers, land uses not clustered with old out lots and
negative existing perception; and competing alternatives such as the
University Park Mall and Elkhart Market Center among others.

Residents spending elsewhere.
A few notable sectors of the retail market are seeing residents spend
their dollars in locations outside of Elkhart. Gaps in retail coverage
are seen the most in; shoes, books and music, office supplies, and
appliances. Conversely, there is a surplus of retail supplied in; motor
vehicles, furniture, full-service restaurants, and auto parts stores.

Downtown proximity.
Elkhart has several business
clusters within 10 minutes of
its central business district,
4,200 businesses and 73,500
employees. There is an
opportunity to serve both the
businesses and employees with
focused commercial and housing
growth in the greater River
District area.

RIVER
DISTRICT

COMMUNITY INPUT

PLANNING COMMITTEE & STAKEHOLDERS
The planning team met with over a dozen community stakeholders to gain insight
about the area. The stakeholders included business owners, school and government
officials, and residents. Through these conversations several themes emerged.
Redevelopment of Jackson, Elkhart and Prairie streets is essential.
The revitalization of these corridors are critical to the growth of the area
and upscale improvements are needed. Improvement of the supporting
street network is desired by community members. With enhancements
to the streetscapes, traffic should slow down. Several owners would like
to personally take these agendas on but do not own frontage. They hope
for a potential partnership with the city to enact these initiatives.
Community health and quality of place.
The core of the downtown is critical to Elkhart’s overall health. The
regional asset of the health and wellness facility will be positive for the
River District and seems logical. Developing a healthy lifestyle in this
area will have a positive impact of the rest of downtown. Stakeholders
see the River District as key to downtown’s sustained success and a
high quality of place is paramount. There is currently concern over the
lack of care shown to the City’s public spaces.
Land use needs to diversify.
Residential and office uses need to supplant some of the manufacturing
and automotive uses currently in the District. This area should be seen
as a destination similar to Main Street and providing residential options
is important to maintaining activity at all hours of the day. An office
market is non-existent at this point and without walkable amenities,
offices likely will not want to locate here. Drawings businesses and
residents to the area will only leverage Elkhart’s success.

RIVER DISTRICT REVITALIZATION PLAN

“The revitalization of Jackson Boulevard is
critical, upscale improvements within the
street corridor are essential as support
elements to the private investments that
are planned within the River District.”
Dallas Bergl, President, INOVA Credit Union

“The core of the City is critical to the
health of the community. We need to be
aggressive with this plan and demand
more than we have in the past from the
City and the private partners.”
Tom Borger, The Borger Group

“Be creative with planning! If wholesale
change is not a part of the scheme,
success is doubtful!”
Carl Tiedeman, CEO, F.M. Stone/Lexington Business Incubator

RIVER
DISTRICT

REVITALIZATION
PLAN

The River District will become a more
attractive place to live, visit and invest.
The River District Revitalization Plan represents a deliberate and well thought-out intervention by
the Elkhart community to invigorate the district and through a concerted effort, create a geography
capable of jump starting the City’s business and residential growth for future decades to come.

24

RIVER DISTRICT REVITALIZATION PLAN

PRINCIPLES
The principles for the revitalization plan were established with the
help of the planning committee. These have directed and informed
the process throughout the plan’s creation and project identification.
IN THE FUTURE, THE RIVER DISTRICT WILL HAVE:

1
2
3

Walkable, urban, and connected developments. These will
come in the form of sidewalks and trails. Street character
should include buildings oriented toward and closely lining
the street. Development should occur in a grid or rectangular
block structure to efficiently maximize space and allow for
pedestrian access. Paths, sidewalks and trails will connect
multiple nodes.
An integrated mix of uses both horizontally and vertically.
Mixing of uses will occur within city blocks and even buildings
with complimentary uses such as; office, retail, residential
and/or civic uses. Vertical inclusion may for example include
residential on upper floors above retail storefronts.
Abundant access to attractive waterways. The Elkhart and St.
Joseph rivers encapsulate the District and provide a unique
amenity to the area. Multiple access points and canoe / kayak
put-in’s should be created to increase interaction. A fully
connect trail network adjacent to the rivers would link these
amenities and provide a recreational loop for cyclists and
other trail users.

5

High quality design of both public and private spaces. An
emphasis on well-considered and appropriate architecture in
new development and redevelopment should be imperative.
Installing and maintaining abundant and attractive
landscaping in public and private spaces will help create a
sense of place currently lacking. Develop a consistent brand
and identity for the district. This could be applied to the
District’s gateways, signage, street furniture, advertising and
beyond.
A signature street — Jackson Boulevard — that is ideal for
walking, biking and attracting investment. An attractive
and fully functional street accommodating both pedestrian,
cycling and vehicular traffic sets the tone of the District.
This driving force places an emphasis on the streetscape
and guides development and private investment in the area.
Properly scaled lanes and sidewalks alongside an abundance
of supportive amenities such as lighting, trees, and street
furniture should all be included.

ELKHART, INDIANA

PRINCIPLES CONTINUED

IN THE FUTURE,
THE RIVER DISTRICT WILL HAVE:

26

Diversity of users and residents.
Providing multiple forms of
housing, retail and office
uses there will be a variety of
demographics and user groups.
Adding accessible and attractive
housing options will provide a
demographic range to City of
Elkhart residents as well as a
draw for Elkhart County.
Safe and attractive connections
to adjacent neighborhoods.
Acknowledge multiple gateways
and access points into and out of
the District. Scaled improvements
along connecting streets similar
to Jackson Boulevard. Increasing
connectivity will increase
opportunities for residents of
the District as well as providing
another set of amenities to the
Downtown Elkhart experience.

RIVER DISTRICT REVITALIZATION PLAN

DEVELOPMENT CHARACTER
Building form and character are depicted in the rendering
below. This provides a framework of development following
the River District’s principles and recommendations.
Long Term Vision.
It is important to keep in mind
that this plan is a 20 year vision
for the River District. Existing
tenants are not being forced to
vacate. As development occurs or
when redevelopment takes place,
it is critical that the principles set
forth in this plan are held in place.
These changes will not take place
over night, but as the River District
transforms, this Revitalization Plan
gives developers and city officials
a set of guidelines to ensure the
District becomes what stakeholders
and community leaders envisioned.
These guidelines will include
buildings fronting on major streets
with parking as a secondary use
giving prominence to pedestrians.
Vertically mixing uses to
accommodate different uses on the
ground floor adds functionality to
the District.

Buildings engage the street.
Small setbacks and buildings fronting
the primary District streets afford the
public realm given to pedestrians as
opposed to vehicular thru-traffic. An
engaged streetscape slows traffic and
creates a more walkable environment.
Signature street.
Jackson Boulevard will be transformed
and be the primary location for initial
development. This redesigned street
features medians and reduced traffic
lanes with on-street parking.
Masked parking.
Surface parking lots are placed behind
buildings to reduce the amount
seen from the major road network.
This combined with fewer curb cuts
in each city block helps to reduce
congestion and wayfinding.

ELKHART, INDIANA

LAND USE
A conceptual land use concept is depicted below and represents only
land use. As expressed numerous places in this report, the form and
character of development is critical to the success of the River District
Mixing of Uses.
As demonstrated in the principles
and recommendations, mixing
of land uses both vertically and
horizontally is paramount to the
area’s success. This land use map
shows several different types of
mixed-use land types and each
will vary in their density and
proposed structures. The character
of development will be guided
by the this land use map but not
restricted to its boundaries. As
developers approach the District
with proposals, this map will likely
change over time.

Make Jackson Boulevard a signature street.
This should be a street for every person and every mode of
travel. A complete street would provide adequate pedestrian
amenities and afford cyclists a safe avenue for travel. Design
focus will be directed towards user experience as opposed to
maximizing vehicular access. Jackson Boulevard will provide
street parking and streetscape vegetation, serving as a buffer
between vehicles and adding safety to pedestrians and
cyclists. The final design of Jackson will fit within the greater
Elkhart Transportation network. The graphic shown is an
example of how the proposed street will function.

Leverage major investments.
Building upon the success of proximate prolific projects, the
area should leverage the development focus. The Elkhart
Health, Fitness and Aquatic Center (A) and potential ice
sports facility (B) will provide event based surges of spending
and area visitors. While a redeveloped Martin’s Super Market
(C) and Foundry (D) residential development will bring
sustained populations and investment. Maximizing this
potential through public and private partnerships, such as a
parking garage (E), will be important in the development of
this unique and exciting neighborhood.

Create exceptional access to waterways.
Capitalizing on the District’s distinct natural amenities in the
St. Joseph and Elkhart rivers. There are a few access points
currently but this opportunity needs to be maximized with
both unique and abundant access points. With the removal
of a lowhead dam along the Elkhart River, space for water
amenities will be created. Recreational examples would
include; white water park, kayak obstacle courses, additional
launches and a marina.

Strengthen the supportive street network.
Streets other than Jackson Boulevard should help circulate

signature street. These side streets will accommodate street
parking adding to the area’s capacity and maintain the design
standards of Jackson Boulevard. Development will focus
first on Jackson Boulevard and Elkhart Avenue, the signature
streets, before moving to the supportive street network.

The River District must be a place where people choose to
live. Using the information revealed in the market analysis, a

cohesion and efficiency. Proposed housing will front streets
and give privilege to pedestrians with vehicles the secondary
mode. Residential units may also be located above other
commercial establishments with a vertical mix of uses.

Create a branding initiative.
Establishing physical evidence of the area’s unique persona
will be obvious and of a high quality. This brand will follow
through in many facets of the District including; signage,
wayfinding, street furniture, advertisements, website,
letterheads, clothing, and more. Prominent entrances into the
District offer the chance to create neighborhood thresholds
through roadway arches or standing signs.

Prepare appropriate development regulations.
A key implementation tool will be development regulations
that clearly articulate expectations for private development.
Regulation standards will be developed as an initial step for
the District as these will guide development. These will outline
design standards for the following; land use configurations,
building setbacks, street dimensions, District materiality,
stormwater management strategies, parking requirements,
and more. A distinct strategy in the River District’s design
will visually hold the neighborhood together and provide a
pleasant and functional place for visitors and residents to live
and work.

Provide internal greenspaces.
Currently all of the District’s recreation areas are on the
perimeter. An internal greenspace would serve as a central
gathering space and provide a moment of relief along Jackson
Boulevard from the proposed development pattern. There
will be pedestrian and multi-use path connections from this
central greenspace to the exterior ribbon of amenities. By
connecting the perimeter pathways across the peninsula, a
full recreation multi-use loop would be created. Additionally,
interior greenspace offers an opportunity to increase the
number of street trees which aid in stormwater management
and pedestrian safety, among other benefits.

Allow for and encourage fun and creative place making.
Creative place making through fun and unique projects and

several strategic locations in the District which would offer
good exposure for quality pieces of public art viewable from

RIVER
DISTRICT

IMPLEMENTATION

OVERVIEW
The following chapter provides a framework for the full realization of the River District Revitalization Plan
including responsibilities for the various public and private sector actors. It is important to understand
phasing, funding opportunities and community capacity to assure overall success.
The City of Elkhart is a community in decline - this in spite of being surrounded by one of the most robust
industrial clusters for a City of its size in the country. The River District Revitalization Plan represents
a deliberate and well thought-out intervention by Elkhart’s leadership to reverse course and through a
concerted effort, create a geography capable of jump starting the City’s business and residential growth
for future decades to come. The plan is ambitious and will require the coordination of a network of public
and private partners. Large investments like the Elkhart Health, Fitness and Aquatic Center demonstrate
a commitment by these partners to the revitalization program. Their projects can be leveraged for even
greater impact if future investments focus on improving the vitality of the district as a whole.
Partners in Revitalization.
The River District Revitalization
Plan is first and foremost designed
to demonstrate the potential to
attract significant new investment
by both the private and public
sector. Investment designed to
strengthen the heart of the Elkhart
community ultimately expanding
into near-by neighborhoods and
business clusters.

36

RIVER DISTRICT REVITALIZATION PLAN

Public Sector Investments.
The public investments focus primarily on three general categories of investment.
> Upgrading dated and/or poorly performing infrastructure;
> Creating River District Area amenities designed to encourage resident, visitor and
business growth; and
> Improving the River District transportation logistics and connectivity to downtowns
existing neighborhoods and area business clusters.
These activities are almost exclusively the purview of the public sector. For purposes of this
discussion, public sector investment assumes a local (City of Elkhart) financing commitment
but also other governmental involvement including at the State and Federal levels.

Private Sector Investments.
The private sector investment
focuses on replacing dysfunctional
and low performing real estate with
new, market driven developments
which will serve existing residents,
grow the number of households
and population and serve to
retain, expand and attract new
businesses. Both the proposed
public and private investments
have been viewed through the
scope of what will support the
local and regional market. More
importantly, a deliberate effort
has been made to position these
markets to help revitalize a City
that wishes to control its destiny
and offer new opportunities for
its citizens. The investments
represent a combination of quality
of life amenities, new housing to
address a changing population
and household formation, and the
inclusion of new businesses that
provide services and employment
diversity.

Projects and Timing.
It is important to be clear on
project phasing, private and
public resources needed to
implement each of the initiatives,
and then steps that should be
considered to assure that the
community and its leadership has
organized to successfully carryout this exciting, and at the same
time, demanding mission.
Prioritized Investments.
Table 1 lists the major projects
for the River District in order of
priority. They are separated into
public and private investments
and outline the timing in years
when planning and development
for each project would happen.

PHASE 1 - SETTING THE TABLE
A clear program for realizing the investments identified as
part of the Plan is critical if the City of Elkhart and its residents
are to enjoy a reasonable level of prosperity moving forward.
Early and Achievable Outcomes.
Table 1 identifies key investments or initiatives to be made by the public and private sectors (10 each) considered essential in charting a new
and resurgent course for Elkhart. Each investment type involves some combination of planning and development which is slated to occur over
the next 20 years. Certain investments are good short term opportunities while others require more planning and will take time to implement
(see later tables). It is possible that the timetable for some of the initiatives may be changed according to economic conditions and/or local
needs. It is believed that the short term initiatives identified in Table 2 represent early and achievable outcomes that set the table for more
significant investment opportunities going forward. Funding responsibility is identified for each project with primary and supporting funds
through local government, non-local government (ie federal, state governments), non-government organizations (NGO) or private entities.

PHASE 2 - RIVER DISTRICT DEFINED
The second round of projects will provide the development fabric and scale
needed to define a dynamic mixed-use district capable of attracting new
business investment and residents that are looking for an active lifestyle.
Building Momentum.
Mid-term initiatives will take advantage of a renewed interest and
the momentum that will be generated by those projects that were
implemented in the “Table Setting Phase”. This phase will involve
over $150,000,000 in new investment which includes approximately
$31,000,000 of public investment over a seven year period. Up to
$9,000,000 of the public investment could be raised from non-local
sources.

Array of Investment. Securing a broader array of non-local public
investment will be easier during this phase given the extended time
period to do so and the progress that will have already been made in
realizing elements of the River District Revitalization Plan. Just over 12%
of the budget for the River District Defined Phase will be comprised of
local funds. Each $1 dollar of local funds is projected to generate $7.26
dollars in additional investment along with significant growth in the
property tax base, jobs and new residents.

A Catalyst for Private Investment.
Over a 10-20 year period it is believed that on average, for every
$1 dollar of public investment made another $6 to $10 dollars of
private investment will occur – resulting in additional tax base,
job growth and modernized public and private facilities. By way
of example only, if the public sector averages $5,000,000 a year
in investment over the next 20 years, the City would experience
approximately $1 billion dollars in additional private investment.

PHASE 3 - REVITALIZED RIVER DISTRICT
These are initiatives that will improve the manner in which the
River District works for its visitors, businesses and residents but are
not seen as essential components of the early revitalization efforts.
Leveraging Private Investment.
There are a series of projects that may take some time to realize or
could be implemented earlier subject to economic conditions and the
involvement and wishes of community leadership. As can be seen in
Table 4, the “Revitalized River District Phase”, these projects are slated
to occur anytime from years 4 through 20. These initiatives represent
approximately $35,000,000-$40,000,000 in additional investment. The

total public investment anticipated for these activities is approximately
$4,400,000 of which $3,400,000 is expected to be generated from
local public sources or not quite 10% of the total investment assuming
a $35,000,000 budget. In this instance the leveraging ratio on these
projects now benefitting from a revitalized District is approximately
$9.29 dollars of private investment for every $1.00 dollar of City or local
investment.

FUNDING STRATEGIES
The full realization of the vision for the River District will take place over a
series of development phases. The scale of the District and the realities of
the short-term market demands insist on a phased approach to development.
Innovative Financing.
It is important to stress that most
communities involved in the
business of revitalization have
been both astute and innovative
in identifying local and nonlocal sources of financing to
accomplish their objectives. The
Elkhart community has proactively
established a number of funding
tools that can be utilized to
assist in accomplishing the River
District agenda. In addition there
are external funding sources
that should be considered to
assist the community with its
financing needs. Table 5 offers
a potential funding plan for over
$110,000,000 in River District
Initiatives to be implemented
between 2017-2021.

RIVER DISTRICT REVITALIZATION PLAN

Spectrum of Funders.
These projects will both change the perception,
reality and long term role of the River District once
they are put in place. While expensive it is clear that
the broad project scope for this 3-5 Year Program will
create funding eligibility across a broad spectrum of
private and public funders. The City’s percentage of
investment for this major revitalization program is
estimated to be just over 22%. Other non-local public
revenues will make up almost 11% with the private
financing covering 67% of the cost. An ambitious
redevelopment program with a daunting price tag
attached to it becomes manageable due to the
partners the City will be able to attract to participate.
In fact, for every $1 dollar that the City invests in
upgrading its infrastructure, reclaiming industrial
brownfields and investing in new long term land uses
will generate at a minimum another $4.50 dollars in
new investment during this Table Setting Phase – all
in an area that has seen little new investment for over
30 years.

Business Plan Development.
The goal of a public-private investment
program will be to attain the optimal
leveraging ratio for the local public
dollars invested. Having said this the
ultimate goal is to create a dynamic
geography that is capable of attracting
significant new mixed-use investment
and by doing so impacting adjacent
neighborhoods and business clusters.
By achieving this outcome, the City
will transform from a no-growth
economically vulnerable community
to one with an expanding tax base, a
diversified business sector with new
population growth. These outcomes
will be accomplished as a result of a
well thought-out business plan that
had input and more importantly buy-in
from Elkhart’s public and private sector
leadership.

FUNDING STRATEGIES CONTINUED
To focus and encourage the continuation of Elkhart’s entrepreneurial legacy, it is recommended that a
River District Small Business Development Fund be established to support the following activities.
River District Emerging Business
Revolving Loan Program
(Proposed).
Existing businesses with 50
fewer employees and/or less
than $1,000,000 in annual gross
revenue could qualify for a loan of
up to $15,000 which will serve as a
subordinate loan to a conventional
loan from a local participating
bank. The small business would
have to document that it is unable
to get a conventional loan for
required capital and/or operational
investment. The emerging business
revolving loan fund would be used
to facilitate a smaller conventional
loan with the revolving loan fund
serving to close the gap required
to satisfy the documented need for
funds.

44

RIVER DISTRICT REVITALIZATION PLAN

River District Facade
Improvement Loan Program
(Proposed).
The Façade Improvement Loan
provides up to $10,000 to the
owner(s) of a building for the
purpose of enhancing its building
façade or corridor adjacent site
aesthetic features, compatible
with the Plan. Repayment is
required only if the owner(s) sells
the building within ten years after
disbursement of funds.
Program dollars must be matched
by private funds at 1:1 ratio. Up to
one-half of the private match may
be in the form of in-kind donations.
Funds will be distributed on a
reimbursement basis, following
submission of a proof of payment
for completed work.

River District Green Fit Loan
Program (Proposed).
The Green Fit Loan provides up to
$10,000 to businesses to install
storm water treatment ‘best
practice’ features, green energy
and energy efficiency projects.
Public dollars must be matched
by private investment at a 1:2
ratio. Funds will be distributed on
a reimbursement basis, following
submission of a receipt or invoice.
Repayment is required only if
the company relocates out of
the development area, or ceases
existence, within ten years after
disbursement of funds.
Gateway Mile Loan Fund
(Existing).
Downtown Elkhart Inc. works in
partnership with local financial
institutions and the Aurora Capital
Development Corporation to offer
this resource. The fund provides
capital to creditworthy businesses,
in a designated area of Downtown
Elkhart’s Main Street corridor

and the immediately adjacent
neighborhoods. Eligible loans may
be made for commercial real estate
and general business purposes.
Loans may be made to either the
real estate owners or the lessees,
and can assist with collateralized
mortgages up to $200,000
and small business loans up to
$50,000. It is recommended
that this program be expanded to
include the River District area.
River District Innovation Grant
Program (Proposed).
The Innovation Grant Program
provides up to $5,000 to
businesses developing new
services or introducing a new
business use to the corridor.
Public dollars must be matched by
private investment at a 1:1 ratio. Up
to one-half of the private match
may be in the form of in-kind
activities. Funds will be distributed
on a reimbursement basis,
following submission of receipt or
invoice.

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
The economic development objectives suggested below are
recommended as potential responses to these questions while also
helping to structure a part of the River District Revitalization Plan.
Expand business base and tax
generating capacity.
Historically both the City and County
have enjoyed an organically grown
industrial base. Starting in the 1960’s
moving into the first years of the
21st Century entrepreneurs and new
businesses have found opportunity in
Elkhart and the surrounding Region. It is
clear that the market place for industry is
becoming more competitive and sensitive
to “business logistics” with factors such
as transportation variables, workforce,
and access to materials and inventory
impacting short and long term business
strategies. Even during the pre-recession
years there was some decline in
industrial employment due to a dynamic
and competitive business climate. Elkhart
with its strong industrial base and RV
and automotive clusters has numerous
advantages but also must be sensitive to
other factors if it is to remain competitive

with other locations regionally and
nationally. While both the community
and the State of Indiana have been
attentive to the existing business base, a
re-assessment of current impediments
and opportunities for the retention,
expansion and continued creation of
new businesses should be performed.
On a national level there is an emerging
attention being given to re-investing in
the nation’s industrial capacity. How does
the national discussion benefit the NorthCentral Region and more specifically an
already well-established manufacturing
center like Elkhart?
Recommendation. Update current
impediments and opportunities which
impact the community’s ability to
encourage the retention, expansion and
continued creation of new businesses.

Expand local workforce and enhance skills
and training.
There is substantial evidence that finding
qualified and available workers to fill industrial
positions, both entry level and skilled, is an
increasing problem for local employers. This fact
is reinforced by the 28,000 + working commuters
that travel into the County each work day. Access
to an able and ready workforce is as important
a resource in the production process as there is.
The inability to effectively recruit and retain a
workforce is a very real issue impacting the cost
of doing business for Elkhart’s businesses. Couple
this with the likely importing of employees from
outside Elkhart County and the industrial leakage
referred to previously is clearly exacerbated.
Recommendation. That this issue be revisited by
community leaders and a discussion focused on
identifying innovative approaches for remediating
this issue be undertaken. One possible response
is offered as part of the fourth economic
development objective listed below.

ELKHART, INDIANA

45

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CONTINUED
Establish River District and Downtown as business service
center.
The River District and downtown in the future will serve as
an important regional mixed-use center providing essential
services to an expanding customer base. As already stated,
one of the stronger existing market opportunities is the 400+
manufacturing firms with their 22,000+ employees within
10 minutes of Elkhart’s Central Business District. The Central
Business District (CBD) is in the best position geographically
and as an already existing well-organized services hub to
meet the diverse needs of the near-by business clusters. In
business activity areas that are a part of the indirect or nonmanufacturing process such as; business supplies, hospitality,
food and entertainment, meeting, medical and training
services, etc., a centralized well equipped location could serve
as a highly valued business amenity currently not available
in the market place. By organizing and focusing on this nontraditional market, the CBD is expanding its market and also
increasing the ability to diversify its role in the general market
place. For example, the market viability of a hotel, or office and/
or furniture center may be improved if the business community
is an additional driver for such services
Recommendation. A more in-depth analysis of the demand
levels of the businesses within the 5 mile radius should
be undertaken in order to document how to maximize
the untapped market potential represented by Elkhart’s
manufacturing firms and business community.
46

RIVER DISTRICT REVITALIZATION PLAN

Revitalize targeted Elkhart neighborhoods utilizing workforce housing
development strategy.
Many of Elkhart’s neighborhoods have experienced economic distress as
the housing stock has become older and the households increasingly are
characterized by lower incomes and increasingly renter versus owner occupied.
While much of Elkhart’s housing stock is well designed and well-built there are
signs of deferred maintenance and neglect. Almost one-half of the City’s housing
stock is now rental with single-family conversions to rental housing being the
largest contributor to the multi-family inventory.
A possible neighborhood revitalization strategy could include targeting specific
neighborhoods for the inclusion of quality “workforce housing” opportunities
– potentially accomplishing two objectives with one program. The demand for
an increased workforce to satisfy employer demand has already been identified
as a pressing local economic need. It is also clear that a significant number of
employees are commuting from beyond Elkhart County’s borders to get to work
each day. A program which provides quality, affordable housing to the workforce
could accomplish two important objectives: 1) attract workforce households to
a perceived housing opportunity; and 2) through existing housing re-investment
upgrade and transition vulnerable neighborhoods from distress to revitalization.
Across the country there are similar efforts in communities that are suffering
a workforce shortage, in part due to a scarcity of and/or inadequate housing
options. Quite often the public sector and private sector (employers) partner to
structure housing programs that are designed to attract a workforce to an area
while at the same time satisfying a community’s redevelopment objectives.
Recommendation. To establish a public-private partnership that focuses on
utilizing the provision of workforce housing to incentivize the workforce to live
closer to available jobs and to revitalize neighborhoods in need of revitalization.

Partner with State of Indiana using CReED/TIF as a 10-15
year economic development incentive.
It is important not only for the Elkhart community, but
the North-Central Indiana Region and the State of Indiana
to realize the significance of the business clusters that
serve as essential economic engines generating significant
local and state economic impact. Not only should local
leadership explore innovative methods for retaining and
expanding these clusters, the State has just as much
vested in assuring success on this front. It is believed that
Elkhart is in a unique position with the presence of these
strong and mature clusters. The opportunities presented
by the clusters should be fully understood and steps taken
to take full advantage of either business expansion and/
or creation. If there are threats to the clusters these also
should be researched and fully understood. Creating a
business climate that supports the continued investment
by these and new firms should be a defined priority
including looking at issues like workforce development
and concentrating business services as identified in earlier
objectives. Establishing a resource pool that can be used to
either incentivize businesses and/or support programs and
initiatives which enhance the economic climate should be
considered.

Next Steps.
The River District Revitalization Study has demonstrated that the surrounding
neighborhoods and the near-by business clusters can play a substantial role in
helping to attract new market opportunity to the River District as well as the
City of Elkhart. There is a synergy that can be leveraged between the CBD (River
District and Downtown), City of Elkhart neighborhoods, and the City’s-County’s
strong manufacturing base. It is believed that taking advantage of this synergy will
serve both the River District program as well as broader Elkhart community in a
manner that will prove difficult to ignore.
Recommendation. To the extent that leadership has the time and capacity
to add to an already full agenda it is recommended that a 30 day analysis be
undertaken to document the opportunities which exist with a business cluster
retention-expansion program. Its early objectives would identify short-term
business investment opportunities, business support programs (i.e. workforce
development, workforce housing, business support services, etc.) and potential
State-Local partnership opportunities. A review of existing CReED and TIF
Legislation should occur to determine if minor amendments should be undertaken
in order to include these existing programs as part of a potential partnership
element. Following the 30 day analysis an action plan designed to create a StateLocal partnership as well as a work program focused on the broad synergies
should be at the very least outlined.

Recommendation. To explore the creation of a State/Local
partnership by using existing CReED and TIF Legislation
to generate resources that will support relevant economic
development objectives.

EVANSVILLE DOWNTOWN MASTER PLAN - FINAL REPORT

1.0 Introduction
Evansville is uniquely located in southwest Indiana approximately two
hours + from any city equal to or larger in size. The physical isolationism of the community is perceived by some to be a negative factor,
however, strong local retail sales characteristics indicate the isolationism
is a significantly important factor for a healthy local economy. Most
consumers in Evansville and surrounding counties are spending their
money locally which helps to fuel a strong micro-economy. The Evansville economy is driven by an impressive list of internationally recognized corporations, regional health services and banking, three institutions of higher learning, and numerous retail & entertainment businesses including the Casino Aztar.
How communities (large and small) elect to measure their growth and
success is of major concern to our cities today, especially to medium
sized cities, such as, Evansville. Suburban sprawl has captured the
attention of community and regional planning authorities nationwide.
Towns and cities are beginning to realize the price they must pay when
delivering expanded infrastructure, roads & highways, municipal
services, and school expansions to support new housing subdivisions
and commercial centers being built further and further from the traditional town center; downtown.
Balancing the growth greater Evansville will continue to have with the
community character and quality of life residents and businesses alike
deserve, can be difficult when community development is not properly
managed.
However, through a public/private partnership and strategic action
plan for downtown, Evansville can determine what the most appropriate future will be for it’s downtown and urban neighborhoods and what
measures it must take to guard against the forces of random sprawl.
In January of 2001, the City of Evansville retained the consulting firm of
Kinzelman, Kline, Gossman (KKG) to prepare a Strategic Action Plan for
a targeted area of downtown. KKG assembled a team of experts including Urban Marketing Collaborative (UMC), TDA; Illinois, Claire Bennett
Associates (CBA) and Brownstone Design to address the challenges
facing downtown Evansville.
Over the past six months the consultants have collected and analyzed
various kinds of data, met with hundreds of local citizens including:
residents, business leaders, elected officials, community service providers, and downtown stakeholders. In addition the consultants have
conducted several informative focus group meetings and a very successful “Towne Meeting” where over 400 participants presented hundreds
of ideas and reached consensus on the most important issues facing
downtown Evansville. The “Towne Meeting” served as a barometer of
how much Evansville-Vanderburgh County residents care about their
community.

Introduction

This document, albeit prepared by the consulting team, has been in
many ways co-authored with the people of Evansville. The consultants
have taken the ideas generated at the town meeting; conveyed during
the one on one interviews, focus group discussions, or expressed
through correspondence, and creatively integrated them into an exciting
urban redevelopment action plan for downtown.
We have purposely formatted the action plan in a user- friendly manner
to allow champions of the effort to use it as a business plan. We encourage the implementation committee to revisit the plan often and to adjust
the course of action as market conditions dictate. Additionally, portions
of the plan can be quickly assembled to provide a marketing packet for
prospective tenants or real estate investors.

1.1 Planning Objectives
The Request for Proposal (RFP) issued by The City of Evansville on July
28, 2000 identified a specific territory that the selected consulting team
was to focus upon. The territory was defined as follows and can be seen
on the Target Area Map on the following page.
North:
Northeast:
Southeast:
Southwest:
West:

The Lloyd Expressway
Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard
Chestnut Street
Ohio River
Pigeon Creek

Planning objectives identified by the city for the project focused primarily on future recommendations for “The Walkway,” the pedestrian/
transit mall located on historic Main Street. Additionally, the city was
searching for the proper antidote for the continuing decline which had
plagued downtown over the past several decades. The city also challenged the consultants to develop a sound strategy to recruit new investment into the downtown.
Additional objectives were identified as follows:
1. Main Street revitalization
2. Plan to guide the growth & physical development in the downtown
3. Plan to promote upgrading of existing buildings and reuse of
vacant buildings/land
4. Downtown housing
5. Access, traffic, parking, and linkages
6. Entertainment district and its integration with Casino Aztar, The
Centre, and Victory Theatre
7. Riverfront development
8. Aid in final plans for Events Plaza
9. Downtown workforce recruitment, retention efforts
10. Develop a series of recommendations for both the private &
public sector actions

As a result of the physical, market, & emotional conditions analysis of
downtown, the KKG team developed a series of urban design principals
[identified in Section 2.2] that expands upon these planning objectives
and begins to set the parameters for the appropriate strategic action plan
that follows.

EVANSVILLE DOWNTOWN MASTER PLAN - FINAL REPORT

2.1 Strategic Thinking

2.2 Urban Design Principles

The process of strategic planning allows an organization to challenge
itself through self-examination and to craft a preferred mode of operation through suggested operational changes. This is accomplished in
part by engaging the organization in a consensus building exercise
designed to encourage creative insightful thinking about the way the
organization views itself. Additionally, the organization may challenge
the product it creates or the message it sends to the general public about
itself or product, and how it might increase its share of the market.

History and experience have shown that with strategic planning,
coordinated effort, and on-going attention, historically rich
environments such as downtown Evansville’s can thrive as both centers
of commerce and culture. It is our firm belief that economically
successful, vibrant downtowns share common traits. These traits can be
characterized by a select set of urban design principles that address both
the physical urban environment and the realities of the marketplace.

5.) Visually Exciting Environment

Once the organization has identified issues affecting positive change, a
strategic action plan can be mapped out and implemented through a
task force committee structure armed with goals, objectives, and critical
path scheduling.

Based on that which we have seen, heard and discovered in downtown
Evansville, we have provided a list of urban design principles which we
feel apply to the core area and the issues of redirecting development
activities in downtown Evansville.

6.) Encourage Mixed Use Development

Organizations of all types have employed this process, or a similar one,
to help them identify barriers to success and determine appropriate
corrective strategies to instill positive change in their organizations.

When followed, these principles can help guide those individuals and
organizations involved in the “businessing” of urban districts to make
sound decisions regarding these matters; investments of time, energy
and resources.

7.) Linked Integrally to Adjacent Neighborhoods and Business
Districts

Private businesses, public agencies, school districts, churches, etc. have
used strategic planning principles to modify their course of action or
methods of operation to affect positive change.
Often times preconceived barriers and threats are not as insurmountable
as what may have been perceived and can be quickly eradicated by
simply providing a forum for one part of the organization to communicate with another. With a common goal in mind and each member of
the organization feeling less threatened by the other, goals and objectives can be realized for each while the entire organization strengthens
and grows.
The strategic plan of action for downtown Evansville, identified in this
document, has been developed through a strategic planning process
aimed at gaining the trust and confidence of an entire community to
move forward with a common repositioning agenda for downtown.
Unlike a business or organization, engaging an entire community in a
planning process can be challenging. However through the hard work
of Mayor Lloyd, the downtown Evansville Master Plan Steering Committee, downtown Evansville Inc., City Council, and our consulting
team, we have created an exciting, yet realistic strategic plan for downtown Evansville.

EVANSVILLE DOWNTOWN MASTER PLAN - FINAL REPORT

3.1 History, Diversity & Opportunity
Before the age of the automobile and shopping mall, downtown’s buildings were built to accommodate a population that lived, worked, and
played within a short distance of the core of the city.
From Evansville’s early 1800’s settlements to the higher population
periods of the Great Depression and post World War II, downtown and
the surrounding neighborhoods were densely populated urban areas
with diversity of people, businesses, and cultural attractions.
Today, Evansville’s legacy as the region’s historic, economic, and cultural center is evident in its remaining historic buildings and landmarks.
As the city looks to reposition downtown, these structures and landmarks and the colorful history they represent can again be leveraged as
the foundations of continued economic and cultural development.
The unique history of Evansville can be read in numerous research
documents available through the public library, City of Evansville, etc.
Our discussion in this section of the document will focus on those areas
of Evansville’s history that should be examined carefully and considered
to be important elements of a redevelopment approach to the repositioning of downtown Evansville.
A community’s history is a critical element when one considers ways in
which to market and promote their town because it offers opportunities
to clearly differentiate one town from the next.
Repositioning strategies in communities such as Lowell, MA; Pittsburgh,
PA; Indianapolis, IN; and others have recognized the importance of this
as a critical component to their success.
Commerce and Industry:
As an historic center of trade and commerce, downtown identity and
development opportunities may capitalize on references to Evansville’s
manufacturing trades and exchange of commodities such as foundry
goods, furniture, flour, cigars, and other agricultural products.
Bygone reminders of downtown’s industrial past include the Singer
Center Buggy Works and the Igleheart Flour Mill that once stood along
the Wabash and Erie Canal at Fifth and Locust Streets. Several remaining historic three and four story structures including the Bitterman,
Britz, Chute, Capelle, Ridgeway and Artes buildings housed dry goods,
jewelry and apparel businesses and provide wonderful potential for
adaptive new-uses that allow for ground floor dining, retail and entertainment spaces with needed upper story residential and office space.
Evansville’s industrial history with innovation & invention provides a
unique perspective from which to explore new development opportunities.

Initial Assessment

Transportation:
Evansville’s rich river heritage, its former position as an important
shipyard, and the legacy of the railroad and streetcar era could be
employed in a wide variety of ways. The recent and ongoing development of the riverfront promenade, the Aztar riverboat casino, and the
operation of the downtown Walkway and North Main Street Trolley
routes are important contributors to the vitality of downtown. Additional opportunities may include retail and entertainment venues that
draw inspiration from Evansville’s 19th century boatyards, the Wabash
and Erie Canal, and the early railroad industry.
Culture:
The array and diversity of Evansville’s historic neighborhoods offer a
window into the city’s cultural heritage. The industrialization of the city
in the mid-1800’s attracted both unskilled laborers and skilled craftsman
of diverse ethnic and socioeconomic status. The influences of European
immigration on Evansville, and in particular that of German decent,
should continue to be showcased as a part of the repositioning of downtown. Other cultural influences on Evansville such as African American,
Hispanic, and Asian can play a valuable role in identifying linkages to
new development opportunities.
An overview of downtown’s historic inventory is provided in Historic
Evansville, a guidebook published by the City’s Department of Metropolitan Development.

3.2 Physical Assessment of Downtown
This portion of the Initial Assessment section will discuss the existing
conditions of the downtown area including comments on the physical
strengths, as well as challenges to overcome, as the Strategic Plan is
implemented.
First and foremost in the strength category, is the wonderful setting
occupied by the downtown on the banks of the Ohio River. With picturesque views to the south beyond the river, downtown Evansville offers
workers, residents, and visitors alike a unique setting from which to
experience this historic river city.
Although downtown is not at the crossroads of key highways, downtown is strategically located to the rest of the city along the Lloyd Expressway which serves as a major connector of several primary destinations in Evansville (see map 3-IV).
A unique quality of the setting is the dense urban development to the
north in the city proper and the serene natural environment south of the
river in the floodplain of the oxbow.
The downtown has changed over the years from the major manufacturing and shipping center it once enjoyed to the service sector industries

dominating the downtown today. Gone are the warehouses and wharfside developments where major river traffic contributed to the local
economy in a more significant fashion than today.
Although some limited businesses still take advantage of the river for
shipping goods, the river has given way to railway, highway and air
shipping. Today, the river provides Evansville with recreational opportunities and scenic vistas from downtown buildings and the newly
opened Riverside Drive & esplanade.
The Casino Aztar, Railroad Museum, and Museum of Art History and
Science now occupy dominant positions on the river and provide visitors with a glimpse of the river and its colorful history.
The Central Business District of downtown is located within the original
city grid of streets primarily between 2nd Street & Martin Luther King, Jr.
Blvd.; and Sycamore & Locust Streets. This area features the pedestrian/transit mall along Main Street, known locally as “The Walkway”
as well as the most intact collection of historic buildings in the downtown.
The rich history of the architecture is somewhat disguised because of
less than sensitive facade remodeling efforts over the years and upper
story neglect. Those buildings that have been renovated or maintained
are clearly fine examples of nineteenth & twentieth century Italianate,
Art Deco, and early high-rise architecture.
Other examples of outstanding architecture represented in downtown
include the Old Post Office, Vanderburgh County Courthouse, YMCA,
YWCA, Victory Theatre, and several historic warehouses, churches, and
residential structures especially in the Riverside Historic District.
Newer structures of merit include the Civic Center, The Centre, Integra
Bank, and the City owned parking structures.
All of these structures are physical representations of an impressive
commitment of local financial resources by Evansvillians committed to
preserving the value of downtown.
Grand boulevards, roads, sidewalks, and public space in the downtown
appear to never have been a major priority to the city. The exception
being from early years the Fourth Street market boulevard and later
MLK Blvd., and Riverside Drive.
Consequently, sidewalk widths, and public spaces are not overly generous for public gathering plazas, extensive tree planting, sidewalk cafes,
etc. Newer projects such as the Civic Center, and the new Old National
Bank headquarters to be constructed at the corner of Riverside Drive
and Main Street, recognize this and have integrated public gathering
space into their plans.

EVANSVILLE DOWNTOWN MASTER PLAN - FINAL REPORT

Accessibility into the downtown is discussed in the following section,
however we should point out that the original geometric grid pattern of
streets in the city contribute both positively and negatively to this condition. The identity or demarcation of the original downtown is clear
when one travels into the city by way of a subtle shift in direction caused
by the offset alignment of the streets. Contrary to this is the confusion to
the visitor when experiencing the same condition. Remedies for this
condition are discussed elsewhere in this document and will suggest
visual enhancements of key entranceways through wayfinding and
landscaping opportunities.

patterns suggest that the main issue in converting streets to two-way
operation is not capacity but road geometry where the one-way sections
currently begin. Conversions to two-way flow are unlikely to affect the
ramps serving the Lloyd Expressway at Main Street since the ramps
already connect with a two-way street section. At First Avenue / Market / Fourth St. the ramps also serve a two-way street section, though
one that is split around piers supporting the overpass. This is a complex
intersection but sufficient space appears to be available to enable appropriate design solutions. In any case, a guiding criterion should be that
ramp movements will be preserved as new intersection configurations
are developed.

1. Transportation, Circulation, & Parking

•

Evansville has experienced a wide variety of changes to its transportation system over the last 30-40 years: conversion of streets to one-way
traffic flow; vacation of streets for superblock development; construction
of an elevated freeway necessitating additional street vacation; closure
of Main Street for a pedestrian mall; development of a transit center; and
reconstruction of Riverside Drive as a landscaped boulevard. It can be
argued that many of the changes to streets, whether to increase capacity,
reduce congestion, or allow new types of land development, have been
implemented without recognition of broader planning issues and have
created a confusing and sometimes frustrating access and circulation
system that no longer serves the needs of downtown.

•

Befitting a master plan for downtown, the transportation recommendations focus on actions that would reasonably improve downtown’s
development potential, market position and visitor appeal. There has
been strong support for eliminating one-way streets downtown. The
question for subsequent analysis will be how best to handle the conversion. So far, no fatal flaws have been identified to suggest that the
recommendation not proceed to the next step. The following points
summarize key aspects of the downtown’s transportation system.
Setting
•
•

Downtown lies in the southwestern area of Evansville,
peripheral to the center of population
River location is increasingly valuable for recreation and for
residential and office views

Access & Traffic Volume
The recommendation to convert existing one-way streets to two-way
flow is based on opportunities to simplify circulation, to limit confusion
(especially for visitors,) and to present a better view of downtown as one
approaches it. Available traffic counts show that volumes are quite
modest on Third and Fifth Streets with a total of approximately 4,700
daily vehicles while Vine and Sycamore together carry an estimated
8,000 - 10,000 daily vehicles. Volumes on each existing pair of streets fall
easily within capacity of a two-lane street. While volume data is limited
pending completion of the updated downtown count program, the

•

•

Major approach routes are from the east and north including
the Lloyd Expressway, Walnut, Main and 1st Avenue. From
the South, Riverside Drive / Veterans Memorial Parkway is
the primary approach. However, access is confusing due to:
- Lack of continuity
- Transition from 2-way to 1-way streets
- Poor or limited sight-lines to guide drivers
Regional access is good with Lloyd Expressway (IN 62),
Riverside Drive/Veterans’ Memorial Parkway connecting to
IN 41 and I-164
Recent traffic counts confirm the concentration of travel on
Walnut Street, Riverside Drive and the Lloyd Expressway.
However, while the highways carry high volumes (approximately 20,000 daily vehicles on Riverside Drive and 60,000
on Lloyd Expressway) it appears that much of that traffic
continues past downtown.
Estimated downtown traffic generation: While cordon traffic
volumes are not available, downtown traffic can be estimated
based on its parking usage.
- Downtown has approximately 7,700 parking spaces
that are 80% occupied (excluding the casino). Most of
those spaces serve employees so turnover is relatively
low, probably in the range of 1.2 - 1.3 vehicles per day.
This amounts to a traffic volume of approximately 15,000
- 16,000 employee and shopper vehicle trips per day.
- Other traffic due to passenger loading, service and
deliveries, transit and pass-through trips would probably
add another 15 - 20%, or 2,250 - 3,200 vehicle trips per
day.
- Casino Aztar generates about 5,000 weekday
vehicle trips.
· It is therefore likely that downtown generates
on the order of 22,250 - 24,200 vehicle trips per
day.
- The volume on Riverside Drive and the Lloyd
Expressway alone amounts to 79,000 daily vehicles, while
other arterial streets entering downtown carry at least
20,000 - 25,000 vehicles.

•

•

- If these estimates are correct, downtown generates
about 22 - 24% of the total traffic passing by or through
downtown. Clearly, downtown has an opportunity to
attract more of that traffic.
Many downtown streets have low volumes (under 3,000
daily vehicles). Walnut Street, MLK Boulevard and Riverside
Drive carry higher volumes due to freeway connections and
cross-town access. Some of the one-way streets such as 3rd
and 5th carry too little traffic (1,800 - 3,000 daily vehicles) to
justify one-way circulation for capacity reasons.
Downtown is the center of the transit system

Parking (see map 3-I)
• Downtown has about 7,700 parking spaces (plus parking for
Casino Aztar)
• 20% are private, 80% public
• About 80% of all spaces are occupied on weekdays. Supply
and demand are in balance across the system though some
areas may experience much higher occupancies with few
spaces left for visitors. The system would be effectively full
when occupancy approaches 85 -90%.
• Some employees park on the street, consequently, visitors
and shoppers may not get most convenient spaces
• “Walkway” stores face on-street parking deficit
- must rely on limited offering of side-street spaces
- employee competition for few street spaces
Walking (see map 3-II)
• Distances between major attractions are manageable.
• Some sidewalks are very narrow for a commercial district.
• Streets other than “Walkway on Main Street” are not very
pedestrian friendly.
Alternative Transportation
The city of Evansville has a quality mass transit system which serves the
entire city very effectively and efficiently. In an effort to provide selected route service to the core of downtown, a trolley system was
introduced. The trolley system should be reexamined for expansion
(both in geographic service area and number of trolleys) to link neighborhoods surrounding downtown more efficiently.
Longer range visioning should include identification of resources to
provide planning funding for a community-wide light rail system and/
or optional energy sources for the entire transit system.
Communities nationwide are realizing more than ever the importance to
become less dependant on fossil fuels. A city’s mass transit system can
serve as a valuable alternative energy demonstration project to enlighten
the entire community as to the importance of this long range goal.

3.3 Market Analysis
1. Introduction
This market analysis is prepared to provide current market conditions
information for the development of the Strategic Action Plan for downtown Evansville. Much of the information contained in this evaluation is
the result of primary research conducted by the consultants. This research included interviews with key stakeholders in Evansville, an
inventory of the existing ground floor retail/commercial space, and a
physical survey of the downtown.

1A. Background and Project Understanding
Downtown Evansville comprises the commercial lands on both sides of
Main Street including the retail/commercial space located on the side
streets. It extends approximately three-quarters of a mile from Second
Street near the Ohio River to Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard at the
north.
·

The downtown is situated on a bend of the Ohio River and reflects
the heritage of the area as the traditional core of the City. At present
the Main Street from Second Street to Martin Luther King, Jr. Blvd. is
a pedestrian and transit mall.

In the last few years, Downtown Evansville has witnessed a number of
changes. Recent Downtown Evansville improvements include:

Previous Studies

A summary of background information on housing, the visitor/tourist
market, and Casino Aztar are provided below.
Housing
In July 2000, the Danter Company prepared a report on A Condominium
and Apartment Analysis in the City of Evansville, Indiana to analyze the
market potential to develop market rate apartments and condominiums
at a downtown site. The proposed project included 44 one, two, and

6

Initial Assessment

three bedroom apartments and 12 two and three bedroom condominium
townhouses. The Danter Company estimated that the absorption rate
for apartments was 4.5 to 5.5 units per month, and the absorption rate
for the townhouses was 0.5 to 0.8 units per month.
Visitors
It is estimated that over two million people visit the City of Evansville
each year. The economic impacts are also estimated to be $3 million to
$4.2 million per year.
In 2000, the Purdue Tourism Hospitality Research Center conducted a
survey of visitors to the City of Evansville for the Evansville Convention
and Visitors Bureau. Some of the preliminary findings include the
following:

Casino Aztar
The Center for Urban Policy and The Environment conducted a Five
Year License Renewal report for Aztar Indiana Gaming Corporation,
February 2001. Casino Aztar includes a 2,700 passenger casino
riverboat, 44,000 square foot pavilion, a 250 room hotel, and a 1,668
space parking garage. There are approximately two million visits to the
casino each year.
Gaming receipts for 1999 were $94.5 million, or approximately $49 per
patron.
A recent survey determined that 18% of visits come from Evansville
residents, 39% come from Indiana, and a further 43% from outside of the
state. Eighty-seven percent of respondents were there for the casino,
while the remaining 13% were visiting for other reasons (family, friends,
vacation, business, etc.).
The survey also ascertained that 23% of patrons visited downtown
Evansville. Of the total number of patrons, 17% or 340,000 visited a
restaurant in downtown Evansville and 5% or 100,000 shopped in
downtown Evansville. Their estimated expenditure was $6 million on
eating, drinking, and shopping in the downtown.
Downtown Evansville also benefits from local incentives and taxes paid
to the state and local governments. Between 1996 and 1999, Casino
Aztar has paid almost $30 million in local incentives, of which downtown revitalization has received almost one-third. Other downtown
benefactors include The Centre, Downtown Learning Center, and Victory Theater. Most of these projects have received their total contributions or will so within the next year.

2A. Project Understanding
As a first step in assisting the city towards creating a downtown master
plan, the team conducted fact-finding initiatives as part of the initial
evaluation to identify the downtown’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. These initiatives included:
•
A demographic analysis of Evansville and Vanderburgh
County
•
interviews with a variety of downtown retailers and key
stakeholders* to identify issues and opinions about commercial success/ barriers in the downtown
•
A review of previous studies and information on
Evansville/ Vanderburgh County
•
an inventory and inspection of the ground floor businesses
and services in the downtown
•
A competitive review and a review of the physical
environment
*Note: Prior to the interview process, the consulting team provided key stakeholder profiles to the city
of Evansville. The City of Evansville then selected community stakeholders for the consultants to
interview. A complete listing of those who participated can be found in the Appendix of this document.

2B. Market Situation

Although several of the cities listed above do not match the population
profile of Evansville, we feel exploration of these cities will prove to be
beneficial to the Evansville Downtown Coalition when comparing urban
redevelopment projects & improvement opportunities discussed in The
downtown master plan.

Much of Evansville’s past and present development can be attributed to
its location between Louisville and St. Louis and being a river port, as
well as a major rail transportation hub in the Midwest. Evansville is 176
miles south of Indianapolis, 126 miles west of Louisville, Kentucky, and
180 miles east of St. Louis, Missouri.

Additional research should also be undertaken into other cities with
comparable downtown economic development “engines” being
discussed in the master plan such as minor league baseball and hockey,
arts, culture & entertainment, etc. Many of those cities are much smaller
than Evansville but have demonstrated how communities of any size
can have healthy downtowns when a strategic plan of action is followed.

Evansville also benefits from a highly developed road network providing local businesses and residents with easy access to major east-west
routes using I-64 and north-south corridors including Highway 41 and
I-164. Major north-south access improvements include the development
study of I-69. However, at present there is no major north-south route
linking Evansville to Indianapolis. The proposed freeway will allow
greater connectivity in terms of business activity and visitor flow.

2. Fact-finding and Analysis
The fact-finding and analysis step is vital to the development of a
customized and comprehensive action plan. This section of the initial
evaluation provides general demographic and retail/commercial data
on the community and the downtown. Furthermore, key person
interviews were conducted in order to identify issues and opinions
about the downtown. An assessment of downtown was performed
through:
(a) an inventory of the ground floor retail/commercial space and
(b) the physical audit of the downtown.

Evansville is characterized by a stable industrial base that has allowed
the city to be in the privileged position of having a relatively stable,
diversified economy with unemployment rates below the national and
state averages.

While most of the MSAs or regions experienced an increase in their
unemployment rate, Evansville/Henderson was one of the rare exceptions that witnessed a decline in their unemployment rate from January
2000 to January 2001. The Evansville area is home to many diversified
employers, most notably Whirlpool Corporation, which employs over
2,800 people, as well as Mead Johnson Nutritionals, which employs over
2,400 people and Toyota Motor Manufacturing, which employs 1,700
people. Employment in Vanderburgh County is approximately 87,000
of which 15,000 (17%) work in downtown Evansville. Downtown
Evansville is the financial, government, legal, and entertainment center
for the region. The businesses provide a significant amount of the total
downtown employment (especially the financial and legal services).
Major downtown employment categories include:
•

Initial Assessment

Retail sales per capita of $15,827 for the City of Evansville is 60% above
the state level of $9,917. The City of Evansville is well ranked with other
cities in the region in terms of retail sales per capita, which suggests high
levels of inflow, i.e. the residents of Evansville tend to shop within their
own city and the city tends to draw from other areas as well.

Another analysis of retail health for a region is to analyze whether retail
expenditures are leaving the city. The method used compares retail
sales as a percentage of its effective buying income (EBI) with those for
several other markets in the area. EBI is defined as personal income
(based on census estimates) minus personal taxes and social security
payments. It is in other words a measure of disposable income.
The following table sets out the retail sales estimates as a percentage of
total EBI for a number of comparable markets. A particularly low
percentage suggests that a city lacks an adequate retail supply and/or
suffers from a net outflow of retail expenditures. A relatively high
percentage suggests the opposite.

As the previous table illustrates, the City of Evansville is actually
capturing a relatively high percentage of its retail expenditure potential
compared with other cities in the area. The problem for Downtown
Evansville is not that the residents are spending their retail dollars in
Indianapolis or Louisville, it is that they are spending them in the outer
suburbs.

Sales tax in Evansville is 5% and includes retail sales, some final-customer wholesale sales (e.g. Price Club), rental of personal property (e.g.
televisions, cars), food and beverage, lodgings under 30 days. There is
an additional tax on food and beverage of 1%, as well as additional taxes
on lodgings and car rentals.
Using sales tax information from the Indiana Department of Revenue,
total retail sales and eating and drinking sales for Downtown Evansville
as characterized by Zip Code 47708 (Walnut Street, Lloyd Expressway,
Ohio River / Pigeon Creek, and Ninth / Main Streets) are estimated to
be:
Eating and Drinking
$63.5 million
Retail and Rental Sales1
$118.1 million
Total Sales
$181.6 million
Casino Aztar accounts for over 9% of eating and drinking sales in
Downtown Evansville ($6 million) and 5% of retail and rental sales ($5.9
million)2 .
Note: lodging sales have been estimated at $10 million and eliminated from
the retail sales figures.

2C. Downtown Evansville Trade Area Delineation

The visitor approaching Downtown Evansville is distinctly aware of
where the downtown is by the changing direction of the street.

Trade area delineation is a fundamental part of any market analysis.
This section of the report delineates a trade area for Downtown Evansville based on location factors of the site, the natural and man-made
barriers, the direct competitive retail environment, and the travel time
distance.

Travel Time Distance: Fair to Good
There is more development to the eastern part of the City than to the
western edge. While traffic can be congested on a number of routes at
times of the day, most provide efficient access for the downtown.

Factors Influencing the Trade Area Delineation
The trade area is considered to be the geographic region from which a
majority of the sales originate. The remaining sales are inflow, or sales
derived from areas outside of the delineated trade area. The boundaries
of the trade area are influenced by the following factors:
•
the size and type of the existing commercial environment
•
accessibility and visibility
•
travel time features
•
the relative location and strength of competitive retail
facilities
•
natural and man-made barriers.
While each of these factors in isolation has a bearing on the trade area
boundaries, it is their cumulative effect that leads to the definition of the
trade area. The importance of each of these factors was considered for
the trade area boundaries.
The size and type of the existing commercial environment: Limited
Downtown Evansville has very few destination retailers. It is characterized by professional service firms, some antique stores, and lunchtime
cafés and fast food.
Accessibility: Fair
Downtown Evansville has good connections with the Lloyd Expressway,
which serves as the major spine for the City, and the Veterans Parkway.
However, Main Street is blocked off by the Civic Center and a series of
streets that meet at odd angles on the east end. The one-way streets
make it difficult to access downtown directly. One-way streets do not
allow motorists the convenience to drive directly to their destination as
easily as two way streets. In addition, the Lloyd Expressway limits the
number of access points into the downtown from north-south.
Visibility: Good
Main Street is identifiable with the archways at Second Street and
Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard and the pedestrian mall. In addition,
visitors are distinctly aware of the fact that they are downtown by the
taller buildings and the number of government and institutional buildings in the area, especially in the Civic Center. In addition, while most
of the other streets in the City of Evansville are in a north-south grid
pattern, Downtown Evansville’s streets are slightly skewed at an angle.

The Relative Location and Strength of Competitive Retail Facilities:
Competitive
Most retail has sprung up to the eastern end of the city along Green
River Road. There are numerous strip plazas, big box retailers, and
enclosed malls along this road. In addition, there are numerous small
shopping centers located throughout other residential areas including
Northbrook Shopping Center and University Shopping Center.
West Franklin Street, which contains a number of shops in a historic
setting, and Olde Town at Lincoln and Highway 41 both contain a small
cluster of specialty shops and retailers.
The major retail centers include:

Natural and Man-made Barriers
There are a number of natural and man-made barriers affecting the trade
area of the retailers in the downtown:
·•
•·
•
•
•

Ohio River
Lloyd Expressway
Civic Center
Welborn Clinic
Main Street pedestrian mall

All of these limit the number of access points from the rest of the city to
the downtown.
Trade Area Boundaries
The Trade Areas for downtown Evansville can be divided into subareas, which identify their relative importance to the retail/commercial
sales for the downtown. Typically, these areas are labeled as the Immediate Trade Area ( ITA), Primary Trade Area (PTA), and the Secondary
Trade Area (STA). The Total Trade Area is defined as the area from
which 75% of the downtown shoppers live. In addition, a portion of the
sales to the downtown originate from outside the delineated trade area.
This represents “inflow” from undetermined areas outside of the designated trade area. Together, these different sources of retail/commercial
sales represent the total sales to the retailers in the downtown.
Immediate Trade Area
The Immediate Trade Area includes a significant portion of Downtown
Evansville. The area is a 0.5 mile radius of Main Street and Fourth Street
and is within easy walking distance (less than 10 minutes). This includes Mulberry Street to the south, the Ohio River to the west, Market
Street and Lloyd Expressway to the north, and Tenth Street to the east.
Primary Trade Area
The Primary Trade Area for Downtown Evansville comprises the area
contained within 4 miles of the corner of Main Street and Fourth Street,
excluding Kentucky. This includes a significant portion of the built up
area of the city up to Wesselman Park and Evansville State Hospital to
the east and just north of Pigeon Creek to the north. It excludes the
major shopping areas along Green River Road to the east, North Park
Shopping Center on First Avenue to the north, and University Shopping
Center to the west.
Secondary Trade Area
The Secondary Trade Area constitutes the area contained within
Vanderburgh, Posey, Gibson, Warrick counties & Henderson, KY. This
includes all of the cities and towns within each county.

population of 73,109 by the year 2005.
Secondary Trade Area
The Secondary Trade Area, including the Immediate and Primary Trade
Areas, has grown from 310,903 people in 1990 to 330,075 in 2000. Between 2000 and 2005, the population is forecasted to grow by approximately 5,000 to 335,452 for an average annual rate of 0.3%.

Conclusions
Beyond a healthy employment base, the trade area residents for
Downtown Evansville are hard working and family oriented. These
residents provide a solid foundation for quality retail businesses to
build upon.

An audit of the existing retail/commercial businesses in the downtown
was conducted during the last week of March in order to understand
completely the current retail situation in the area. The area studied is
depicted on the map on the following pages and comprises all of the
ground level land uses within the study area. In addition, the retail
audit included the retail in Casino Aztar. While there is office space
within the downtown, only ground level professional services (lawyers,
accountants) space along Main Street was estimated in our inventory.
Social and cultural institutions, hotels, other offices, and government
buildings were noted for their number only. In completing this inventory, the strengths and weaknesses of the downtown’s business mix
were identified. The following are the most salient findings based on
the retail audit:
• In total there are 105 ground level retail/commercial operations in
Downtown Evansville, totaling approximately 390,760 square feet.
• 15% of the stores and 13% of the total square footage is retail-merchandise oriented. A further 5% of the stores and 5% of the total
square footage is retail food/convenience oriented.
• Fifteen properties along Main Street are vacant representing 59,026
square feet of space or 15% vacancy.
• Among the retail/commercial operations inventoried, the following
commodity groups are dominant:
- ground floor professional services
- leisure goods and services, particularly antique stores
- cafés/restaurants
•
There are a number of cafés/restaurants in the downtown representing a total of 69,810 square feet. There are a total of 25 eating and
drinking operations. Most of these operations are fast food operations or cafés serving lunch items.
•
Ground floor professional space occupies a considerable amount of
downtown space (23%). This is far greater than any other commodity category.
•
In terms of personal services, there are a limited number of operations (10), of which four are related to beauty.
•
Rental rates range from $3.50 to $4/square foot on the walkway to
$5 to $7.75 in other places.
· Relatively low vacancy, 5%, for Class A and B office space and
higher rental rates (range $11 to $20/square foot and average
$13.50/square foot).

2E. Retail Mapping
Color coding the different retail/commercial store types in Downtown
Evansville assists in understanding downtown’s strengths and weaknesses in terms of commodity mix and clustering.
The majority of retail operations are situated along Main Street with the
greatest concentration between Second Street and Fourth Street. In
addition, there are a number of retail operations along the west side of
SE Fourth Street.
There is no strong cluster of any grouping. The antique stores are
dispersed along the street and there is no strong concentration of eating
and drinking operations. The retail mix is chopped up due to the large
number of vacant buildings and the high level of professional office
space at the ground floor.

Those consumers who lead or set
fashion trends, buying “the very
latest”; often this is a highly visible
but not very large segment.

Each business was rated according to what type of customer it would
appeal to under each parameter. The customer appeal information is
summarized for downtown Evansville below.
Outlining the character of existing retailing on the dimensions of income
and lifestyle provides a useful tool for the analysis of strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities. It suggests opportunities that are more
specific than store category analysis.

Retail is very limited west of Second Street approaching the Ohio River.
Most empty space is turned over to surface parking lots.

Downtown Evansville covers a large segment of the traditional and
middle-income segment. There is a small percentage of the retail/
commercial operations that is more contemporary than other operations.
In addition, there are some businesses that appeal to lower income
consumers.

Downtown Evansville functions to serve the nearby office workers in
terms of lunch time activity (cafés, and drug stores), with limited leisure
and entertainment in terms of antique stores and performance spaces.

There is opportunity to expand the breadth and depth of retail operations to include more contemporary retail operations that build off of the
natural environment and the performing arts activity.

Office
The office market conditions were reviewed through rental rate reviews
and properties representative of the extremes in the market.
Additionally, discussions were held with area real estate professionals
familiar with the metropolitan office market and in particular
downtown.
The following positioning grid for office space uses occupancy costs / value
and qualities / space appeal as parameters to define the current and
potential office market in downtown Evansville as defined by the
territory of the master plan study area.

Retail
During the retail inventory, the consumer appeal of each retail and
eating/drinking establishment in Downtown Evansville was assessed.
This was done based on two parameters: income/price and fashion/lifestyle.
Income

General income ranges used are
LOW (household income under
$15,000), MODERATE, and UPPER
(household income of $50,000 or
more).

Initial Assessment

There are also 3 lifestyle groups:
Those consumers with conservative
spending values, i.e. in terms of
fashion they tend to wear “classic”
clothing that does not go out of
style quickly.
Consumers who like to keep up-todate and are aware of fashion
trends.

The Evansville office market has changed considerably over the past
several decades with much of the Class B and some Class A space users
moving outside of downtown. Fortunately most major financial
institutions, government bodies, and professional offices continue to
prefer the downtown for their corporate headquarters locations.
The potential for historical building office space, unique loft office space,
or high-rise building office space is much greater in downtown than in
any other part of the city.
With the number of area industries, greater Evansville offers great
potential for a “technology zone” office environment. If the local utility
company [Vectren] combined their technology services & products with

EVANSVILLE DOWNTOWN MASTER PLAN - FINAL REPORT

the City of Evansville and area institutions of higher learning, a strong
foundation for a technology zone could be formulated. The State of
Indiana Department of Commerce could potentially be folded in to offer
support resources as they have done in other communities throughout
the state.

Downtown Housing Positioning Grid

In addition, it stands to reason that the opportunity to attract more
quality office users will increase when potential tenants and building
owners’ confidence in downtown real estate is heightened through the
implementation of the new master plan.

Many businesses are closed when residents shop (i.e. Friday
night, Saturday, Sunday)
Some very strong operators are unique (e.g. Lib’s Candies)
Most retailers are average or lower than average compared to the
competition
Retail operations need to set higher standards in their
execution in order to appeal to customers.

Office
• Downtown is still considered to be a strong office address
• Office rents for class A & B space are among strongest in the
entire market
• Historic buildings provide unique opportunities for loft units
• High speed communications network potential
• Central location to the community for easy access

Housing
The housing market in downtown Evansville was reviewed through
discussions with area real estate representatives, a study on downtown
condominiums prepared by The Danter Company for Center City
Corporation in 2001 entitled, A Condominium and Apartment Analysis in
the City of Evansville, Indiana, and a review of general real estate listing
information for greater Evansville including downtown.

Housing
• Strong neighborhood housing surrounding downtown
• Ohio River as a unique greenway feature for housing amenity
• Young professionals market from which to attract tenants
• Historic buildings provide unique opportunities for empty nester
tenants

The downtown housing positioning grid uses income / value and lifestyle /
features appeal as parameters to define the current and potential housing
market in downtown Evansville.

3. Conclusions and Recommendations
It should be noted this graphic method of defining the positions of
downtown housing is our opinion of the market within the specific
target study area for the master plan project and does not include the
Riverside Historic District.
The potential of future housing in the downtown will increase as
consumer confidence in investing, as well as living in downtown
Evansville, is heightened through the advancement of the new master
plan.
Upper story loft rental and condominiums in historic properties, new infill townhomes, and renovated existing units are all future opportunities
for the units described as being feasible in the Danter study.
We would strongly urge the City of Evansville to not focus on subsidized housing development within the downtown without providing
more market rate units.

The future opportunities for the repositioning of downtown Evansville
will become easier to accomplish as renewed investment in downtown
increases. Investor pessimism will be replaced with a feeling of trust and
confidence in downtown as new public and private projects are introduced under the new focused leadership of The City of Evansville,
Downtown Evansville, Inc. and the Downtown Coalition.
Conclusions
Listed below are key conclusions reached after a review of the market
data for downtown Evansville. These conclusions will be important
considerations when building new relations with investors and developers for reinvestment opportunities.
Good Economic Strength
•
Solid background in the city to build upon
•
Good employment base
•
Fundamental population base — most households are family
edge/suburban oriented not urban oriented (less than 2% of the
households are considered urban and sophisticated)
•
Good central location (see map 3-IV)
Retail
•
Retail operations mostly service the office populations and other
visitors
•
Few are destination
•
Antiques and restaurants are only real clusters of retail use

Opportunities
Based upon our review of the market- related data provided to us, key
person interviews, town meeting input, and our perceptions of the
opportunities for leasing and development, we have listed the high
potential use groups below for downtown Evansville.

EVANSVILLE DOWNTOWN MASTER PLAN - FINAL REPORT

4.1 Town Meeting and S.W.O.T.
Perhaps the most critical step of any planning exercise is the ability of
the consulting/client team to gain the trust and enthusiastic support of
the plan by the community stakeholders and users. Without this, the
ability to move forward becomes difficult at best. In the worst case,
confrontation leads to planner/community frustration and ultimately to
inaction or project abandonment. Enthusiasm built in the early stages of
the plan is lost and much less is accomplished than would otherwise
have been possible.

planning team members. Issues and opportunities arising from stakeholder interviews and the downtown audit were then presented to the
steering committee.
On April 19, 2001 The Downtown Master Plan Town Meeting was held at
The Centre ballroom. Mayor Lloyd and Mike Hinton steering committee
chairman and Executive Vice President, Old National Bank, presented
opening remarks to an impressive showing of approximately 400 participants representing a broad cross-section of the community. The full list
of participants is included in the appendix.
After brief introductions and discussion of the Master Plan’s framework,
process, and schedule we presented preliminary findings in the following areas:

Evansville

their

findings

By engaging the community up front in an interactive process we are
able to use citizen generated ideas and concerns as the foundation of a
redevelopment program and design platform from which the planning
team can apply its expertise and build upon the basic ideas. Plan recommendations address specific community concerns. Planning outcomes
are readily embraced and momentum generated at the start continues
through the implementation of the plan.
On March 6, 2001 the planning team leaders convened in Evansville for
the first of several ongoing visits. At that time and through the following
six weeks the planning team met with Mayor Lloyd, members of the
Downtown Master Plan Steering Committee, government officials, and
community stakeholders to discuss the broad range of physical, cultural,
and economic factors at work in downtown Evansville, the City, and the
region. Meeting sessions were conducted with individuals and groups.
Each session focused on specific topics relevant to the master plan.
Simultaneous to the focus group meetings, the planning team conducted
an extensive inventory and audit of downtown’s urban environments,
architecture, land uses, transportation systems, real estate and market
conditions. Preliminary findings were developed and tested among

At the conclusion of the presentation attendees were asked to participate
in a survey of Evansville’s Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and
Threats, (S.W.O.T.) Upon dividing into groups of approximately twenty
participants were asked to offer their ideas on the challenges and
opportunities before the downtown and the entire community of
Evansville. Participants were asked to be brief in the interest of gaining
the widest possible survey of ideas in the hour allotted for the exercise.
As groups completed each challenge statement results were recorded
and consolidated in the ballroom.
At the conclusion of the survey participants were asked to reconvene in
the ballroom in order to rank their top three issues. Each participant was
provided with three adhesive, colored dots and informed that they could
place them next to the most important issue(s) Strength, Weakness,
Opportunity, or Threat. The results of the survey are listed below. Total
votes for each issue are indicated in parenthesis.

Simply defined, an illustrative vision package graphically illuminates a
community’s shared vision of its future. Vision packaging assists a city
in discovering its distinctiveness and provides images detailing where
that city wants to go. This illustrative vision package provides a collection of drawings, reference images, diagrams, and data formulated from
the shared beliefs of the downtown stakeholders. While this is a process
and not a policy-making mechanism, the illustrative format of the plan
more forcefully imprints goals on the minds of the intended audience.
Participants

What Threats stand in the way of allowing these improvements to
occur?:

4.2 Design Charrette Process
The word “charrette”, which means “hand cart” in French, originated
with young architecture students who would work intensely on the final
details of a project. The term was derived as an analogy between the
design process and the speed and sound of the wheels rolling over the
cobblestone streets.

On Thursday, April 19 planning team members assembled to prepare
for the Town Meeting and Charrette and set up a temporary design
studio on Main Street. Professionals from Kinzelman Kline Gossman, TDA
Illinois, Claire Bennett Associates, Urban Marketing Collaborative, and Brownstone Design, were joined by Renee Oldham, Executive Director Main
Street Richmond and sixteen Graduate landscape architecture students
from Ohio State University under the guidance of Professor James Hiss,
MA, ASLA.
In the three weeks prior to the charrette Professor Hiss and his students
focused their class time exclusively on Evansville. Ohio State students
conducted extensive inventories and research and developed CADD
maps and three-dimensional imagery that was used at the charrette. We
appreciate the value of the time and effort contributed by Professor Hiss
and his class and feel fortunate to have had them associated with the
planning effort.
Both students and professionals acted as facilitators, runners, and scribes
for the S.W.O.T. inventory portion of the town meeting. At the conclusion of the meeting, students, professionals, and members of the steering
committee met at Turoni’s on North Main to discuss the results of the
meeting.
Early Friday morning 22 professionals and students gathered at the
Main Street studio for a team meeting over coffee, and a review of
preliminary findings from the downtown audit, stakeholder interviews,
town meeting and S.W.O.T. ranking. After a discussion and review of

Resulting in an illustrative package, the charrette format is our preferred
methodology because it engages both the public and private sectors,
en-masse, to gather community commitment and consensus. When
complete, an illustrated charrette package can be utilized in ongoing
downtown planning discussions as well as in business recruitment and
promotional activities.
In providing a strategy for downtown redevelopment, an illustrative
charrette “vision” package can be a far more comprehensive tool for
fostering economic growth within the downtown than the more
traditional land-planning/zoning consultant approach.

During the late night studio session a substantial amount of time and

Teams discussed strategy and goals and then set out for walking tours

proficient with CADD and graphic applications provided technical
assistance to each group. Renee Oldham and her group worked with
Center City Corporation, Evansville Downtown Development Corporation,
Metro Development, etc. to list familiar organizational barriers, chart
potential development partners and discuss potential strategies to
leverage community-wide strengths into a cohesive downtown revitalization effort.
Craig Gossman, KKG, orchestrated the activities of each of the various
groups to focus attention on the town meeting results and coordinate
the overall concept direction. Professionals including Eric Brown, Brian
Kinzelman, Clete Benken, Ross Tilghman, and Joann Green served as
team leaders for the student groups.
The afternoon was spent developing and testing design concepts and
development strategies. By 5:30 P.M. most of the wall space in the
studio was taken with inventory mapping, design concepts, and outlines of redevelopment strategies for downtown organization, traffic
circulation, and commercial revitalization. Members of the steering
committee including Mayor Lloyd, Joan David, Ken Robinson, Bill
Gaisser, and others arrived in the late afternoon to review concepts and
offer their perspective on the work in progress.
Following dinner, the team leaders reconvened in the studio for work
into the night and scheduled the next days events.

Early Saturday morning the design team reconvened to continue development of design concepts and prepare final graphics for presentation.
While most of the time spent involved the articulation and refinement of
design concepts, the investigation of traffic and parking issues lead to
some curious discoveries related to the Riverside Drive improvements
and the available supply of downtown parking.
Riverside Drive:
On Friday afternoon we received a copy of proposed construction plans
for Riverside Drive which we reviewed in detail. While all agreed that
the improvements at the riverfront would have a very positive effect on
the area, we were surprised to discover that left turning movements
from Riverside into downtown would be limited to Court and Walnut
Streets. This is a real concern in that we strongly believe that restricted
traffic movements have negative impacts on downtown development
and activity in urban areas like downtown Evansville.
A basic principle for downtown transportation is that turning options
should be kept open at all possible locations. Downtowns host a wide
range of activities so people should be given great latitude in their
ability to navigate downtown. Another important consideration is that
public access to key resources such as scenic drives and parks should be
as easy as possible.1 At the time of this writing, Mayor Lloyd has
already taken steps to raise and address this issue and it is our hope that
access to Main Street and other important cross streets will be preserved.

Excerpt from Ross Tilghman letter to Mayor Lloyd, May 2, 2001.

At the town meeting and over the course of the stakeholder interviews
we heard a handful of business owners describe their concerns over the
limited availability of parking in downtown Evansville. After several
visits to the area it became apparent to us that there was more than an
ample aggregate amount of parking to meet demand. On Saturday, we
set out to test this observation. First, we proceeded to map all surface
and structured parking areas in downtown. All surface parking was
shaded red to stand out from the map. Second, we asked several
students to fan out from the intersection of Fourth and Main and walk to
the edges of downtown. These students were instructed to track their
location relative to the studio at intervals of 5, 10, and 15 minutes.
The results of the exercise confirmed our initial observations. The
parking inventory showed red shading to the extent that we termed it
the “Blood Map”. The walking radius map demonstrates that Evansville
has a very walkable downtown and that it’s attractions can be
conveniently accessed from just about anywhere when the distance
between attractions is not too great. While vehicular access and visibility
are extremely important, it is the density and diversity of a vibrant
downtown (or district) that captivates the visitor and makes the extra

walk worth making. It is a scene that repeats itself minute by minute
and day by day in urban settings where complimentary entertainment,
dining retail, office, and housing alternatives, are clustered in settings
that offer a uniqueness and sense of place. This genuine character is
what shopping center developers have tried to manufacture in the
suburban shopping mall.
As the end of the day approached, most of the team’s goals had been
met. By 6:00, as members of the steering committee arrived, three days
and approximately 250 staff hours worth of work was posted in the
studio. As is always the case with a strategic planning charrette (as we
know it), at some point you need to put the design markers away and
get the ideas in front of the groups and individuals that can turn them
into tangible success stories. Based on several of the comments from the
steering committee we believe that the transformation of downtown
may already be underway. Through the continued leadership of the
City of Evansville, Downtown Evansville Incorporated and an ever
expanding group of downtown advocates, downtown Evansville can
evolve into the vibrant metropolitan center of the tri-state region.

migration patterns throughout the area. When downtown did not take
proactive measures to solidify its position as the retail and commercial
center of the area, a slow but deliberate shift in where people shop and
conduct business occurred. This coupled with new housing developments on the east and west side of town, and pocket convenience commercial areas within neighborhoods, a staggering blow was dealt to
downtown leaving it as a center for regional government, financial
services, and corporate offices.
The exception to the overview described above is the collection of cultural & entertainment facilities located in the downtown area.
Evansville’s situation is not a unique development phenomenon. Research shows that while many communities large and small have experienced outward growth, cultural centers have not always followed. This
condition occurs primarily because private development, the nucleus of
sprawl, cannot find ways to financially support performing arts centers,
libraries, and cultural sites in their development plans.
However, what is unique with Evansville’s situation is the quantity and
level of quality of the cultural & entertainment venues located within
downtown.
Cultural activity centers such as The Centre, Victory Theatre, Casino
Aztar, Evansville Museum of Arts, Histroy and Sciene, Civic Theatre,
Rivers Bend Playhouse, Koch Planetarium, Railroad Museum, Reitz
Home Museum, Willard Library, Public Library, YMCA & YWCA,
Soldiers & Sailors Memorial Auditorium, Vanderburgh County Courthouse, the riverfront, and historic public market continue to be the
preferred sites for significant cultural events.

4.3. Strategic Vision
Reposition Downtown Evansville As The Regional Cultural Center
The economic and community development of Evansville has contributed greatly to the entire region. However, the impact on downtown has
not been as positive as evidenced by the lack of real estate development
and reinvestment.
As Evansville has grown over the years, commercial corridors have
developed in response to new housing developments and consumer

1. Develop Three Distinctive Downtown Districts
The physical size of downtown and the significant loss of historic structures over the years has contributed to a disjointed urban environment
that lacks cohesiveness and user friendliness. This condition is exacerbated with the disorienting effect of the old downtown historic street
grid shift and the visual confusion when entering downtown from the
Lloyd Expressway and the southeast side of town. Consequently, most
visitors are uncomfortable about their orientation in the downtown area.
The idea surrounding the three district concept is to develop distinctive
personalities and characteristics for each of the districts:

Central Business
District

Civic/Cultural
District

Entertainment
District

The creation of the three districts provides the new downtown coalition
with a redevelopment model to use when guiding the downtown repositioning effort. When developed, the districts will provide visitors with a
clear understanding of these special areas of downtown.

Exceptions to this would be the activities that take place in Roberts
Stadium, The Mesker Zoo & Botanical Gardens, university campuses, in
the area city/ county parks, and at several local cinemas.

Each district would have a unique personality created by carefully
crafted design guidelines for storefronts, facades, lighting and signing.
Streetscape improvements would be designed to reinforce the district
identity while acting as a common thread woven through all three
districts.

The time is now to capitalize on this strength by investing into both
existing and additional cultural arts facilities downtown to become the
premier cultural center for the entire region.

A recruitment initiative spearheaded by Downtown Evansville, Inc.
would focus on assisting landlords to secure those tenants who relate to
the district identity and retailing clustering opportunities.

Long-term benefits will include a signature identity for downtown, a
more stable night time user rate, higher probability of becoming a
preferred
convention city, more entertainment options conveniently located to
each other providing opportunities for successful downtown hotels,
restaurants, unique shops, and supportive retail.

EVANSVILLE DOWNTOWN MASTER PLAN - FINAL REPORT

2. Reintroduce Evansville to Downtown Living
Although there is always a desire to bring new businesses into the core
urban areas of our towns by those involved in the revitalization process,
successful redevelopment of downtown Evansville will not be fully
realized until new market housing is made available. Quality housing in
the downtown will allow more people to live downtown and thus
increase the demand for higher quality retail, eating establishments and
other services.
Demographics for Evansville indicate that young professionals and
portions of the aging population are likely candidates for quality downtown market housing. Living downtown is an attractive option to these
population segments for several reasons:
•
•
•

Conveniently located next to their work, restaurants and
services
Adjacent to cultural activity centers
High value of housing product for the money compared to
the rest of the market

A pilot upper story loft development project could help to demonstrate
that Evansville is ready for downtown housing, however the town’s
growth and demand for more suburban housing developments suggests
that renovated upper story apartments is not necessarily the only type of
housing to consider. Discussions with area homebuilder might suggest
that the market may be more attractive for new townhomes and in-fill
housing than historic property rehabilitation projects. (see section 4.4)
Historic property rehabilitation projects can be very attractive investment opportunities when one takes advantage of the federal and state
historic tax credit programs. Multi-story older buildings tend to present
the developer with handicap access (ADA) issues not normally encountered with single story construction. However, by taking advantage of
the alternative building code specifically created for older property
rehabilitation, elevators and other costly improvements can sometimes
be avoided.

Urban Analysis Opportunities

A significantly positive impact will be felt downtown once a commitment to developing new and rehabilitated housing in downtown Evansville is made. By introducing young professionals and portions of the
aging population to the advantages of living downtown, a quiet reinvestment into downtown properties and businesses will likely follow.

The large graphic plates on the following pages have been developed to
provide the reader with a vision of the overall master plan and selected
areas that focus on redevelopment opportunities. We have organized
these drawings around what the community felt were important
physical areas of downtown. The resultant illustrations are important
ideas that were a part of the numerous meetings and brainstorming
exercises conducted with the community throughout the master plan
development process. The final master plan was reviewed by our team
to ascertain ideas which were generated during the town meeting and
then incorporated into the downtown vision.

A coordinated graphic wayfinding system would include the development of a
family of downtown logos such as the convention and visitor bureau logo
represented here.

Future redevelopment of the park could accommodate daily cafe seating,
lunchtime events, and a stage area with ampitheatre style event seating.
Design theme inspiration for the park could include reference to the steamboat
industry or early Evansville commodities and industry.

“Main Street” parks such as the Oxford, Ohio Uptown Park can provide a
prominent community focal point and gathering space that attracts evening
and weekend visitors.

1. The restoration and adaptive reuse of the Britz Building
provides a fine example of the ways in which other Main
Street historic buildings can be adapted to uses which
contribute to the vitality of the central business district.
2. Although facade alterations have concealed the original historic quality and detail of a number of Main
Street buildings, most if not all buildings have the potential to be rehabilitated with more sensitive
architectural treatments that restore an intimate pedestrian scale and balance the scale and relationships
between ground floor storefronts and the upper stories.
3. Massed tree plantings that obscure strorefronts, limited visibility and a lack of on-street parking are
issues that must be addressed in order to lure operators of retail, dining, and entertainment venues.
4. Alleyway connections to off-Main parking areas should be enhanced to be more inviting to pedestrians.
5. Wide pedestrian spaces along the existing streetscape could be adapted to accommodate contained cafe
seating or limited on-street parking.

6 - 9. Low level landscaping, furnishings, and architectural features can be utilized to create an appropriate
separation and comfortable relationship between cars and pedestrians.
10 & 11. Restored traffic flow along Main Street could promote discovery of downtown venues,
accommodate on-street parking, and contribute to the return of a 24 hour vibrancy.

12 - 17. The size, placement, and character of signage should compliment the architectural style of “Main
Street” buildings. Signage should not obscure significant architectural features but may be considered to
enliven blank or featureless wall elevations. Blade, window, and wall mounted signage should be scaled to
the size of the building entry. Object signs can help animate Main Street.

5.1 The Vision
With a common vision of what the future of the downtown should hold
for the city of Evansville, both the private and public sectors can work
effectively towards achievable goals.

Based on extensive downtown key person interviews, market research,
and input from the community charrette, there is a clearer vision of what
downtown Evansville will be in the future. Almost all stakeholders are
excited about the possibilities in their downtown and envision a very
positive future.

Retail
Because of Evansville’s location and downtown’s physical relationship
to the rest of the city, the largest target market will be primarily the
primary trade area residents and workers in the downtown Evansville
area. Additionally, retailing in downtown Evansville will focus on the
visitor/tourist market coming to downtown for Casino Aztar, conventions, and other events.
If additional entertainment and cultural activity centers are developed in
downtown it stands to reason that additional retail establishments could
be expected to take advantage of the increased traffic and trade opportunities.

To create a dynamic urban center. It will be based on a blend of unique
shopping, entertainment, social, cultural, and service experiences that are
distinct to that of the competition in the region. The core of this vision will
be based on Evansville’s historic architecture, its location adjacent to the
Ohio River, its vibrant street life, and its healthy businesses. It will instill
pride and ownership for the workers and residents, and a sense of admiration
from visitors who choose to come to the area. There will be three primary
activity nodes or districts: Civic/Cultural District, where government and
cultural activities are focused, the Central Business District, which will be
a business services and lifestyle district, and the Entertainment District
centered around Casino Aztar and the proposed baseball park.

1. Target Market
In analyzing the retail, housing, & office target markets for downtown
Evansville, clearly the isolationism of the city in relationship to the
region is a major factor because of the limited population growth of the
region.
The development activities in the housing and office markets appear to
be driven by local residents and businesses desiring to move to higher
quality facilities or locations within the city, not necessarily driven by
the influx of new residents or new businesses to the area.
However, the strength of the local economy has fueled ongoing development in all three market segments as evidenced by new housing developments & subdivisions, the mainstream retail developments on the east
and west sides, and the suburban office buildings continuing to be
developed.

Housing
Housing is a critical component of any downtown revitalization program. Currently, less than 1000 residents [less than 1% of the city population] reside in downtown Evansville.
In July of 2000, DEI (formerly CCC), Center City Corporation, contracted with The Danter Co. to develop a market research study for
condominium and apartments in downtown. The results indicated that
sufficient demand already exists for a minimum of 44 market rate
apartments and 12 moderately priced condominiums.
As the revitalization plan is implemented and the image of downtown
Evansville begins to improve, our consulting team predicts housing in
downtown will become more desirable by area residents.
The City of Evansville understands the importance of housing in and
around downtown as evidenced by the commitment to develop a housing trust fund. Downtown housing offers many long- term benefits as it
will encourage other forms of economic development nearby. For example, increased residential population downtown will heighten demand for a variety of retail, food, restaurant, and home product related
services, thus providing opportunities for new or relocated businesses to
open in the city center.
Below we have identified the immediate and long- term opportunities
for housing in downtown Evansville.

Serious attention should be placed on business retention efforts to make
certain these strong economic anchors remain downtown. At the same
time, a serious recruitment campaign should be undertaken to introduce
new potential businesses to downtown in an attempt to strengthen this
important downtown use.
Identifying development opportunities for innovative business recruitment would allow downtown to take advantage of its strengths by
offering a product not found elsewhere in the market.

Our consulting team is recommending a special task force be formulated
to look into this growing phenomenon and identify local business
partners who could offer guidance, resources, and insight into the
development of an urban technology zone to encourage the recruitment
of these types of businesses. This office environment could utilize existing buildings and encourage the development of new in-fill buildings as
demand grows.
Finding developers to explore loft office environments, and tenant
opportunities such as business incubators, downtown classrooms for
area universities [i.e. art studio space, business administration center,
downtown laboratory for geography & urban studies programs], private
education, or tech programs in hospitality & gaming industries [important skilled training for downtown focus] all bring unique development
approaches to downtown.

Learning centers

The office market in downtown Evansville continues to be the driving
force behind the entire micro-economy of downtown. The downtown
has historically served as the area’s financial and government center.
However, as Evansville has grown and downtown has experienced a
physical decline, office development outside of downtown has emerged,
placing pressure on downtown to hold the position in the marketplace it
has learned to expect.
Fortunately, Vectren Corporation, American General Finance, the Evansville Courier Press, Welborn Clinic, St. Mary’s Hospital, the area’s
leading banks, and numerous professional offices and community
service organizations have continued to place value on a downtown
address.

•

Build an enabling organization to carry out the commercial requirements to revitalize the downtown
The strength of any revitalization program is based on having an
effective organization. The organization creates a broad-based
partnership among public and private sector interests to provide
leadership and resources to propel and maintain the revitalization
goals. A commitment should be made to merge Center City Corporation (CCC) and the Evansville Downtown Development Corporation (EDDC) into a new downtown focused entity [i.e. Downtown
Evansville, Inc. (DEI)]. Increased work between the EDDC and CCC
is required to ensure revitalization work is carried out in the most
effective and efficient manner (i.e. understand and share resources,
coordinated marketing efforts, and targeted recruitment activity
among others).

•

Ensure the basics are in place
Downtown Evansville has a good range of neighborhood-serving
commercial operations that are servicing the downtown businesses,
office workers, and local population. Among others, these include a
drug store, personal services (banks, dentists, and barbers), and a
convenience store. These types of goods and services need to be
reinforced to ensure their strength in the downtown. Many of these
retailers need to improve their operations in order to stay competitive.

The collection of large historic buildings downtown should be considered to be a unique asset in developing new office space not easily found
in the greater Evansville area. In particular is the increased demand for
flexible high-tech space for the wave of e-commerce businesses interested in locating in urban areas around the country.

Short - Long Term ( 1- 10 yrs.)

Office

committing to an overall plan, the people of Evansville will gain a
competitive edge over other development areas and cities. Businesses
will flourish, property values will grow, and the city will enjoy increased tax revenues and a vibrant downtown.
The principles behind the revitalization of downtown Evansville are:

G o v e r n m ent O ffices

2. Principles of Revitalization
There are no overnight miracles in downtown revitalization. However,
there are incremental steps that lead to significant progress in a relatively short time. Many of the projects proposed in the entire master
plan will take several years until they come to fruition. By that time, the
downtown Evansville environment will be drastically different than it is
today. The retail environment should be flexible enough to accommodate these changes as they progress over the next 5 to 20 years. By

Having the breadth of quality neighborhood-serving operations in an
easy-to-use environment will help to build loyal customer traffic in the
downtown especially along Main Street. Some of the basic goods and
service stores required include:
- Convenience stores
- Dry cleaners
- Drug stores
- Banking services
- Insurance, real estate
- Hardware
- Travel
- Photo store
- Hair and beauty salon
- Medical/dental/optometrist
- Video rental
- Stationery/card store

EVANSVILLE DOWNTOWN MASTER PLAN - FINAL REPORT

•

Build off strengths
• Like any marketed consumer product or brand, downtown
Evansville has several important commercial attributes, namely:
• safe, comfortable environment
• high concentration of historically significant buildings
• adjacent to Ohio River
• sizeable, stable workforce
• proximity of Casino Aztar
• key commodities: convenience goods and services, restaurants/
eating establishments, and antique stores
• new housing initiatives and growing downtown population
• professional services
It will be important for downtown Evansville to capitalize on these
strengths. Of particular importance, downtown Evansville should
build off of its key strengths of the office market and the potential
visitor market to expand its offerings of restaurants/eating places,
convenience goods and services (e.g. book stores). Of particular
interest are the cultural developments planned for the area along
Second Street as well as those near Fourth Street. This will have
positive spin-off towards building stronger restaurant and leisurebased products (especially wholesale/retail operations such as
sporting goods, home-decor/improvement) in the downtown as well
as attracting more residents and visitors. In the long-term, a commitment should be made to reconnect Main Street with North Main
Street.

•

However, in the short and medium-term, professional firms that
support the business offices (e.g. lawyers, accountants) may occupy
space on Main Street in order to fill space with the caveat that these
spaces will be converted to retail at a future date to accommodate
increased consumer spending in the Downtown. This means that
buildings being used by offices must maintain physical aspects that
make them useful for retail (e.g. large windows and clear not
smoked glass). As new projects develop (e.g. the new ballpark,
expanded Casino Aztar) retail operations should be strengthened
and ground level office space converted back to retail operations.
Other retail/service businesses (e.g. banks) should be encouraged to
build new buildings or restore old buildings so they enhance the
retail feel of the street.

• Linkages are critical
As mentioned, in the long term, linkages will be critical to creating a
cohesive downtown environment whereby businesses work
together to realize the synergy created by one another and mutually
support one another.

Start with a geographical concentration
Revitalization activity and investment should start by growing from
blocks of retail strength and building these up to impressive levels
rather than trying to do a little bit everywhere or by trying to fix the
big problems first. Strong clusters of similar stores build critical
mass.

There are numerous initiatives that will work toward building
stronger ties. These include:

At present the core retail is located along Main Street between
Second Street and Martin Luther King, Jr. Blvd. There is also a
developing node of retail near Casino Aztar that could become very
strong should Downtown Evansville secure a ballpark and/or arena
in the area. However, at present the critical mass of strong retailers
is not present in either retail node.

•

In addition, retail could develop along Fourth Street as a connector
to the downtown from the Lloyd Expressway gateway and east to
the historic residential neighborhood. However, Fourth Street will
primarily attract neighborhood convenience retail operations to the
southeast and wholesale/retail operations to the northwest.
In the long-term, the “core area” (Main Street) should be preserved
for retail. Professional firms should be discouraged from locating on

6

the ground level in this core area. While professional services are
critical to the downtown by generating retail traffic, supplying
business services to nearby offices, and providing an invaluable
source of downtown customers; their presence at the ground level in
downtown is not conducive to good retailing.

Strategic Action Plan

•

•

Opening up Main Street to traffic by connecting Main Street
with North Main Street (either with improved signage and circulation efforts around the Civic Center or by establishing a direct
link through the Civic Center).
The reconfiguration of Fourth Street to provide easier circulation
and wayfinding to and from downtown Evansville.
Gateway signage and wayfinding features that will direct people
easily to the downtown.

While commercial continuity between the downtown and the new
gateways will bring the downtown into focus for the city & region,
improved signage, streetscaping, banners, and special events will work
towards effectively linking them. The newly combined EDDC and CCC,
casino, offices, convention center, and other entertainment developments
(e.g. Victory Theatre, proposed ballpark, proposed arena, etc.) must
continue to work together for each other’s mutual benefit to bring the
retail, eating and drinking, and service functions of the downtown in
closer connection especially through coordinated marketing campaigns.

•

Partnerships are critical
Downtown revitalization will not happen solely within the public
sector. Public/private partnerships are required to ensure that the
shared vision for downtown Evansville becomes a reality. Partnerships can vary from the shared understanding and cooperation
between private investors and the city/downtown organizations,
with respect to building uses (e.g. banks should ensure that their
ground level is pedestrian-friendly by not building large impenetrable fortresses and using clear glass instead of smoked glass) to
coordinated marketing campaigns, linking specific businesses to key
target markets, to sharing the cost of downtown improvements.

3. Organizational Strategy
•

Combine EDDC and CCC [Completed newly formed DEI]
Combining the existing organizations into a single organization
would be the most effective organizational strategy.
While there are a number of groups concerned about downtown
revitalization and economic development, forming a tighter coalition
of the EDDC and the CCC will likely achieve the goals identified
elsewhere in this report. Each of these organizations can make a
potential contribution; but only if they unite in sharing resources to
accomplish the tasks ahead.
The new organization will capture the energy now apparent in
Evansville. Downtown Evansville will be best served by a highly
focused, mission-driven, entrepreneurial organization that quickly
secures the support and loyalty of the downtown business community and, in addition, the support of private sector.
Since the time of this writing, the merger described above has taken
place. EDDC & CCC have been combined into a single new organization, Downtown Evansville, Inc.

New Downtown Coalition
As DEI, the City of Evansville, Vanderburgh County, and others come
together to champion the Downtown Evansville revitalization effort, a
new downtown coalition will be formulated to bring community-wide
leadership to the forefront and establish new goals and expectations for
downtown.
This new partnership will draw its constituency from the entire region
and will include members of the following organizations as well as
others not known at this time.

EVANSVILLE DOWNTOWN MASTER PLAN - FINAL REPORT

•

•

A newly founded downtown coalition will bring greater Evansville organizations together to
formulate and implement priorities of the Strategic Action Plan (see section 5.3).

•
In addition to the broad based local coalition discussed above, a long
term goal for DEI should be to reach out further through the Convention
& Visitors Bureau to tap regional tourism opportunities. By developing
strong relationships with regional communities such as New Harmony,
Owensboro, Henderson, Princeton, etc. a broader, more attractive
message can be packaged and marketed allowing all communities to
benefit from the increased tourism.

•
Organizational Characteristics, Structure, and Resources

•

•

The downtown coalition must have support that is both broad
and deep. Support must be secured from both the public &
private community, but in particular from the private area
businesses, corporations, and institutions. It is imperative that
DEI support be gained from major corporations & institutions
that to date have not felt compelled to be involved in the
businessing of downtown Evansville.
The downtown coalition must develop and articulate a vision for
downtown Evansville that is compelling yet realistic. The vision
must be sufficiently compelling to generate and maintain a
strong sense of commitment and excitement, but it must be
believable – that is, people must recognize and understand that
the various elements not only can be accomplished, but also can
be accomplished in a reasonable amount of time with resources
that can be obtained.

• Exercising non-jurisdictional power

DEI must attract new board members to complement the existing
DEI board of directors to gain further credibility in the community. Credibility, particularly in the early stages of the organization, is essential. DEI will be seeking to make changes in downtown that heretofore have seemed out of reach. Persistence and
commitment are necessary because development is not an overnight process. Competency and leadership are also essential; the
organization’s leadership must have, and must be perceived as
having, the requisite skills and ability to attract others to the
cause.
DEI must have competent, energetic, and creative staff to provide support and management of the vision. Leading the revitalization of a Downtown is not a nine-to-five job. Furthermore, in
a small organization, staff must possess both general organizational skills and a certain level of technical skills and knowledge.
The DEI staff appears to have dedicated and skilled personnel.
However, now that the merger has taken place it will be critical
that key positions of responsibility be identified and carefully
assigned.
DEI must have the capacity to do things. Acting as an advocate
for downtown is important, but not sufficient to accomplish the
tasks at hand. At the same time, it should be recognized that the
downtown organization probably will not have sufficient
resources to accomplish everything it sets out to do. It will have
to establish partnerships and alliances with other organizations,
both public and private, to leverage its resources.
The downtown coalition and in particular DEI must inspire
commitment and action by catalyzing, energizing and facilitating
others to create visions and solve problems. Strong community
based leadership is critical to downtown repositioning success.
Communities dominated by one family, one corporation, one
political leader, or one industry often lack the flexibility to react
to new opportunities.

•

DEI must instill collaborative leadership in its staff and Board of
Directors. Collaborative leadership “requires a community to get
beyond single issue and single organizations.”

•

Collaborative partnership components:

• Coalition building, compromise, judgement/political
skills
• Networking
Building linkages beyond traditional relation ships,
whatever it takes to get the job done.

The power of ideas, power of understanding, how
different systems can work, the power of media and
public opinion
• Institution building
Constructing new systems, building problem solving
capacity into them and recruiting talent to operate
them
• Flexibility
The ability to react as circumstances change and
opportunities emerge
• Dialogue
Discovering new areas of agreement and opportuni
ties to talk and listen; problems require more shared
understanding than in the past

4. Commercial Strategy
The downtown coalition will be responsible for implementing the
recommendations of the commercial strategy of which DEI and DMD
will play critical roles. The commercial strategy for downtown Evansville will shift in the short-term to the long-term. The shift will center on
increasing customer traffic in the downtown and then recruiting new
businesses that can benefit from this expanded traffic as numerous
developments are completed in the downtown.
The short-term strategy for downtown revitalization will focus on
fulfilling the needs of the office workers and downtown residents. As
visitation numbers and residency increase, and slated projects are
completed, the long-term work should concentrate on developing an
identifiable retail role that is more akin to a lifestyle district with a
variety of eating and drinking establishments, antiques and collectibles,
and other leisure retailers.
Marketing
Short Term
The DEI marketing committee’s primary responsibility will be to organize promotional programs to attract shoppers, workers, residents,
students, and outside visitors. This will be accomplished through the
following initiatives.
• Help build positive images – Marketing should have a broad mandate to build positive programs and images, re: easy access, safety,
convenience, historic setting, Ohio River, cleanliness, enjoyable
shopping, well-managed stores, etc. Regional residents do visit the
downtown for work and business services but the area needs help to
convert single-purpose visitors into multi-purpose visitors (e.g. go to
the bank and have lunch). While marketing should have a broad
Strategic Action Plan

7

EVANSVILLE DOWNTOWN MASTER PLAN - FINAL REPORT

mandate, the marketing communications must be highly focused on
specific target markets of the downtown (e.g. Casino Aztar, convention delegates, office workers, residents).
• Begin with both umbrella communications (e.g. general good
news on downtown Evansville) and the targeted facts to
select groups.
• Continue good news to the public regarding new develop
ments, changes, and successes through the Downtown Pulse
and other regional publications, such as Evansville Living
magazine.
• Continually update the web site to highlight special events,
historical institutions, commercial buildings, and homes in
the area. Although DEI has combined, the CCC & EDDC
have merged into one organization, we are recommending
that the web site be divided between those seeking informa
tion on investing in downtown and those who want to visit.
There should be quicker links for special events, available
commercial sites, downtown demographics/information,
etc. and they should be put up front
• See downtown Houston’s web site as an example.
www.Downtowndistrict.org

Other possible events
• As Downtown Evansville builds more success as an entertainment venue, an arts festival where artists of all kinds,
young and old, are invited to showcase their art. This could
include converting vacant stores into temporary galleries,
using restaurants to showcase art, having poetry readings in
different Downtown businesses, posting poems on posts,
painting the streets, film festivals, and staging theater or local
singing groups/bands in the Downtown. This event easily
ties in with nearby college students and could draw people
from outside the trade area if marketed successfully.

Strategic Action Plan

•

•

Commercial retention activities — Before developing new businesses, downtown Evansville needs to protect and enhance the
existing retailers. These businesses generate traffic and attract
people from outside the trade area. The new business association
will be able to supply retention services through the following
means:
• Making educational tools (including slides, videos, guide
lines, and books) available to downtown businesses.
• Continuing to offer seminars on topics such as merchandis
ing, effective use of window displays, how to offer good
customer service, how to develop a mail order business, etc.
• Making demographic information available so that busi
nesses can target their promotions to customers better.
• Continuing to provide businesses with networking opportu
nities by holding monthly meetings. These meetings can be
enhanced by allowing merchants to take turns holding meet
ings in their stores, which gives downtown retailers the
opportunity to learn about each other’s businesses.
• Supporting cross-promotional efforts e.g. a dining guide to
downtown Evansville.
• Encouraging retailers to stay open longer on weekdays and
weekends.
Communicating/sharing the retail vision — Holding regular briefing meetings with property/business owners and city officials on the
state of the commercial real estate market and encouraging dialogue
regarding the retail vision for Downtown Evansville will help in
terms of pursuing municipal, state, and federal support programs as
well as private business support (e.g. Casino Aztar).
Retail operations need to set higher standards in their execution in
order to appeal to customers.

Existing Business Retention

•

There are numerous events promoted by the DEI in Evansville at
present. These include:
Event

Using the retail mix noted in Section 5. 2.1, targeting restaurants, antiques and collectibles, and leisure businesses (wholesale/retail), DEI
should develop a committee of interested businesses, individuals,
organizations/institutions, real estate people, and City staff and officials
to work toward:

The following are some promotional and on-the-street images of Des
Moines, Iowa’s highly successful arts festival.

Make attractions and events retailer-friendly – downtown’s calendar
of events should be planned on a merchandising & entertainment
basis. It should focus on specific, high-priority, shopper segments
and merchandise buying seasons, with the emphasis on building
shopping traffic for the various retail businesses. Targeting special
events, such as the Riverfest, to the downtown’s target market will
ensure that when people come downtown for the events that they
will stay longer and shop more. Special events that do not tie into
the target market may be successful for the event but the retailers
will not experience the possible spin-offs. In addition, events held at
Casino Aztar should be linked (physically e.g. trolley, carriage rides,
etc. and event-wise) with the downtown businesses as much as
possible.

•

Building Retail Assets

For the events already held in Evansville, and the new proposed events
it is important to prioritize them. Start by planning one additional event
per year while remembering to link them to promotions already held in
the downtown and to always include a merchandising component (e.g.
restaurant specials and retailer cross promotions that tie together
Riverfest and summer vacation). Once these events are running well,
other events may be added or reorganized.

New Business Recruitment

• Develop an information package to target new local and regional
businesses. The information package should include the following
points:

•
•
•

Demographics on the Evansville region
The size and nature of the downtown retail potential
Good news on the downtown

EVANSVILLE DOWNTOWN MASTER PLAN - FINAL REPORT

•
•
•

•

•

•

Targeted communications to these potential retailers
Testimonials from other successful retailers
Development of a brochure on how-to key points for new
businesses to follow when starting a new business (see
appendix for a copy of “Starting a Retail Business in
Downtown Owen Sound” to use as a guide)

Maintain good contacts with property owners and leasing agents/
real estate professionals in order to refer potential business prospects
to appropriate properties.
For the most part, retailers that will come to downtown Evansville
will not be national chain operations. Most chains sign radius
clauses with developers when they lease. Because Green River Road
has so many chains, most of these retailers will be prevented from
coming to downtown by their current leases. Instead, downtown
should focus on strong independents and local chains.
Look for business development opportunities nearby. These businesses will be primarily local specialty retailers and regional chains
(e.g. drug stores). Examples of target retailers include:

As the committee begins to work together on the implementation strategy
and has met with key individuals or organizations intended to champion
the cause on various projects, the list of action items suggested above may
be broadened or diminished depending upon the wishes of the project
liaisons and the committee.
The priorities might also shift because certain situations may present themselves suggesting a project might take more or less time to implement.
In the end, regular meetings of the committee will ensure communication
linkages between the committee members, project liaisons, and the downtown Evansville Inc. will remain strong and focused to provide a new found
level of confidence in the downtown Evansville organization.
Investors and property owners will gain trust and confidence in downtown as a future investment opportunity as they witness the success of
Downtown Evansville, Inc. to champion and implement the strategic planning initiative.

2. Development & Business Incentives
As the champions & sub-committees begin to explore ways in which to
expedite their particular charge, funding will undoubtedly be an issue.
Private enterprise will be cautiously excited about the prospects of
investing into downtown. Consequently, it will be important to work
closely with city & county government to identify potential economic
incentive packages to help lessen the developers risk by underwriting a
portion of the project development expense. Additionally, the same
applies for potential new retailers who may be cautiously optimistic as
they consider opening a business in downtown. Below we have
identified a few such programs for consideration, some of which are
ongoing and already exist in Evansville.
DEDC Co-op Loan Fund

Downtown Revitalization Loan fund

Economic Development Loan Fund

DEDC Design Incentive Grant

Riverfront Development Beverage License

Tax Abatement Program

20% Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit

10% Investment Tax Credit(Non-Historic)

on the advantages of sustainable community development techniques
for a “healthy” downtown as well.

The review of current regulatory mechanisms such as zoning, building
code compliance, and design review, will be concurrent with efforts to
implement key projects within the action plan. Our cursory review of
these regulatory elements suggest that a special overlay zoning district
be identified with the downtown target area to allow for a more relaxed
approach to the off-street parking requirements & possible development
entitlements. See Section 1.0 Map I-II for existing zoning details.

We recommend that a task force be identified within the action
committee structure to explore sustainable community design principles
being used in other communities. This group of individuals should
include local authorities on these matters such as university professors,
city/county energy officers, and local design practitioners familiar with
applicable programs and techniques.

3. Public Policy & Guidance

Strategic Action Plan

Additionally, we recommend that new design guidelines for building
rehabilitation and new construction be crafted to more closely align with
the overall redevelopment plan for downtown.
Site planning standards should be adopted that will eliminate building
setback requirements that tend to break the integrity of the street wall
and introduce an ill-advised suburban design condition.
New buildings should be designed to blend into the historical character
of the street without trying to replicate historic architecture or through
the all to often disappointing historical theme approach. New buildings
should be contemporary in style with careful attention to neighboring
building massing and fenestration so as not to disrupt the urban rhythm
of the street but rather to complement the authentic historic integrity.

4. Sustainable Design
As future community development issues and opportunities are being
discussed for a better Evansville, consideration should be given to the
importance and long-range benefits of sustainable design practices for
the entire community and in particular downtown.
A sustainable design practice encompasses an expanded sense of
responsibility shared by a community to future generations for the
preservation and enhancement of our planet’s ecological systems. This is
not limited to pure natural resource conservation concerns such as the
rain forests of South America, glacial reserves of the arctic, or the
preservation of the farmlands, wetlands, and wood lots surrounding our
towns.
A community’s sustainable design philosophy should include issues of
safe building materials and material recycling, historic preservation,
clean energy alternatives such as solar or wind, energy conservation
practices, alternative transportation systems, innovative techniques for
storm water purification and management, and other important matters
affecting the longevity of the earth.
The public/private partnerships that will be created to accomplish the
actions spelled out in the strategic action plan will provide the citizens of
Evansville with a revitalized downtown. In addition the practices
employed to accomplish this task can provide education and knowledge

The action committee should encourage downtown Evansville project
sponsors and developers to consider including those “green” practices
on their projects that will demonstrate sustainable thinking without
jeopardizing the economic considerations of the project. It has been
proven that most sustainable design techniques decrease even initial
construction costs, in addition to the life cycle costs of a project.

5. Final Thoughts
As the strategic plan for downtown Evansville has reached completion,
the reality sets in that this is the end to a project but the beginning of a
process. A process crafted by the people of Evansville for the
revitalization and re-positioning of downtown Evansville. The process of
creating the new master plan has taken approximately twelve months to
complete through the hard work and dedication of public officials and
private citizens alike. The timeframe to revitalize downtown can not be
measured in months or even years because the business of revitalizing
our cities is a task that is never completed.
Hopefully this document will serve the city of Evansville well by
instilling a new sense of ownership and pride in all of Evansville’s
citizens to take part in the process of making downtown the best that it
can be.
The framework from which this new campaign for a better downtown
was created has met with tremendous support to date and it will be
important for those who will be responsible to advance the plan to
revisit their commitment to the cause often.
Champions of the plan should not become discouraged when challenged
by those who do not see the merits of certain aspects of the plan. This is
a normal part of the process and will in many ways allow renewed
commitments and improved approaches to be examined by the
downtown coalition, thereby fostering even stronger public support for
the revitalization program.
A physical project or two that happens as a result of the master planning
effort cannot be the measure of success of the strategic plan. The true
measure of success will be through the improved quality of life in
downtown Evansville in the coming years.

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DOWNTOWN

V. DOWNTOWN
The Downtown will continue to evolve as the cultural center of the City of Richmond offering

citizens a unique lifestyle experience in a vibrant mixed-use urban setting. The City of
Richmond will continue to value and preserve the rich cultural heritage and historical
significance of the Downtown architecture. A transition for Downtown into an exciting retail
and entertainment destination in the heart of the city’s arts and entertainment district will
occur. Downtown Richmond will become the home for the region’s finest museums and arts
related destinations promoted through advertising, exciting public events and unique
programs. The Downtown will be a desirable place to live with a variety of affordable, attractive
housing types, and a great place to work with easily accessible streets, restaurants, amenities
and ample parking. The Downtown will be a place of beauty with well-maintained properties,
aesthetically pleasing and walkable streets, enjoyable parks and abundant green space.

V. DOWNTOWN
A. Introduction
It can be argued that downtowns represent the heart and soul of their respective cities. Visitors
and residents alike are affected by the physical conditions of Downtown and draw conclusions
regarding the city’s commitment to community development and pride from what they see and
experience within the city center. The City of Richmond and its downtown partners, Main
Street Richmond Wayne County (MSRWC) have remained focused on Downtown since the
completion of the 1995 Strategic Action Plan directing resources and capital into several
significant projects. The Main Street Streetscape project, the removal of the pedestrian
promenade, renovation of two historic buildings to house MSRWC offices, creation of the
Richmond Innovation Center, implementation of a signing and wayfinding program, along with
numerous private property investments represent the public and private sectors’ commitment to
Downtown.

Strategic Action Plan 1995
In 1995, Main Street Richmond
Wayne County in partnership
with The City of Richmond
developed a Strategic Action
plan for Downtown. The plan
provided a roadmap for Main
Street and other stakeholders
to guide future redevelopment
activities, government driven
public improvements / capital
appropriations and marketing /
promotional and business
retention /recruitment
suggestions activities. The
planning initiative was
embraced by the greater
Richmond community and was
used to demonstrate the value
of pursuing several important Downtown projects including re-opening Main Street to vehicular
traffic, focusing on business retention and recruitment, recognizing the value of districting &
signing, recognizing the importance of the Whitewater Gorge and Depot areas and developing an
awareness of the residential opportunities Downtown.
Although first floor occupancy improved dramatically immediately after the pedestrian
promenade had been removed, local retail market conditions, in conjunction with a lack of
aggressive redevelopment of downtown and inappropriate land uses [Rumpke, Wayne County
Jail and outdoor advertising] contribute to the constant challenges for successful downtown
retail. These conditions have negatively affected the economic viability of retail and
entertainment destinations Downtown. Consequently, the local real estate investment
community continues to have concerns regarding the stability of Downtown as a secure
investment opportunity. However several retail businesses have relocated or opened in the
greater downtown in recent months providing more retail destinations for consumers and
broadening the critical mass.

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DOWNTOWN

Richmond is certainly not alone in this circumstance.
A downtown’s success is often fragile without
attention, coordination, management and
reinvestment. Downtown areas can easily slide into
decline as retail trends, physical deterioration, traffic
congestion and other factors undermine the
desirability of the downtown location.
The goals and objectives identified below have been
established to offer a bold and appropriate antidote
for the development challenge facing downtown.
When implemented these development

conditions for all of downtown. Cities who take an
aggressive position on Downtown redevelopment as a mixed-use environment find they can
change the perception of a place through quality-focused development, marketing /promotions
and retention and recruitment.

B. Goal and Objectives
Goal

To create a Downtown that combines the historic past of Richmond with a sustainable future
that includes a thriving retail environment, residential community, educational and municipal
facilities and entertainment destinations. The Downtown will be the center for culture and the
arts. Downtown will become a magnet for residents and visitors of Richmond who will view it as
the premier regional tourism center. As such, Downtown Richmond will become a community
that will experience increases in property values in both the consumer and business segments.
Population will increase as new people move into the revitalized City Center neighborhoods.
Richmond will exemplify quality building, preservation and urban design within a mixed use
environment to assure a vibrant and appealing Downtown.

Objectives

The overarching objective for the Downtown is to develop sustainable solutions that support the
continued vitalization of downtown and contribute to its vibrancy, cultural character and
economic viability. Specific objectives are:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.

Create a redevelopment district along East Main Street, including a mix of retail and
residential uses, to act as a gateway and provide physical linkage to downtown from the
east Richmond retail areas.
Identify expanded “central core” by demarcating downtown from 10th street to the Gorge
and Fort Wayne Avenue to Old Richmond. Connecting the 10th Street corridor, Fort
Wayne Avenue, the Gorge and Old Richmond as the New Central Business District.
Utilize the State of Indiana Riverfront Restaurant Redevelopment District program to
encourage restaurant development within downtown and the adjacent business district.
Develop a streetscape and wayfinding signing system that reinforces the relationship of
the civic theater, museums and Starr Historic District as a cultural district.
Consider an open space/greenway theme into downtown that echoes the wonderful
natural resources of the gorge area.
Create an artist’s colony downtown for artists that provides live/work space and
promotes downtown as the art and cultural center of the region.
Create an urban learning campus integrating art, culture and education.

8. Encourage all institutions of higher learning (Indiana University East, Purdue
University, Earlham College, Ivy Tech State College and Indiana Wesleyan to consider
developing an education based project in the urban learning campus downtown.
9. Aggressively pursue new businesses to take advantage of downtown technology park.
10. Provide development incentives to encourage residential living in the downtown area
through building renovations and new infill construction. Downtown should be a top
priority and designed in accordance with the Downtown Strategic Plan Update.
11. Solicit traditional and non traditional anchor tenants suitable for Downtown
Richmond’s vision and comprehensive plan goals.
12. Evaluate Downtown Parking and develop a Parking Plan for Downtown.
13. Develop new areas of public open space.
14. Encourage new, anchor attractions for people to experience downtown.
15. Promote pedestrian activity and walkable streets.
16. Prioritize transportation related improvements to provide connectivity and streetscape
improvements in and between each downtown district.
17. Encourage community participation in downtown planning.
18. Encourage entrepreneurship in new business recruitment and retention.
19. Encourage the development of Starr Gennett heritage tourism destinations within the
downtown.

C. Organization
Issues and Findings
Structure

Several organizations throughout greater Richmond are involved in guiding downtown
development, marketing and promotions. However, the City of Richmond has come to rely on
Main Street Richmond Wayne County [MSRWC] as the driving organization for Downtown.
MSRWC provides unwavering leadership to the City regarding all aspects of Downtown. In
addition to the organizations listed below, several Downtown located institutions such as the
Wayne County Museum, Civic Theatre and Earlham College provide knowledge and vision to
the city for the betterment of Downtown. The major organizations engaged in downtown
activities are listed below.

Main Street Richmond Wayne County

Main Street Richmond Wayne County is dedicated to a holistic environment of retail,
entertainment, business, government, housing, industry and urbanism. MSRWC has embraced
the National Trust for Historic Preservation Main Street program and the Indiana Main Street
Program as guidance platforms for the structure of their own organization.
MSRWC has expanded upon these basic Main Street programs and principles to include
significant involvement in real estate development activities. MSRWC has developed two
buildings in downtown as demonstration projects for the community to see the benefit of
downtown real estate investment. Both of these projects included new offices for MSRWC
operation. However, MSRWC’s latest development, the Richmond Innovation Center, was a
successful public / private partnership with area institutions of higher learning, the State of
Indiana, private business and the City of Richmond. The project was developed to provide enew business technology start up, business incubator space, a multi-purpose training facility,
video conferencing, MSRWC office space as well as government offices and Not-For-Profit
offices.

APRIL 2006 | RICHMOND, INDIANA | 114

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DOWNTOWN

The Main Street program creates opportunities for investment through public/private
partnerships. MSRWC is the symbol of ownership in socio-economic development and
community-wide pride.
Main Street Richmond Wayne County maintains a database of all available facilities in
Downtown Richmond. Main Street is the advocate for Uptown Richmond, and a first stop for
business advice, consulting and assistance. New business start-ups and proven companies with
years of experience can participate in Main Street’s valuable services and advantages. Main Street
also provides unlimited networking and publicity opportunities.
Main Street Mission: To facilitate the continual health and prosperity of the central business district and thus
the community at large by leading public/private sector community and economic development efforts.

Richmond-Wayne County Chamber of Commerce

The Richmond-Wayne County Chamber of Commerce is the organization that represents over
700 business members. The Chamber offers many programs, incentives, networking and training
programs to business and professionals throughout greater Richmond. The Chamber is an
advocate for a strong downtown and supports the efforts being undertaken by Main Street
Richmond Wayne County in numerous ways while taking the position that what is good for
downtown is good for the community.

Wayne County Economic Development Corporation (EDC)
The Wayne County Economic Development Corporation is an organization that works to
improve the business and community environment and employment opportunities in Richmond
and Wayne County by identifying, addressing and overcoming obstacles to business retention,
growth and development. The Wayne County EDC encourages the retention and expansion of
existing businesses, attracts new investment, and invests in the workforce through its education
and training programs.
The EDC is a liaison between business programs and services at a local and state level. Local
assistance includes tax abatements, the city and county revolving loan funds and training
funding. State assistance programs include training programs/grants, loans for equipment
purchases, trade show assistance for companies interested in exporting and getting into
international markets, and energy programs. The EDC works closely with the Indiana
Department of Commerce and the local and state Workforce Development offices to stay current
on available programs.
EDC is a recognized partner by MSRWC and should become more active in the development of
downtown through creative partnerships with local government and private sector interests.

The Urban Enterprise Association, Inc.

Established to provide economic revitalization to the City of Richmond through targeted
assistance in the Enterprise Zone. Activities are directed toward community and economic
development for businesses and residents of the Richmond Enterprise Zone. For more

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DOWNTOWN

Strategies and Recommendations
O 1. Continued and Expanded Partnering with Existing Economic Development and
Tourism Organizations
The City of Richmond should continue to work closely with Main Street Richmond Wayne
County as the lead organization for Downtown activities. MSRWC should continue to serve as a
clearinghouse for all Downtown related information, projects and general discussions
surrounding the evolution of downtown. Other organizations such as the Economic
Development Corporation of Wayne County, the Urban Enterprise Zone, Richmond / Wayne
County Indiana Convention and Tourism Bureau, local institutions of higher learning including
Earlham College, Purdue, IU East, Ivy Tech State College, and the local Chamber of Commerce
should become MSRWC’s partners in numerous redevelopments, educational and promotional
opportunities.
O 2. Identify and Market to Potential Downtown Developers and Tenants
The updated strategic plan will identify specific target real estate development opportunities and
the type of tenants and uses which match up with the opportunity. Wayne County Economic
Development Corporation and Main Street Richmond Wayne County should collaborate on
developing a tenant retention and recruitment strategy for downtown. The 1995 Strategic Plan
for Downtown identifies how a successful tenant retention and recruitment program can work.
MSRWC has initiated this program in the past and should be called upon to implement efforts
again based on new development strategies. Working with real estate developers interested in
downtown, Wayne County Economic Development Corporation and Main Street Richmond
Wayne County should orchestrate the public / private vehicle to create an attractive marketing
package for developers.
O 3. Develop a Marketing Campaign to Attract Customers and Visitors to the Downtown
Richmond’s organizations should coordinate and partner on a comprehensive Marketing
Campaign with the following elements:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Using “Uptown” as a start, develop a brand identity for Downtown Richmond.
Engage a professional firm to create a marketing program for downtown promotion that
can be implemented immediately to attract both customers and visitors.
Establish a system for evaluation of the effectiveness of these efforts.
Link festivals to marketing efforts.
Reinforce identified districts.
Continue to promote downtown as the arts and cultural center for the region.

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DOWNTOWN

D. Downtown Environment
Issues and Findings
Richmond’s center city is a classic
example of a traditional American
downtown. The central business
district is concentrated along a
twelve to sixteen block portion of
Main Street (the National Road) and
broadens out one block north and
south to North A Street and South A
Street. Contiguous to this compact
business core are walkable
neighborhoods, government campus,
churches and reasonable access to the
Whitewater River Gorge. Unlike
many downtowns similar in size,
Main Street looking West from 8th Street North Side of Street
elevated road-ways, multi-laned
Source: waynet.org
arterials or radical land uses changes
have not been built thus making the downtown environment barrier free and physically
accessible by foot or vehicle.
One of the physical challenges facing Downtown is the ability to broaden the territory of
Downtown proper by linking the Central Business District to adjacent business districts such as
Old Richmond, Elizabeth Starr Historic District and the Historic Depot District. By including
these districts with downtown, a better story can be told through marketing and public relations
campaigns of the unique districts and the variety of products, services and special environments
within downtown.
The Old Richmond business district and the Depot District could both benefit from the
management, promotional and development expertise of MSRWC. As the Urban Enterprise
Association is dissolved over the next few years, MSRWC can assist the district in channeling
resources in capital into the development interests. Expansion east to 16th Street, west to the rim
of the gorge, north to the Depot District, and southward, including Old Richmond, will allow the
districts of Downtown to be marketed as a means to attract tenant property owners and visitors
into Downtown. Expansion of the territory of Downtown will provide more redevelopment
opportunities through the additional land area of the broader territory.
With coordinated efforts, and on-going attention to details, historically rich downtown
environments such as downtown Richmond can thrive as centers of both commerce and culture.
It is a firm belief that economically successful, vibrant downtowns share common traits. These
traits can be characterized by a select set of urban design principles that address the physical
urban environment, sound economic modeling and the clear understanding of the realities of the
marketplace.

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DOWNTOWN

Uptown Redevelopment Project 1998

As a result of the Strategic Plan completed in 1995, the Uptown Redevelopment Project
completed in 1998 focused on the core area of Main Street in Downtown. Project elements
included new pavement concrete curb and gutters, sidewalks, brick pedestrian walks, extensive
landscaping treatment, directional signage, traffic signal modifications, and parking garage
rehabilitation.
The project serves as an excellent model to pattern future streetscape enhancements downtown.
In following the districting discussions in the City Image and Identity Chapter of this
Comprehensive Plan document, future streetscape enhancements should incorporate new design
elements and thematic icons to help distinguish the various districts in downtown.

Urban Design Principles
The economic and cultural development of Downtown Richmond should be guided by an overarching list of urban design principles. When followed, these principles can help guide those
individuals, organizations and government involved in the “businessing” of Richmond’s urban
districts to make sound decisions regarding the complex issues surrounding downtown repositioning. Such appropriate principals are:
1.

•
•
•
•

Market-driven leasing goals and development
A repositioning strategy with calculated economic enhancement objectives
A strategic action plan designed for implementation
Recognition of existing downtown organization’s capacity & capabilities for
implementation of the plan

2. Development of Key Activity Centers or Districts
•
•
•
•
•

Offers shopping and entertainment destinations
Characterized by a diversity of environment, people, and culture
Celebrates the history of the district
Unique characteristics evident in leasing opportunities as well as environment
Innovative urban housing opportunities

3. Pedestrian Friendly Environment
•
•

Safe & secure environment - day & night
Promotes pedestrian circulation and discovery along streets and alleyways

4. Unique Personality and Sense of Place

Parking
Parking is an important component of
Richmond’s future downtown development;
it should not detract from the intrinsic
qualities, like a pedestrian-friendly
environment and a unique sense of place.
Parking should be viewed as a supportive
tool to help make downtown attractions
easier to access.

Parking Wayfinding

APRIL 2006 | RICHMOND, INDIANA | 119

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DOWNTOWN

Although too much surface parking tends to detract the urban qualities and pedestrian activity
in a downtown area, Richmond is exceptional among small American towns in that it actually
appears to need more parking. Unlike many historic downtowns, Richmond has made use of
virtually every available opportunity to create parking on underutilized land. Inner block and
on-street parking opportunities have been established in virtually all conceivable locations, and
the few off-street parking facilities that are provided experience relatively high levels of
utilization.
Current Conditions
There are currently a total of 1006 city owned parking lot spaces available in Uptown Richmond.
Of the 1006 parking spaces available, 506 spaces are available for employees to purchase monthly
parking passes. Currently 379 monthly parking passes have been purchased leaving 127 spaces
available for purchase. All lots are $15.00 a month and the City of Richmond Parking Garage is
$10.00 a month.

In conjunction with the City of Richmond and Main Street Richmond Wayne County 3hour free parking has been made available for Uptown customers on all Uptown lots
listed above; additional long term parking is available at the City of Richmond Parking
Garage with entrances located on South 7th and 8th Street, a half block from the Main
Street corridor.
There are currently 258 off-street parking spaces available from 5th to 11th Street North A
Street to South A Street. Of the 258 off street parking spaces, 223 are designated as 2
hour parking spaces and the remaining 35 off street parking spaces are designated 1 hour
parking spaces. Source: Richmond Code Chapter 76 Schedule VI.
Monthly and yearly passes can be purchased from the City Clerk’s office Monday
through Friday 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. The City offers a discount on the purchase of an
annual parking pass which provides a 12 month pass for the price of 11 months.
If you are a new business locating in Uptown Richmond the City of Richmond provides
you with a year of free complimentary parking for you and your employees. Contact City
Clerk’s office located at the City of Richmond Municipal Building, Monday through
Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
Fines are written for violations for over time parking in the amount of $20.00 per
violation, if paid within 72 hours the fine is reduced to $10.00 per violation. Fines can be
paid at the Clerk’s Office located at the City Of Richmond Municipal Building Monday
thru Friday 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. or at the Police Station on the 1st Floor of the City
Building.-City of Richmond Ordinance Resolution No. 8-1997.
The City of Richmond’s Annual Budget for routine on and off street parking for Uptown
Richmond is $100,340. In addition to the $100,340 paving costs is $115,000 annually
bringing the total to $215,340.

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DOWNTOWN

Strategies and Recommendations
D E 1. Consider Expansion of Downtown Core
Expand downtown boundaries -east to 16th Street, west to the rim of the gorge, north to the
Depot District and South to Old Richmond.
D E 2. Evaluate Downtown Parking and Develop a Parking Plan for Downtown
The Downtown parking can be improved through several strategies:
•

It will be necessary to create additional parking facilities in the Downtown area due to
the level of use that the Downtown parking facilities experience at present, and the need
to replace a small but centrally-located portion of Richmond’s on-street parking in order
to improve traffic flow through this area.

•

It is crucial that all new parking facilities be designed and located so that they do not
adversely impact Richmond’s traditional downtown character. With very few
exceptions, demolishing buildings in Richmond is not an acceptable alternative, and
buildings in the Downtown should not be demolished to create a parking lot. Richmond
is fortunate to have a Downtown that is not developed with surface parking lots, and
maintaining its pedestrian-friendly character will require that the continuity of
Richmond’s historic building stock be maintained.

•

The City and owners of the few significant private parking lots in the Downtown should
improve the efficiency of existing parking areas in order to optimize the use of the offstreet parking that exists at present. The City can encourage and provide incentives for
shared parking. Private lots have the potential to provide shared parking.

•

The City must consider strategies for creating small amounts of additional off-street
parking in appropriate strategic locations. Large parking lots should be avoided because
of their deadening effect on pedestrian activity, but small, well-designed lots will
actually make Richmond more pedestrian-friendly by improving the quality of the
walking environment. Small, well- placed parking lots will also lessen demand for onstreet parking and will decrease the safety concerns associated with narrow on-street
parking lanes.

•

Select parking locations carefully. Generally speaking, off-street parking lots and
structures should not be located on major downtown commercial streets, in the middle
of clusters of storefronts, at peak land value intersections, or along primary pedestrian
corridors. These locations disrupt continuous pedestrian flow, decreasing the potential
volume of pedestrians passing in front of businesses. Moreover, they can reduce densities
and render the downtown less walkable. It is always preferable to place these facilities
behind Main Street commercial buildings, along streets with less commercial activity
that run parallel or perpendicular to Main Street, or at the edges of downtown.

•

Good design can help parking facilities integrate with the downtown fabric and
contribute to a sense of place. Lots can include ample landscaping outside to provide an
attractive visual buffer and within the lot itself to create an aesthetic appeal at the point
of transition from driver to pedestrian. Parking structures can contain storefronts on
street-level to avoid an ugly blank wall (known as a dead zone) on the streetscape.

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DOWNTOWN

D E 3. Downtown Property Development
Encourage development and redevelopment of properties in the downtown area, designed in
accordance with the Downtown Plan. Solicit anchor tenants suitable for Downtown Richmond’s
vision and comprehensive plan goals.
Much discussion about the need for more convenient retail stores in the downtown occurred as
part of the public involvement and Steering Committee/Planning Commission meetings. The
Downtown would be enhanced if retail operations such as a grocery store, pharmacy, or bakery
could be developed. That type of business will locate based on market demand which changes
dramatically if new housing is developed and renovated. Demographics and consumer spending
will dictate such private involvement decisions. The City can do two things to encourage such
activity:
•

Facilitate the completion of a retail market study

•

Provide a flexible zoning district which will allow the expansion of the geographic
boundary of the existing Downtown. However, possible expansion of the Downtown
should not be considered until after the retail market and business composition study is
complete, and the existing Downtown is at nearly full practical capacity.

D E 4. Downtown Development Control Strategies
The City of Richmond will apply the recommendations suggested in this document to heighten
the quality of life for its citizens, leverage the success of the business development and job
creation conditions to grow commerce in the city and encourage renovation and construction of
new housing and neighborhoods for the current and future citizens to enjoy.
As new zoning legislation is crafted to guide and shape Richmond s future, several areas of
importance within the zoning code should be explored to help [not hinder] in the development
of certain ideals for downtown. The city’s desire to embrace sustainability standards,
downtown’s role as a cultural center for the community and encouragement for additional living
opportunities within downtown will all place concern in the minds of the private real estate
development community regarding zoning compliance, marketability and appeal of downtown
and protection of one’s investment.
Several zoning models should be explored to ascertain that it is in the best interest of
downtown’s image, marketability and pro-development platform.
Although the zoning code reform exercise will become the forum for debating the pros and cons
of different zoning models, the city should be very clear about the intent of the downtown
zoning goals and remain focused on developing a flexible, user friendly, pro-development
language to encourage continued investment into downtown.
Several zoning considerations include; special overlay areas, districting, form-based zoning, and
higher density mixed use development opportunities.
Higher density within the center city is a goal that should be emphasized. Consequently,
opportunities to encourage this strategy through new zoning are important considerations.

APRIL 2006 | RICHMOND, INDIANA | 122

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DOWNTOWN

Design review should be broadened geographically to include the expanded areas of downtown
and use properly tailored design standards as a guidance mechanism for rehabilitation as well as
new development and construction. Complementing existing urban and architectural context
should be the basis of such standards. The city’s designated design review authority must
provide the author of these standards with their important environmental concerns for
downtown so particular attention can be paid to these key areas of importance.
D E 5. Promote Mixed-Use Development
Main Street Richmond Wayne County in co-operation with the Wayne County Economic
Development Corporation should explore public /private real-estate developers to consider the
merits of mixed use development within downtown.
D E 6. Consider Density Bonus
The City should consider a density bonus to encourage mixed-use commercial development. This
would be treated as a Conditional Use or Overlay District that would also require a higher design
standard and quality material. This would necessitate placing a density cap on existing
commercial districts.
D E 7. Encourage Downtown Housing Development
Encourage downtown housing development. The most important development strategy and
reinvestment Richmond can make in downtown and the contiguous center city neighborhoods is
housing. Rehabilitated older housings, as well as new low and high density housing should be
supported by the City though public/private incentive programs designed to attract the real
estate development interests. Not one type of housing surfaces as the top priority. The City
should form a task force with local lenders to look for ways to develop attractive incentives such
as ten year real estate tax abatement, first time homebuyer assistance, and low interest rehab
loans.
Historic tax credits are very attractive for multi-family rental housing. Historic Tax Credits are
available from the federal and State governments providing an attractive alternative for funding
mixed-use buildings and older apartment buildings prevalent in Richmond’s central business
area.
D E 8. Place Richmond Southside Historic District on the National Register Of Historic
Places
Years of misunderstanding the intentions, restrictions and advantages have led Richmond to
believe it is better to not have the historic assets of Richmond’s center city on the National
Register. It is time for the Department of Metropolitan Development, MSRWC and the Urban
Enterprise Association to provide educational forums regarding this subject. The financial
incentives created by this would be significant with a 2.20% federal tax credit coupled with a
state tax credit available for historic building rehabilitation, and it is imperative this opportunity
be explored immediately.

E. Aesthetics
Issues and Findings
The beauty of Downtown Richmond’s starts with the wonderful collection of historic buildings
located throughout the central business core. The buildings are primarily late 1800’s Italianate
architecture and collectively create a superb traditional main street environment. This
historically rich setting can be complemented with context sensitive new construction. The new
urbanism trends that are sweeping the country fold architectural aesthetics into new real estate
development projects in an attempt to replicate the high quality architecture of exemplary places
like Downtown Richmond. Downtown Richmond is genuine and should be exploited for
economic benefit.

Curved trestle bridge over the Whitewater River
Source: wwwindianatrails.org

Unique to Richmond, is the significant natural open
space connection of The Cardinal Greenway that
borders the Whitewater River at the base of the
Gorge running through downtown and serves as a
regional recreational connection trail.
Opportunities to engage the Gorge into the
Downtown from a marketing and promotions
perspective should be explored. The Downtown
environment is lacking in green space and open
space. Consequently the areas of the Downtown
appear cold and uninviting. Introducing more green
space to Downtown will contribute to a more
aesthetically pleasing experience.

Other aesthetic issues which need to be addressed in the central core are:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.

Engage a professional design firm to develop and implement phase 2 of the streetscape
master plan.
Develop an overall urban master plan development concept.
Prepare specific plans for the Main Street retail arts, and entertainment district.
Coordinate recommendations with signage and lighting incentives for storefronts.
Identify opportunities for lighting, public art and green space development.
Consider maintenance needs and develop a long-term maintenance plan.
Consider a Business Improvement District to finance the maintenance program.

Strategies and Recommendations
A 1. Building and Public Improvement
The following guidelines will be used by the City in reviewing new development and
redevelopment. The overall intention is to maintain the appearance and character of the historic
buildings throughout the commercial area, both in the downtown core and in the supportive
nearby areas:
• Buildings should be held to a context sensitive scale consistent with the central
downtown.
• Building heights in the downtown core should match those of adjacent structures,
with two or three stories being the desired height in that area. Building heights
outside the central core may vary.

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DOWNTOWN

•
•
•

•
•

Maintain as much building line along the street as practical. Where buildings must
be setback, a strongly landscaped edge should be established to maintain some visual
line along the street.
A window line should be maintained in the building facades along the facing.
All commercial buildings should have rear entries designed to be attractive,
functional, and identifiable.
All building entries, front and rear should make provision for the protection of users
from the elements by overhangs, recessed doorways, and/or awnings.
New buildings should attempt to complement the window proportions and
placement established in the downtown core.
Exterior building colors in the central core should be limited to a palette chosen and
governed by the Design Review Board.

F. Retail
Issues and Findings
Retail in Downtown is experiencing a
transition. As more retail development has
been approved for construction, a growing
concern among downtown retail merchants
is the ability to compete for the business.
The trade area for Richmond, or any city for
that matter, will only support so much retail
and restaurant development.
Downtown however continues to be
recognized as a destination retail district.
This modest retail success is because of
several key factors;

Store, Kessler’s Sporting Goods, Bullerdick’s Furniture and the Secret Ingredient are
located Downtown.
Strong non-retail destinations that bring potential shoppers into downtown such as,
government offices, banks, post office, museums, theatres and service businesses.
Main Street Richmond Wayne County promotes Downtown through quality events
and advertising and provides excellent management service to the tenants and
property owners.
Downtown offers a reasonably convenient shopping environment as evidenced by
the downtown parking program.
Historic architecture and linkages to adjacent historic districts provides a
stimulating environment and identity for Downtown.

Developers and major big box retailers argue that the market will support new retail because
these retailers do not exist in the marketplace. They often overlook the goods and services or
product categories that do exist in the marketplace because they are not offered under one roof
and offered by a one-name retailer. Because of this biased pro-retail development perspective
and the often times surplus ground zoned for retail and commercial, the end is nowhere in sight.
Therefore, it is vital for Richmond to remain proactive and persuasive in working with current
anchor stores to ascertain their future in the market including a Downtown Richmond location.

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DOWNTOWN

Of equal concern is helping the smaller retailers and restaurants by aggressively pursuing mixed
use projects that include a significant residential redevelopment element, hence bringing more
“built-in” customers into Downtown.

1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.
8.
9.
10.

Identifying the current market position of retail in Downtown.
Identifying the trade area currently served by the retail in Downtown Richmond.
Retail types (retailers and restaurants) supportable in Downtown.
Supportable sizes of these retailers and restaurants.
Ideal retail tenant mix for Downtown Richmond.
Strong retail destinations such as Elder Beerman Department Store, Veach’s Toy Store,
Kessler’s Sporting Goods, Bullerdick’s Furniture and the Secret Ingredient are located
Downtown.
Strong non-retail destinations that bring potential shoppers into downtown such as,
government offices, banks, post office, museums, theatres and service businesses.
Main Street Richmond Wayne County promotes Downtown through quality events and
advertising and provides excellent management service to the tenants and property
owners.
Downtown offers a reasonably convenient shopping environment as evidenced by the
downtown parking program.
Historic architecture and linkages to adjacent historic districts provides a stimulating
environment and identity for Downtown.

In order to attract consumers back to the Downtown, Richmond residents and U-Plan meeting
participants indicated that they would like to see more things to see or do, plus more restaurants,
apparel stores, and a possible grocery store. Richmond consumers are adamant that the real
strength of the downtown is its base of independent, home- grown stores. They would prefer not
to see the addition of more chains to Uptown because it would detract from its unique
“Downtown” quality. The Richmond/Wayne County area is rich with unique shopping
opportunities. The area is known for the many antique shops and malls and is often referred to
as Antique Alley
Uptown was once the commercial hub for the City of Richmond. The City was not only the hub
for government and finance, but also had the main concentration of destination retail stores that
attracted shoppers from throughout the County and beyond. Uptown has a significant portion of
the area’s retail and other commercial businesses.
Downtown Richmond is enjoying upward success as the arts, entertainment and cultural center
for the area. Growing retail competition along Richmond’s popular corridors will continue to
apply pressure on downtown. However, the holistic mixed use development strategy for
downtown will allow downtown to focus less emphasis on retail and concentrate efforts on
quality not quantity. In addition to the expected uses in downtown such as finance, government
and office, Downtown continues to be recognized as a destination retail district. This modest
retail success is because of several key factors;
The success of the retail, arts /entertainment/ culture in Downtown will play a significant role in
creating a strong demand for other development and mixed-use projects in Downtown such as
residential, artist live/work space and office. Downtown Richmond has benefited from its high
quality historic building stock, its location and its concentration of unique / higher quality
businesses.

APRIL 2006 | RICHMOND, INDIANA | 126

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DOWNTOWN

Strategies and Recommendations
R 1. Strengthen Sustainable Retail Health
Strengthening the long-term sustainable health of Richmond retail should include the following
strategies:
• Shopping as entertainment/dining as eatertainment.
• Appeal to the younger consumer (18-40 yrs.).
• Unique merchandise to complement - not compete with - area malls.
• Offer merchandise at a moderate price point.
• Extended operating hours.
• Support mixed use projects.
• Support residential development.
R 2. Help Strengthen Independent Businesses
Increased profitability and market penetration of existing independent businesses can help
prevent the entry of chains. However, some chains may view the success of others as an
opportunity to enter and dominate a market. Nevertheless, providing independent businesses
with market information, business district management and promotion, and small business
assistance can strengthen their performance. Main Street Richmond Wayne County must
continue to work diligently to manage and promote downtown. Shopping center management
techniques should be applied to downtown to ensure the right mix and critical mass of
businesses. This will point to business expansion opportunities for existing businesses. Business
recruitment is a necessary component of the retail strategy and should focus on smaller regional
or multi-location family businesses as an alternative.
R 3. Impact Assessments
As additional retail development is considered for Richmond, an Impact assessment process
should be considered. Forcing larger retailers to undergo a community impact assessment
requires that they demonstrate the overall impact of their development on a community. A
review of local land use or development policies that favor the large corporate competitors can
provided important public dialog. These assessments can include provisions for public hearings
and provide an avenue for citizen discussion.
R 4. Encourage Community Participation and Action
Richmond’s local businesses can regain their role in a healthy local economy. Getting the public
and other businesses to understand the issues is the first step. Then they can be mobilized to
promote their independent businesses and encourage local consumers to patronize locally owned
stores.
R 5. Chain Development
Richmond may want to attract or defer chain development in their downtown based on its
economic development priorities and long-term vision. While many communities would
welcome the addition of a chain store to their downtown area, they must realize that chains do
not want to be the revitalization catalyst. Instead, they want to be in places that are already
revitalized. Accordingly, the attraction (or deferment) of chains in downtown Richmond should
not be as an "end-all" goal, but rather as an ongoing consideration in business expansion and
recruitment efforts.

G. Connectivity and Accessibility
Issues and Findings
Connectivity and accessibility may be
defined as vehicular, bicycle and
pedestrian “pathways” which connect
adjoining neighborhoods and streets.
These connections join neighborhoods to
other neighborhoods and to services in
other areas.
One of the goals of the Richmond
Comprehensive Plan makes clear that
building a connected system of roads,
bikeways, trails, and sidewalks should be
a high priority, and a main objective of
the plan is to create neighborhoods and
areas built on the model of older
neighborhoods with walkable streets,
good connections and higher densities.

Source: waynet.org

Alternative transportation systems must be developed to further connect downtown to the
contiguous neighborhoods and to reinforce the city’s commitment to sustainability. Providing
bicycles welcome paths, parking and secure storage is an important initiative to implement.
The goal of the Plan also addresses the edges of the Richmond that they should be clearly
delineated and well-defined to create identifiable and welcoming community boundaries that
provide a sense of arrival. The Plan should reinforce the gateways and activity centers of
Richmond, to enhance connectivity and the interface between the community and the region.
Accessibility can be viewed from different perspectives, such as from the perspective of a
particular location, a particular group, or a particular activity. It is therefore important to specify
the perspective being considered when describing and evaluating accessibility. A particular
location may be very accessible by automobile but not by walking and transit, and so is difficult
to reach for non-drivers. A building may have adequate automobile access but poor access for
large trucks, and so is suitable for some types of commercial activity but not others.
Identifying the linkage opportunities that will offer Richmond residents alternative
transportation options and connectivity between the contiguous neighborhoods and downtown
is an important task. Vehicular transportation servicing downtown has been improved over the
years and appears to be capable of handling vehicular demand for years to come. In an effort to
honor the request of Richmond’s residents, alternative transportation systems should be
explored as well as improved pedestrian paths, trails and sidewalks to provide easier access to
downtown.

APRIL 2006 | RICHMOND, INDIANA | 129

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DOWNTOWN

Of major importance to Downtown, is the connectivity to other business districts (primarily the
eastside retail area) and adjacent neighborhoods. Aesthetic improvements to the US 40 National
Road will contribute to improved connectivity by creating a seamless and comfortable link from
the downtown to the eastside retail area and to the Westside and Centerville.

Richmond’s Regional Relationship

The strategic linkage diagram illustrates the variety of aesthetic and environmental “zones”
travelers experience as they migrate into and out of downtown along the major corridors.
Improving the quality of the travel experience will detract from the time required for the journey
and improve the connectivity to the center city.

Richmond’s Strategic Linkage plan
Source: 1995 Neighborhood Linkage Plan

APRIL 2006 | RICHMOND, INDIANA | 130

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DOWNTOWN

Strategies and Recommendations
C A 1. Identify Linkage Opportunities
Identify and develop linkage opportunities within the existing connective structure, and actively
promote the downtown as an ideal location for the future location of business and industries that
could properly take advantage of these opportunities. Opportunities should be sought to link
parks and open spaces via trails, greenways and bike paths thus integrating open space as a key
component of the downtown character and quality of life. Convenient vehicular and
pedestrian/bicycle access from surrounding neighborhoods to the central core is vital to the long
term sustainability of downtown Richmond. Downtown currently has signs that say “No
Bicycles Allowed”. Bicyclists should be welcomed but directed to appropriate paths and storage
areas through creative regulatory signing.
C A 2. Develop Pedestrian Circulation Plan for Downtown
The City of Richmond should commission a pedestrian circulation plan to analyze and guide
future development within the Richmond downtown and to create a mixed-use, walkable, urban
environment in contrast to the existing auto-dependent development pattern. A Pedestrian
Circulation Plan will enhance the community’s appeal while preserving natural and cultural
assets. Trails and on-street linkages create healthy recreation and transportation opportunities
by providing people of all ages and abilities with attractive, safe and accessible places to bike,
hike, jog, in-line skate or push baby strollers. In doing so, Downtown Richmond can gain
economically, environmentally and socially while providing vital services needed for a healthy
city.
The goal of the Circulation Plan will be to analyze pedestrian and cycling needs and identify and
prioritize improvements to address those needs. A key element of the pedestrian circulation plan
should target and improve pedestrian connections between existing and proposed retail
developments, the Cardinal Greenway, civic buildings, arts and entertainment destinations, and
transit stops. The Circulation plan should include provisions for safe and convenient pedestrian
movement across major streets and ADA-related access deficiencies in the existing pedestrian
system. Pedestrian circulation routes shall be defined and emphasized with appropriate
streetscape treatments, lighting and wayfinding systems.
C A 3. Develop Alternative Transportation Plan for
Downtown
To sustain an effective approach to alternative
transportation, the Alternative Transportation Plan
should address the following goals:
•
•
•

Provide a visible, high-profile municipal
alternative transportation program .
Provide an array of alternative transportation
options that work well and are safe.
Provide effective alternative transportation for
downtown commuters (in-bound, out-bound,
within) and recreational transportation.

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DOWNTOWN

•
•

Provide alternative transportation options that strive for improvements of air quality,
that lead to long-term sustainable improvements, and that will provide
sustained/sustainable transportation funding.
Design alternative transportation systems to support a sustainable economy and quality
of life.

Potential alternative transportation options for Richmond include but are not limited to:
1. Expanded bus service to complement the bus transit system already in place.
2. A city-center trolley and/or shuttle system connecting Downtown with the
neighborhoods, Old Richmond,The Depot District, Reeveston, IUE Ivy Tech Campus
and Earlham College.
3. A system of connecting bikeways and bike paths.
4. A regionally connected light rail system.

H. Art and Culture
Issues and Findings
Arts and culture is the primary advantage that downtown has over other business and retail
districts in Richmond. Unlike the Eastside retail area which is retail and restaurant driven,
Downtown offers broader consumer appeal through a holistic mixed use experience. Retail and
restaurants are complemented by art and culture through relationships of Richmond Civic
Theater, Richmond Symphony Civic Hall Performing Arts Center, The Richmond Art Museum,
Wayne County Museum, Starr-Gennett Foundation and the Indiana Football Hall of Fame to far
exceed the offerings of a shopping center. Promotion of the arts and cultural events in
Downtown Richmond is of utmost importance to the overall sustainability of Downtown.
Several issues need to be addressed in support of this aim:

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DOWNTOWN

Faith-based cultural experience
The exceptional collection of churches provides a
faith-based cultural experience that serves the
business and residential community of downtown.
Building upon this cultural foundation, downtown
Richmond can illustrate the diverse environment of
the center city and influence the tenant leasing
strategy with retail, restaurant and artist live/work
environments.

Festivals

Richmond is home to many diverse and entertaining
festivals and events. Winter in Richmond invites
people to get out and come to the Whitewater Valley

auctions. In helping with spring cleaning the City of
Richmond sponsors the Annual Spring Clean Up

weekend from April to June. This invites residents to
get rid of unwanted or unused items easily with easy curb pickup and disposal of hazardous
materials. The Wayne County 4H Fair is held in July with something for everyone. Animal
showing and judging, carnival, antique tractor & machinery show, hot air balloons and skydivers
are some of the events that take place during this week-long fair. Also in July, to celebrate
Independence Day, is Richmond’s fireworks and air show that includes craft show and helicopter
rides. Other events in July include the Wayne County fair for all ages, and for young people there
is the Civil War Camp that reenacts life during the Civil War. Late August celebrates the
settling of Richmond with an old-fashioned Pioneer Harvest Festival featuring pioneer crafts,
wagon rides, entertainment and so much more. Fall brings the Everett Festival in the Historic
Depot District with traditional arts and crafts, antiques and collectibles, food and live
entertainment. The Roof Top Rendezvous event in September celebrates Richmond’s Jazz
heritage on top of the city parking garage.

Arts Organizations
Richmond Symphony Orchestra
In its 49th season the Richmond
Symphony Orchestra is located inside the
the Civic Hall Performing Arts Center at
Richmond High School. The RSO makes
classical music accessible to the
community through several outreach
programs.

The Wayne County Historical Society Museum
The Julia Meek Gaar Museum, in the Starr district of Richmond, is one of America's outstanding
local museums. The museum is housed in a historic Friends Meeting House, and the museum
grounds are home to a two-story log house from 1823, an 1890's print shop, and an 1880's
blacksmith's shop. The museum is located at 1150 North "A" Street in downtown Richmond.
Wayne County's history is
particularly significant because the
county was a major gateway to the
west, and at one time was the most
populous county in Indiana. When
the National Road (now US 40)
opened through Richmond in 1833,
countless emigrant families trudged
through Richmond on their way
west. The museum is located at 1150

The Revitalization Plan for the Downtown
Business District was made possible by a planning
grant from the Indiana Office of Community and
Rural Affairs (OCRA) and managed by the City of
Huntingburg. The mission of OCRA is to “promote
community prosperity to strengthen Indiana’s
economy by providing capacity-building solutions
to assure ready, marketable, and competitive
communities for economic growth.”

This Plan is meant to assist City officials
and guide public investment projects in and
around Downtown with the goal of catalyzing
private investment in the coming years. It lays
out significant data, analysis, and resulting
recommendations needed to implement a
comprehensive revitalization effort that builds
off the significant progress already achieved in
Downtown Huntingburg.

The primary goal of the Huntingburg
Downtown Revitalization Plan is to
provide Huntingburg leaders with the
tools and strategies they need to continue
revitalization efforts in the Downtown
Business District. It is clear however that
the tools and strategies outlined in this
document, should be integrated into a
larger comprehensive economic strategy
if downtown and the community’s
economic potential is to be fully
realized. In other words the downtown
revitalization strategy will benefit greatly
by Huntingburg’s community leadership
stepping back and taking a look at the “big
picture.”

Huntingburg is fortunate to have several,
reasonably
strong
manufacturing
businesses, a number of which are in
proximity to Downtown. These businesses
demonstrate growth potential but are
expressing an increasing frustration
regarding their ability to attract skilled
employees to the Huntingburg area. The
current sentiment in the local market
is that labor supply shortages have
constrained business productivity and
growth. There is an expressed need
for a “retention-expansion” program to
prioritize the creation of an improved
business environment which makes
long-term investment and growth by key
industries and growth possible.

A
R

While most cities have experienced
a decline in both their downtowns
and employment in manufacturing,
Huntingburg has not followed this trend.
In contrast, their two most significant
assets are a historic downtown and a
significant manufacturing base. While it
may not be obvious, both downtown and
Huntingburg’s manufacturing base are
interdependent. Without employment,
retailers suffer and without access to local
amenities to attract and retain employees,
employers suffer. A strategically designed
program which leverages each entity’s
strengths will enhance the ability of each
to grow and prosper in a manner that
cannot be accomplished by operating in a
vacuum.

There are at a minimum, seven (7)
significant employers within a five (5)
minute drive of Downtown Huntingburg
employing a total of over 1,300 people.
Based on conversations with local
economic development organizations and
key community leaders these industries
have grown and show potential for future
growth. However, this potential has been
stalled by limited access to a skilled labor
pool and the inability to attract qualified
employees to Huntingburg. Quality of
life, local amenities, elementary and
secondary education and access to
appropriate housing are several of the key
factors that help companies recruit and
retain employees.

Huntingburg Downtown Business Revitalization Plan / page 11

PROJECT OVERVIEW & INTRODUCTION

Amenities and services offered in
Downtown provide residents with access
to retail, services, recreation, and
entertainment but do not provide the
total “quality of life” package that will
play a significant role in attracting new
employees to the region. Downtown
does however, demonstrates the ability to
support additional retail and residential
growth. Leveraging Downtown’s existing
reputation as a retail destination,
Huntingburg must focus on expanding
the current retail and service offerings
to better suit the demands of a growing
workforce.

that Huntingburg’s downtown and
manufacturing base are vulnerable to
regional and national economic trends.
At the same time, both economic bases
are relatively strong and with concerted
innovative programming the community
can build from a position of strength not
weakness.

Business & Downtown Growth
Distric t (BDGD)

Huntingburg is fortunate to have a
solid downtown and several healthy
manufacturing businesses within a
compact geographic area. Their proximity
to each other offers an opportunity
to create economic and programmatic
linkages that if designed well can
leverage growth and economic benefit
for both entities. It is recommended
that Huntingburg leadership consider
the establishment of a “Business and
Downtown Growth District (BDGD). The

EXECUTIVE
S U M MA RY
Building off Huntingburg’s past successes
in downtown, the goal of this Plan,
from the onset, was to identify the
few remaining hurdles that have kept
Downtown from reaching the high
expectations of Huntingburg residents
and community leaders. Even with the
hard work and support of local businesses,
residents, and the City – Downtown
Huntingburg is still missing key elements
to its revitalization. Essential to this
effort is Huntingburg’s ability to expand
their Downtown business mix to attract
residents, employees, and visitors as
users of Downtown, while concurrently
increasing housing options to build a
Downtown resident base and built-in
customers to support local businesses.

What makes Downtown Huntingburg‘s
task achievable, is its position within
the region and the ability of the City to
capture a large share of an undersupplied
regional market for retail, services,
and goods.
Within their secondary
trade area (25 minute drive) there is in
excess of $15 million dollars of potential
spending that is leaking to neighboring
retail centers. Attracting and retaining
businesses which supply retail, goods,
and services will allow Downtown to
thrive and prosper as a true business
district, pulling consumers from outside
their primary trade area.

Strong employment base, steady population
growth, and access to an unmet retail market,
positions the City of Huntingburg with a great
opportunity to capture a growing share of the
retail and housing markets.
As part of this evaluation, two key trade areas
were analyzed - the primary trade market, which is
defined by a five (5) minute drive from Downtown
Huntingburg and the secondary trade market,
defined as a twenty-five (25) minute drive from
Downtown. A majority of the region’s population
live within these two areas and includes the
municipalities of Jasper, Holland, Ferdinand, and
Santa Claus, Indiana.

Additionally, this area of Southern Indiana is
known for its cluster of woodworking and food
processing manufacturing businesses.
Unlike
many cities in the Midwest, Huntingburg and
the surrounding region, have not experienced
a significant decline in these job sectors. With
access to manufacturing jobs, the City is one
of the primary commuter destinations for the
region, employing over 3,500 individuals within
three (3) miles of Downtown.
Strategically located between both population
and employment centers, the secondary trade
area represents a $15 million dollar retail gap,
which indicates an ability to recapture some of
the potential spending within Huntingburg’s
Downtown.

Population Trends
Having experienced moderate population
growth over the past decade, the small
City of Huntingburg is home to just over
6,000 residents, representing a nearly ten
percent (10%) growth rate over the last
decade. Looking at growth within the
city proper, the majority of growth since
2000 has been in the north and northwest
sections. A comparison of the population
changes between the City limits and
the primary trade area (5 minute drive
from Downtown) reveals the majority of
new growth is occurring in the northern
section of Huntingburg which is not
included in the primary trade area. This
indicates that the primary trade area’s
population has been essentially stagnant

Huntingburg has experienced only
slightly higher growth rates than other
cities in the region. The secondary trade

seen very similar growth rates, increasing

DEMOGRAPHICS &
MA R K E T CO N D I T I O N S

While the City and surrounding trade
areas have experienced modest growth in
the past decade, the City of Huntingburg’s
growth has been dominated by the influx
of new Hispanic residents. The growth
in the Hispanic population over the
last two decades has been significant,

experiencing a 1200% increase (from
just 39 residents to over 500) between
1990 and 2000. The secondary trade area
saw a much lower, but still significant
increase during that time but has slowed
to just over 100% growth in the following
decade.
Rising sharply, beginning in
the 1990s and almost doubling over
the following decades, this population
subset now makes up twenty percent
(20%) of the total population. Attracted
to the well-established food processing
and manufacturing jobs in and around
Huntingburg, the City has embraced their
fastest growing population sector with

It must be noted that, without the
significant increase in Hispanic migration
to the City, the predominately white
population of Huntingburg would have
declined to 1960s population levels. With
a negative growth rate for non-Hispanic
persons, Huntingburg must continue to
embrace and accommodate the needs of
this rapidly growing population that is
projected to continue this trend over the
next decade.

Over the past few years, Dubois County
has enjoyed the lowest unemployment
rate in Indiana averaging just over five
percent (5.5%) in 2012, while Indiana
remained at over seven percent (7.4%).

This is in part due to the high number
of manufacturing based jobs in the City
which traditionally has required lesser
amounts of education than other office
and professional sectors.
The Southwest Dubois School System
ranks higher than Indiana’s statewide
average on most educational categories,
but it must compete successfully within a
secondary market region with other highly
ranked school systems. Huntingburg and
Southwest Dubois schools must continue
to improve their competitiveness within
this region to attract future residents and
employees with families.

Downtown Markets

Generally, downtown markets have three
primary drivers – residents, employees,
and visitors. Various factors determine
how each driver impacts the downtown
market, but simply speaking, higher
densities and higher incomes will result
in higher spending and more revenue for
local businesses.

D

Downtown Markets

e m p l oye e
market

The residential market within Huntingburg
has shown little growth and what new
housing units have been captured within
the City limits have predominately been
on the north side of the City. However,
the majority of new housing construction
in the last decade occurred in Jasper and
unincorporated parts of Dubois County.
In addition to slower growth, sales and
housing values in Huntingburg compared
to other parts of the county are lower,
reflecting the greater demand for housing
in those areas.

While new construction and singlefamily housing values are lower, rental
vacancy rates are very low within the
City, indicating a solid demand for rental
housing and multi-family apartments.
Only six percent (6%) of rental housing is
vacant resulting in an effective vacancy
rate of around one percent (1%), which
accounts for temporary vacancies and
homes on the market. This demand
has caused stress on the surrounding
Downtown single-family neighborhoods;
many homes have been subdivided
into multiple units to accommodate
the growing rental demand. This rental
demand likely stems from the steady
base of entry level manufacturing jobs.
Very few new multi-family units have
been built elsewhere in the county. This
creates an opportunity for Huntingburg to
capture a share of the expanding underserved rental market.

With decent population growth over
the past two decades, Huntingburg is
projected to continue to grow, increasing
the demand for housing.
Based on
current projections, population growth
within the county is expected to stabilize
while population in Huntingburg will
continue to grow at a steady rate. This
indicates that within the next thirty to
forty years, Huntingburg will continually
expand, capturing a larger percentage of
the county population. Based on these
estimations, it is likely that the market
could absorb approximately twenty five
(25) to thirty (30) housing units per year.

D

Secondary to the residential market,
employees significantly impact the
downtown market.
With over 2,700
employees within one mile of Downtown,
the ability to capture this market is
critical to the area’s success. Over half of
that number is manufacturing employees,
who receive slightly higher compensation
than the average median income in
Huntingburg. Downtown retailers and

visitor population; many business owners
indicated this group represented a large
source of revenue, drawing in people from

visit the historic Downtown, local retail,

festivals throughout the year. While it
is unknown what the actual scale and
impact of visitors on local retail revenues,
anecdotal evidence points to the need
to leverage Huntingburg’s position as
a retail destination to further support
existing businesses and grow this market
segment. Additional data is needed to
verify the actual impact that visitors have

Retail Market Analysis
Positioned in the center of a large regional
employment hub, with nearly 30,000
employees within a half hour drive, and
as a visitor destination, Huntingburg is
poised to capture a much larger share
of the retail market than other cities
of comparable size. Currently, within
the primary trade area (5 minute drive
from Downtown), there is a retail gap of
approximately $5 million dollars. Retail
gaps are estimates based on current
spending patterns and the existing supply

everyday shopping needs are the easiest
to recapture and should be the focus of
any business recruitment and attraction
program for Downtown.

The retail potential of several trade
categories

further
analyzed
to evaluate which market segments
Huntingburg has the best ability to
recapture. It should be noted that no
one market will ever be able to recover
100% of their “leakage,” however,
conservative estimates for recapture
rates fall anywhere between ten percent
(10%) and thirty (30%). While there is
some demand for large ticket items such
as automobiles and specialty electronics,
these markets are much harder to attract
to small cities and demand for these
is most likely absorbed into the larger

While only a small amount of food and
dining “leakage” occurs in the primary
trade area, it is the secondary market
(25 minute drive from Downtown) that
presents the most significant opportunity
for Huntingburg to establish itself as
a restaurant and dining destination.
With over $5 million dollars in potential
spending just within this category, taking
advantage of existing local dining options,
expansion of hours, new establishments,
and offering more food choices will draw
customers from nearby cities and towns
with limited options.

No one location can capture all of the
potential spending. Capture rates for
small markets as stated previously tend to
be between ten percent (10%) and thirty
percent (30%) depending on the type of
goods and services. Using this range,
paired with conservative estimates for
revenue per square foot, assumptions on
the number of new retail opportunities
can be calculated. The primary market
doesn’t present much opportunity
beyond expanding existing businesses.
The secondary market does, even on the

Another retail category with room for
growth is clothing retail. Only a few
stores in Huntingburg currently offer
these goods and with a regional retail gap
in excess $15 million dollars. Capturing
only a small share of the clothing category
would greatly benefit Downtown by
bringing in new spending and diversifying
the retail offerings.

As of the writing of this report, there are
currently only six first floor vacancies
along 4th Street (see Appendix for
complete building inventory) representing
just less than 14,000 square feet of
potential retail. These vacancies provide
Downtown the opportunity to capture
additional shares in the marketplace.

Miscellaneous retail, which accounts
for thirty-five percent (35%) of the
stores, is the primary retail use along
4th Street. This category includes gifts,
florist, and antique stores. Food and
drinking establishments with just under
twenty-five percent (25%) of the existing
storefronts represents the next largest
retail cluster. However, nearly one-third
of the storefronts are occupied by office
and non-retail uses which detract from
4th Street as a true retail destination.
Several of these uses would be more
appropriate on the upper floors of
buildings or in a service cluster. Clothing

Located along t wo major highways,
Huntingburg is accessible to most of
Southern Indiana.

With lease rates between $3 and $5
per square foot the cost of retail space
should not be a constraint to attracting
businesses to Downtown.
However,
the low commercial lease rates make
it difficult for building owners to not
only cover operating cost but more
importantly finance needed interior and
exterior renovations to attract higher
paying retailers and businesses.

The current conditions of Downtown
infrastructure and utilities adequately
meets the needs of existing businesses.
However several issues, including an
aging water line, that if not addressed will
present challenges to redevelopment and
discourage private investment.

Located along two major highways in
Southern Indiana and just ten minutes from
Interstate 64, Downtown Huntingburg is
easily accessible from all directions by
automobile. The only real hindrance to
current mobility around Huntingburg is
the east-west train tracks that bisect the
City, just north of Downtown. The City in
partnership with Dubois County and the
Indiana Department of Transportation
(INDOT), will begin construction on a new
northwest overpass allowing north-south
traffic to eliminate traffic delays caused
by trains.

Traffic counts are highest, averaging about
19,000 cars a day, north of Downtown
and steadily drop off as US 231 intersects
with IN 64 and points further south. The
impacts of the proposed overpass on
Downtown traffic will require additional
analysis.

T
F

The water line under 4th Street was
constructed in 1896 and has adequately
served Huntingburg’s downtown area
for more than a century. However, the
8” water line needs to be replaced due
to its age and potential to break without
warning which would cause a major water
service crisis in Downtown Huntingburg.
One lateral break occurred in December
of 2013 that shot a geyser thirty (30)
feet into the air, and required immediate
repair.
Fortunately, the repair was
managed without cutting off service to
an entire block or more. The projected
cost estimate for this repair is between
$800,000 and $1,200,000, but it is a
capital project that the City Water Utility
must complete before a major break in
the line causes a potentially catastrophic
impact to the residents and businesses
within its distribution area.

occupy the remainder of the space.

Several business and property owners
commented on the need to study backup issues for both the sanitary and storm
sewers in the 300 and 400 blocks of 4th
Street on either side of Main Street. It
is recommended that the City budget
around $50,000 to $200,000 for the
study and potential repairs. The sewer

improvements may be adequately repaired
by City Utility crews if improvements
do not require special construction
equipment or methods beyond normal
maintenance and repair work for these
sections of the sanitary and storm sewers.
While Huntingburg has sidewalks that
provide a slant to meet the street
pavement at the intersections in
Downtown, many of these intersections
do not appear to meet ADA requirements
regarding proper slope angle of no more
than three (3) degrees or adequate width
to accommodate wheel-chair users’
proper width for maneuvering about the
intersections. It is recommended that
these ADA intersections be improved to
adequately meet modern requirements
as part of the larger 8” water line
replacement project and potential
streetscape and parking upgrades along
4th Street.

Without coordination and effective
management, parking concerns can
not be resolved. Overflow parking at
peak times could be accommodated in
nearby underutilized parking lots. Public
buildings such as City Hall, Old Town Hall,
and the Post Office are predominately
used during weekday business hours and
could be re-purposed on evenings and

Parking has been a concern in Downtown
Huntingburg. It is unclear whether the
issue is a perception or reality. On-street
parking is allowed, and during most visits
to 4th Street, existing parking sufficiently
meets the daily needs of most users.
There are times during major events and
festivals that on-street parking does not
accommodate the demand. However,
parking levels should not be based on

Conditions

The buildings along 4th Street are
well maintained and in good condition
considering many were built over a
century ago, due in part to a small group
of investors who are passionate about
preserving the architectural heritage of
Downtown. Of the sixty (60) buildings
Facade Conditions & Improvements

Of the 60 buildings inventoried, over 2/3 had no
visual facade issues.

The cost associated with making needed
repairs and improving space so it is
marketable, is not supported by existing
lease rates.
The result is deferred
maintenance, deteriorating buildings, and
unusable space. If this existing condition
is to be remedied “soft loans” and grant
monies must be available to reactivate
the impacted buildings.

Underutilized Sites and

Few sites within the core of Downtown
should be considered underutilized.

Currently, the City’s Revolving Loan
Fund has some capacity to provide low
interest loans to commercial building
owners, but has yet to make a loan for
facade restorations. A dedicated program
incentivizing building owners to make
upgrades may be necessary. This type of
program could have the added benefit of
encouraging high quality and historically
accurate renovations. Without providing
incentives or funding for projects, owners
are at their own discretion as to how they
improve their properties and may not

there is no available land adjacent to 4th

There are a few
properties that could be better utilized

limitations and needs of individual
property owners helping to reach positive
solutions for both the property owner and
Downtown.

inventoried (see Appendix for a complete
building inventory), less than one-third

facade improvements and only four (4)
stood out as prime candidates for large
scale facade restoration.

Just as important as the historic buildings
and the people that make up a downtown,
the ability to implement projects and
programs are critical to success.
In
cities like Carmel, Columbus, and Elkhart
where great strides have been made,
local organizations were the key to these
successful revitalization efforts. In the
case of Huntingburg, a city with only
6,000 residents, the level of local capacity
is much higher than other comparable
cities and is a key asset for Downtown’s
revitalization. From financial incentives
to festivals, the City offers a wide range
of local programs and organizations
targeted at improving Downtown and the
businesses that make up 4th Street.
Recently
established
“Destination
Huntingburg”, the City’s new Main Street
Organization, should focus on taking the
lead to coordinate the various groups,
organizations, and events that support
this goal. This will increase the reach and

Huntingburg Downtown Business Revitalization Plan / page 31

E X I S T I N G CO N D I T I O N S E VA LUAT I O N

impact of the individual organizations
and programs offered in Downtown
Huntingburg.

Downtown Organizations
Many existing organizations currently
provide support to 4th Street and
its businesses including - the City of
Huntingburg,
Huntingburg
Chamber
of Commerce, Downtown Merchants
Association, Visit Dubois County, and
Dubois Strong (county-wide economic
development organization).
Given
the mission of the recently established
Destination Huntingburg, they are the
most appropriate entity to provide
oversight on the programming, events,
and financial support to 4th Street.

Local Tools and Programs

Local financial tools should be used
to leverage additional funding and
to expand each program’s capacity
and ability to assist more businesses.
Emphasis should be placed on working
with, not independent of, local financial
institutions.

T
F

Dubois County, through Dubois Strong,
offers a similar loan program.
The
Enterprise Loan Fund (ELF) provides
gap financing for business ventures
throughout the county, with a strong
focus on job retention and creation.
Loans are targeted primarily to industrial
and commercial entities which may limit
the impact in Downtown Huntingburg.

A
R

The ability to build capacity within
Destination Huntingburg will be one of
the keys to determining how quickly
recommendations from this Plan may be
realized. There needs to be coordination
amongst the players and Destination
Huntingburg is the likely organization to
fill this role

D

Huntingburg’s main assistance program
for Downtown businesses is the City
Revolving Loan Fund overseen by City staff
and a five member review committee.
This program offers financial assistance,
typically between $10,000 and $25,000,
to businesses turned down by traditional
financing sources such as local banks.
This fund has been used predominately
in the past for inventory and equipment
purchases for small businesses.

In addition to the on-going loan programs,
both the County economic development
entity, Dubois Strong and the City can
apply on behalf of businesses, for grants
and other funding sources to assist with
start-ups and business expansion on a
case by case basis.

Currently the City has not created a Tax
Increment Financing (TIF) District to
support redevelopment in Downtown
Huntingburg.
The City has effectively
utilized TIF as an economic development
tool to assist business expansions with
new infrastructure, to the advantage of
the growing manufacturing industries
elsewhere in Huntingburg. A method
that has been used by cities throughout

Huntingburg Downtown Business Revitalization Plan / page 32

T

the state has been to consolidate their
existing TIF’s into one consolidated TIF
District to encourage development.
Further consideration is needed to analyze
the potential impacts of consolidating
the separate TIFs which could include
Downtown, and provide the City the
flexibility to support and reinforce
investments in industrial development
with renewed investment in Downtown.

D

Events and Festivals
As a regional destination for much of
Southern Indiana and parts of Kentucky,
Downtown Huntingburg hosts over fifteen
unique events and festivals each year.
The most notable is the Christmas Stroll

T
F

Understanding the impact of these events
and festivals is necessary to attract larger
event sponsors, support growth of existing
businesses, and recruit new businesses
to Downtown. Providing current and
accurate data on spending patterns at
previous events may show a potential
business owner that there is a larger
market than the small residential base
within Huntingburg. A coordinated effort
led by Destination Huntingburg will ensure
that thorough and accurate information
is collected for each event. Additionally,
cross marketing and promotion of events
and festivals will garner additional
attention, reduce overhead cost, and
potentially increase attendance.

A
R

The Christmas Stroll is Downtown’s largest
and most notable event, drawing in crowds of
5,000+ visitors over 3 days.

E X I S T I N G CO N D I T I O N S E VA LUAT I O

which, over the course of the three day
event, has been estimated to attract nearly
5,000 visitors from as far away as South
Carolina. Many businesses indicated that
Downtown events, the Christmas Stroll
in particular, make up a large share of
their annual sales and are vital to the
sustainability of their businesses.

Communit y Par tners
Downtown Huntingburg is home to
numerous community partners including
churches, schools, and key public buildings
like City Hall. Significant buildings such as
Old Town Hall, renovated in the late 1980s,
and Memorial Gym are key landmarks that
attract visitors to the area. Completed in
1951, Memorial Gym is still the site of
high school basketball sectional games

Huntingburg Downtown Business Revitalization Plan / page 33

E X I S T I N G CO N D I T I O N S E VA LUAT I O N

bringing in large crowds; the capacity of
the historic building holds an impressive
6,000 fans.
There are a significant number of
churches that surround 4th Street and
attract large congregations each Sunday.
Leveraging this large influx of individuals
with targeted retail and dining will
increase revenues for local businesses.
Currently, very few businesses are open
on Sundays and are therefore missing out
on a significant opportunity. Offering
expanded breakfast and brunch menus
may attract worshipers to stay Downtown
after services. These extended hours and
new customers could benefit local shops
and retailers who would be in a position
to capture this market segment.

Often cited by others in Indiana as the example
of downtown revitalization, Huntingburg’s 4th
Street is a successful business district; however,
thinking about revitalization now instead of after
disinvestment occurs, will ensure Downtown
remains successful. Downtown Huntingburg is
vulnerable due to the small local market, the
cost to maintain / improve its’ historic building
stock and the regional and national retail trends.
The foremost goal of this Revitalization Plan is
to identify the area’s limitations and strategize
around short- and long-term programs and
projects that will elevate 4th Street and its
businesses in order to remain relevant in the
market.

D

To be successful, downtowns must offer a
distinct reason for people to become repeat
visitors; focusing on offering one of a kind,

local retail and dining options that complement
regional shopping centers and national chains,
not compete with them. Huntingburg should
continue to focus their efforts on creating
a unique atmosphere for retail, dining, and
entertainment that attracts visitors from outside
the area, not only during the business day, but
on evenings and weekends. Huntingburg is in an
excellent position to capture this unmet regional
demand for both retail and dining due to its
central location within the region. The following
strategies will assist Huntingburg and the various
Downtown organizations to collaboratively tackle
their underlying issues while working towards
a shared vision for the revitalization of their
Downtown Business District.

The vision for Downtown Huntingburg
is to establish 4th Street as a true
mixed-use neighborhood that attracts
residents, employees, and visitors with
its abundance of unique, local dining,
retail,
and
entertainment
choices.
Increasing the quality of life in Downtown
Huntingburg benefits not only the City and
its residents, but also its many businesses
who can point to Downtown as an amenity
for their employees. Features like trails
and restaurants will enhance the quality
of life for residents and attract higher
income, higher educated households to
Huntingburg.

square feet of upper story spaced is
currently vacant or used for storage,
indicating ample opportunity for the
City to bring new residential units to the
Downtown market. These new residents
will further support existing businesses,
bring in new retail demand, and create a
renewed sense of community. Providing
activity during non-business hours,
will create the 24/7 feel that is vital to
establishing a prosperous and sustainable
downtown neighborhood.

A
R

Create “win-win” scenarios for
Huntingburg’s largest employers
and Downtown by encouraging
them to participate in and support
the revitalization of 4th Street.
An attractive and vibrant 4th Street
in downtown will retain and attract
employees who are interested in working
and living in Huntingburg because of
its high quality of life. Work with local
industries to gain a clear understanding
of their immediate and long-term needs
and identify creative solutions that both
address these and increase the overall
quality of life for residents. Quality of
life improvements, such as trails, dining,
and entertainment, directly benefits
employers by making it easier to attract
highly educated and skilled workers to
Huntingburg.

Build off Huntingburg’s position as
a regional destination for shopping,
dining, and entertainment to expand
Downtown’s customer base. Due to
the City’s small population and proximity
to Jasper, Huntingburg’s primary market
is insufficient to support additional retail
and dining. However within the larger
trade area (approximately 25 minute
drive, including Jasper and Santa Claus)
there is excess demand and Huntingburg’s
central location puts it in an excellent
position to capture this unmet demand.
Expanding on the downtown district’s
dining and retail offerings, festivals, and
unique events give consumers a reason
to visit Downtown to keep them coming
back.

employment
opportunities and attract regional
residents
and
employees
to
Downtown with vibrant retail, dining,
and entertainment options as well
as diverse housing opportunities for
all income levels. As the center of a
large employment hub, nearly 23,000
individuals are employed within a 25
minute drive of Downtown Huntingburg,
capturing this market is crucial to the
sustainability of the downtown district.
A multi-faceted strategy for engaging
this market should be considered. First,
the City must continue to foster business
growth by creating a setting that attracts
the regional market to Huntingburg and
all that it offers. Second, Huntingburg
must
attract
regional
residents/
employees by filling the county-wide void
in workforce housing. This housing can be
a redevelopment tool for both downtown
and the near north side.

With a major infrastructure project along
4th Street looming, the opportunity to
leverage this construction project to the
benefit of the downtown is possible.
Construction of the 4th Street water

opportunity to improve the accessibility,
usability, and appearance of the entire

Conversations with local owners indicated
that the trees are too large for the existing
tree lawns and in the worst case have
caused damage to the historic building
facades.
Additionally, they are fruit
bearing trees which are a safety hazard
and become a nuisance for local shop
owners and their customers.

With the proposed parking configuration,
4th Street would continue to accommodate
approximately the same number of
parking spaces.
The angled parking
creates structured spaces and reduces
underutilization caused by irregular
parking in parallel spaces.

Prior to the reconstruction of 4th Street,
consideration should be given to the
existing landscaping, lighting, and street
trees.
The current species of street

Funding for the streetscape and sidewalk
enhancements along 4th Street will
partially come from dollars set aside by
the City of Huntingburg for the 4th Street
water line replacement. Supplemental
funds will be needed to offset the cost
of the improvements and will likely be
funded by the City of Huntingburg with
possible assistance from federal or state

The water line under 4th Street was
constructed in 1896 and has adequately
served Huntingburg’s downtown area for
more than a century. However, the 8” water
line needs to be replaced due to its age and
potential to break without warning which
would cause a major water service crisis in
Downtown Huntingburg. One lateral break
occurred in December of 2013 that shot
a geyser thirty (30) feet into the air, and
required immediate repair.
Fortunately,
the repair was managed without cutting
off service to an entire block or more. The
project cost estimates for this repair are
between $800,000 and $1,200,000, but it is
a capital project that the City Water Utility
must complete before a major break in the
line causes potentially catastrophic impact
to the residents and businesses within its
distribution area.

Straddling both sides of Old Town Hall,
the significance of Market Street in
Huntingburg’s history is evident.
In
recent years however, the tree lined
boulevard which features historic lighting,
has been underutilized with the exception
of parking and overflow from downtown
festivals and events.
Market Street should be recognized as an
important cultural resource for Downtown
Huntingburg through enhancements to
reflect a formalized market and festival
center with year-round programming.
The ability to limit traffic, makes this
an ideal location to host events such as
an expanded farmers market, a venue
for regular festivals, and other outdoor
activities without causing any conflict
with existing traffic flow and on-street
parking along 4th Street.

its

Significant historic landmarks, like the
Old Town Hall, need to be engaged in
community building efforts to build social
capital and preserve the unique downtown
character. The nearly vacant and grossly
underutilized Old Town Hall has served
this role in the past, but fails to do so
currently. Reactivating the structure will
require some creative thinking to attract
users that are compatible to both the
building and the future role of Market

Retail districts must be multi-faceted
in order to consistently appeal to its
targeted market. For example modern
malls incorporate entertainment, and
event venues in their building program
giving customers more than one reason

Creating an attractive retail line-up is
only one important dimension of making
downtown a magnet for visitors. Venues,
both indoors and outdoors that attract
event organizers, events, festivals and
programs increase visitor traffic and

300 block of 4th Street presents a great
opportunity to formalize an important
public space and create substantive
programming throughout the year. Events
such as concerts and movies in the park,
will give residents and visitors a reason to
come downtown and to do some shopping
or grab dinner before and after events.

To complete a park project of this
scale, costs may range from $150,000
to $300,000 depending on the actual
design and amenities which may range
from seating to public restrooms. This
project may be able to attract private

be able to attract federal or state grant
funds to support a well-designed park
that could encourage activity and attract
future contributions to Downtown.

The physical layout of downtown and
its neighborhoods is relatively compact.
The distance between the 4th Street
retail district and venues including the
Memorial Gym, League Stadium Ball Park,
and even the near northside industrial
park is not great. This compactness offers
attractive options for linking recreational
venues and employment centers directly
to downtown with careful planning.
The Huntingburg Heritage Trail, as
proposed in this Revitalization Plan, would
connect local recreational amenities,
employment centers attractions, and
recent public investments along a nearly
eight mile looped trail. Recent studies
indicate that trails not only increase
residential property values for adjacent
properties, but increase retail revenues
for businesses located along the trail.
The proposed Huntingburg Heritage
Trail would not only increase access to
recreational amenities but act as an
effective economic development tool to
spur additional spending at Downtown
businesses if constructed along 4th Street.

Many downtowns struggle to find a
balance between creating urban, walkable
cores and providing adequate parking for
residents and visitors who, in a market
such as Huntingburg where consumers
are accustomed to traveling, are heavily
dependent on automobiles. In these
situations, attention must be paid to
addressing both the concerns for easily
accessible parking and the walkability of
an area.

parking is unavailable. Shared parking
of underutilized lots, such as churches
who typically have complementary hours
of operations to downtown businesses,
would increase the amount and location
of parking for Downtown users.

To combat this perception Destination
Huntingburg should invest in additional
wayfinding and signage to clearly identify
and direct Downtown visitors to existing
free public and semi-public parking. Signs
at each lot within walking distance of 4th
Street should indicate when and where
patrons are allowed to park. Additional
signage along 4th Street is needed to direct
visitors to the existing lots if on-street

and property owners voice concerns over
inadequate parking along 4th Street. A
simple parking analysis indicated that
there is adequate parking for on-street
spaces and off-street public and semipublic lots to sufficiently meet the
current daily demand.
However, this
indicated another issue, the perception
of limited parking, which is a real concern
to many retailers and is perpetuated by
regional and national chains that cater
to oversized parking lots in front of retail
establishments.

both provide signage in and around 4th

Coordination between

The National Register of Historic Places
lists
Downtown
Huntingburg’s
4th
Street as an architecturally significant
commercial district featuring Italianate
and Romanesque architecture from the
turn of the century. Maintenance of and
care for historic properties can become
financially demanding on small businesses
and building owners without assistance.
Further adding to the problem is the
over 40,000 square feet of vacant and
underutilized upper story space which
provide little to no additional income
for most building owners, reducing their
ability to fund facade restoration projects.

A
R

These buildings, which add considerably
to the culture and charm of 4th Street,
are an important asset to the City of
Huntingburg. With only a small number
of Downtown buildings in need of largescale restoration and a few in need of
minor upgrades and repairs, the City and
downtown organizations should identify
additional resources and incentives to
provide financial motivation for property
owners to tackle these projects.

D

A potential response would be to establish
a traditional facade grant or loan pool,
accessible to all property owners within
downtown, to reduce the initial costs of
restoration and upgrades to commercial
buildings. Typically, programs like this,
fund improvements to the front facing
walls, signage, windows, and entryways.
Funding could be available as a low interest

loan,a forgivable loan, or a matching grant
where owners pay for up to fifty percent
(50%) of the costs. There are benefits and
draw backs to each option and additional
discussion is needed to determine what
type of support best suits the needs of
property owners and works given resource
availability.
Limited capacity, time, and financing
are large hurdles that prevent many
building owners from taking on facade
improvements. The use of a Facade
Easement Program is one way to reduce
those hurdles.
Similar to a utility
easement, transferring the rights to a
building’s facade greatly reduces the costs
and risk to each owner, while allowing a
local organization, such as Destination
Huntingburg, to control the quality of
restoration and ensure compatible designs
for facade improvements and new signage
are completed. Once the construction
project is completed, the facade easement
can be transferred back to the building
owner for long-term maintenance.

Funding for either option would require

One potential source of these funds may
come from local “angel” investors who do
not need to realize a quick return on their
investments but see this as a way to invest
in their local community.

With a proper recruitment plan in place,
Huntingburg has the ability to capture a

With a strong visitor population, it is
surprising that Huntingburg has only
one hotel; requiring many visitors and
business travelers to go outside the
City for these accommodations. This
allows surrounding towns and cities to
capture much of the potential visitor
spending, which could have remained
in Huntingburg. Spending is not only
limited to hotel accommodations, but
dining, shopping, and conveniences such
as gas typically are associated with tourist

All across the country the market for
downtown housing is growing as young
professionals, empty nesters, and others
seek a more active lifestyle with access
to a wide array of amenities not offered
in most suburban subdivisions.
New
housing options, especially those not
found already in the market, attract
new households and provide businesses
with an immediate customer base for
downtown retail and dining. To strengthen
and support Downtown as a true mixeduse district, Huntingburg must increase
the residential base.

One of 4th Street’s greatest assets is its
historic building stock, which is currently
underutilized as upper story storage and
warehouse space.
With over 40,000

ability to convert these spaces back to
their original use as residences presents
a unique, but challenging opportunity for
Huntingburg to expand housing options
and attract new residents.

While a few upper floors have
been renovated, a majority remain
empty because the cost to make the
improvements outweighs the financial
return on their investment, creating a
financial “gap” for building owners. A gap

rehabilitating upper floor space.

The Pennsylvania Borough of Tamaqua (2012
population 7,003) had a similar issue with
upper story vacancies and underutilization.
DCI assisted the small Borough by identifying
and analyzing upper story opportunities
for conversion to residential. The Upper
Story Revitalization Plan, completed in
2010, identified innovative public-private
partnerships for upper story mixed-use
development in their Downtown.
The
primary recommendation involved packaging
several buildings into a single development
to leverage state and federal resources primarily tax credits.

A

Since the completion of the plan, community
leaders have acquired one property and
received a $500,000 grant for the renovation
of that building. They have optioned several
other properties that will be packaged
into a $16 million dollar project creating
40 new housing units in their Downtown.
Additionally they utilized the Plan with
support from the State Legislature to help
them establish the downtown area as a City
Revitalization and Improvement Zone (CRIZ)
that provides additional funding, from state
taxes, to incentivize redevelopment of their
upper floor spaces.

OPTIONS
lease write-downs: in many cases the rent

situations like this, a lease write-down covers
the difference between market rate rents

A
R

balloon loans: raising capital can present
challenges to small businesses. Balloon loans
require less money upfront and typically
lower interest rates which reduces cost
during the start-up phase and over the first
few years. After revenues have stabilized, a
large payment or “balloon” is due at the end
of the short-term loan.

T
F

TIF increment waiver: improvements on
vacant and underutilized buildings can
create a financial burden due to increased
property taxes. One way to combat this
initial increase is to essentially abate the
increment (or the difference between the
pre-rehab assessed value and the completed
renovation assessed value) for a short-term
period following the improvements.

D

Low Interest Loans: can support and be
blended with conventional bank financing to
improve the cash flow of projects to make
it attractive for conventional lenders to
participate in a redevelopment project.

Housing options play a vital role in
determining a city’s quality of life. A
city needs to be able to meet the varied
housing needs of all residents regardless
of income level. Without a diverse range
of housing options, including both for
ownership and rent, the attractiveness
of a city for residents and employees and
more importantly employers is greatly
reduced. Huntingburg and the region’s
manufacturing base require that special
attention be paid to the concept of

Construction of multi-family housing,
especially in Downtown, will likely require
some form of public sector participation
due to the higher costs associated with
urban infill development.
With very
few underutilized or vacant buildings
in the Downtown core, any multifamily development will most likely be
in the form of new construction, which
can create larger development “gaps”
than rehabilitation.
A public-private
partnership between the City and a
private developer will ensure that both
parties are able to realize a benefit
from this initiative.
Land assembly

their ability to attract qualified employees

numerous stakeholder interviews. The
City’s rural location, limited housing

were cited as limiting factors in attracting a
qualified workforce to live in Huntingburg.
These concerns are not dissimilar from
those we heard from local businesses and

Already recognized by its peers and amongst
the region as a retail destination, Downtown
Huntingburg has the opportunity to leverage this
reputation and establish itself as an attractive
City with unique shopping, dining, recreation, and
living options. In the short-term, Huntingburg
must focus on capturing the unmet regional retail
demand and building its residential base. Once
a healthy retail and dining mix is established,
the primary market will respond, but without
a traditional residential base to support the
commercial core, sustainability of this market is
uncertain. Huntingburg must invest in building
this base if they want to ensure the sustainability
of their Downtown.

D

The Revitalization Plan for the Downtown
Business District identified four strategic goals,
drafted to leverage the City’s existing strengths
and offer creative solutions to issues that have
in the past, created a challenging environment
for revitalization and private investment. To
achieve this, the City of Huntingburg must work
in coordination with supporting organizations to
strategically implement the priority projects from
the Plan.
The following section provides a basic guide
on project phasing, key players, and funding
sources. Additional implementation information
is included with the project descriptions in the

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

IV. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
The City of Richmond will work cooperatively with its local and regional partners to vigorously

promote economic development and skilled job creation. The City of Richmond intends to
promote connectivity with regional markets, through a diversified and self-supportive
economic base. Economic development will be supported by communication and cooperation
between city government, related agencies, businesses and residents, in the pursuit of
appropiate investment opportunities for the City of Richmond. A variety of sustainable
employment opportunities will be available to the citizens of Richmond in addition to skilled
job training and continuing education.

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

IV. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
A. Introduction
A city’s economic development is the process of building an economic base for the community’s
future, while continuing to meet its current fiscal responsibilities. Economic development plans
form and determine the structure of the city’s economy, which includes its workforce, private
businesses, industries, infrastructure, and natural resources. A healthy economy is fundamental
to developing and maintaining a balanced, sustainable tax base. The economic base should be
sufficiently broad to reduce the impact of economic downturns, yet focused to encourage
retention, expansion, and attraction of businesses. Therefore, a community’s long-term
sustainability depends on a sound and diverse economy.
Sustainable communities
recognize that a healthy
environment can stimulate a
stronger economy. Economic
growth will benefit if a city
respects the interconnectedness
of environment, economy, and
community. Sustainable
communities develop and
promote an economic base that
minimally impacts the
environment. This approach to
economic development
understands that the natural
resource wealth, or “natural
capital,” of a community is
Depot District
intricately intertwined with the
Source: Waynet.org
health of its ecosystem. A
conservation-based approach
bridges natural resource conservation with job and community development.
This section of the comprehensive plan will address promoting a secure economic base through,
downtown revitalization, industrial, office, retail, and tourism development, plus economic
incentives. Although Richmond is benefiting from its current economic development activities,
the area’s long-term vitality will depend to a great extent on its ability to continue to enhance its
business environment and build its economic base, while protecting its natural resources. Not
only will the City and surrounding areas need to provide job opportunities in order to fuel the
local economy and attract residents, but also the City must generate market workforce
development and training opportunities. Richmond can fortify its economy through ongoing
investments in local labor, products, and services. Additionally, the City must continue to
generate fiscal income that is derived from non-residential land uses in order to support the
services that it provides.

APRIL 2006 | RICHMOND, INDIANA | 61

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

The City of Richmond is fortunate to have many exciting projects underway and planned for the
future. Reid Hospital is building a new campus on Chester Blvd. north of their existing facility.
Total investment by Reid will exceed $250 million. As a result of Reid’s new campus, the City of
Richmond constructed a new street for Reid Hospital. Total investment for the street (Reid
Parkway) exceeded $2 million. A new $6 million assisted living facility is under construction.
New subdivisions are being approved including a new 70+ home subdivision in Hidden Valley.
The City of Richmond continues to invest in pedestrian infrastructure and is completing a
$900,000 stabilization of a historically significant structure in the heart of Richmond’s
downtown, and a bike path in the Whitewater Valley Gorge. Richmond offers utility services
including water, sanitary sewer, electricity, natural gas, refuse collection, and
telecommunications services to both commercial and residential users. The City strives to
maintain state-of-the-art equipment and technology to support the growing needs the
community.

B. Goal and Objectives
Goal
The City’s economic base will be diversified and expanded to create a variety of employment
opportunities, encourage additional investment in the community, and ensure sufficient revenue
is available to support the community. The City and the Wayne County Economic Development
Corporation can develop and implement healthy and sustainable economic development
initiatives throughout Richmond. The City will coordinate with Main Street Richmond-Wayne
County, Inc., the Urban Enterprise Association of Richmond, the Wayne County Economic
Development Corporation, Economic Growth Group, and the Wayne County Chamber of
Commerce to build an expanded tax base with the correct mix of business and industry through
an aggressive business recruitment and retention program. The City will coordinate workforce
and career development programs with the appropriate agencies and educational institutions,
plus current and future employers to guard against an insufficient skilled labor force to serve
business and industry.

the Life Science interests.

C. Economic Base
Issues and Findings
Economic Structure

During the 1860s and continuing through the twentieth century, Richmond was considered a
manufacturing city. Though not at the top of current industry trends, manufacturing is still a top
contender, but the service sector superseded in the number of establishments and occupation
over the past ten years in keeping with National and State trends. Using a standard classification
system, the distribution of the number of establishments is shown below in the various tables
and bar charts. These are the standard categories used by the North American Industrial
Classification System (NAICS). Manufacturing, education, health care, and social assistance
represent the largest number of establishments in Richmond, Indiana followed by retail trade,
and other service oriented establishments.

Occupation by Industry

When comparing a 10-year difference between 1990 and 2000, the City of Richmond had the
greatest decrease - 60%- in agriculture, forestry, fishing, hunting, and mining positions from 1990
to 2000. The number of positions in the service industries (arts, entertainment, recreation,
accommodation, and food services industry) had the greatest growth of 60 percent between 1990
and 2000. Wholesale trade and retail trade both lost a significant number of positions between
1990 and 2000.

that inhibit business retention, growth, and development. The Wayne County EDC encourages
the retention and expansion of existing businesses, attracts new investment, and invests in the
workforce through its education and training programs.
The EDC is a liaison between business programs and services at a local and state level. Local
assistance includes help with tax abatements, funding through city and county revolving loans,
and funding for training. State assistance programs include training programs/grants, loans for
equipment purchases, trade show assistance for companies interested in exporting and

programs.
These markets include automotive, plastics, food processing, biomedical, information
technology, and advanced logistics. These industries are targeted by the State. Richmond has an
excellent access to the interstate that makes it very attractive to automotive suppliers, food
processors and logistics companies. Because of competitive utility costs, Wayne County attracts
a large number of plastics and injection molding companies.

system to inventory downtown facilities and marketing the available space.
The EDC established a Business Retention and Expansion Program. The program works with
existing companies on a regular basis; tracks information about those companies and helps to
find grants and other financing options for company expansions. There is a database to track this
information.

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

Strategies and Recommendations
E B 1. Conduct a Market Study and Business Sector Composition Study
The City of Richmond should conduct or commission a market study for the purpose of studying
the composition of the business sector with the Wayne County Economic Development
Corporation. The market study will evaluate the level of demand for Richmond’s goods and
services. This study should define the Richmond trade area -which will probably extend well
beyond the city-and identify the purchasing power, retail, and service needs of the trade area’s
residents and businesses. Studying the current composition of businesses will pinpoint the types
of businesses currently operating in the Richmond trade area and evaluate the opportunities that
the existing businesses present.
These may include:
• Clustering opportunities (strategies for attracting businesses that are suppliers of
existing establishments or buy goods and services from existing establishments)
• Niche opportunities (strategies for attracting businesses that complement existing
establishments)
• Expansion opportunities (strategies for attracting businesses that have similar needs to
successful local businesses and are likely to benefit from the Richmond environment)
E B 2. Economic Development Plan
On the basis of the data gathered in the market and business composition study, the Wayne
County Economic Development Corporation will be prepared to develop a strategic economic
development plan with the City of Richmond. This plan should be designed to capitalize on the
information gathered to date and designed to work with the EDC’s service delivery capacities.
The Economic Development Corporation will use its knowledge of local economic opportunities
and resources to evaluate a variety of possible strategies.
The findings of these studies and the Economic Development Corporation’s strategic plan should
be shared with key community partners and the public to help build broad support for the
Council’s strategies and for any public expenditure that may be necessary.
E B 3. Identify Mixed Land Use Development Areas and Incorporate Zoning Reform
Improve the quality and variety of retail, commercial and service businesses through land use
strategies and zoning reform policy throughout the city. Develop mixed-use land use categories
and zones to promote a mix of business types within a geographic area. Select appropriate areas
for this type of land use. Change current zoning code and classifications to reflect the mixed-use
areas. Identify sites and plans for future industry including manufacturing, technology, and
advanced research companies to locate in the Richmond area.
E B 4. Promote Inter-Organization Communication
Foster further consensus and regular communication between business and government on
existing economic development programs. Interact and communicate with local area chambers of
commerce, real estate professionals, and developers to identify the needs and business plans of
the community.
E B 5. Retail Strategic Development Plan
Develop a Retail Strategic Development Plan to envision sites and areas for strategic retail
development and centers in conjunction with the City of Richmond.

APRIL 2006 | RICHMOND, INDIANA | 79

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

E B 6. Create a Clearing House for Redevelopment Sites and Greyfield/Brownfields Sites
Create and maintain a clearinghouse that will be available to the public to inventory and market
underutilized sites, potential brownfield sites, and redevelopment opportunities in the City of
Richmond and in the two-mile fringe area.
E B 7. Develop Joint Economic Partnership
Promote cooperative and joint economic development partnerships between Wayne County, The
City of Richmond, and Centerville to encourage economic development initiatives between local
governments and businesses for specific projects and areas located within the two-mile fringe.
E B 8. Expand the Downtown TIF District
Expand the central core TIF district to build more capacity for business location and offer
further incentives for the Downtown TIF District.
E B 9. Develop and Promote Customized Business and Industry Training with Educational
Institutions
The City of Richmond should continue to work closely with the Economic Development
Corporation of Wayne County and local colleges including Earlham College, Purdue, Indiana
University East, Ivy Tech State College, Main Street Richmond, and the local Chamber of
Commerce to further higher educational opportunities and co-op programs. The Economic
Development Corporation of Wayne County should continue to work with a number of different
organizations in the community to improve economic and community development through new
and improved co-op programs with local universities for job placement.
Create programs for high school students and college students to explore career and job
opportunities in the Richmond area. Currently there are programs between the RichmondWayne County Chamber of Commerce and the Economic Development Corporation to promote
careers for students. The City of Richmond should participate in these local and regional
programs, plus provide support and awareness of the programs.
E B 10. Workforce Development Marketing and Outreach
Work with the organizations to further market the existing and future workforce development
and training programs for the labor force in Richmond, Indiana.
E B 11. Coordinate Marketing and Public Relations Planning For The City With Agencies
And Organizations
The City of Richmond should be aware of all Marketing and Public Relations efforts with local
agencies and any agencies conducting the efforts and should track all efforts in a centralized
location.
E B 12. Strengthen Richmond’s Overall Tourism Development
Pursue development of tourism programs including:
• Conference Center/Hotel complex development in strategic location.
• Lodging facilities’ ongoing renovation &/or possible expansion/development
opportunities.
• Continued development and promotion of historic downtown Richmond as arts and
cultural destination.
• Work with area attractions & event providers to strengthen the overall tourism product.

D. Industrial Development
Issues and Findings
Industrial Inventory
Richmond has a history of a significant inventory
of manufacture-based firms. These firms have
been the city’s basic industry and major
employers. Richmond’s manufacturing industry
imports intermediate goods (semi-processed)
goods used to produce final manufactured
products. Attractions for companies are the two
industrial parks in Richmond. The Midwest
Industrial Park encompasses nearly 550 acres
and is located in the northwest quadrant. The
location gives companies easy access to
Interstate 70 and the Norfolk Southern rail line.
The Safety Zone
The Gateway Industrial Park, located just off
Source: www.iedc.org
Interstate 70 and State Road 1, is a smaller scale
park of around 280 acres. These area industrial parks encompass over 800 acres.
Richmond’s industrial base is oriented towards a traditional mix that is weighted heavily with
manufacturing. Products generated by local plants include, plastics, caskets, pet food and
supplies. Construction is the largest local industrial sector. The second largest is manufacturing
and wholesale trade is third (see table below). One of the largest industrial clusters is in plastics
with the top 10 companies providing 1100 jobs.

APRIL 2006 | RICHMOND, INDIANA | 81

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

Richmond’s dependence on a large, manufacturing sector causes its economic base to be
susceptible if there is a downturn in this sector. Nationally, manufacturing has been declining as
an industry for three decades. Richmond must remain competitive to attract those exceptional
manufacturing companies and niches that are experiencing growth. The City’s industrial base
will need to expand and diversify in order to remain competitive and attract the technology
driven industries. It is also important for the City to retain a strong industrial base as a source of
tax revenue in the future. A diverse economic base can ensure that a severe downturn in any one
industry or sector will not have the effect of reducing the City’s overall tax base.
Industrial development continues to occur with Osborn International’s recent announcement to
expand their company. Innatech has announced an expansion and is building on to their existing
facility. The EDC of Wayne County has announced that a new food processing facility plans to
locate in Richmond bringing a multi-million dollar investment and up to 200 new jobs.
Reid Hospital and Health Care Services is
building (2005) a $250 million hospital
complex off Chester Boulevard in Richmond.
It is the largest capital investment in the
history of Richmond and east central Indiana.
This investment, combined with internal
business expansions and successful business
prospects by the Economic Development
Corporation of Wayne County, is likely to
generate job growth.

Strategies and Recommendations
I D 1. Designate and Market Formal Industrial Parks
The priority of this objective is to create and market an identity for the City’s industrial areas.
This will improve the City’s ability to attract new businesses. The City should designate formal
industrial parks for each industrial area within the city. Their owners have already established
some formal parks. At the same time, the City or other developer may develop new industrial
parks in the future.

APRIL 2006 | RICHMOND, INDIANA | 83

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

I D 2. Develop and Maintain an Information Clearinghouse of All Industrial Related Firm
The City of Richmond in conjunction with the Wayne County Economic Development
Corporation and the Richmond-Wayne County Chamber of Commerce should develop a system
to inventory all manufacturing and industrial types of developments in the city and the two-mile
fringe that is easily updated and accessible to the public.
I D 3. Designate Formal Industrial Parks and Enhance Park Identities
Industrial parks should create special gateway features and signage to reinforce their individual
identities. The City of Richmond and the Wayne County Economic Development Corporation
will work with private owners to enhance gateways. Industrial areas will be designated, which
provide separate identities for each major concentration of industrial uses. In the future, new
industrial parks should provide formal identities.
I D 4. Market Industrial Parks
The City of Richmond and the Wayne County Economic Development Corporation will
continue to market specific industrial parks and larger industrial areas in its marketing materials.
I D 5. Continue to Implement and Improve the City’s Airport
Implement the various developments programmed at the Richmond Municipal Airport in the 20year planning period to accommodate its changing role as a general aviation airport as identified
in the Airport Layout Plan (ALP). The airport will play a vital role in the economic stability of
the community while it grows from a small general aviation airport to a large general aviation
airport required to serve large aircraft.
There is a need to implement the long-term strategy identified in the Airport Layout Plan to
capitalize on this important asset, especially as demand from within the county grows enough to
support more executive aircraft. The airport is a marketing amenity for attracting industrial and
office uses. The airport is a generator of economic development and will grow in importance
within the region over time. The city should continue to expand and improve its facilities and
operations. In addition, aviation-oriented businesses should be attracted to the airport environs.
I D 6. Improve Truck Access
The Transportation Section recommends the rerouting of truck traffic and hazardous materials
transport routes in the creation of an overall transportation plan. Truck and hazardous material
routes should be identified along primary routes to industrial areas and guide traffic from the
interstate to such points of destination. It is important to keep such traffic away from the
downtown and residential areas. Such efforts, if aimed at diverting truck traffic away from the
city’s existing and prospective residential neighborhoods, will also help strengthen the
marketability of those areas.
I D 7. Ensure that Labor Supply Issues are Continually Addressed and Marketed Through
the Educational Institutions
The Wayne County Economic Development Corporation and the Richmond - Wayne County
Chamber of Commerce will continue to work closely with area colleges, state vocational/
technical training programs, and local manufacturers to ensure that labor supply issues are being
addressed. These programs need to be marketed and to both the employers and to the
universities and students. In this way, city efforts will add value to local companies’ own efforts
at labor recruitment. The EDC and the Chamber establish contacts with area colleges, state
vocational / technical training programs, and local manufacturers to address labor supply issues.

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

I D 8. Prioritize Economic Clusters
The City focuses its marketing, attraction, and retention efforts on the key sectors that have
established strong concentrations in the city’s economic base. While operating with a focus, the
City is responsive to those that provide significant employment, reasonable income tax return to
the City, or offer the opportunity for growth. As efforts focus on economic clusters, efforts
should be made to maximize available land so that the City gets as much development as feasible
on industrially zoned land.
I D 9. Develop and adopt standards for Industrial Zoning in the Zoning Code
The City should develop standards and requirements for Planned Industrial Districts that would
provide a flexible zoning tool to accommodate large or unusual development projects.

E. Office Development
Issues and Findings
The City has the largest share of the county’s and the region’s office market. There are typically
Class B/C buildings in cities the size of Richmond. Downtown primarily has financial;
government and government related professional office uses – attorneys and physicians,
consultants and organizations. Some professional, real estate, and other office tenants are
scattered in a few neighborhood locations and small office parks such as those along US27/US40.
Downtown has a large concentration of office space that is currently used by or is available for
private offices, according to Main Street Richmond -Wayne County’s inventory. However, most
offices are not located in office “buildings,” but on the second stories of first floor storefront
tenants. Much of the Downtown space is in older, historic buildings. Downtown is also home to
a number of government functions. There are many professional physicians and dentists offices
located along US 27 corridor and close to Reid hospital.
The City of Richmond's zoning codes permit office uses in the non-residential C-1 – C-4 zoning
classifications. There are many areas in the city that are zoned for commercial uses – these areas
zoned for office uses can attract future Class A/B space.

Issues

Among the issues to be addressed is
the lack of demand for office space.
The City faces competition from a
large and growing office supply in
the exurban areas of Dayton,
Indianapolis, and Greater Cincinnati.
The City cannot easily compete with
the retail and other amenities that
help attract office tenants to that
area, unless cost factors present an
advantage to locating in the City or
the Downtown area.

Source: Waynet.org

APRIL 2006 | RICHMOND, INDIANA | 85

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

The City also lacks dedicated and defined office parks to support such development. Finally,
there is a perception among commercial office developers that the City only has limited zoned
land available for office development.
Even if there was demand for professional and corporate office space, there is relatively little new
Class A office stock in the city to accommodate this demand. Richmond’s Downtown office
space is located primarily in the core area and in 2nd and 3rd floor spaces in vintage buildings.
Much of this Class B/C space remains vacant and has not attracted many of the typical small
downtown office uses (attorneys, real estate and insurance offices, medical & dental
professionals, etc).
The City has not had the kind of housing development that attracts executives to locate here.
Since corporate executives and professionals tend to locate their offices near their homes, the
lack of housing opportunities helps reduce demand for professional and corporate office space.
It is assumed that the City will have sufficient office-zoned land to accommodate and encourage
the addition of new corporate office tenants and additional suburban office space, and the City
will have sufficient and “appropriate” housing to attract office tenants, that some public
intervention or public-private partnerships may be required to enhance the marketability of
downtown office space.
Definitions
• Class A Office Space: New and recently built building with elevator, lobby, amenities,
and medium finish.
• Class B Office Space: Similar finish to Class A, but older building (10-plus years) with
fewer amenities.
• Class C Office Space: Older building, fair to poor quality, few amenities.

Strategies and Recommendations
O D 1. Develop a Downtown Office Niche Incentive Marketing Strategy
The City represents such a large share of the Wayne County office market. In order to attract
these niche tenants, the initial marketing strategy would focus on Richmond’s uptown business
district, which projects the unique image of the City to potential tenants. Office will be
considered a key component of the Downtown revitalization plan. The interaction of office and
retail uses is a secondary basis for attracting office uses to the Downtown.
O D 2. Identify and Market to Potential Tenants
The revitalization strategy will identify specific target office tenants for the Wayne County
Economic Development Corporation and Main Street Richmond-Wayne County to recruit for
the Downtown. Among the most appropriate first-phase tenants would be educational
institutions, non-profit arts and cultural organizations, financial services, architects, engineers,
and other professional tenants.
O D 3. Promote Mixed-Use Development in Outlying Locations
In order to ensure that the character of potential office areas is protected and enhanced, the City
should allow for and promote mixed-use development in these outlying areas in an orderly
fashion. The overall market preference is for mixed uses, especially retail. The current exception
would include planned, landscaped office parks, with natural amenities.

APRIL 2006 | RICHMOND, INDIANA | 86

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

O D 4. Promote Office and Mixed-Use Development
The Planning Department works with property owners and developers to plan on office-retail
developments that provide a mixed-use commercial environment.
O D 5. Consider Density Bonus
The City should consider a density bonus to encourage mixed-use commercial development. This
would be treated as a Conditional Use or Overlay District that would also require higher design
standards and quality materials. This could necessitate placing a density cap on existing
commercial districts.

F. Retail Development
Issues and Findings
The City has a total of about 431 retail businesses as
of 2005, according to InfoUSA, ESRI inventories.
Much of this inventory is located along the eastern
portion of Richmond’s US 40, along the northern
edge of the US 27 corridor, and downtown.
Almost 90% of the consumers from the Downtown
area shop at Wal-Mart’s Superstore, Meijer, or other
competitive location. In order to attract consumers
back to the downtown, Richmond’s residents and
meeting participants indicate that they would like to
have more entertainment, recreational, retail,
grocery, and restaurant choices. Richmond
consumers are adamant that the real strength of the
downtown is its base of independent, home grown
stores. They would prefer not to see the addition of
more chains to Uptown because it would detract
from its unique “Downtown” quality. Uptown was
once the commercial hub for the City of Richmond.
Main Street
The City was not only the hub for government and
Source: Main Street Richmond-Wayne County
finance, but also had the main concentration of
destination retail stores that attracted shoppers from
throughout the County and beyond. Uptown has a significant portion of the area’s retail and
other commercial businesses.
The retail summary includes the largest supply categories of retail trade in automobile
dealerships, general merchandise stores, gasoline stations, grocery stores and full-service
restaurants. Unfortunately, competition and a changing retail industry have contributed to the
decentralized retail districts on the edges of Richmond, thereby creating a more difficult retail
environment in Downtown Richmond.
Commercial development is also occurring. A developer recently purchased thirty-three acres of
ground on the east side of Richmond -within the main commercial corridor. The land will be
developed into a multi-tenant development including Menards, Kohls, Frischs, Walgreens and
more. This development should occur in 2006. In addition, a former hotel was demolished and a
new car dealership is being located in Richmond. An abandoned Lowe’s building was recently
rehabbed into a Toyota Dealership.

APRIL 2006 | RICHMOND, INDIANA | 87

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

Issues
1.

Competition: An important issue for Uptown is the large-scale, rapidly emerging, strip
malls. Wal-Mart’s Superstore, combined with its attendant spin-off and “big box” retail,
is a major draw for Richmond residents. As such, competitive retail leads to “leakage” in
retail expenditures from Richmond to areas outside of the downtown.

2. Small Business Base: Uptown’s locally owned small businesses are an important part of
the “Downtown” image that is attractive to residents and visitors alike. However, small,
locally owned businesses lack the financial and marketing resources available to national
or regional chains, and are therefore more susceptible to competition and economic
downturns.
3. High Turnover: Downtown has seen higher than acceptable turnover rates. This is a
sign of underlying weaknesses resulting in part from competitive forces acting on the
City’s small business base and trade area population.
4. Merchandising and Marketing: Downtown would benefit from a comprehensive
merchandising, marketing, and targeting strategy to bolster the resources of individual
businesses that are otherwise acting alone. Lacking cooperative efforts among small
businesses, such businesses are more susceptible to the competition that results in
higher turnover.
5. Additional Anchors: Downtown is fortunate to have a downtown department store in
Elder Beerman that serves as the only major retail anchor. Several junior anchors such as
Kessler’s Sporting Goods and Bulderick’s Furniture generate impressive consumer trip
statistics as well. Many fine small retail businesses have loyal customers that frequent
their establishments also but downtown needs additional anchors that can help bolster
its competitiveness for destination demand. These anchors might come in the form of
non-retail uses but have drawing power from the trade area to bring additional
consumers into the downtown. Without access to the marketing resources available to
national or regional chains, the smaller independent local stores have difficulty reaching
the broader regional consumer market.
6. Visibility and Access: While I-70 is nearby, uptown lacks the kind of gateway access
and visibility of other towns, large and small that are located astride interstate highways
or other major regional access routes.
7. Role of Key Institutions: Downtown benefits from the presence of important
institutions, such as the Innovation Center, City and County government offices, and
large banks or financial institutions. Until recently, there was no comprehensive effort to
leverage the power of these institutions to strengthen downtown.

APRIL 2006 | RICHMOND, INDIANA | 88

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

Strategies and Recommendations
R D 1. Develop a Downtown Niche Marketing Strategy
The Downtown Niche Marketing Strategy is driven by the need to enhance Richmond’s Uptown
destination appeal in order to expand the local retail and other trade markets. This area must
increase its appeal to “inflow” consumers such as Richmond’s day-trippers and tourists from
outside of the Richmond’s market. By enhancing “in-flow,” the City can counteract some of the
leakage effect from local households to competitive retail nodes. Of Richmond’s retail nodes,
Uptown has the best opportunity for generating destination appeal and capturing in-flow sales,
in the short- and mid-term.
R D 2. Downtown Activity and Entertainment
A key finding from the stakeholder interviews, the survey results, and the results of the U-Plan
meetings was that existing downtown shoppers -and presumably many consumers who do not
currently shop in the downtown area-find that Uptown lacks “things to see or do.” One priority
for any comprehensive downtown marketing strategy would be to identify and establish a
program for enhancing downtown’s role as a destination center and an activity center for events,
entertainment, retail, restaurants, and other street activity on a regular basis.
Richmond already has a substantial thematic base on which to build. A strong building stock is
available to use for either commercial or entertainment ventures. Additionally, several, popular
community festivals contribute to the local economy annually.
R D 3. Tourism
For a small historic downtown with significant competition, a key marketing strategy is to build
on “inflow” from tourists and day-trippers from outside of the trade area. Key elements of this
strategy include the development of bed and breakfasts and small inns to help bolster the
community’s image as a quaint get-away near the big city. Restaurants, conference centers,
heritage corridors, and tourist attractions are also important marketing elements that should be
considered as part of a comprehensive marketing strategy for tourism.
R D 4. Attract Downtown Anchors
A comprehensive strategy will also address ways to attract or create anchors for Uptown.
Anchors are important as “drivers of destination” appeal and can include unique national and
regional chain stores, or a convention center. Large local specialty stores, theaters (stage or film),
civic or cultural centers, art galleries, historic hotels, antique malls, factory stores, museums,
monuments, parks, or other strategic elements that can attract destination shoppers, tourists,
and day-trippers. A Plan should be developed to jointly address the specifics of how to recruit,
create, or develop appropriate anchors.
R D 5. Develop Educational/Institutional Partnerships and Programs
Technological and other university classes are held at the Richmond Innovation Center in
downtown Richmond. The Uptown stakeholders are currently exploring ways to continue the
vitalization of the downtown. Main Street Richmond-Wayne County has invested in providing
continuing education classes and it remains a resource and attraction for its students. The City,
Main Street Richmond-Wayne County, The Richmond-Wayne County Chamber of Commerce,
and financial institutions are working together to coordinate and maximize efforts to strengthen
Uptown. Area institutions, along with business and government, can also form additional
partnerships to finance improvements and marketing efforts.

APRIL 2006 | RICHMOND, INDIANA | 89

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

R D 6. Merchandising, Management, and Marketing Plan
A strategy to include merchandising plans should be developed to address specific marketing
issues relating to individual retailers as well as the overall marketing effort for Downtown in the
outlying areas. Management and marketing will be coordinated between and among downtown
businesses in the same way that a shopping center management company markets the center as
one entity, in order to create economies of scale in marketing, development, security, parking, or
other shared concerns.
R D 7. Entrepreneur Development Program
The Uptown’s key strength is its diverse collection of local, independent businesses. There is a
need to make certain technical resources available to existing and potential small businesses that
add value to the downtown retail mix. Such resources might include merchandising expertise,
business planning, market research, building improvement loans, and operating capital, which
are packaged to appeal to typical small business concerns. This program is currently being
coordinated by Main Street Richmond-Wayne County and the Small Business Development
Council. Main Street Richmond-Wayne County will also conduct pro-active efforts to identify
and recruit local residents as potential entrepreneurs to operate niche businesses, with the
assistance of the Wayne County Economic Development Corporation, Small Business
Development and the Richmond-Wayne County Chamber of Commerce. This program could be
financed through a special levy on downtown businesses (such as through a business
improvement district – BID) that might also be used to finance certain physical improvements
and services.
R D 8. Land Use Changes
The land use patterns in the Uptown area should encourage pedestrian activity. To do this, it is
preferable that retail uses be located on first floor spaces with office and other non-retail uses
located on upper floors.
R D 9. Enhance Gateways
In order to enhance the competitiveness of the City’s suburban retail areas, there is a need to
ensure a high-quality physical environment. These strategies will be prepared in City Images and
Identity.
R D 10. Design and Implement Streetscape Enhancement
Urban design improvements are appropriate along the City’s main commercial corridors,
particularly US 27 and US 40 that act as key gateways. The City will design streetscape
enhancements as part of a development plan and design guidelines for those corridors.
R D 11. Avoid Haphazard Development
The City will avoid haphazard, single-use, suburban, retail development along these corridors in
favor of mixed-use development (see office recommendations). The design guidelines will
respond to this issue.
R D 12. Develop Planned Business Overlay Zoning District
The City should broaden the Planning Business Overlay District to include retail and services
uses. This will provide a flexible zoning tool to accommodate large or unusual retail development
projects.

APRIL 2006 | RICHMOND, INDIANA | 90

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

R D 13. Conduct a Market Analysis and Market Plan for Retail Uses
The City of Richmond in conjunction with Main Street Richmond-Wayne County, the
Richmond-Wayne County Chamber of Commerce and the Wayne County Economic
Development Corporation should conduct a market study to develop an inventory, analyze the
market for retail development, target geographic locations, and develop a Strategic Plan of Action
for recruiting and maintaining retail uses.
R D 14. Manage Retail Development through Zoning
Retail development is an important component of the City’s economic base and is necessary to
meeting residents’ needs for goods and services. The City will support retail development that
meets community needs for goods and services. To ensure that such development does not overly
impact the community, a conditional/special use permit will be required for all retail
development in excess of 90,000 square feet, whether or not freestanding. The
conditional/special use permit will be issued based upon fulfilling specific criteria (e.g. location
on a major arterial, demonstration of retail market demand through a market study; architectural
design, materials, landscaping, signage, exceptional site design and town planning principles,
plus traffic and access management, etc.).
R D 15. Encourage Retail Center Owners to Address Vacancy Issues
The City will work with retail center owners/managers to address ongoing tenant space
vacancies. The City will be vigilant relative to code enforcement to ensure such properties
continue to be well maintained.
R D 16. Develop an Information Clearing house for Retail Uses
The City of Richmond must develop and maintain an information-clearing house of retail uses,
vacancy rates, current leasing rates, trends in development, types of retail and locations. This
information should be readily accessible to the public.

G. Tourism
Issues and Findings
Tourism is flourishing in Richmond with a
strong potential for expansion and further
development. The Richmond Tourism
Market consists of various area attractions
including museums and historic sites within
the community, a county fair, and local
events celebrating Richmond’s heritage.
Tourists are attracted to the Indiana Antique
Malls, numerous parks, the Whitewater
River gorge and cardinal greenway trail.
Visitors to Richmond encounter a history

nature. Richmond has the history and
heritage of the early pioneers along the Old
National Road, slaves along the Underground Railroad, and America’s Amish community. The
many great outdoor places, wandering nature trails, tranquil golf courses, and adventurous
expeditions create a rich sense of place and destination.

APRIL 2006 | RICHMOND, INDIANA | 91

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

The City has an outstanding collection of historic buildings and sites, and significant
architecture that could be a focus of the tourism strategy. Richmond has preserved its
extraordinary collection of early 19th to early 20th century architecture. Richmond has one of the
finest early Victorian neighborhoods in the nation. The area also consists of late Federal and
Greek revival townhouses and cottages, early 19th century farm homes, sturdy barns, ornate
churches, mansions, and the majestic county courthouse.
The City and area is also rich in cultural history including jazz, rose gardens, civil war, and
Underground Railroad history. Another focus is the arts. The City is home to several arts-related
institutions including the Richmond Art Museum, Wayne County Historical Museum, Gaar
House and Farm Museum. Furthermore, there are art galleries, the Richmond Symphony
Orchestra, and the Civic Hall Performing Arts Center, Richmond Civic Theater and other local
theater venues. The arts could be expanded to include additional gallery spaces, artists lofts in
the Downtown, related businesses, and co-programming with Earlham College, and Indiana
University East/Purdue University.
The Richmond/Wayne County Chamber of Commerce and the Wayne County Convention &
Tourism Bureau have developed and direct the area’s tourism and visitor’s markets. There is a
welcome center located in Richmond for visitors, numerous lodging packages, a web site,
brochures, and other marketing information promoting the area’s attractions. Additional
infrastructure is needed. This would include more bed and breakfasts, and small inns in the City
that can host overnight guests. Additional restaurants and shopping in the Downtown are
needed to serve visitors. Below is a list of some of Richmond’s Tourism and Cultural Attractions.

Antique Alley Trails

Richmond has two Famous Antique Alley Trails. The first trail offers more than 900 dealers
along the Historic National Road (a National Scenic Byway) from Richmond to Knightstown
and circles back to Richmond on scenic SR 38 through New Castle, Hagerstown, and Green's
Fork. The streets of Cambridge City are dotted with antique and specialty shops. Trail #2 starts
on US 27 to many antique shops and malls offering an array of antiquing.

Historic National Road

The Historic National road was America’s
first interstate highway and was established
by an Act of Congress in 1806. The Indiana
portion, built between 1829 and 1834, linked
the eastern seashore with the western
interior. Today, the Indiana National Road
Association helps to preserve, protect, and
promote the Historic National Road. The
road was recently designated an AllAmerican Road. Driving the route evokes a

sense of traveling through the passageways of
history from the pike towns to the rural
pastures, showcasing genuine Midwest scenic beauty.

Joseph Moore Museum of Natural History

The museum features an Egyptian mummy and giant prehistoric mammals, a prehistoric
mastodon, allosaurus skeleton, and birds and mammals in their natural habitat.

Madonna of the Trail

In commemoration of pioneer mothers of the covered wagon days, this statue is the ninth link in
the Great National Shrine erected by the Daughters of the American Revolution along the
National Road Trail. There are only 12 statues linked along US 40 from Bethesda, Maryland, to
Upland, California. The Richmond statue was dedicated in 1928 by a little-known Missouri
judge, Harry S. Truman. The statue stands at the entrance of Glen Miller Park, US 40 E.

Murals

To celebrate Richmond's jazz heritage, four colorful murals have transformed building walls into
an outdoor art gallery in Richmond's uptown area.

Old Richmond Historic District
With more than 213 structures of historic importance, members of the Society of Friends, later by
free blacks and German immigrants, first settled this neighborhood. Enrolled on the National
Register of Historic Places, several significant structures were catalogued by the Historic
American Buildings Survey.

Richmond Art Museum
Founded in 1898, the fine art museum features Indiana artists and American art including, T.C.
Steele, John E Bundy, Wayman Adams, Wm. Merritt Chase, Robert Reid, Childe Hassam and
Overbeck pottery.

Starr Historic District
The Starr District, listed on the National Register, was developed from farmland bought by
Charles and Elizabeth Starr from Jeremiah Cox, a Richmond founder. The land was subdivided
into lots in the early 1850s and sold for residential construction. The homes reflect the early,
middle, and late Victorian periods of architectural styles, as well as additions of early 20th
century homes. This neighborhood was the home of many of Richmond’s business and industrial
leaders and is an excellent example of the life and times of that era. The district is cited as having
national significance because of its number of historic homes and the people who lived here.

Gaar House and Farm Museum

This Victorian Second Empire style mansion is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
The Mansion was built in 1876 at a cost of $20,000 and boasts hand-painted ceilings, parquet
floors, and 90% original furniture. On display, is an 1870s Gaar-Scott portable steam engine. The
garden features a gazebo and is available for weddings and receptions.

Indiana Football Hall of Fame

Dedicated to the sport and its Indiana heroes, the Football Hall of Fame features displays and
memorabilia from Indiana high school, collegiate and professional athletes. A personal tour guide
could be Lamar Lundy, one of the L.A. Ram’s former “Fearsome Foursome!”

Wayne County Historical Museum
The Julia Meek Gaar collection features curiosities from around the world: authentic Egyptian
mummy, Gaar-Scott Steam Engines, Starr-Gennett Jazz Collection, Davis airplane, Wooten desk,
pioneer life exhibits, the early automobile collection of Richmond-made cars, and much more!
Special celebrations include Pioneer Harvest Festival and Christmas at the Museum.

Starr Piano Company & Gennett Recording Industry

Hoosier, Hoagy Carmichael is quoted in his biography, “Sometimes I Wonder” as stating “The
birthplace of recorded jazz was a rambling brick building on the banks of the Whitewater River
gorge on the edge of downtown Richmond, Indiana.” The factory was the home plant of the Starr
Piano Company. Tucked away in one unused corner was the tiny phonograph-recording studio
that the firm called its Gennett Records division. It was primitive, simple and effective . . . And
truly a pioneer.”

Starr Piano Factory

In 1872, an organization of prominent businessmen headed by James M. Starr began
manufacturing pianos in a small factory near the Whitewater River. At this time, the city had
two banks, a public library, and gas lighting. The next year, when the first piano was produced,
Richmond became the county seat of Wayne County and had a population of 10,000. The first
structure built for the piano works was a two-story pitched roof building. Over the next fifty
years, some thirty additional structures were added. Today, all but one of those buildings are
gone, but a portion of the original 1872 Starr Piano Factory building remains, a silent reminder of
a bygone era.

Strategies and Recommendations
T M 1. Strengthen Wayne County’s Overall Tourism Development. Stimulate increased
overnight visitation to this area through new and/or existing product development and

H. Economic Incentives
Issues and Findings
The City in conjunction with the Wayne County Economic Development Corporation offers
many economic incentive programs to retain and recruit businesses. The City of Richmond has
many incentive programs and tools to encourage and support economic development,
entrepreneurship, and business expansion and retention. This section lists and describes many of
the existing tools and programs.

Economic Incentive Programs
Businesses thrive and grow in Richmond/Wayne County where a strong community/business
partnership offers new and existing companies an important financial edge. Here, new and
expanding firms discover a wealth of tangible financial opportunities from low government and
operating costs to a variety of incentive and business assistance programs.

Tax Increment Financing (TIF)

The City of Richmond uses the Tax Increment Financing as an economic develop tool to generate
property tax revenues attributable to increases in assessed value (AV). The City of Richmond
Tax Increment Finance District is an economic development area to promote economic
development, plus to create and retain jobs in Richmond. The TIF area includes most of the
northwest corridor south of I-70 and west of US 27 It also includes most of the Uptown area and
properties along US 40 on the north side and east of S. 18th Street.

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

Increases in Assessed Value (AV) occur when private development takes place in a defined
geographical area designated by local government. When a TIF area is created, the AV is frozen.
As development occurs, the property taxes paid on the increase in the AV are captured and can
be used to pay for infrastructure improvements, debt payments on bonds issued to facilitate the
development, and a variety of other costs incurred to generate additional development in the
designated area. The Richmond TIF District provides the tax incentives to businesses. There are
two types of TIF districts – a redevelopment area and an economic development area. The
redevelopment area can only be established if certain criteria are met. There must be a finding
that the area is blighted and normal development would not occur unless the TIF district is
created. Factors that determine blight are no growth, deterioration of improvements, and
substandard buildings. An economic development area can be created to generate or retain jobs.
A declaratory resolution is passed establishing a TIF district, and then the assessed values of that
geographic area are frozen. When development occurs, the increase in the value of the area is
multiplied by the tax rate. The difference between the property tax revenue collected on the base
assessed value, and the increase in the assessed value due to development, is the “increment.”
The TIF district in Richmond is 2.55 acres or 16.75% of the total land area of the City. City Limit
encompasses 23.821 square miles or 15,245 acres

The Urban Enterprise Zone
Over the past several decades, state and local governments have become more active in
promoting economic development, and Enterprise Zones (EZs) have become a common tool. The
City of Richmond‘s Urban Enterprise Zone was established in 1984. The purpose of the
enterprise zone program is to stimulate local community and business redevelopment in
distressed areas.
Zone Benefits:
• Property Tax Credit (Enterprise Zone Inventory)
• Gross Income Tax Exemption
• Credit for Qualified Increased Employment
• Deduction for Qualified Employee (Employee must reside within the zone)
• Enterprise Zone Investment Cost Credit
• Industrial Recovery Site – Investment Cost Credit & Inventory Tax Abatement
• Low Interest Loan Funds
• Project Design and Development Assistance
Agency: Richmond Urban Enterprise Association (UEA)
The day-to-day operation of each EZ is managed by a local nonprofit entity called an Urban
Enterprise Association (UEA). Each business that obtains EZ tax incentives must contribute to
the local UEA through a business participation fee equal to a percentage of the incentives
received during the year. Thus, the tax incentives serve as both a business recruitment tool and
the source of funding for the UEAs, thereby determining the funding available for various
community and economic development programs that may be pursued by the association.

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

Forty-three states currently provide incentives for businesses to locate or expand in these
distressed and blighted areas, which are often traditional downtown areas or old industrial and
manufacturing areas that have gone through a protracted period of decline. Typically, EZ
incentives consist of tax instruments, such as property tax abatements, income tax deductions
and credits for employment creation, capital investment, and income creation in the EZs. At the
present time, Indiana has twenty-five municipal Ezs with EZs located on closed military bases.
Indiana’s Enterprise Zone (EZ) This program was established in 1983 and allows EZs to be
located in municipalities or on closed military bases. The Indiana Economic Development
Corporation (IEDC) administers the EZ Program, and has the power to review and approve
applications for proposed EZs, renew existing EZs, and monitor EZ operations and incentive
use. EZs are designated based on demographic, socioeconomic, and geographic size criteria. The
initial designation period for an EZ is ten years, with EZs eligible for two five-year renewals
based on performance reviews by the IEDC Board. In addition, the IEDC Board may designate
EZs that have operated for a full twenty-year period for a new term with an initial ten-year
designation period. The IEDC Board is currently authorized to designate two new municipal EZs
each year until December 31, 2015.
Enterprise Zone Incentives
The following describe the tax incentives, which serve as recruitment tools for the EZs.
Inventory Tax Credit: This credit eliminates the property tax on wholesale or retail merchandise
being held for resale as well as finished goods maintained by a business in an EZ. Before 2004, it
also eliminated property tax on work-in-process and raw materials incorporated in finished
goods for shipment out of state. Such inventory was exempted from property tax statewide
beginning in 2004. More importantly, the credit will be inoperative beginning in 2007, once the
inventory tax is eliminated statewide through the 100 percent inventory deduction.
Investment Cost Credit: This is a state tax credit for equity investment in an EZ business. The
credit is equal to a maximum of 30 percent of the price of the ownership interest purchased by
the taxpayer. The allowable credit percentage, up to 30 percent, varies depending upon the type
of investment, the type of business, and the number of jobs created by the investment.
Employment Expense Credit: This is a state tax credit for incremental wages paid by an EZ
business to employees who are EZ residents. At least 90 percent of the employee’s services must
be directly related to the EZ business, and at least 50 percent of the employee’s time must be
spent working at the EZ business. The credit is equal to 10 percent of the additional wages paid
to qualified employees during the year, up to $1,500 per qualified employee.
Loan Interest Credit: This is a state tax credit for interest income earned by a taxpayer from a
loan that directly benefits an EZ business, increases EZ property values, or is used to rehabilitate,
repair, or improve an EZ residence. The credit is equal to 5 percent of the loan interest received
during the year.

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

Property Tax Investment Deduction: This is a new deduction enacted during the 2005
legislative session, and it became effective July 1, 2005. It is a property tax deduction for the
increased value of an EZ business property due to real and personal property investment by the
business. The added valuation may be deducted for up to ten years. Qualified investment at an
EZ location includes: (1) purchase of a building, new manufacturing or production equipment, or
new computers and related office equipment; (2) costs associated with the repair, rehabilitation,
or modernization of an existing building and related improvements; (3) onsite infrastructure
improvements; (4) construction of a new building; and (5) costs associated with retooling
existing machinery.
The Richmond Urban Enterprise Zone is bound by the Whitewater River on the west, New
Paris Pike on the North, on the south by South A from South 2nd to South 18 and the eastern
border follow North 22nd Street from Main to North D.

Economic Development for a Growing Economy (EDGE)
The Economic Development for a Growing Economy (EDGE) program was created to reward
companies creating new jobs and contributing to the growth of Indiana income. EDGE credits
are calculated as a percentage of payroll tax withholding for net new Indiana jobs. EDGE credits
may be awarded for a term of up to ten years. Indiana individual income tax withholdings from
company employees can be credited against the company’s Indiana corporate income tax
liability. Excess withholdings shall be refunded to the company. The credits have no effect on an
employee’s income tax liability. The project must create new, competitively paying jobs for
Indiana residents. Credits are considered when a project would otherwise locate in a different
state, and when local governments have committed significant incentives. Companies agree to
operate in the state for at least twice as long as the duration of the credit. The credit awarded can
be a fixed amount per year or a percentage of taxes withheld (maximum of approximately 3.1% of
new payroll). Credits can be awarded for a period up to ten years. Agency: Indiana Department of
Commerce, Business Development Division

Other Programs
Brownfield’s Redevelopment Program
A brownfield is typically an abandoned or underutilized piece of property that often has an
industrial or commercial history, although not all brownfields are former industrial or
commercial sites. Redevelopment of these properties is difficult due to the potential for or actual
presence of environmental contamination. Through site investigation, assessment and
remediation, these properties have been transformed either into thriving businesses that add to
the tax base, or into community facilities or valuable parks and greenspaces.
Grants and low-interest loans from the Brownfields Fund are directly available to cities, towns,
and counties. Grants of up to $50,000 are available for environmental site assessments, and lowinterest loans (2.5% to 3.0% interest rate) are available for remediation, selective demolition, and
additional assessment. Additionally, brownfield sites that either have underground storage tanks
or are located within one-half mile of a school or licensed child care facility may qualify to have
up to 20% of the total loan amount forgiven. Cleanup grants of up to $250,000 are available for
the remediation of brownfield sites with petroleum contamination, and an Indiana state tax
credit is available to offset the expense of voluntary remediation at eligible brownfield sites. In
1997, the IFA became the administrator of Indiana's Brownfield Revolving Loan Fund. The initial
$10 million fund capitalization, and subsequent appropriations and transfers by the Indiana
General Assembly, has greatly enhanced brownfield assessment and cleanup efforts in Indiana. In
cooperation with the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM), local
governments, developers, environmental consultants and other interested parties, Indian Finance
Authority’s Brownfield’s financing incentives play an important role in supporting brownfield
projects statewide.

the original structures still remain. Widely supported plans for the redevelopment of this site
have taken shape within recent years and include a biking/hiking trail, a jazz museum, and an
outdoor amphitheater. The overall goal of the project is to not only create an outdoor recreation
area, but to promote the history and heritage of the music industry once located in Richmond.

the local recapture of certain state and local tax revenue that can be invested in the development
of the park.
Industrial Development Grant Fund
The IDEC provides financial support for infrastructure improvements in conjunction with
projects creating jobs and generating capital investment in Indiana.
This grant provides money to local governments for off-site infrastructure projects associated
with an expansion of an existing Indiana company or the location of a new facility in Indiana.
State funding through the IDGF program must be matched by a combination of local government
and company financial support.
Industrial Recovery Tax Credit
The Industrial Recovery tax credit provides an incentive for companies to invest in facilities
requiring significant rehabilitation or remodeling expense. After a building has been designated
as an industrial recovery site, companies may be eligible for a tax credit calculated as a
percentage of qualified rehabilitation expense.

Strategies and Recommendations
The City is to establish a policy that ensures a sufficient return for the City, which is relative to
employment and tax revenue to justify and/or structure incentive packages. Incentives are limited and
should be strategically utilized and targeted. It may not be in the City’s best interest to offer a full
incentive package to a company that generates a limited return to the city.

This may also include targeting specific business sectors that hold the most promise for longterm growth, as well as companies with a sound business track record of success. Numerous
examples can be found locally and throughout the state.
Likewise, incentives should not be awarded to businesses that are proposing projects, which are
inconsistent with the Comprehensive Plan relative to land use, density, infrastructure, and
related policies. The City should not encourage business development that conflicts with the
community’s long-term vision as reflected in the Plan.
E I 1. Ensure Consistency with the Comprehensive Plan
It is critical that companies seeking economic incentives and inducements must propose projects
that are consistent with the Comprehensive Plan. This consistency is measured relative to land
use, density, location, infrastructure, development character, and timing of development. Such
consistency will support the vision encompassed in the Plan.
E I 2. Address Inconsistencies
Projects that are substantially inconsistent with the Plan will not be considered for economic
incentives unless City Council determines that the inconsistencies do not outweigh the potential
economic benefits to the community. In those situations, Council will formally amend the Plan’s
future land use map and policies.

for an economic incentive. If these proposed minimums were applied to 700 acres, manufacturing
uses in that area would generate about $1 million in taxes to the City (based on 35 sites on an

An ordinance is considered by City Council to require that minimum fiscal returns are met to
qualify for economic incentives.
E I 5. Continue to Package Incentives
The Economic Development Corporation continues to evaluate economic proposals and
assembles incentive packages that meet business needs while fulfilling the City’s economic
priorities. These are presented to City Council for approval.
E I 6. Establish Priorities
Priority will be given to companies that are consistent with the economic, land use, and
infrastructure policies of the Comprehensive Plan.
E I 7. Promote More Tax Increment Financing (TIF)
TIF’s have become one of the most promoted and preferred economic incentive tools in Indiana.
This is partly due to the decline of available local, state, and federal dollars to provide grants and
loans to qualifying businesses. TIF’s capture the net increase in property taxes that result from
investments and direct it to a fund to pay for related public infrastructure. It is a preferred tool
for office, commercial, and industrial development, and Uptown revitalization that require
infrastructure improvements.
E I 8. Promote TIF Districts
The Economic Development Corporation will promote the use of TIF’s for qualifying economic
development projects, especially in those projects where significant public infrastructure is
necessary. TIF agreements are presented to City Council for approval.
E I 9. Establish Priorities
Priority will be given to companies that are consistent with the economic, land use, and
infrastructure policies of the Comprehensive Plan.

PURPOSE__________________________________________

The Elkhart Urban Renewal Plan was created and adopted in 1985 and a supplement to
the plan was adopted in 1986. The plan identifies the boundaries of the Urban Renewal
Area and states that this designated area does not have the ability to be successfully
redeveloped with normal private or public investment. The area was identified in both
the "Greater Elkhart Neighborhood Development Program" and as a target in the
Community Development Program. The overall objective of the Downtown Urban
Renewal Plan is to declare this area a portion of an existing tax increment financing
(TIF) district so it can directly benefit from any new investment (see Map 1).
When approved, the Downtown Redevelopment Plan will be amended to the current
Urban Renewal Plan. This addition to the existing plan is necessary for four primary
reasons:

1.)

The business climate in downtown Elkhart has changed since the
Urban Renewal Plan was adopted. Industrial uses are continuing to
move further from downtown, leaving the area plagued with brownfields. The
downtown areas has also suffered the loss of large office employers, while at
the same time development continues to sprawl north toward Interstate 8090. In addition, incompatible land uses (such as homeless shelters, light
industrial facilities, and warehouses) have created an unappealing
environment for attracting new businesses and people into downtown.
Further complicating the downtown area are the significant troubles of the
Quality Hotel, which is frequently cited by reSidents as a Significant "problem
property" in downtown.

2)

The new RivelWalk Greenway, designed by Woolpert, will stimulate
exciting new opportunities in downtown. New visions for downtown
Elkhart include a riverwalk which will provide a high-amenity recreational
facility needed to attract additional visitors and patrons to downtown. The
proposed Riverwalk Greenway will provide a strong impetus for new
development, and will strengthen the use of the Elkhart River as a natural
amenity. The riverwalk will be able to provide strong overall linkages
between various uses (both existing and proposed) within the downtown
area.

3)

Other recent projects have increased the attractiveness of the
central business district (CBO) to potential developers. The plaza and
clock tower along Main Street, combined with the recent renovation of the
Elco Theater present amenities which will increase the attractiveness of
downtown as a possible site for new investment. However, despite these
positive new investments to the downtown area, many believe that
downtown Elkhart still lacks a clear definition. Retail development throughout
Elkhart has been scattered, with no significant concentration, which
diminishes the City's overall retail identity. If downtown is successful at
attracting new retail uses, it could improve the overall retail image within the

-3-

City. Therefore, it is essential that new improvements and amenities in
downtown be considered in a redevelopment strategy so that they can be
marketed to attract additional development downtown.

4)

By focusing initial efforts and resources within a specific portion of

the Urban Renewal Area, positive results will be more visible and
create a stronger overall impact. The Downtown Redevelopment Plan
emphasizes a designated "impact zone" within the redevelopment boundaries
to focus initial revitalization efforts, as shown in the Conceptual Development
segment of this document. The impact zone is roughly bounded by Main
Street to the west, Jackson Boulevard and Lexington Avenue to the north,
Prairie Court to the east, and Elkhart River to the south and southeast (see
Map 2). Focusing initial redevelopment activities within a concentrated area is
the initial step that will spark new investment by private entities through the
entire Urban Renewal Area and TIF district. This effort will assist downtown
as it works to reclaim its hold as the "focal point" of the region.
This Downtown Redevelopment Plan will serve as an amendment to the existing Urban
Renewal Plan. This document is intended for approval by the City of Elkhart
Redevelopment Commission in accordance with Indiana Code 36-7-14. The Downtown
Redevelopment Plan will serve as the road map for reversing the signs of blight and
disinvestment in downtown Elkhart, and enhancing the overall mix of uses to bring more
people into the downtown area. This plan will help guide the Redevelopment

Commission and City of Elkhart in attracting new investment to the
downtown area.

II.

GOALS AND OBJECTIVES,_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ __

The overriding goal of the Downtown Redevelopment Plan is to facilitate and
encourage reinvestment and redevelopment in downtown Elkhart, specifically
within the designated impact zone. Reinvestment will be in the form of new
housing, commercial development, entertainment/recreational opportunities, and civic
uses which will provide an attractive, pedestrian-friendly environment for both residents
and visitors. The result will be an environmental conducive to attracting local private
investment, and setting a trend for healthy growth.
Specific objectives of the Downtown Redevelopment Plan are as follows:
1)

Utilize the Elkhart and St. Joseph Rivers as a downtown amenity and a
community resource.

2)

Utilize land downtown to its maximum potential, or "highest and best
economic use," in a manner which blends private and public uses.

3)

Encourage new investment in the impact zone to strengthen the investment
climate in the entire downtown.

4)

Increase the local tax base.

5)

Increase the downtown resident population.

6)

Enhance the overall appearance of the downtown to attract new investment
and new patrons.

7)

Make downtown Elkhart a "destination point" for the city, county and region.

8)

Eliminate pockets of disinvestment, detrimental influences and environmental
concerns.

9)

Remove inappropriate land uses currently within the downtown area, such as
industrial sites and warehouses.

10)

Incorporate an "arts and culture theme" into downtown revitalization efforts.

11)

Enhance the overall security and public safety in the downtown area.

12)

Use limited public resources to leverage Significant new private investment in
the downtown area. Every one dollar of public investment should strive for
attracting four to ten dollars of private investment.

MARKET OVERVIEW_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ __

Interest in three major land use categories guided the research in the market
assessment. Projected demographic data was essential in completing an Elkhart Market
Assessment. A separate document was produced which profiles and analyzes the market
for new development in housing, retail and office uses. This section highlights the major
findings from this larger study.
Statistics indicate an additional 800 households are expected in the City of Elkhart
between 1995 and 2000, with an additional 1,600 new households in the city between
2000 and 2010. Similar to national trends which reflect the aging "baby boom" cohort,
the fastest growing age cohorts are those 45-64 and those 65 and over. At the county
level, Elkhart County is expected to gain over 12,000 adults over the age of 65 by the
year 2020.
This significant population gain, coupled with antiCipated shifts in specific age cohorts at
both the city and county level, will impact the future growth and development of
downtown Elkhart. Three specific development opportunities were examining in detail:
the housing market, retail/hotel market, and office market. The key findings from each
sector are presented below.

HOUSING
With population increasing, the demand for housing also grows. Local real estate
specialists state the number of single-family homes currently for sale in the City of
Elkhart is the lowest it has been in 15 years. New single-family housing construction
outside the city limits outnumbers that occurring within the City of Elkhart. The diversity
of housing types in Elkhart is extremely limited. A diverse housing stock is essential for
the overall health of a City, particularly one in a region experiencing significant economic
growth and expansion such as Elkhart. If Elkhart is unable to provide a range of housing
options able to accommodate the changing needs of its workforce and reSidents, it may
lose some of its expected growth, as people will leave to find more suitable housing
elsewhere.
The supply of condominiums is virtually non-existent in the city, and apartment
construction has been minimal over the past five years. The three existing housing
complexes devoted to special needs populations (elderly and disabled) are all operating
at full occupancy with a waiting list. An assessment of existing downtown housing shows
that approximately 1,500 rental households within the immediate downtown
neighborhoods are spending over 30% of their income on rent, and thus not living in
affordable housing.
For the past decade, housing supply has not kept pace with the increasing housing
demand in the City of Elkhart. New housing represents the strongest immediate
market for new development opportunities. Housing would be a strong investment
for the entire Elkhart community, but can be an extremely important asset for the
downtown district. Three types of housing appear to be in greatest demand in Elkhart
and all are appropriate for downtown:

-7-

1)

Affordable housing: In Elkhart, wages for typical "blue-collar" jobs, such as
manufacturing, wholesale trade, construction, and transportation/utilities,
have been stagnant and some sectors are experiencing a decrease in real
wages. This fact, combined with the number of surrounding neighborhood
households that do not have access to affordable housing, indicates that
quality affordable housing is a necessity to the health of the community. It
should also be noted that if Elkhart expects to attract new retail,
entertainment, and service establishments, it needs to be able to maintain an
adequate supply of housing affordable for this labor force.

2)

Senior living facilities: There will be an increased demand for special
arrangement residential units in the form of nursing homes and assisted
living apartments in Elkhart's future. The largest boom is expected for
housing suited for empty nesters and senior citizens. Within Elkhart County,
there will be over 3,000 more people over age 65 from 2000 to 2010. Within
that same time period, the number of people age 45-64 will increase by over
10,000, providing an even larger number of senior citizens in the following
decade. Given that the city's existing senior citizen housing facilities are
operating at full capacity, the city will be experiencing a severe shortage
within the next five to ten years.

3)

Condominiums. Nearly all housing in the CBD is rental. The development of
modest condominiums may serve the community's young, empty nesters,
and a segment of the senior citizen population. The success of York Woods
demonstrates there may still be a demand for upscale housing close to the
CBD. Currently, less than 100 condominium units are available in Elkhart (less
than one percent of the city's total housing stock). Furthermore, only two
condominium units have been constructed in the city over the past 12 years.

RETAIL AND HOTEL
The City of Elkhart captures less than half of residents' shopping dollars; for every dollar
spent by Elkhart reSidents, only $.50 is spent within the city limits. At the same time, the
City of Elkhart is capturing a smaller percentage of county-wide retail sales. In 1994, 60
percent of all county sales occurred within Elkhart city limits. By 1996, this figure
dropped to 55 percent, reflecting the increase of new shopping centers in outlying
areas.
Elkhart residents are leaving the city to get their needed goods and services. Even
though Elkhart's buying power has steadily increased over the past decade, the number
of retail establishments in the city has declined. The city's overall buying power is
increasing, however, total retail sales (in constant dollars) have declined by six percent
from 1994 to 1996.
Downtown Elkhart's retail environment is composed primarily of small, locally-owned
specialty stores and services with no major retail attraction. Downtown must compete

-8-

with seven community-sized shopping centers, five plazas, and two regional shopping
malls all within close proximity.

Sufficient gains in population and job growth have not led to substantial
gains in retail trade development in the City of Elkhart. Retail development has
been relatively scattered with no concentration. If substantial retail development does
occur in downtown, it could create a needed "retail destination point" and improve the
city's retail image.
Demand for new retail development downtown
segments of the population: nearby neighborhood
their employees, and tourists and special events
such as office, hotel and housing, will dictate the
retail development.

will ultimately be driven by three
residents, downtown businesses and
populations. Other downtown uses,
overall magnitude and scale of new

The hotel market will be driven by a combination of the business sector and tourism and
special events populations. Growth in white-collar industries, combined with the
downtown amenities such as the Riverwalk Greenway will make a hotel/business center
development an attractive, successful addition to downtown Elkhart. Even though
Elkhart has over 1,000 rooms in franchised hotels and motels, most are located north of
the City, near the Interstate 80-90 interchange. Market findings suggest three is enough
demand to support a moderate scale hotel and business center in downtown.

OFFICE
Strong growth is expected in office-related industries at the county level. Over the next
15 years, a total of 5,1000 new jobs will be added in finance, insurance, real estate, and
professional services within Elkhart County. Even if only a small portion of this
antiCipated industry growth chooses to locate in downtown Elkhart, there will be a
sizable demand for office space in downtown. For example, if only 10 percent of these
new jobs come to downtown, there will be demand for approximately 20,000 square
feet of additional office space by the year 2010.
The current downtown office vacancy rate is 15 percent (Summer 1997), yet much of
this vacancy can be attributed to ineffiCient, inadequate space in older buildings. The
most recent new "small scale" office development in the downtown area, Waterfall
Villages, has enjoyed success with nearly 100 percent occupancy. This office complex
also has benefited by being situated along the Elkhart River, and incorporating the use
of this amenity in the layout and design of the office space.
Strong antiCipated growth in office related sectors will lead to opportunities for new
office development. However, if left to prevailing market forces, most new office
development will not come downtown. The City of Elkhart will need to develop an
aggressive marketing strategy that promotes downtown as "the place to be" and
emphasizes the convenience of support services and amenities to attract new office
development downtown.

IV.

CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ __

Discussions with downtown property owners, business leaders, and city staff members
helped determine which specific sites demonstrate potential for new investment. The
criteria for identifying priority areas for redevelopment included:

1)
2)
3)
4)

Areas of blight and/or disinvestment
Vacant land parcels
Areas which link to other city initiatives
Parcels which can easily be acquired or have responsive owners
fl

The result was a deSignated "impact zone which will act as the initial core of the
redevelopment efforts. This area contains the Quality Hotel property, property south of
the Jackson Boulevard Bridge directly along both sides of the river and Waterfall Drive,
the East Bank site, and industrial land directly east of the East Bank site and south of
Jackson Boulevard.
Map 2 on the following page highlights the existing Urban Renewal Area, along with the
designated impact zone. Future consideration might be given to expanding the Urban
Renewal area, along with the existing TIF district, to include parcels which more closely
correspond with future anticipated development activities. Other properties within the
Urban Renewal Area were identified as potential independent manageable projects and
future redevelopment areas. However, for the Downtown Redevelopment Plan, the
emphasis will be focused primarily within the designated impact zone.

SITE INVENTORY AND ANALYSIS
The land west of the Elkhart River within the impact zone includes the hotel property
and a public plaza with a clock tower and underground parking lot. The blocks north of
the hotel/plaza area consist primarily of parking lots and retail and service oriented
businesses located in older, mUlti-story structures. Most of the structures are in
relatively good condition, and some are believed to be historically significant. Others are
in need of minor repair, or may need to be removed if the redevelopment vision for
downtown is to be successful. Adjacent to the impact zone on the south area the historic
Elco Theater currently undergoing renovation, the pOlice station and a multi-level
parking deck.
The key issue with properties west of the Elkhart River will be linking the businesses
along Main Street with the river and the new development uses expected to occur along
it. The middle portion of the impact zone consists of the East Bank site, vacant land near
Clark Street and Jackson Boulevard, and the "triangle area" bounded by Jackson
Boulevard, Clark Street, and Elkhart Avenue. The East Bank site is primarily unimproved
land with the exception of two vacant industrial buildings near the Elkhart Avenue
Bridge. Because the East Bank site is a large, primarily vacant lot, and is located along
the river, it represents a significant development opportunity. However, environmental
concerns have surfaced about the site, particularly the closer one gets to Jackson
Boulevard.
The "triangle area" between Clark Street, Elkhart Avenue and Jackson Boulevard
contains automobile-related businesses such as body shops, engine repair, and car
detailing. Scattered residential properties and various other small businesses are also in
this area. These structures vary in condition. Old, abandoned vehicles are prevalent
throughout this portion of the impact zone.
The land east of Elkhart Avenue is utilized mostly by large industrial facilities. The
southern portion of the site is occupied by two structures utilized by Burnstine's
Distribution. The Elkhart Foundry owns and occupies a sizable lot in this portion of the
impact zone. There is a large building utilized by the foundry in addition to a couple of
accessory structures. North of the foundry and south of Lexington Avenue are additional
automobile-related businesses that mirror those between Elkhart Avenue and Clark
Street.

CURRENT CHANGES

The proposed Riverwalk Greenway calls for changes to the existing land use pattern and
circulation system in downtown Elkhart. Riverwalk plans include closing Waterfall Drive
between Franklin Street and Jackson Boulevard. High Street and Lexington Avenue will
terminate with a cul-de-sac along the western edge of the Elkhart River to provide
continued access to businesses in this area.
The Riverwalk Greenway also suggests the removal of the existing Quality Hotel. The
future of the hotel property is debatable. One set of plans calls for the site to house a
new, better equipped hotel which utilizes the river and the new amenities in downtown
Elkhart. Others have the site becoming public space to compliment the existing plaza on
Main Street.
A pedestrian bridge will be constructed connecting the existing pedestrian outlook
(located at the end of High Street) to the East Bank property. The walkway and
landscaping improvements will be constructed on the East Bank, and an additional
pedestrian bridge will cross the existing intake on the east side. The walk will be
extended further north toward Jackson Boulevard.
PROPOSED LAND USE DISTRICTS

The conceptual land use plan (Map 4) proposes a mixture of "development districts" on
the west side of the Elkhart River to. take advantage of the proposed Riverwalk
Greenway. The land use mix will create "market synergy" because it insures people will
be attracted to the area for a number of reasons. With the Riverwalk connecting the
east and west banks with a bridge designed for pedestrians only, there is potential to
create speCific "people places". The areas have been labeled "urban entertainment
nodes". These sites should be designed specifically as magnets to draw people
downtown. The nodes are bordered by retail uses and some housing.

It should be noted that these designated development districts shown on Map 4 may
contain more than one given use, provided that the uses are compatible with one
another. For example, an existing restaurant which might be located within a "retail
district" will not need to be relocated. A district labeled as "urban entertainment" does
not necessarily preclude some new housing from being built. The ultimate goal is to
make speCific uses within a district compatible with one another, and to maintain
compatibility between new and existing uses within these particular districts.

In an ideal world, everything east of the Elkhart River within the project
impact zone would be converted into developable land parcels. While this may
be unrealistiC, in any redevelopment scheme, the current land uses must change
significantly to support new development efforts along the river. The East Bank site
mirrors the location of the urban entertainment nodes on the west bank. The parcels
along Jackson Boulevard are best suited for retail uses because of their valuable
frontage along the heavily traveled thoroughfare. The land situated between the East
Bank site and Elkhart Avenue will be devoted primarily to housing.

- 17 -

The northeast corner of the impact zone represents a prime opportunity for mixed use
office and retail since it is bordered by a business incubator and a printing shop to the
north and a grocery store to the east. The amount and quality of investment in the land
owned and occupied by the Elkhart Foundry is extensive; therefore, it will be difficult
and expensive to acquire. For that reason, the foundry site has been labeled a long term
developable site. The property south of the foundry, now occupied by Burnstine's, is
suitable for a number of different developments. New office development would
compliment nearby Waterfall Villages. Urban entertainment would provide a link to the
East Bank site and the proposed Riverwalk.
Upon removal of the existing hotel, the Burnstine's site may also be appropriate for a
new hotel and business center. In fact, there are numerous options for the location of a
new hotel and business center. The old hotel property is one option. It could also be
beneficial to move the hotel to the south side of Franklin Street. The last option would
be to locate the center in the northwest corner of the impact zone between Lexington
Avenue and Jackson Boulevard on the west bank of the river.

DEFINED LAND USES

Urban Entertainment

Each "urban entertainment node" should be unique to
attract a variety of people to the downtown. Potential
activities may include an amphitheater, restaurants, a
public outdoor garden, bars or nightclubs, a fountain,
and/or an outdoor sculpture gallery. Some of the spaces
should be publicly-owned, while others could be private
businesses. The spaces should work together to attract a
variety of users at different times of day, and different
times of the year.

Residential

Residential uses on the west bank should be urban in
scale. Top floor apartments above specialty retail shops
are the most appropriate housing for this area. These
apartments will provide residents to convenient access to
downtown activities. The housing on the East Bank site,
however, will differ considerably from that on the west
bank. East Bank residential uses should contain a mix of
styles, type and tenure. However, emphasis will be placed
on market rate units targeted towards elderly and
professionals. Apartments, condominiums and single family
homes will exist in harmony on the east bank.

Retail

Any new retail development should complement the
existing retail development in downtown. The new
development should be small, locally owned specialty
shops similar to the types of businesses that already exist
on Main Street. Larger retail uses may be developed as
part of a larger, mixed-use development initiative (i.e. a
new hotel/business center along with retail shops).

Office

New office space in downtown should be different than
that now existing in large, older buildings. New office
development must have Class A amenities (safety features,
technology capabilities, etc.). Office space along the rivers
in downtown should complement the Waterfall Villages
project. However, other office development projects within
the core area should be more "urban" in design, with
increased denSities and less surface parking.

LAND ACQUISmON STRATEGY

The Redevelopment Commission should utilize its powers of land acquisition for public
purpose. Given the multiple-ownership of land parcels within the impact zone, with the
exception of some very large parcels (East Bank, Burnstine's, etc.), significant
redevelopment efforts will have to involve acquisition of numerous properties. The
multiple land ownership, combined with existing land use conflicts and

- 20-

environmental contamination, present barriers for market-based
revitalization activity. In an effort to make these parcels more suitable for
development activity, which will spur redevelopment activity by reducing a private
developer's risk, the Redevelopment Commission will be an active player in acquiring
needed properties to begin the revitalization process.
While the Redevelopment Commission has the power to condemn and acquire privately
held property, the rights of the individual property owner will take priority. It is the
desire of the Redevelopment Commission to assemble land parcels for development
which benefits the existing and future property owners. The "Proposed Activities"
sec;tion of this document highlights land acquisition activities in greater detail.
The area within the impact zone targeted for initial redevelopment efforts is directly
adjacent to the Elkhart River (see Map 5). Redeveloping this land will provide high
impact, visible results to all residents. There are several large land parcels on this area
which if configured correctly will accommodate significant new development.
SpeCifically, the East Bank site and the hotel property will be the first sites to be
acquired. The East Bank site is a large lot with an involved owner. The hotel property,
as a candidate for a Significant renovation or new civic uses, will add great enthusiasm
to the redevelopment effort. Assuming these two properties are available for
development, and final plans are made, additional property along the west side of the
river should be pursued.
Acquisition of the Burnstine's site would move the redevelopment effort to the east side
of Elkhart Avenue. Since this particular site has redevelopment potential, it is a likely
acquisition candidate. The land directly west and north of the existing Elkhart Foundry is
divided into multiple parcels, thus making it difficult and costly to acquire. However, this
land is a valuable part of the redevelopment vision for downtown effort and every
attempt to acquire it should be made.

PROPOSED AcnNTnEs_________________________________
Activities which the Redevelopment Commission will lead, related to the impact zone,
include the following:
.

1)
Land Acquisition and Disposal. It is anticipated that in order to encourage
new investment within the impact zone, the Redevelopment Commission will become
involved in selective acquisition of strategic properties. Properties which demonstrate
evidence of disinvestment and abandonment will be given priority. Additionally, real
property, which is affected by blighted or abandoned property, will also be considered
for acquisition if such acquisition will encourage new investment in the downtown area.
All acquisition activity is contingent upon negotiation and active discussion with the
individual property owner(s). Furthermore, the Redevelopment Commission will present
opportunities for relocating existing uses into new locations in the redevelopment area
where appropriate.
In acquiring interests in real property, the following procedures will be followed:
The Redevelopment Commission will order two appraisals to be conducted by
independent appraisers for each parcel on the acquisition list. The price offered will not
exceed the average of the two independent appraisals. The Redevelopment Commission
will work closely with each downtown property owner to assure that the acquisition does
not create a hardship for the owner. It is believed that most, if not all acquisitions will
involve vacant land or abandoned real property, In those cases when operating business
may be impacted, the Redevelopment Commission will work with the affected business
to determine how they can take advantage of the downtown redevelopment activities.
Initial land acquisition activities will consist of the following parcels within the impact
zone, subject to successful negotiation with the individual property owners:

3)
Riverwalk Greenway Improvements. The Redevelopment Commission and
City of Elkhart will lead all implementation activities associated with the Riverwalk
Greenway plan, as produced by Wool pert Consultants.

4)

Public/Private Partnership. The Redevelopment Commission has determined

that it will use its limited funds in a manner which will leverage significant new private
investment to the impact zone. All public/private partnerships created must
leverage private investment which is consistent with the specific objectives
stated within this Redevelopment Plan.
The Redevelopment Commission has adopted a leveraging goal of $1 to $4 - $10. In
other words, every dollar of local, public sector funds used related to the Downtown
Redevelopment Plan is expected to leverage between four to ten additional dollars from
the private sector. Funds that the Redevelopment Commission use for site
improvements, for example, must lead to development activities financed by outside
sources. Outside funding may include conventional equity investment, long-term debt
financing, or other "soft money" sources such as private foundations, state grants, or
national programs.
Furthermore, while the Redevelopment Commission is expected to play the lead role in
the redevelopment process, other local groups will be significantly involved, and may
also take responsibility for finding outside funding to supplement the Redevelopment
Commission's funds. Local groups such as the Elkhart Chamber of Commerce, the
Elkhart Downtown Development Corporation, and the Downtown Merchant's Association
will be key players in the process, and will be involved throughout the redevelopment
process.

CONSISTENCY WITH OTHER PLANS,_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ __

Several plans prepared for an adopted by the City of Elkhart have focused attention on
redevelopment of the downtown area as key to the health of the City of Elkhart. The
plans provided a starting point for research on the downtown district:

URBAN RENEWAL PLAN: 1985
The Urban Renewal Plan was created to initiate a more specific plan for downtown.
Because downtown has become blighted and deterioration is a dominant trend,
redevelopment can not be expected with normal public and private investment.
Therefore, this document created an Urban Renewal Area as a portion of the tax
increment financing (TIF) district to channel the benefits from any new investment
directly into the downtown area. These objectives from the 1985 plan are still applicable
today.
Urban Renewal Plan Objectives:
•

To preserve and create an environment within the downtown which will protect
health, safety, and general welfare; preserve or increase existing property values
and taxable values of properties within the Urban Renewal Area.

•

To establish conditions which will prevent the reoccurrence of blight.

•

To strengthen the downtown areas as the business, financial l administrative,
governmental and cultural center for the city and the county.

•

To strengthen the economic well-being of the downtown area by increasing retail
activity, office floor space, taxable values and job opportunities~

•

To create an appropriate compatible relationship between residential neighbors
and the downtown.

•

To leave such a legacy of redevelopment and rehabilitation that local private
investment voluntarily sets a trend of healthy growth in this area and its
surroundings.

COMPREHENSIVE LAND USE PLAN:

WOOLPERTi NOVEMBER 1996

The comprehensive plan dedicates special attention to downtown Elkhart as an entity
needing additional consideration. The plan recommends creating specialized districts
within a more broadly defined downtown area, and continually reiterates that people's
perceptions of downtown are vital to its success, as are these components:
The core:

Recapturing the rivers should be emphasized as the underlying theme in
the downtown conceptual plan. This can be accomplished through the

- 27-

enhancement of a greenway river corridor. This attraction will act as a
spine that can unify, link and establish a common design theme.
Mix of uses:

The uses downtown should accommodate a diversity of people, interests,
seasons, and times of day. A balanced mix of residential, office, specialty
retail, dining, cultural, and entertainment will create a "market synergy"
in downtown. Over concentrations or saturation of one use can diminish
this synergy.

Public spaces: Appropriately designed public spaces must be provided to accommodate
local and regional attractions. Festive and lively social atmospheres are
essential in creating this setting.
compactness: Compactness helps develop the special relationships that are important in
establishing a critical mass. Economic vitality and the need for pedestrian
routes are an important part of compactness. Residential development
within the downtown is one way to achieve compactness. It provides
attractive features for those who desire the convenience and activities a
vibrant downtown has to offer.
Linkages:

Functional linkages between downtown activities and adjacent
neighborhoods are essential in creating market synergy. A balance
between pedestrian and vehicular routes helps create and define linkages
and can maximize access to complementary uses. The grid of existing
streets and natural flow of Elkhart and st. Joseph Rivers creates an
environment facilitating linkages.

Identity:

A positive image of the downtown also plays a critical role in its. Vitality.
Entry features which define the edge of downtown create a sense of
identity in unifying downtown as a destination. Once in the downtown,
people should feel as if they have arrived in a special plan that is uniquely
different from where they have come from. The repetition of streetscape
features such as tree plantings, paving, lighting, and benches creates
visual order that reinforces the organization of downtown.

BROWNFIELD REDEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES FOR ELKHART, INDIANA:
THE GREAT LAKES ENVIRONMENTAL FINANCE CENTER, THE URBAN CENTER,
CLEVELAND STATE UNIVERSITY, 1997.

The successful redevelopment of the Wilt's and East Bank sites will depend on Elkhart's
ability to create and implement a compelling new vision for the downtown area. Special
attention must be focused on removing inappropriate or outdated facilities, crating new
greenspaces and pedestrian areas, assembling smaller parcels for projects of scale, and
identifying attractive new end-uses to draw people downtown. Economic performance
guidelines for the area should be established. These guidelines should specify a range of
intended benefits produced by redevelopment projects.

- 28-

ELKHART CONSOLIDATED PLAN:

1995-2000

The Elkhart Consolidated Plan does not formally mention· the downtown as an entity
needing special attention. It does, however discuss the nature of the housing market in
Elkhart. There is a need for quality, affordable rental units. The plan details
Neighborhood Development Strategies, which focus on revitalizing older neighborhoods
in the core of the city. This directly correlates with the plans to revitalize the downtown
business district.

RIVERWALK GREENWAY: WOOLPERT, 1997
Elkhart approved Phase I of a plan by Woolpert to create the Riverwalk Greenway along
the Elkhart River between the Jackson Boulevard Bridge and the Elkhart Avenue Bridge.
The plan includes aesthetic improvements and calls for the redevelopment of certain
properties along the proposed Riverwalk.
This new attraction will complement Island Park, existing walkways and bridges, and
new developments downtown. The revitalization of the rivers is the key component to a
new successful image of downtown Elkhart. The Riverwalk will provide the link from the
East Bank to Main Street and from the Elco Theater to Jackson Boulevard.
Future phases of the Riverwalk include linkages directly to the YMCA, Island Park,
neighborhoods north and west of the central business district and neighborhoods east of
downtown.

SUMMARY
All recent, previous planning documents focus on the importance of the river transition
from an industrial resource to a natural, community amenity. This is the key step in the
redevelopment vision for downtown Elkhart. All plans state that economic diversity and a
mixture of uses is optimal for downtown Elkhart.

VII.

FUNDING AND FINANCING_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ __

The following section describes several alternative financing mechanisms for
consideration within the City of Elkhart. These are presented only as potential options,
and not necessarily a commitment to using.
.
BONDS
1)

Revenue Bonds, or T1F Bonds. The existing tax increment financing (TIF )
district provides for the temporary allocation of increased property tax proceeds
to the redevelopment district. The City of Elkhart and the Redevelopment
Commission may wish to consider expanding the current llF boundaries (along
with the Urban Renewal Area boundaries) to include areas north of Jackson
Boulevard and east of the Elkhart River, which more closely corresponds with
anticipated future downtown redevelopment activities.

llF permits communities to use increase property tax revenue stimulated by
redevelopment activities to pay for the cost incurred to initiate the activities.
When the llF is established, real property assessments are "frozen" within the
designated area. Cities issue revenue bonds to finance a portion of the
redevelopment activities. Once property values begin to increase, the tax
assessments will also increase. This increase, or increment, in tax revenues is set
aside to payoff the debt service on the issued bonds. Once the full debt is
retired, the tax allocation is discontinued and all taxing units enjoy the benefits
of increase property tax values.
2)

General Obligation Bonds.
G.O. bond financing may be used for
funding an economic development project undertaken for a valid public purpose.
These bonds are obligations payable out of taxes levied and collected on all
taxable property. However, the total debt carried may not exceed two percent of
the net assessed valuation of the city.

TAX ABATEMENT
Certain types of businesses may qualify for tax abatement incentives. Within the City,
business owners may be eligible to deduct a portion of their real property investment
that is new to the area. The abatement is allowed on real property and is calculated only
on the increase of assessed value.
SECTION 108 GUARANTEED LOAN FUNDS
Section 108 loan funds are an extension of the Community Development Block Grant
(CDBG) Program which provides grant funds to Elkhart. By pledging future CDBG funds
toward repayment, the City can leverage up to five times the amount of their annual
allocation and access large amounts of new capital for community and economic
development activities. The City's future CDBG grants serve as collateral for the Section
108 loan.

- 31 -

Section 108 funds have low, fixed interest rates and repayment can be made over a
period of up to twenty years. Section 108 loans can involve little or no cost to public
entities when third parties (i.e. private developers) make principal and interest
payments. And, Section 108 borrowing does not affect the legal debt capacity of the
city. Projects financed with Section 108 loans must be eligible under the CDBG program.

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT INCOME TAX (EDIT)
EDIT has already been established and used efficiently by Elkhart County. EDIT is a
potential funding source for debt service or other redevelopment expenditures, or
economic development projects.

CONVENTIONAL FINANCING
The city anticipates that most private developers/investors who propose approved
activities within the Urban Renewal Area will require conventional financing from private
lending institutions. The city will work cooperatively with the developers/investors to
secure conventional financing, if necessary. Specifically, the city will provide proof of its
financial commitment to a developer/investor in order to assist the developer/investor
with securing conventional financing for a project.

EQUITY INVESTMENT
The city's objective within the redevelopment district is to facilitate private investment.
Whenever possible, the city will seek equity investments from private
developers/investors who propose to implement approved activities within the Urban
Renewal Area. The city will financially assist projects primarily with gap financing and
with leveraging of public funds that will result in repayment by the private
developers/investors. By establishing a llF district and providing tax abatement
incentives, the city is creating an atmosphere conducive to private investment.

OTHER LOCAL SOURCES
The City of Elkhart may utilize any combination of local revenue sources to support
redevelopment activities within the designated impact zone. Use of such funds will be
subject to all public notification requirements and approvals. These funding sources may
include the following:
•
•
•

Existing General Obligation debt capacity
Cumulative Capital Development Funding
Food and Beverage tax Revenues

- 32-

VIII. STATUTORY FINDINGS,_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ __
In accordance with Indiana Code 36-7-14-15, this Redevelopment Plan meets the
following criteria:

1)

The designated areas highlighted within this Redevelopment Plan are
blighted to an extent which cannot be corrected by the ordinalY
operations ofprivate enterprise.

Over the last decade, downtown Elkhart has lost some of its significant downtown
business base, in terms of size, tax generation, and employees. In addition to the losses
of some of the downtown's most notable business enterprises, new large-scale
commercial development has been occurring immediately outside the downtown area,
and elsewhere outside of city limits, further pulling businesses and shoppers away from
downtown Elkhart. The significant site acquisition and site improvement costs, combined
with the multiple ownership of land, and potential environmental contamination, will not
allow private investment to occur if left to prevailing market forces.

2)

The public health and welfare will be benefited by the acquisition and
redevelopment of the area.

Land acquisition activities, infrastructure improvements, and site improvements will lead
to Significant new tax revenues for the City of Elkhart, which will provide additional
services for both city and county residents. Acquiring land, making it more suitable for
new investment, and promoting public/private partnerships will produce an atmosphere
more conducive to housing, retail, hotel, and office development, which will lead to new
jobs for area residents. New investment will help in reversing the business losses
downtown has recently experienced, and will build up the city's tax base.

3)

The areas targeted within this plan are a menace to the social and
economic interests of the City of Elkhart, and redevelopment will be of
public utility and benefit.

Redevelopment activities (land acquisition, site and infrastructure improvements, and
public/private partnerships) will create an environment conducive to new housing and
commercial investment, and will provide additional tax revenues for the City, and new
services for city residents.

INTRODUCTION

Background
Where is Jacobsville?
The Jacobsville neighborhood is located within the City of
Evansville in Southwestern Indiana. Evansville is located along
the Ohio River and is Indiana’s third largest city.

Regional and Local Context

The Jacobsville neighborhood is located just north of Downtown
Evansville, Indiana. Although close to Downtown, the
neighborhood is separated by the elevated Lloyd Expressway,
which acts as a physical and perceptional barrier to create a
direct, working connection to Downtown.
Once thriving as a working class neighborhood that valued
its manufacturing companies to provide jobs and economic
well being, the Jacobsville neighborhood is going through
redevelopment initiatives, specifically with the closing of key
businesses and the lasting environmental impacts of these
companies.
For the purposes of this document and in the context of the Study
Area is an area defined by West Lloyd Expressway from the south
to the Michigan Street to the north and from 1st Avenue on the
west to Main Street on the east.

What does the southern Jacobsville
area need
Being a north-central neighborhood and home to many life long
residents and thriving businesses,

Southern Jacobsville needs...
...job opportunities

for the residents.

...mixed-use development

as a complement

to downtown.

...safe and walkable neighborhoods.
...diversity of housing choices.

Green Infrastructure – Part of Evansville Regional
Sustainability Plan

How to Use the Plan
The Redevelopment Area Plan starts with this introduction section
that provides a basis for creation of the Plan. The following
sections and their intent will help the reader understand the
essence of this plan and where to browse to get specific
information:
Vision & Goals - These define the plan principles and will
guide implementation of the plan
Neighborhood Analysis - Analysis of physical and economic
framework of the Study Area
Big Ideas - 8 Big Ideas were generated as a result of the
planning process that will guide the effective implementation
of the plan. Each of the big ideas has an analysis of the
existing framework which results in the recommended
strategy and implementation action items
Action Plan - Provides key steps to implement the
Redevelopment Plan based on the Big Ideas

Goal: identify potential green infrastructure projects that will
work toward reducing Combined Sewer Overflow
Reduce the frequency and volume of Combined Sewer
Overflow occurrence on an annual basis
Develop a cost-effective program that has community
support
Develop green infrastructure programs that appeal to
regulators, City and the public
Measures of Success

Green Streets and Alleys
Incorporate into city-wide alley improvement
program

Other Opportunities
Planter Boxes, urban tree trenches, vegetated
swales, cisterns, green roof, stream restoration,

EMPO Regional Bicycle and Pedestrian Plan - 2000
Goal is to “improve the safety and visibility of bicycling and
walk, first as modes of transportation and secondly as forms
of recreation.”
Supplements the 2020 Transportation Plan which addresses
current and future transportation needs and recommends
projects to address these needs
Bike and pedestrian goals for the region for the next twenty
years

In the Evansville area there are several designated bike
routes:
Pigeon Creek Greenway
Mesker Drive between Helfrich Park and Helfrich Golf
Course Clubhouse
Between Evansville State Hospital and Wesselman Park
(closest to our site)
The area struggles with finding secure bike storage for bikes
when they reach their destination
Priorities:
Within 5 years implement recommended Bikeway
Network

1. Recognize walking and biking as valid modes in the
transportation system
2. Recognize the importance of education, enforcement,
and encouragement programs to bike and pedestrian
system
3. Appropriately accommodate bicyclists and pedestrians
in design, construction/reconstruction and maintenance
of roadways and sidewalks
4. Reduce number of bike and pedestrian-related crashes
5. Increase bicycling and walking from less than 1% of all
trips in 1990 to 5% by 2020
Recommendations:
1. Physical Improvements: sidewalks, bike lanes, 		
separate bike facilities
2. Policy Changes: revise roadway design standards,
modify Zoning and Subdivision Ordinances,
3. Suggest modifications to local bike laws
4. Education, Enforcement, and Encouragement: 		
interactive activities to promote safe biking and 		
walking
“The Evansville-Henderson urbanized area has the potential
to convert many local trips to bicycle. The area has relatively
flat terrain, a well-developed grid street network, and mild
climate that allows for bicycling 9 or more months out of the
year.”

Background
What was the Public Process
The Redevelopment Area Plan incorporates a number of
opportunities for public participation and the consensus building
process. In summary it consisted of the following:
Jacobsville Area Community Corporation (JACC)
Stakeholder Interviews
Public Workshop
Public Open Houses
Real Estate Roundtable
Regular Meetings with City Redevelopment Staff
Social media - Facebook
During the process, several comments were also received
from charrette/workshop and public open house participants.
All of the above assisted in evaluation of needs, streamlining
recommendations, consensus on approach, targeting focus
areas and putting forth effective implementation strategies.

Background
Jacobsville History and Where it is
Today
The neighborhood of Jacobsville was first shown on the city
directory in 1863 but was officially annexed around 1868.
Originally, it was slated to be a city of its own but downtown
Evansville grew at an exceptional rate and quickly approached
the neighborhood. Early on the neighborhood became home
to many blue collar workers. It was very dense with modest
housing.
The neighborhood was named after Hannah Jacobs who
had a farmhouse located just north of the Study Area on
Maryland Street. The home was built around 1860 and was
razed in 2003 to make way for more modern housing for the
neighborhood.
Jacobsville is also home to Indiana’s oldest public library, the
Willard Library, which opened in 1885.
Today Jacobsville is still considered a blue collar community but
also home to many of Evansville’s prominent businesses such as
Berry Plastics, Vectren and Deaconess Hospital.

1885

The neighborhood of Jacobsville remained a highly dense
residential area even after almost 100 years. The 1960’s show
the inception of clustered commercial uses along Oakley and
Pennsylvania Street which would soon be the home of Berry
Plastics.

Pedestrian Shed/Walkability
Based on research papers on the pedestrian-shed (or the maps
showing actual area within 5-minute or 10-minute walking
distance) approach by the Congress for New Urbanism and
other generally accepted principles, a comfortable walking
distance is ¼ of a mile i.e. 1,320 feet. As this exhibit shows, the
activity centers are mostly within 10-minute walking distance
from each other. Yet from a perception perspective they are
afar because of the vacant lots and surface parking areas
that contribute to a fractured and unwelcoming environment.
Opportunities should be explored for infill development in
some of these areas to add more uses along travel paths and
encourage walkability.

1

The street grid of the neighborhood creates a very walkable
environment north of the Lloyd Expressway which unfortunately
acts as a barrier from downtown. Larger blocks that hold
the neighborhood’s prominent industries such as Deaconess
Hospital and Berry Plastics disrupt the grid making it harder to
promote connectivity.

Connectivity
The Jacobsville neighborhood is well connected to the
surrounding areas north of the Lloyd expressway. All secondary
and minor streets are two way traffic with parking on both sides
of the street with the exception of Division Street which is one
way traffic going west along the Lloyd Expressway.
First and Main Streets bound the study area on the east and west
sides connecting to downtown and northern Evansville. Much
of the areas retail and commercial businesses are located along
Main Street. Mary Street also connects under the Expressway to
downtown and up to the hospital.
Virginia and Franklin Streets are the prominent east/west
secondary thoroughfares in the neighborhood connecting main
activity areas - The Main Street commercial district, Berry Plastics
and Deaconess Hospital.
The 2035 Transportation Plan constitutes the long-range,
multi-modal transportation plan for the Evansville, Indiana - no
roadway improvement projects associated with the Jacobsville
area were identified.
The Lloyd Expressway, comprised of the SR62/66 corridor,
provides a continuous multi-lane divided highway through
Vanderburgh County. Lloyd Expressway is also included in the
National Highway System (NHS) routes and is classified as a
controlled access route. First Avenue is a major north-south
street in the grid system for Evansville and is classified as a
Collector/Distributor. First Avenue is also a freight/truck route.
Even though other corridors in Jacobsville are classified as
local roads, they carry traffic volumes in excess of 2500. See
Appendix for Traffic volumes & Truck routes.
The existing Right-of-Way along all the roads in Jacobsville Area
is approximately 60 ft. (30’ half R/W).

Opportunities
In order to determine a proper roadway network that can be
expected to accommodate projected traffic demands, average
daily traffic volume estimates, intersection, signal warrants and
corridor studies will need to be performed for the existing and
proposed roadway network.

Green/Open Spaces, Vacant Sites and Potential Edge Enhancements
As highlighted on the exhibit there is a distinct lack of public
green space within the neighborhood. Willard Park acts as an
inviting gateway to the neighborhood on 1st Avenue being on
the edge of the neighborhood along Lloyd Expressway.
Willard Library grounds and Jacobsville Mini-Park (located
at Baker Ave and Maryland St) represent nearly all the green
space that exists in the area. Due to expansion of industry and
commercial lots, the neighborhood is separated from this green
space and access is indirect. Garvin Park, which is located just
a couple of miles North from Jacobsville, is one of Evansville’s
oldest and most popular parks.

Opportunities
With many vacant parcels throughout the neighborhood there is
clearly an opportunity to increase the amount and type of green
space in an effort to provide gathering places for both residents
and visitors. As infill development happens, attention should
be given to add more public gathering opportunities and parks
as they create ‘beachfront’ property for additional real estate
development and further reinvestment. Opportunities to have
green parking with parking islands, buildings offset from busy
streets to introduce landscaped lawns in the sidewalk areas are
other potential opportunities that should be explored.
The greening of existing surface parking lots in this area would
also help to reduce storm water runoff, and thereby help to
minimize flow into the combined sewers and minimize our
combined sewer overflow into the Ohio River.
Green parking provides dual aesthetic and environmental
benefits helping to implement the renewal of Evansville.

Parking
Parking is an important component for area for the large
neighborhood businesses that call Jacobsville home such as
Berry Plastics and the Deaconess Hospital. There is an abundant
amount of off-street parking but due to the lack of design
enhancement these parking lots do not add to the walkable
environment as it creates dead zones in the public realm with the
void of any vertical built form as well as inactivity after business
hours.
Main Street is the only major road that has on-street parking.
Pavement, traffic signage and stripping are in fair to poor
condition.

Opportunities
While these businesses wish to grow and expand which
alternatively means the need for more parking, special attention
needs to be made in order to introduce a neighborhood
aesthetic for all existing and new parking lots. The abundant
surface parking lots provide the opportunity to convert surface
parking into parking garages as businesses expand in the future.
No new surface lots should be installed along Main Street. This
frees up land for more desirable uses. Utilizing vacant lots and
providing edge enhancements can soften the effects of expansive
asphalt in a neighborhood setting.
Appropriate signage and wayfinding should be promoted to
provide directional guidance to residents and visitors to the
parking areas.

Existing Land Uses
Jacobsville’s current land use pattern evolved from a traditional
single-family neighborhood with Main Street retail to a more
diverse mix, including intense medical and industrial campuses.
Much of the existing residential fabric remains but as areas of
the neighborhood have transitioned to accommodate these
newer large-scale uses, the remaining residential areas have
been eroded. Throughout the Jacobsville Study Area, pockets
of houses remain adjacent to less desirable commercial and
industrial neighbors. These residential clusters are isolated
islands that have lost the consistency of solid blocks of
connected, established dwellings that exist elsewhere in the
neighborhood. The Study Area lacks a coherent, predictable
land use pattern, making it susceptible to undesirable change
that will continue to negatively impact the existing neighborhood
uses.
Single-Family Residential relates to single-family
homes, most of which are 50 or more years old, on
narrow lots with alleys.
Multiple-Family Residential consists of apartment
buildings and attached dwelling units, most of which
are located on corners, generally on busier streets in
the neighborhood.
Traditional Retail includes historic “Main Street”
buildings, pedestrian-oriented, built at the front lot
line, may be multi-story with retail on the first floor
and flats or office space above.
Modern Commercial buildings are auto-oriented, with
parking in the front and side yards, drive-throughs,
and contemporary character and building massing.
Consumer Commercial uses are sometimes formerly
industrial, but have shifted from manufacturing to
distributing, limited warehousing, auto service, and
professional service shops.
Industrial uses are large manufacturing campuses,
including Berry and Vectren.
Institutional uses are public buildings like the library,
schools, churches, Deaconess and related medical
uses, and service/advocacy organizations like
SWIRCA.
Parking/Utilities include surface lots, parking
structures, and utility substations.
Vacant lots with no buildings on them.

Zoning
The following are a few highlights from a technical review of
the current zoning regulations for the City of Evansville. In
particular, the regulations have been reviewed relative to their
applicability to the Jacobsville neighborhood and the land
use development patterns recommended in the Jacobsville
Redevelopment Plan. This is not an exhaustive review of all
aspects of the zoning regulations, nor is it intended to propose
specific amendments. However, upon reviewing the existing
regulations, it is apparent that the city’s zoning ordinance is
not structured and does not contain the tools needed to fully
implement the Redevelopment Plan.
 The ordinance structure is difficult to use, requiring the
reader to consult multiple sections just to determine which
uses are allowed in any given district.
 The districts seem to be a random composite of uses that
don’t relate to a specific intent or to the physical area in
which they are located.
 The lack of a defined purpose for each district results in
unnecessary overlap and conflict among the districts.
 The zoning map is a patchwork quilt of districts, illustrating
both the lack of a coherent plan and a defined purpose for
the zoning districts.
 There is considerable overlap between districts (R-4 and
R-5; CO-1 and CO-2; C-4, M-1, M-2 and M-3). Some
of these could be consolidated or revised to serve a more
distinct purpose. For example, rather than allowing all
uses by right, some uses could be designated as “special
exception uses” within the zoning districts to ensure that
potential negative impacts or nuisance effects (traffic, late
hours of operation, noise, odor, etc.) can be controlled with
the addition of conditions to any approval. This reduces the
need for separate zoning districts.
 Despite all of the overlap, there is no true mixed use
district that fully integrates a range of residential and nonresidential uses within a single development. There are
traditional districts and PUD that permit a long-list of uses,
but do not allow for the effective consolidation of those
uses in one building or one property without a lengthy and
costly review process. Allowing a mixture of uses requires
some forethought and a defined purpose to ensure that the
allowed uses, in combination, complement one another and
do not create conflicts.
 Parking requirements are overly complicated. There
are excessive requirements for some uses; and parking
standards (while attached to specific uses) follow the same
cumbersome “use group” format as used to categorize the
permitted uses.
 The full technical review is located in the Appendix.

Existing Infrastructure Framework
All major corridors of the Neighborhood area consist of existing
underground and overhead utility lines. Any reconstruction/
relocating plan needs close coordination with the City of
Evansville/Vanderburgh County Department of Public Works
(DPW) and the utility providers.

Water
Evansville Water Utility is responsible for supplying water. The
existing system includes extensive network of distribution mains.

Storm Water Drainage and Combined
Sewer Overflow
Currently, surface water drainage is served by combined sewers
carrying both sanitary sewage and drainage. Management of
storm water in Evansville and Vanderburgh County is generally
the responsibility of the Evansville Board of Public Works and the
Vanderburgh County Drainage Board (County Commissioners).
There are active and inactive CSO points close to Jacobsville
Neighborhood area but not within the Study Area.
The Clean Water Act of 1972 requires CSO communities to
restore their waterways. Evansville is working closely with state
regulatory agencies to remediate its CSOs. A Long Term Control
Plan (LTCP) is being developed to establish cost-effective and
practical projects to reduce the impact and frequency of CSO
discharges. A Stream Reach Characterization and Evaluation
Report (SRCER) to establish the existing baseline conditions of
the receiving stream and the CSO discharge concentrations
must be completed prior to developing a Long Term Control
Plan (LTCP). The recommended CSO control program for the
City of Evansville consists of the implementation of controls in
phases over a period of ten years.

Flood Potential
The Jacobsville Neighborhood area is outside the 500-year
flood plain with less than 0.2% annual probability of flooding.

Soil Contamination & Remediation
In 2000, the Indiana Department of Environmental Management
(IDEM) conducted the reassessment of the Evansville Plating
Works site. Analysis of the neighborhood samples showed high
levels of lead.
In 2001, IDEM conducted historical research to determine if
other facilities in the vicinity could have contributed to the high
levels of lead. Four former facilities, were identified as possible
contributors to the lead. These include:
1. Advance Stove Works, operated from 1900 to the 1950s as
a manufacturer of stoves and a foundry. That site is at Read
and Division streets.
2. Newton-Kelsay, which operated from the turn of the century
to the 1950s. They manufactured harnesses for animals.
The site is at 20 N. Main Street.

3

3. Sharpes Shot Works, which operated from 1878 to an
unknown date, manufactured lead shot for guns. That site is
currently owned by Deaconess Hospital.
4. Blount Plow Works (Razed in 1970), operated from the
1880s to the 1940s as a manufacturer of horse-driven
plows. The facility operated a foundry or a factory where
metal castings were produced. The site is at 200 N. Main
Street.

Cleanup Activities to Date


The EPA added the Jacobsville Neighborhood site to the
National Priorities List in 2004.



To address the site, EPA has divided the cleanup into two
parts or operable units.



Operable Unit (OU1) is shown on the map to the right.



Through August 2013 the EPA has sampled 1,930 sites and
cleaned 830 sites which required remediation. Over half of
the sites required no cleanup action.



The EPA has invested over $15 million to date in sampling,
remediation and related activities in the neighborhood.

Transportation
Transit
Metropolitan Evansville Transit System (METS) is an important
component of the transportation system in the Jacobsville
Neighborhood area. Since, there are many jobs and services
in and around Jacobsville area that can be accessed without
the need to drive. Public transportation is expected to remain a
viable mode of travel for area residents. The map to the right
shows various transit routes. Coordination with METS is crucial
while planning mobility needs to provide better access points
and connectivity throughout the neighborhood area.

Bicycle and Pedestrian Travel
There are many neighborhood-serving community facilities that
residents can walk and bike. Even though, walking and bicycling
remain a viable means of travel for work, school, and other
trips for many people, the Neighborhood is not well equipped
with safe, connected, and continuous facilities for bicycling
and walking. Absence of bike lanes, damaged sidewalks,
sub-standard curb ramps at driveways and intersections, lack
of pedestrian signals at intersection are some of the issues that
require immediate attention. These are vital to encourage and
support travel by pedestrians or bicyclists, and also help to
promote transit use.

investments to help revitalize the neighborhood. These
opportunities are:

Read St

The proposed expansion boundaries are Lloyd Expressway to
the South, Maryland Street and Main Street to Bosse Field to
the North, 2nd Avenue to the West and Heidelbach Avenue
to the East.

Proposed TIF District

Harriet St

The current TIF district only captures a small amount of tax
dollars in the neighborhood. It is recommended to expand
the current TIF district boundary to include key areas such as
the Main Street area from the expressway to Bosse Field at
the north end.

Existing TIF District

Mary St

TIF districts are one of the most preferred economic
incentive tools in Indiana, partly due to the decline of the
available local, state and federal funding. This tool should
be utilized primarily in the commercial sector, specifically
around major businesses and the Main Street area to pay for
public infrastructure.

 Research the potential impacts per the Indiana Code
of the proposed expansion by estimating the economic
benefits and costs incurred. These would be measured
by increased employment and economic growth of real
property assessed values.

Existing & Proposed TIF

Edgar St

The Indiana Tax Increment Financing (TIF) process is
formally established in Indiana Code 36-7-14. TIF is a
redevelopment tool used by towns/cities and development
authorities to finance certain public redevelopment costs
such as water and sewer upgrades and streetscape
improvements. It is an economic development tool to
capture property tax revenues attributable to increases in
assessed value.

FOCUS ON KEY CORRIDORS FOR STREETSCAPE improvements

Promote multi-use streetscape enhancements at
strategic locations along with redevelopment of
adjacent blocks.
It is recommended to follow the Priority Diagram for
priority streetscape implementation projects (refer to page
45). Enhancements should potentially include renovated
sidewalks, tree lawns, bikepaths (dedicated or shared
use), opportunity for bus shelters, sustainable stormwater
management practices, lighting, street furniture, etc., based
on appropriate needs and available resources. Adopt
the “complete streets” approach to enhance streets and
pedestrian activity areas. Ultimately this will help to set the
stage for public-private partnerships and infill development
to occur along the corridors.
What is the Complete Streets design approach?
The National Complete Streets Coalition characterizes
“Complete Streets” as streets that are designed and
operated to provide safe, attractive and comfortable access
for users (vehicles, bicycles, pedestrians and transit users) of
all ages and abilities. Streets built utilizing “Complete Street”
principles encourage social interaction, provide a unique
sense of place and have a positive influence on adjacent
land values.

ACTION STEPS
 Streetscape/Road Network
 Follow the hierarchy of street connections (mostly
pedestrian oriented streets to high automobile traffic
corridors), as exhibited in this plan, that will facilitate
multiple modes of transportation.
 Explore opportunities to re-engage alleys with
improved aesthetics to make them safer and visually
better to encourage pedestrian accessibility.
 Explore road diet (technique where the width of
roads are reconfigured/minimized for transportation
efficiency) and slower “design speeds” which will help
in promoting walkable environment to accommodate
the needs of all ages.
 Implement traffic calming measures within higher
density areas - with curb-extensions at intersections
and possible mid-blocks, potential raised midblock crossings, introduction of pavers in pedestrian
crosswalks, electronic lighting system that activates
when pedestrians are at crosswalks, etc.
 Minimize and consolidate curb cuts into off-street
parking areas. Also, minimize continuous curb-cuts.
 Promote a comprehensive signage and wayfinding
system.
 Implement a cohesive streetscape design along with
redevelopment of under-utilized lots and/or buildings.
 Sidewalks and Walkability
 Utilize the overview design standards and visual
design guidelines (within this section) as guide to
redevelop sidewalk areas for catalytic improvements.
 Explore opportunities to incorporate sidewalk dining
areas, wherever applicable, while maintaining a clear
zone for pedestrian traffic.

44

JACOBSVILLE REDEVELOPMENT AREA PLAN

ACTION STEPS
 Sidewalks and Walkability Cont.
 Tree plantings are encouraged to enhance visual and
environmental quality of the public realm areas - they
will help to create greenways within urban core as
well as provide relief from heat-island effect.
 Biking
 Incorporate bike lanes whenever the right-of-way
allows the opportunity; otherwise promote shared
access lanes as exhibited in the Franklin and Virginia
Street proposed recommendations.
 Parking
 Conduct a parking study as density of development
grows within the Jacobsville area - it will help to
justify requirements of different forms of parking
(on-street, off-street lots, parking garages).
 Parking should be identified with the comprehensive
signage and wayfinding system.
 On-street Parking:
 Enforcement of time limits, specifically on high
traffic corridors such as Main Street, 1st Avenue,
etc. will help customers and store owners with
higher turnarounds.
 Appropriate techniques of parking fee payment
to be installed that adds to the character of core
areas (individual parking meter, consolidated and
electronic systems, etc.).
 Off-Street Parking:
 Majority of off-street parking spaces should be
located behind the buildings specifically when
infill development occurs.

 Promote curb-extensions at intersections and midblock to encourage safer sidewalk connections.

 Parking lots should be well illuminated, signed
and nicely landscaped with green parking aisles
with opportunities for stormwater management.

 Promote sidewalk redevelopment with ADA
accessibility requirements.

 Off-street parking lots fronting principal streets
should be screened with low height landscaping.

ACTION STEPS
 Parking Garages
 Construct parking garages that will support
large developments and/or cluster of smaller
developments, specifically if it is related to industrial
and/or medical uses.
 Explore innovative financing solutions, TIF and publicprivate partnerships to build garages.
 Parking garages should be designed with high bay
ground floor (with commercial uses) to allow for the
garages to be integrated within the urban framework.
 Promote design solutions that creatively mask
the facades of the parking garages - screens,
architectural features, etc.
 Provide easily accessible short term parking spaces in
parking garages.
 Add bike parking on 1st floor as well as short-term
visitor parking.

FOCUS ON STRONG NEIGHBORHOODS AND HOUSING

Strengthen neighborhoods and commercial areas
Diverse housing options, well-maintained infrastructure
and a safe environment are all important features of strong
neighborhoods that will ultimately contribute to sustained
economic growth. Neighborhoods that are safe, well
maintained and well connected, will provide stability, appeal
to new residents and encourage greater investment. Also an
appealing and inviting public realm is a fundamental part of
a strategy to strengthen neighborhoods and business districts
alike.
ACTION STEPS
 Consider working with the Police Department and/or
other local resources or possibly retaining a consultant
to provide guidance in dealing with the impact of publicsafety perceptions in Jacobsville, including necessary
improvements to the physical environment, adjustments to
various programs and patrols, innovative approaches to
strategic communications, and appropriate metrics and
measures to track progress.
 JACC to work with City to establish a protocol to develop
better communication with the neighborhood residents,
ensure follow-up and transparency with regard to how the
City implements changes and improvements. Use internet
technology to develop an interactive process.
 Continue strong collaboration with SWIRCA for
neighborhood engagement programs and opportunities
for recreation.
 Establish an aggressive Code Enforcement and
Abatement program by City in collaboration with JACC
and neighborhood partners to address blight, crime and
other nuisances, to kick-start long-term neighborhood
revitalization and reinvestment.
 Audit public spaces to identify and remedy areas that
encourage crime – areas with poor lighting, sites that
need clean-up, etc. Promote safety and security measures
- lighting, ground floor occupancy, police patrol,
opportunities for pick-up and drop-off services (publicprivate), etc.

50

JACOBSVILLE REDEVELOPMENT AREA PLAN

ACTION STEPS
 Partner with local merchants to clean sidewalks,
storefronts and parking lots to demonstrate care and
concern about the community, decrease criminal activity
and increase community use and livability.
 Establish a “Neighborhood & Business Watch
Program” creating a partnership between business, law
enforcement, and other organizations that represent
neighborhood & business interests. The philosophy is
straightforward – take control of what happens in your
neighborhood & business community and lessen chances
of becoming a victim.
 Increase the presence of police volunteers in the
neighborhoods and the Main Street area. Often bright
colored vests or other types of visible uniforms to direct
visitors and provide a visible presence are enough to
deter crime and increase public safety.
 The City in cooperation with JACC and Police Department
should partner with area financial and real estate
companies to develop a comprehensive foreclosure
and abandoned building policy. This policy and its
enforcement actions should target distressed properties
before they become a problem.
 Engage JACC to continue to host neighborhood-based
Community Engagement meetings. These meetings
reaffirm community and neighborhood identity by working
on concerns identified by citizens in the community and
empowering them to be proactive in solving those issues
with the guidance and assistance of the police and law
enforcement.
 Maintain clean parks and green spaces, immediately
removing litter, graffiti and undesirable conditions.
 Formalize a program to inventory and prioritize
rehabilitation of viable blighted structures and if not
suitable for rehab, demolition.

ACTION STEPS

ACTION STEPS

 Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED)
[http://www.cpted.net/] principals should be employed
especially in public realm, sidewalks, public plazas, public
gathering areas, parks and trails. By modifying the built
environment of the green spaces the City can reduce
crime and disorder and improve the overall quality of life
in those areas. Trimmed trees and shrubs, designated
walkways, proper fencing and adequate lighting will add
not only to the beauty of the areas but improve safety and
security.

 Work with the major employers to encourage employees
to live in the area. This may include the production of
promotional materials, incentives, and working closely
with realtors to match employees to targeted areas.

 Revise zoning districts and regulations to promote urbanstyle housing choices such as attached single-family and
mixed-use buildings with minimal front yard setbacks
along primary corridors.

 Explore temporary uses for vacant residential property
such community gardens, neighborhood open space, and
use of the land bank for parcels where redevelopment is
more likely long-term.

 Develop infill guidelines (sample sketches and
photographs) and ordinance standards to promote new
houses that complement the design of homes in that
neighborhood (i.e. new homes with modern amenities but
that look like they are part of the neighborhood).

IDENTIFY ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE FOR IMPLEMENTATION EFFORTS INCLUDING: BUSINESS IMPROVEMENT DISTRICT, MAIN STREET
MANAGEMENT & PUBLIC/PRIVATE REINVESTMENT

Develop a Business Improvement District [BID]
or Economic Improvement District [EID] to
garner commitment and financial support from
property owners to provide professional targeted
management efforts in the Main Street Area and
adjacent commercial areas
A Business Improvement District (BID) or Economic
Improvement District [EID] is a quasi-public organization
formed by property owners who have agreed to an
assessment on their property in order to generate revenue
for services and capital improvements provided within
a defined district. EID’s provide a long-term financial
base for marketing, capital improvements and management
programs. They spell out the services and improvements
to be delivered in a contract between the property owners
and the organization charged with managing the EID. This
contractual arrangement increases accountability and keeps
the focus of the organization on achieving the stated goals
of property owners.
It has been proven throughout the country that Economic
Improvement District [EID] forms of management raise the
quality of main street districts. Reasons include:
 Full-time attention by trained Main Street Manager
 Financial resources directed toward management, leasing &
promotions efforts
 Strategic business recruitment & retention
 Pro-active real estate development focus
 Strong district advocacy programs to solidify authority,
alliances and trust
Sixty percent of property owners, or those representing
roughly seventy-five percent of the linear footage, must
agree to the assessment (amount to be determined by local
area). The process of recruiting the property owners to
agree to an assessment and how it will be spent is a time
consuming effort requiring a high level of commitment
from leadership at all levels in the Main Street and the

52

JACOBSVILLE REDEVELOPMENT AREA PLAN

commercial areas. A results oriented EID/BID program will
help to secure funding from participants, local financial
institutions & foundations and solidify public/private
partnerships.
Other responsibilities such as streetscape maintenance, litter
control, sidewalk trash removal and parking enforcement
and lot management, could also be placed under the
Economic Improvement District.
ACTION STEPS
 The City, JACC, Chamber of Commerce and other
responsible agencies should work collaboratively with
investors, major property owners and business owners to
create the EID.
 Gain consensus on instituting the EID/BID through
educational sessions (regarding benefits and formation
guidelines) held by JACC with property and business
owners.
 Follow IC 36-7-22 of Indiana Code (http://www.in.gov/
legislative/ic/code/ title36/ar7/ch22.html) for guidelines
to institute an Economic Improvement District.
 Define the specific area and develop an operating
plan describing the kind of services and/or details of
infrastructure improvements.
 Determine the annual cost for delivering the services and
develop formula for annual assessments.
 Research and apply for appropriate funding mechanisms
and work with different agencies to pool resources and
financing – to operate the EID/BID.
 Submit to appropriate local legislative authorities in
ordinance form for public hearing and subsequent vote to
approve the creation of the district.

Establish the necessary funding and staffing in place
to implement the Area Redevelopment Plan
While the City of Evansville and relevant department
officials/staff (mostly DMD staff) will work with JACC and
neighborhood stakeholders to oversee the implementation
of this plan, it is recommended to employ a Main Street
Manager or Jacobsville Area Redevelopment Manager to
act as a gatekeeper for the implementation of the action
items specifically for Main Street. This will in no way replace
any current organizational/ implementation efforts by JACC,
Chamber of Commerce and other stakeholders, rather
create an environment for a focused approach.
ACTION STEPS
 Research and pool funding to create the position
through collaboration of City, JACC and other interested
stakeholders. Involve Chamber of Commerce of
Southwest Indiana. Discuss possibilities of funding by
major employers as well as leveraging funding from BID.
 This position will be responsible for implementation of the
Area Redevelopment Plan recommendations. The position
will work under the guidance of JACC.
 Responsibilities for this position will also include
researching additional funding opportunities and
pioneering the PR campaign for the Main Street and
adjacent commercial area tenanting and district
marketing.
 The position should be filled by an individual who is able
to influence property owners and developers and has the
qualities of an aggressive salesperson.
 Different resources will be available at different times; it
would be the prerogative of this position in consultation
with JACC to prioritize accordingly and make strategic
decisions of implementations for the best case scenario.

Continued commitment to Main Street and adjacent
commercial areas
To make certain that the strategic repositioning and
revitalization objectives outlined in this plan are
accomplished and efforts gain momentum, the Main Street
Program as administered by the National Trust for Historic
Preservation should be followed to coordinate with the
strategic vision of this Plan.

ACTION STEPS
 Utilize the Area Redevelopment Plan as a marketing,
educational and information tool.
 Utilize the State Main Street Program & office personnel
for community information exchange.
 Continue to work with local/regional/ digital media to
promote the revitalization plan.
 Continue to refer to the Indiana Main Street’s guidelines
(http://www. in.gov/ocra/2364.htm) as well as the ones
stated by the National Trust for Historic Preservation
(http://www. preservationnation.org/main-street/aboutmain-street/getting-started/).

 Create a Business Retention/Recruitment Program
 Build trust in investment community through retention
by giving existing businesses access to helpful
information and a support team to improve their

 Gateway Main Street
 Home to Vectren and a number of national chain
businesses, this area lends itself to be the Gateway to
Main Street. Being on the edge of the neighborhood
and bounded by Lloyd Expressway, this district
should make a statement for the businesses and the
neighborhood with additional real estate and public
realm improvements.
 Core Main Street
 The historic preservation of the existing buildings
should be enhanced and new infill development
should compliment not mimic their historic neighbors
paying special attention to the pedestrian.
 Mixed Use
 While a number of existing homes have been
converted and commercial uses have been initiated
in various locations, this district has already taken
the character of being a mixed use district. Special
attention should be made to deter uses with high
traffic volumes while promoting live/work units and
developments with residential above.

54

JACOBSVILLE REDEVELOPMENT AREA PLAN

Big Idea 4
Identify public / private partnering opportunities and
explore creative implementation vehicles and funding
mechanisms
The identification of all potential community partners
interested in the Jacobsville area is a critical first step
toward a healthier and economically successful commercial
area and one that elevates the quality of life for the
neighborhood residents. Some of them are mentioned
throughout this Plan. These major employers, banks,
foundations, institutions, corporations, alliances and
developers should be brought into discussions to determine
what conditions need to be met to engage them into the
redevelopment of the Jacobsville area, specifically the
catalytic project opportunities. Economic partnerships such
as a For-Profit LLC can bring individuals and/or corporations
together to combine resources and share the risks (and
rewards) of focused real estate redevelopment investing.
Not-for-profit community development vehicles can also
provide public improvements and select types of mixed-use
development when immediate return on investment is not as
critical.
Historic renovation is a tool that should not be ignored
in these initiatives. With Jacobsville’s arsenal of historic
properties, historic tax credit building renovation should
become a major redevelopment tool.
Other funding and financing sources should be researched
for appropriate application including the on-going
brownfield remediation/Superfund assistance. Funding
research should focus on:
 Site and public realm development including Superfund
assistance, transportation funding for roads and alternative
transportation, City capital improvements funds for
sustainable infrastructure and general improvements,
MAP-21 initiative by Federal government and economic
development programs.
 Housing Development Incentives such as low-income
housing tax credits, HUD programs, etc.

ACTION STEPS
 Create a collaborative environment with banks,
foundations, institutions, corporations, alliances to
determine how to overcome barriers for reinvestments
into the Jacobsville area. JACC and City should lead the
collaborative effort.
 Identify public-private partnering opportunities,
collaboration with quasi-public organizations and explore
creative implementation vehicles.
 Creation of EID/BID will provide a reliable financing
mechanism and facilitate the cooperation of several
partners to support economic development, capital
improvements and maintenance.
 Discuss opportunities for funding/financing with property
and business owners and provide financial incentives to
small businesses.
 Provide incentives for residential uses on upper floors
of currently underutilized buildings as well as for homes
within residential neighborhoods.
 Engage interested parties to create an LLC. Invitation and
membership to the LLC can be open to both property
owners and non-property owners in the Jacobsville
area. JACC can lead the charge in creation of the LLC.
Once created, the LLC should raise private funds. The
LLC can determine how they want to operate and use
their collective funds toward revitalization – whether to
leverage TIF funds, to leverage superfund assistance,
towards historic rehabilitation and/or towards new infill
development.

51% of property ownership must sign the petition.
Not signing means “no.”

An assessment methodology is proposed that
includes the street frontage, value and square
footage of Downtown properties. There is a
differential in the assessment for commercial and
non-profit (including government) properties.

51% of the total property value in the district must
be represented.
City drafts and considers/approves a local
ordinance authorizing the assessment collection.
Nominating committee selects board of 7 to 11
representing owner of different property sizes,
business owners and a current Covington Business
Council board member.

The BID would have its annual budget geared
toward public realm maintenance and for economic
development and beautification.

COMMITMENT TO BRANDING, IDENTITY & PUBLIC RELATIONS PROGRAMS

Collective marketing strategies: Build on the
strength of the commercial district through collective
marketing with web presence, maps, specials, and
other district-wide marketing strategies.
Promote the neighborhood area as an exciting, convenient
place to live among target population groups including
young professionals, area employees and aging local
residents. Jacobsville, with its proximity to amenities, offers
a tremendous opportunity to create a unique and appealing
living and working environment.
Development of promotional activities for Jacobsville and
marketing the initiatives to the local and regional market
is paramount. This effort has to be coordinated with citywide efforts. Local marketing will provide an understanding
of Jacobsville’s transformation as a neighborhood and
encourage potential residents and additional visitors to
frequent Jacobsville.

ACTION STEPS
 Leverage existing events and promotional items to spread
the perception of Jacobsville’s livability amenities
 Promote cross-promotion of businesses, arts, culture, and
special events with a consistent branded focus
 Develop cohesive signage and banners so that visitors
know they are in the Jacobsville neighborhood and
provide directions to different amenities including parking
 Create website that offers suggestions for what to do in
Jacobsville

Create a wayfinding framework with a common
design theme that reinforces the neighborhood’s
unique attributes.
Two hierarchical levels of signage are recommended to help
reinforce a sense of place as well as direct automobile, bike
and pedestrian traffic through the neighborhood area. They
are:
 Primary/Gateway Signage: Strategically located at the
gateways and outlying areas. These signage components
will guide automobile traffic to specific focus areas and
major destinations within the neighborhood.
 Secondary/District Signage: This family of signs will be
designed with pedestrians and bicyclists in mind. It is
recommended to have not only the common design theme
of the signage family but should also incorporate some
distinctive characteristics or logos/marks specific to the
focus areas in which they are located. In order to highlight
and provide a stronger sense of orientation, consideration
should be given to employing the use of pedestrian-scaled
signing elements that can be easily modified as tenanting
evolves within the focus areas. Future consideration should
also be given to include the identity of the residential areas
as well.
ACTION STEPS
 Gateways and signage should be installed at strategic
entry points including:
 Main Street and Lloyd Expressway
 Mary Street and Lloyd Expressway
 First Avenue and Lloyd Expressway
 First Avenue and Franklin Street
 Main Street and Columbia Street
 Main Street and Morgan Avenue
 Design and install a uniform signage and wayfinding
system with the implementation of streetscape
improvements

COMMITMENT TO ENVIRONMENTAL MITIGATION & SUSTAINABLE SOLUTIONS

Promote sustainable development practices that will
help environmental stewardship, social interactions
and financial benefits
“Sustainability” has become a catch-phrase for practices
that meet ecological, economic and social needs without
compromising the ability of future generations to meet
their own needs. The ethics of sustainability call for an
integrated approach to planning and design that requires
consideration of impacts (from capital improvement projects)
on the natural environment and quality of life. This plan
has been developed with a commitment to considering
the sustainability of the design of every element of the
Jacobsville area.
ACTION STEPS
 There are several key areas that should be addressed
to properly integrate sustainable design practices.
Good design and best practices alone will encompass
many factors of sustainability, but it is important to
implement some actions that will assist towards a more
sustainable future.
1. Site Development
2. Buildings
3. Parks and Recreation
4. Utilities
5. Arts and Culture

1. Site Development
 Low Impact Development (LID)
–– LID is achieved through better site design, minimal
site disturbance, conservation design practices
and installing “green” infrastructure (bio-retention,
pervious pavement, green roofs, rain barrels etc.)

58

–– Protects native landscape, habitat, water quality
and quantity (less flooding), reduction of impervious
surfaces, replenishment of groundwater.
 Green Streets
–– Incorporates multi-modal transportation (pedestrian,
bike, cars, buses, etc.) that helps to provide amenity
for different needs; reduces CO2 emissions, reduces
the number of car trips and vehicle miles traveled.
–– Includes stormwater management features (rain
gardens, porous pavements, etc.) that allows for
gradual recharge of groundwater, while reducing
stormwater runoff from urban areas thereby helping
to improve water quality.
 Green Parking
–– Retrofit existing large surface parking lots and
any new parking installed to incorporate best
management practices for stormwater including
landscaped islands, trees and bioswales.

 Housing mix allows for opportunities for different income
ranges and market niches, thereby encouraging social
interaction and a vibrant area.
 Life cycle housing provides a range of housing options
that meets people’s needs at all stages of life.
 Universal design advocates for housing to provide
accessibility options to accommodate all people
regardless of age or ability (eg. wider interior doorways
and hallways, door levers in lieu of handles, etc.)
 Infill buildings and adaptive reuse utilizes under-utilized
and available lands and buildings for development as
highest and best uses that are connected to existing
infrastructure.
 Building designs include orientation, height and massing
to utilize optimum energy, access to natural light, etc.

5. Arts and Culture
 Murals, paintings, plaques, signage, wayfinding, etc.
should be integrated with streetscape design that
will help to link the major destination areas within
Redevelopment Area, the Jacobsville neighborhood and
Downtown.

 Encourage the use of new, advanced and sustainable
building materials and mechanical, electrical and
plumbing systems.

3. Parks & Recreation
 Providing green spaces and public gathering
opportunities drive economic development activities.
New buildings and stores want to front the open space
as amenity increasing pedestrian traffic to businesses,
residential uses want the piece of green space as a
‘room to breathe’ and aesthetic considerations thereby
making the green spaces as an attractive asset to the
Redevelopment Area.

2. Buildings

 Green roofs help energy efficiency by absorbing
solar heating, adds to aesthetic quality, and reduce
stormwater runoff.
JACOBSVILLE REDEVELOPMENT AREA PLAN

 LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design)
is an internationally accepted benchmark for design,
construction and operation of high performance
sites and buildings. Third-party verification improves
performance metrics for a wide variety of factors - site
design, energy consumption, water efficiency, improved
indoor environmental quality, recycling and reuse.

4. Utilities
 Implement stormwater management practices.
 Assess the feasibility of incorporation of stormwater
management practices along streetscapes.
 Promote the utilization of available sewer and
stormwater credits to developments in locations with
existing infrastructure.
 Explore renewable energy generation systems
(geothermal systems within parks or other large
development initiatives, solar power for lighting, small
scale streetscape heating etc.) to reduce the need for
fossil fuel and thus reducing carbon footprint.

revise current regulatory mechaniSms (zoning code, design development standards, design review) to align with
redevelopment vision

Provide a regulatory framework that encourages
the land use mix proposed in the Redevelopment
Area Plan, discourages incompatible or noncontributing uses, and sets forth dimensional and
other development requirements that will achieve the
vision for redevelopment.
While there are many programs and activities important to
the overall implementation of this Plan, the zoning ordinance
is a critical mechanism for achieving the desired land use
pattern and quality of development advocated in the Plan.
Zoning regulations control the intensity and arrangement
of development through standards on lot size or density,
setbacks from property lines, building dimensions and
similar minimum requirements. Various site design elements
discussed in this Plan can also be regulated through the
site plan review process, which addresses overall site
design for items such as landscaping, driveways, parking
and circulation, and access management. Together, these
elements combine to define the type of development that will
be allowed or required, and so it is a critical component of
any implementation plan.
The City’s current Zoning Regulations have been reviewed
relative to their applicability to the Jacobsville neighborhood
and the land use development patterns recommended in the
Jacobsville Subarea Plan. This is not an exhaustive review
of all aspects of the zoning regulations, nor is it intended
to propose specific amendments. However, upon reviewing
the existing regulations, it is apparent that the city’s zoning
ordinance is not structured and does not contain the tools
needed to fully implement the Redevelopment Plan.
In general, the ordinance should be re-organized (see
appendix), streamlined and clarified to remove unnecessary
zoning districts, especially where existing districts overlap.
While the actions given here may help improve zoning for
the Jacobsville neighborhood, this recommendation may
be applied to the ordinance as a whole. A comprehensive
update to the zoning ordinance is strongly recommended to
ensure any changes made pursuant to this plan will blend
seamlessly with the larger regulatory document.

ACTION STEPS
 Simplify the ordinance:
 Update the list of allowed uses to remove the use
groups, modernize the list of uses, remove outdated
terms and revisit which uses should be permitted
by right as opposed to requiring special exception
approval (vehicle service stations, drive-in restaurants,
intense industrial, outdoor sales, vehicle wash
establishments, etc.).
 Consolidate similar districts, especially those that
allow similar uses or require the same dimensional
requirements (R-4 and R-5; CO-1 and CO-2; C-4,
M-1, M-2 and M-3), to remove unnecessary zoning
districts.
 Simplify the zoning districts as discussed above,
and provide specific purpose statements for each.
Without an identified purpose, districts can be
inadvertently, but inappropriately assigned to property.
 Expand the ordinance:
 Add a landscaping section to address frontage
plantings, sidewalks, clear vision areas, etc.
 Develop basic building design standards that address
required design for main street buildings, building
height step-back transitions in the Townhouse and
Workforce to the Traditional Main Street areas.
 Update the sign regulations to address home
occupation uses, and main street signage that might
include marquee, projecting, and sandwich board
signs.

ACTION STEPS
 Revise the zoning map according to the Redevelopment
Area Plan:
 Eliminate the R-5 district, which allows up to 150 foot
tall (10 to 12 story) buildings that are not appropriate
for the Jacobsville area.
 Eliminate the M-3 district, which allows intense uses
that are not appropriate for the Jacobsville area.
 Modify the current districts to include elements
needed to achieve the vision in the Redevelopment
Plan. In some cases, existing districts may be used,
but the City may choose to develop specific districts
that match the future land use recommendations. As
noted, the City’s zoning ordinance is already quite
cumbersome, so adding new districts is reluctantly
suggested. However, if the City should re-organize
its current ordinance, the following table provides
direction regarding which districts may most
closely match those proposed, and what additional
regulations should be considered to achieve the
vision in the Redevelopment Plan.
 Consider adopting a performance-based zoning
approach:
 This will be for the Main Street corridor and/or
other parts of the district. Rather than the traditional
“Euclidean” zoning which is concerned primarily
with the segregation of land uses between discrete
districts, other creative concepts should be considered
in order to achieve the desired look and character
envisioned in the Plan. Potential techniques could
include a form-based Code, an overlay zoning district
or a hybrid than combines elements of form-based
and traditional.

59

This future land use plan seeks to simplify the patchwork
of land uses across the Study Area into distinct districts
that complement the urban design framework plan and
catalytic project areas. These land use categories recognize
predominant established uses, while placing greater
emphasis on the character of future development rather
than particular uses. These designations are established to
provide the foundation for zoning changes to accomplish the
goals set forth in this Plan.

Big Idea 8
Future Land Uses

Preserved Single-Family Residential are substantial
clusters of single-family homes. These areas
include a critical mass of existing homes that,
with appropriate residential infill, can thrive as
continued residential districts in the Study Area.
Townhouse/Workforce Housing is targeted for
areas adjacent to the employment and medical
districts along primary corridors. Employees
of these campuses seek urban-style housing
options such as townhouses or lofts, which can
accommodate a variety of affordability levels
when complemented by single-family infill housing
nearby. This category provides a good transition
along primary corridors between the largescale campuses and the preserved single-family
neighborhoods.
Mixed-Use areas are transitional areas that
can support well-designed mixed-use buildings
including office, retail, and residential uses.
These areas front primary corridors, making them
suitable for contemporary “Main Street” style
buildings rather than mimicking the more historic
charm of Main Street.
Traditional Main Street preserves and restores
the historic Main Street buildings, which are
pedestrian-oriented and front the street. It also
encourages a vertical mixture of uses, with retail
on the first floor and offices or residential above.
Employment Campus provides the large industrial
campuses, Berry and Vectren, room to grow, but
contains their uses to the southern portion of
the Study Area along the Lloyd Expressway. This
designation should include high-quality campus
design, providing well-screened parking, improved
visual character from the expressway, and
appropriate buffers to adjacent uses.

Chapter 4

IMPLEMENTATION FRAMEWORK

The intent of the Jacobsville Redevelopment Area Plan
is to provide overall goals and objectives for sustainable
development, creation of diversified economy, provide variety of
job options, preservation and enhancement of the quality of life,
expand housing choices, create safe and secure neighborhoods,
promote mixed-use, connect destinations and to coordinate
transportation and infrastructure improvements to support the
future growth within the Jacobsville neighborhood.
The implementation section is critical in framing the
recommended strategies so that the initiatives can be
appropriately tasked and completed within an expected
timeframe. Moreover, it acts as a yardstick to gauge the results
of the implementation initiatives to marked impact on the
Jacobsville neighborhood.
Any development and organizational review and approvals
should strongly adhere to the recommended strategies of this
Plan. Development decisions may sometimes require an amount
of flexibility from the recommended policies to implement based
on current circumstances. Particular attention should be provided
in those cases so that the essence of the approvals does not
deviate from the visions and objectives of the Plan. Major
deviations that are not consistent with the Plan will require formal
amendment of the Plan.
City departments, ERC, JACC and associated agencies should
continually review the Plan for adherence to the policies and
programs. Capital Improvement Program (CIP) and budgets
should be earmarked according to the programs and budgets
based on the priorities and timelines as described within the
checklist. As initiatives are being implemented, this Plan along

with the CIP, will be the guide to ensure capital and operational
investments are consistent with the visions and objectives as
prescribed in this Plan.

 Revise regulatory framework to create a conducive
development environment for public and private investment
to occur according to the guidance mechanisms

The Plan should be revisited and modified on a 5-year basis
based on implemented projects and potential opportunities.

 Implement a market rate housing project in collaboration
with Deaconess Hospital

Potential Initial Initiatives

 Create a BID/EID within Main Street district

The following action items are recommended to be implemented
for catalytic effect to initiate the Redevelopment Area Plan.
The order of the initial items does not provide any hierarchy;
rather the plan and the recommendations, including these
potential initial initiatives, are flexible to allow for other catalytic
opportunities to be implemented provided they abide by the
vision and the guidelines of the Redevelopment Area Plan.
 Employ a redevelopment director (full-time or part-time)
to implement the day-to-day activities by coordinating
with Evansville Redevelopment Commission (ERC),
Jacobsville Area Community Corporation (JACC), City
and other important stakeholders (potential activities discussing the possibilities of strengthening the position of
existing businesses, specifically on Main Street, recruiting
businesses, discuss with real estate professionals for potential
development, coordinate with City, JACC for implementation,
setting up BID, LLC, etc.)
 Set-aside capital budget and implement priority streetscape
projects for Franklin and Virginia streets (utilize Jacobsville
as one of the pilot projects for implementation of green
infrastructure as part of the Renew Evansville project)

APPENDIX

Zoning Ordinance Technical Review
the Commercial/Office districts (CO-1 and CO-2) allow
all forms of residential land use, including single family
dwellings. On its face, this seems completely inappropriate.
Likewise, a full range of retail and service uses is permitted
within the three industrial districts. This not only creates
unnecessary competition with the city’s designated
commercial zones, but allows conflicting uses and customer
traffic within the industrial areas. Use group #8 permits
“department store”, “supermarket”, “drug stores”, “night
clubs”, and “theater” in the M-1 and M-2 industrial districts.
While permitting the opportunity for mixed uses is desirable,
the randomness of these groupings is not consistent with the
concept of mixed use.

The following comments are the result of a technical review
of the current zoning regulations for the City of Evansville. In
particular, the regulations have been reviewed relative to their
applicability to the Jacobsville neighborhood and the land use
development patterns recommended in the Jacobsville Subarea
Plan. This is not an exhaustive review of all aspects of the zoning
regulations, nor is it intended to propose specific amendments.
However, upon reviewing the existing regulations, it is apparent
that the city’s zoning ordinance is not structured and does not
contain the tools needed to fully implement the Subarea Plan.

General Comments










70

The ordinance structure is difficult to use, requiring the
reader to consult multiple sections just to determine which
uses are allowed in any given district.



Many of the districts are based on the early, and now
outdated, “Euclidean” pyramid style in which each
zoning district allows all (or most) of the uses permitted
in the district immediately preceding it. This is especially
evident in the CO-2, C-4 and M-3 districts which are an
agglomeration of uses.
At first glance, the ordinance gives the impression of being
outdated. Use groups are littered with archaic terms – film
exchange, stereophonic equipment, video tapes, letter
service and mimeograph, telegraph office, aluminum can
collection, parasols, venetian blinds, carbon paper and
ink ribbon manufacturing, etc. This does not suggest a
progressive community.
The categorization of land uses into 21 use groups is
cumbersome. Several of the groups lack a unified theme
and seem to include random and illogical pairings unrelated
to the majority in the group. For example, group #9 lists
a number of gambling related uses but also includes
“blue printing and photostating” and “lithographing and
engraving”.
There is no defined purpose for any of the zoning districts.
The districts seem to be a random composite of uses that
don’t relate to a specific intent or to the physical area
in which they are located. Therefore, many of the use
groups contain uses that seem completely inappropriate
for the districts where they are permitted. For example,

JACOBSVILLE | REDEVELOPMENT AREA PLAN







Main Street, the neighborhood’s primary commercial
corridor, appears to contain three separate commercial
zoning districts and two industrial districts. The most
intense of these and the most prevalent along the corridor
is the C-4 district which permits most, if not all, of the uses
permitted in the other commercial districts. Again, the lack
of a defined purpose for each district results in unnecessary
overlap and conflict among the districts. The range of
uses permitted in the C-4 District is likely too intense and
broad for the Main Street corridor. Examples of permitted
uses include: welding supply and equipment, welding
shop, storage warehouse, recycling center, bottling plant,
contractor shops, truck repair and many others.
The zoning map is a patchwork quilt of districts, illustrating
both the lack of a coherent plan and a defined purpose for
the zoning districts.

sales, vehicle wash establishments, etc.) are not among the
special uses.


Commercial/service uses, entertainment and recreation are
all allowed in the industrial districts. This should be revised.
Mixing general retail and high traffic entertainment uses
(e.g., theaters) with industrial/employment centers is typically
undesirable and a deterrent to creating concentrated
employment centers.

Uses by District



There is little distinction among most of the commercial
districts, suggesting all four districts are not needed or that
their focus should be more narrowly defined.



CO-1 and CO-2 allow single family dwellings, but not
home occupations. This is another example of contradiction
and oversight within the ordinance. The only apparent
difference between the two CO Districts is that one limits
offices to 3,000 square feet, while the other allows offices
over 3,000 square feet. This is something that could be
controlled as a special use, rather than creating redundant
zoning districts.

The following table illustrates the overlap and generalized
categories of uses permitted within the various zoning districts
currently found in the Jacobsville neighborhood.

There is considerable overlap between districts (R-4 and

of these could be consolidated or revised to serve a more
distinct purpose. For example, special use provisions could
be used in some cases to provide desired controls without
the need to create totally separate zoning districts.

13 – Water related commercial/industrial

Only limited use is made of special use controls. While
there are approximately 30 uses identified as special uses,
these are primarily limited to very large scale (airports,
colleges, hospitals, etc.) and/or potentially obnoxious uses
(gun clubs, mineral extraction, sanitary landfills, etc.). Other
uses commonly controlled as special uses (vehicle service

Bed & Breakfasts are not allowed in any residential districts
(where they are traditionally found), but permitted in C1
commercial which doesn’t allow single family dwellings.
Again, this is an example of contradiction and lack of
defined purpose for the individual districts. It may also
suggest that the B&B use was included in a specific zoning
district to accommodate individuals or isolated conditions.
Group #4 permits “apartment dwelling units” and “multiple
dwellings”. This is confusing, though the ordinance defines
apartment dwelling unit as essentially an accessory dwelling.
Treating this as a special use would be preferable to listing it
as a principal permitted use.
Despite all the overlap, there is no true mixed use district.
Allowing a mixture of uses requires some forethought
and a defined purpose to ensure that the allowed uses, in
combination, complement one another and do not create
conflicts.
The Planned Unit Development District allows only limited
mixed use. Non-residential uses within a residential
PUD, for example, must be intended to primarily serve
the residents of the PUD. Therefore, PUD doesn’t permit
the flexibility desired for such a zoning tool. In addition,
there are no review standards, open space requirements,
qualifying conditions or other specifics to guide the PUD
review or give the applicant any direction. On their face,
the PUD regulations provide maximum flexibility with zero
guidance. This is not conducive to encouraging developers
to use PUD as a creative tool.



There doesn’t appear to be any provision for mixed use
(residential/non-residential) in any zoning district. PUD
would be the only way to integrate varying uses and this is
very limited.



Parking requirements are overly complicated; there are
excessive requirements for some uses; and parking is tied
(inappropriately) to use groups, which are too generic to
fit the use type or district purpose. For example, parking
standards for one-family dwellings require two spaces per
dwelling (typical) but also require additional parking for
“extended family.” This is unenforceable and cumbersome.
Another example is found regarding home occupations for
which added parking is required, though the ordinance
does not permit home occupations that will generate
customer traffic or employ non-residents. Likewise, parking
requirements for multiple family dwellings are based on the
number of bedrooms, another unnecessary and unusual
complication. For neighborhood retail (Use Group #7),
a requirement of 5 spaces per 1,000 square feet of gross
floor area is used. This is excessive for most types of retail,
but far beyond what should be required for neighborhood
businesses. Conversely, in Use Group #11 (which includes
flea markets), the parking requirement is only 2 spaces per
1,000 square feet (totally inadequate for that type of use)..



Sign regulations are meager and generic; don’t address
individual sign types, business centers, or specific size and
location requirements. Industrial sign area is permitted to
be substantially larger (1,000 square feet) than commercial
sign area (150 to 500 square feet). This is unusual since
industrial uses generally don’t require the type and amount
of signs more commonly found in commercial districts.



While review procedures for PUDs and Improvement
Location Permits (site plan) appear to be fairly efficient,
the ordinance does not provide any standards to guide
decisions. This can result in inconsistent and arbitrary
decision-making and frustration for the applicant. It is
essential that any process requiring a discretionary decision
(such as PUD, site plan review and special uses) be based
on specific standards cited in the ordinance.

100%

all zones



All dimensional requirements should be reviewed. In the
absence of any significant differences in dimensions and
allowed uses, districts should be combined where possible
(R-4 and R-5, C0-1 and CO-2).



The R-5 district permits up to 150 foot tall (10 to 12 story)
buildings and only a 5,000 square foot lot and 5 foot side
yard are required. If such high-rise buildings are to be
permitted in the city, the Jacobsville neighborhood seems
an unlikely location. Such height allowance could be
addressed as a special use, rather than creating a second
residential district for that purpose.



There are very few dimensional requirements for commercial
and industrial districts. Some minimum standards should be
required.



The dimensional requirements table notes 100% green
space in front yard. This seems to mean that parking is not
permitted in the front yard. Is this any front yard or just the
required front yard?

BACKGROUND
AND GOALS

BACKGROUND AND GOALS
The Downtown Evansville Master Plan Update identifies priorities for downtown improvements,
policies and actions for the next five-to-seven-year investment cycle. It was initiated in mid-2015
by the Evansville Redevelopment Commission (ERC).
The last Master Plan for Downtown Evansville was completed in 2001 by Kinzelman Kline
Gossman, with additional implementation work in 2005 by HOK Planning Group. While these
documents impacted downtown positively, they could not foresee the changes driving downtown
in 2016 and beyond, and more importantly, what tools and strategies will facilitate downtown’s
success into the future.
Discussions around the need for an updated plan began in earnest in late 2014, with the
announcement of Downtown Evansville as the selected location for the expanded Indiana
University School of Medicine Evansville, and Evansville Multi-Institutional Academic Health
Science Education & Research Campus (Medical Campus) and accelerated as a revamped
incentive package was being put together for the DoubleTree by Hilton Convetion Hotel.
This Plan frames a way to capture the catalytic impact these two major projects can have
in Downtown Evansville, while providing strategies to leverage and incentivize additional
development and investment.
Other factors were also top-of-mind as this Plan was developed. Evansville is in a competition,
a critical one, for population and workforce – particularly the young skilled millennials that
create businesses and ‘city-build’ while they are doing so. Millennials are being sought after from
coast-to-coast. This Plan helps develop strategies to retain our homegrown talent, encourage
those who graduate from our regional colleges and universities to stay, as well as bring back
those who have already left Evansville for perceived greener pastures.

BACKGROUND AND GOALS 4

Other communities have shown the importance of a vital downtown as a tool for retaining and
attracting the talent needed to keep their communities flourishing; Evansville can incorporate
those lessons as it improves downtown. The notion of attracting talent through quality of place
got a boost with the 2015 selection of Indiana's Great Southwest as an Indiana ‘Regional City,’
and the 2016 funding of $42 million towards creating a talent-worthy community. Many of the
Regional City programs are planned for Downtown Evansville and are incorporated into elements
of the Plan.
The ERC contracted with Progressive Urban Management Associates (P.U.M.A.), a Denver-based
consulting firm specializing in downtown economic development, organizational and strategic
planning. Other members of the consulting team include Hafer, an Evansville-based architecture
and engineering firm providing design and local perspective, and Rundell Ernstberger Associates
(REA), an Indianapolis-based firm providing additional design work, mapping, and graphics.
This Plan is different than previous efforts in several ways; perhaps most importantly it strives to
build a downtown neighborhood through a series of strategies that include:
•
•
•
•
•

Framing Downtown Evansville as “an activated, innovative, connected neighborhood.”
Being user-friendly, key ideas of the plan are drafted and presented in a manner that is easily
accessible to the community that helped shape it.
Offering an extensive market assessment that builds on Evansville’s inherent strengths and
identifies favorable demographic and lifestyle trends that can benefit downtown.
Focusing on four “Transformative Ideas”: Activating Main Street, activating the riverfront,
developing a “Makers District” and improving public spaces.
Demonstrating the importance of the creation of a sustainable downtown-focused
management organization. The Evansville Downtown Alliance will be a sustainable
organization with resources to effect the changes the Plan outlines, advocating for the
implementation of the transformational ideas which will retain and attract the workforce and
city-building talent needed for Evansville’s continued transformation.

BACKGROUND AND GOALS 5

The Evansville
Regional Development
Commission
President, Randy
Alsman, summed
up the overarching
objectives for the plan
in this way:

Together the preceding elements create a “Community Handbook to City Building”, providing
the market grounding, innovative strategies and practical steps to enable all members of the
Evansville community to join together and participate in improving downtown – from energetic
millennials to seasoned corporate CEOs.
The planning process was guided by the following project goals:
•
•
•

Build on prior planning efforts and engage city leadership, neighborhoods, and civic partners
in a participatory process.
Develop a strategic vision and investment plan to help guide Downtown Evansville’s evolution
toward shared goals through the next five-to-seven-year investment cycle.
Align resources with the priorities of the Master Plan Update to implement organizational and
financial strategies.

“Effective,
Inspirational,
Achievable.”

PLAN ELEMENTS
The planning process was designed to be an inclusive effort representative of the community’s
vision. The brief summaries of Plan components below are supported by detailed appendices,
attached to this document.

1. Summary of Prior Plans

3. Community Engagement

4. Planning Framework

The consultants reviewed prior relevant and
evolving plans to ensure that this process
would build upon those efforts.

A broad engagement effort was undertaken
to involve the community in the planning
effort. The outreach – which attracted more
than 1,500 community voices – included a
steering committee of downtown stakeholders,
individual interviews, meetings with focus
groups representing specific interest areas, an
online survey, and community open houses.
The core values that emerged from the
outreach include:

Drawing on findings from previous plans,
the market assessment, and community
engagement, the consulting team developed
a Planning Framework to guide physical
investments in the public realm that support
and enhance market opportunities. The
Planning Framework concepts and maps are
key components of this Plan.

2. Market Assessment
A comprehensive market assessment identified
specific market opportunities in the residential,
office, retail, entertainment, and mobility
sectors. Additionally, P.U.M.A.’s Global Trends
Affecting Downtowns offered an overview of
trends impacting Downtown Evansville. Global
Trends information helps provide additional
market context and supports the market
conclusions and plan recommendations.

Activated – A vibrant downtown, Main Street
and Riverfront.
Innovative – A regional hub for jobs,
innovation & unique businesses.
Connected - Safe, walkable & bikeable.
Neighborhood – A downtown for living with
diverse housing options and amenities.

PLAN ELEMENTS 8

5. Four Transformative Ideas
Aligning with the Planning Framework
concepts, four catalytic ideas – those that
could have the most transformative impact on
Downtown Evansville – have emerged through
the planning process:

"Downtown.
Lights on
buildings and
everything
that makes you
wonder. And in
that moment,
I swear we are
infinite."

A Thriving Main Street

An Active, Accessible Riverfront

Channeling new investment to a few blocks
along Main Street, including a newly redesigned
4th and Main Street Park, will create a hub of
activity that radiates beyond Main Street to
energize the entire Downtown core.

Enhancing the riverfront by including more
amenities and better pedestrian access to
create a more appealing and dynamic public
space for the entire community to meet, play,
and linger.

NoCo Makers District

Public Space Improvements

Designating the area North of Court Street
as a “makers district” – a place where people
live and work, where production ranges from
fabricating to knitting to brewing and beyond,
can enhance the diversity and appeal of
Downtown Evansville.

Where it is easy to move to and through by foot,
bike, or car. Complete streets, wayfinding, and
gateways can make moving through downtown
intuitive and enjoyable. Parks and greenspace
provide places to relax or play, and can guide
future private development.

Wallflower

PLAN ELEMENTS 9

6. Action Plan
The Action Plan includes projects identified
in other plans, and incorporates new
ideas, prioritizing those that have the
most potential to advance community
vision and values. It is an actionable list of
implementation strategies that will bring this
plan to life. “Quick wins” – efforts that can
begin immediately – are also identified.

7. Implementation - How the Plan
Comes to Life
In order to advance implementation of this
Plan and its priorities, a new downtown
organization – the Evansville Downtown
Alliance – is recommended. The Alliance will
lead the charge to build a new Downtown
Evansville and convene partners from
throughout the community. Financing
options, including a plan to form an
Economic Improvement District (EID), and a
leadership strategy are also outlined in the
implementation section.

“It's really kind
of hard to be
a suburb of
nothing. If you
don't have a
downtown,
you really
don't have
anything. It's
hard to build
a community
around parking
lots and
subdivisions."
- Ed McMahon

PLANNING
EFFORTS

PREVIOUS PLANNING EFFORTS
An important aspect of the Master Plan Update is to research and embrace the goals and values
of many of the plans and projects that have come before this one. This Plan builds on the desire
to activate the riverfront and promote a vibrant urban core that has been exhibited in many
plans - dating back to 1927 when Harland Bartholomew and Associates completed one of the
most comprehensive master plans for the City. Recent plans such as the initial Downtown Master
Plan produced in 1984 inspired the establishment of Downtown Evansville as an event destination
and contributed to the overall aesthetic enhancements to streets and the riverfront. Following
this Plan was an update in 1995 that focused on integration of the new Casino Aztar campus
into the riverfront dynamic. The 2001 Master Plan improved circulation downtown, expanded the
entertainment district and called for residential development along Main Street.
In the past few years, Downtown Evansville has experienced exciting developments that have
sparked an increased interest in downtown. These improvements include the construction of the
new Ford Center, additional restaurants and retail developments, multi-unit housing and overall
recreational enhancements. Current developments such as the Medical Campus, downtown
hotel, and the land-based Tropicana casino and their resulting impact were also considered during
the development of this plan.

1927 Plan for City's Appearance
By Harland Bartholomew

In addition to actual development, at the grassroots level, excitement was built when a
community-wide, citizen-driven visioning process, Evansville VOICE, was undertaken in 2013.
Some 3,000 people took part in 32 visioning sessions that led Evansville VOICE volunteers to
launch, organize and support collaborative projects. Three focus areas emerged including: City
Core, Experiences, and Healthy Green Space. The data derived from these efforts has been an
appreciated resource for development of this Master Plan.

PREVIOUS PLANNING EFFORTS 12

Several additional recent planning efforts have also contributed to the excitement and vision of
this Master Plan. These resources have been reviewed and incorporated. A summary, including
their specific impact on downtown, of these planning efforts are as follows:

This plan analyzes bicycling and walking
in Evansville and makes recommendations
for future infrastructure and programming
improvements to expand multimodal
transportation options throughout the
City. In particular, downtown would benefit
from additional bike amenities and better
connectivity across the Lloyd Expressway.

The plan targets growth in Evansville and
Vanderburgh County by encouraging and
supporting employment opportunities and
livability. The plan calls out downtown as
a major employment center for the region,
but not as a shopping, entertainment and
residential hub. Key downtown initiatives
include reestablishing downtown as the urban
core, development of particular amenities, and
various redevelopment strategies.

This report summarizes findings and
recommendations from the Evansville Transit
Comprehensive Operations Analysis (COA)
for improving METS bus service throughout
Evansville. The report specifically calls for
improved transit access to Downtown
particularly from the USI campus, Warrick
County and Eastside surburban development.
Upgrades to the Transfer Center are planned
for 2016/2017.

This assessment analyzes housing in Evansville
and identifies suitable housing types. In
downtown, the housing market is particularly
strong due to consistent business expansions
and revitalization efforts. The quantity, variety
and quality of housing in downtown will
need to increase in order to meet growing
demand for rentals, studios and one bedroom
apartments.

natural space and farmland with a focus on
social equity, environmental sustainability, and
clustering growth and development in urban
areas. Downtown is prioritized as the best
possible area to direct growth, development,
and reinvestment. However, near-downtown's
high concentration of poverty presents a
barrier to growth. Several proposed projects in
downtown were highlighted in the document.

A Report on Blight, Vacancy and
Abandonment in Evansville, IN

This plan analyzes “brain drain” in the
greater Evansville region and recommends
strengthening downtown as the top strategy
for attracting and retaining a young, skilled
talent pool. Specifically, the plan recommends
reinvesting in downtown to create a vibrant
core that will appeal to the young, diverse
workforce that has been leaving.

This planning effort was aimed at providing
the City of Evansville a streetscape
enhancement program specifically intended
to encourage residents, shoppers, and
visitors to utilize downtown for business and
entertainment. The Deliberative reinforces the
necessity of building a green public amenity
infrastructure that forms the framework
for private investment and creates the
neighborhood culture desired by residents
searching for urban living experiences.

This report analyzes blight and vacancy in
Evansville. The plan links blight to strong
population decline in the urban core.
Downtown is surrounded by a swath of blight.
Recommended solutions include land banking as
means to redevelopment and adding new and
affordable housing options to serve existing lowincome residents and future residents.

MARKET
ASSESSMENT
17. Global Trends Affecting
Downtown Evansville
18. Key Market Opportunities

MARKET ASSESSMENT
As part of the strategic planning process, a market assessment was prepared to help inform recommendations for public and private
investments that strengthen underlying market trends. The assessment summarizes current market conditions in Downtown Evansville and
offers an educated overview and qualitative assessment of trends and market opportunities Downtown Evansville can leverage.

Global Trends Affecting Downtown Evansville
Since 2006, P.U.M.A. has been conducting research into global trends affecting downtowns. The
research adds insight that helps predict the direction and magnitude of local market influences.
Many of these trends are in evidence in Downtown Evansville, and can be expected to increasingly
contribute to a more thriving downtown. Some notable global trends that are beginning to
impact Evansville include:
•
•

•

Millennials and empty-nest Boomers are
driving a resurgence in downtown living.
A “rebound wave” of 25-to-34 year-olds
being priced out of big cities like Chicago
and Nashville is opening an opportunity
for less expensive cities like Evansville to
bring former residents back home.
Skilled talent is in high demand, driving
businesses to locate in the compact
urban centers that these employees
prefer.

•
•
•

•

Walking and biking as forms of
transportation are on the rise.
Car ownership is decreasing.
Healthy lifestyles, including fresh food
and active living options, are driving
choices in where to live and how to get
around.
Growing consumer preference for local
retail and experience shopping, at all
price points.

All of these trends favor Downtown Evansville and its ability to attract and retain a talented
workforce and a reinvigorated downtown core.

MARKET ASSESSMENT 17

Key Market Opportunities
Based on both quantitative and qualitative data, P.U.M.A. identified key market opportunities in
Downtown Evansville, they include:
Residential
The downtown residential market is strong and currently underserved. There is opportunity for
diverse and quality housing product at all price points – affordable, market rate and upscale.
Retail
There is ample opportunity for additional restaurants, cafes, and specialty retail, particularly along
Main Street. Downtown must appeal to skilled workers in order to fill office vacancies. One way to
make it more appealing is through additional retail.
Office
There is an oversupply of traditional office space which presents an opportunity to convert class B
office space to residential units. Conversely, demand exists for affordable and creative office space
which could fill street-level vacancies in downtown.
Hospitality
The hotel market may be reaching short-term saturation with the new DoubleTree by Hilton
anticipated to open in late 2016. However, there appears to be room for an additional boutique hotel.
Public Space
Investments in the public realm such as complete streets, bike lanes and amenities, more
open space and parks, intuitive connections throughout downtown, holiday or event lighting,
street furniture, and safe pedestrian connections all add up to a more appealing, thriving,
and exciting place to be. Public space investments and enhancements are a critical part of an
appealing urban core that in turn attracts residential, retail, office, and hospitality investments
throughout downtown.

Online Survey Responses
An online community survey was created and 1,242 responses were collected. The majority of respondents were greater Evansville residents, as
well as downtown visitors, employees, residents, and business owners. A majority of respondents had household incomes in the $50,000 to $200,000
range, and were between the ages of 25 and 49.
When asked to choose the single most important action to achieve their vision for Downtown Evansville, respondents’ top three choices were:
1. Activate the riverfront, make it more appealing, active, and user-friendly.
2. Activate Main Street with shops, events, restaurants, streetscape, public space enhancements.
3. Encourage more nightlife, restaurants and clubs, create an entertainment niche.
In an open response question, the survey asked respondents to list three words that describe their vision of a future Downtown Evansville.
The resulting word cloud represents the most common words (the larger the word, the more often the word was used). Respondents see a
future Downtown Evansville as:

DOWNTOWN
ZONES

DOWNTOWN ZONES
Downtown Evansville is roughly defined by the Lloyd Expressway to the north, the Ohio River to the South, Mulberry to the east, and Fulton
to the west. The 'study area' for this Strategic plan is indicated by the dotted line on the map below, and is larger than the Downtown
Redevelopment District or the nearly contiguous 47708 zip code. This study area includes significant buildings and activity centers outside of
the Redevelopment District including recent development along Walnut, more residential areas, and development opportunity areas.
The district map informs where Evansville should
concentrate investment in the public realm
and help leverage private investment. A zone
framework, detailed in the following section, was
then developed to define areas of emphasis,
approaches, and connections throughout
downtown. The downtown zones are:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Downtown Core – the center of downtown
including Main Street and the Tropicana
Casino.
Civic Center – the area surrounding City Hall.
Riverfront Park – the greenway area and
Riverside Drive.
NoCo – a new “Makers District” intended to
appeal to entrepreneurs and creatives, named
for its location north of Court Street.
Medical Campus – the area defined by the
redevelopment of the IU medical campus.
The Riverside Preservation Area lies to the
south-east of the Core, and continues into the
Arts District (outside the area of this study).

FRAMEWORK
Building upon the district map, a series of framework maps were developed to illustrate
existing and future conditions in Downtown Evansville. Each map layer identifies
opportunities for improvements, investment, activation, and programming. The map layers
illustrate existing conditions and future opportunities. They are described in detail below.

Amenity Infrastructure
The amenity infrastructure is a network of enhanced complete streets, park space, and signage
that connects districts and destinations throughout Downtown Evansville. It is important because
it helps define specific areas for investment that will help create a more walkable and livable
downtown. While the exact configuration of each street will vary, common complete street
elements may include:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Wide, accessible, and easily walkable pedestrian sidewalks.
Two-way dedicated bicycle facilities.
Traffic calming features to reduce vehicle speeds.
Green infrastructure to reduce stormwater runoff.
More trees and increased tree canopy.
Fourth Street improvements to maximize visual and physical
connections between NoCo and the medical campus from Court
to the Arts District area.

Gateways located along these complete
streets will define and announce arrival into
Downtown Evansville. They should be eyecatching, artistic, and informational. They may
include signage, sculptural artwork, identity
signs, light displays, plantings, and/or murals
under overpasses. Proposed locations for
gateways include:

The addition of the Medical Campus will
create a completely new place within the city,
improving six underutilized blocks and city
streets adjacent to the development. This will
announce entry into the Medical Campus,
and serve as an introduction to the downtown
core. Due to its width and terminating vista,
Fourth Street provides ample opportunity for
enhanced design features.

Adjacent to the Medical Campus, the new
DoubleTree by Hilton will activate the Old
National Events Plaza and revitalize regional
convention business in Evansville. The new
streetscape will enhance the pedestrian
experience adjacent to both the hotel and the
Medical Campus along Walnut and Fourth.

core development
in the downtown
area that is
absolutely
honing to boost
our economy.
It's going to
boost downtown.
It's going to
create the need
for downtown
development."

The public spaces framework layer identifies
areas in Downtown Evansville that have the
opportunity to improve and add public park
space. Vibrant public spaces can be created
using existing parks and infill development
opportunities, and through improvements
within the public right-of-way. Ownership
of park space opportunities vary between
public and private parties, and will require
collaborative approaches to develop.
Enhancing downtown’s “outdoor living room”
is a way to create a more appealing place
that will attract more people, activity, and
investment.
The existing Riverfront and the privately
owned 4th and Main Street Park are critical
components to downtown public space.
They can be improved by adding amenities
and features, consistent programming, and
special events, as well as encouraging passive
use. Upcoming development near the Old
Post Office, Central Library, and the Medical
Campus will create more publicly accessible
outdoor space.

Activity Centers
Evansville has a variety of unique activity centers and cultural destinations. This framework layer
identifies downtown destinations that can catalyze redevelopment and strengthen economic and
cultural growth. The three activity centers that attract the most visitors annually serve as anchors that
are located throughout downtown.

Tropicana Evansville Land Based Casino

Evansville Vanderburgh Central Library

Ford Center

The Evansville Vanderburgh Central Library
is the second most visited attraction in
downtown. With one million annual visitors,
the library has tremendous catalytic potential.
The library has plans to develop adjacent
land for programming and performances
downtown while providing space for
community activities including a Farmer’s
Market.

The Ford Center on Main Street is the third
busiest downtown activity center and attracts
about 425,000 visitors annually. The Ford
Center can catalyze more investment and
activity on Main Street. The market assessment
reinforces the notion that there is ample
opportunity for more restaurants, cafes,
shops, and bars on Main Street – all of which
are activities that can enhance a visit to any
downtown attraction.

The Tropicana Casino attracts more than 1.1
million visitors every year. The casino has
recently begun planning to move from its
current riverboat location to a new land-based
location. The new casino is expected to break
ground in 2016 and be completed late 2017.

FRAMEWORK 31

Other downtown activity centers include:
•

The Civic Center containing City and County offices and courts; adjacent Federal Building
with courthouse and U.S. Post Office.

•

Cultural venues and institutions including the Victory Theatre (home of the Evansville
Philharmonic), the Evansville Museum of Arts, History and Transportation, the Reitz Home
Museum, the Old Court House, Koch Family Children’s Museum of Evansville (cMoe), the Soldier
and Sailor’s Memorial Coliseum, the Hadi Shrine, and two institutions just outside the downtown
study area: the LST 325 and the Evansville African American Museum.

•

Places of worship include multiple churches, and a Catholic oratory.

•

Recreation facilities including the YMCA, the YWCA, the riverfront, the Pigeon Creek
Greenway Passage, and Sunset Park located just outside the downtown study area.

•

Major employers including Old National Bank, Vectren Energy Deliver, Springleaf/One Main,
as well as Berry Plastics, Koch Enterprises and Deaconess Health Systems located just outside
the study area.

•

Downtown Evansville is one of five nascent ‘Cultural Districts’ and lies in the center of these
Districts: Haynie’s Corner Arts District, North Main/Jacobsville, West Franklin and the University
of Evansville campus and its environs.

•

Major downtown festivals include July Fourth fireworks display, Shrinerfest, the Wine and Jazz
Fest, and numerous runs and other events.

MAP IDENTIFYING ACTIVITY CENTERS

FRAMEWORK 33

Development Opportunities
Review of previously completed studies, public forums, and discussions with private real estate
entities and public planning departments identified numerous development opportunities that
align with the vision of this Plan. The federally mandated Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) efforts
that will be implemented by the Evansville Water and Sewer Department will not only improve
the City’s storm water management system, but also provide opportunities for attractive green
improvements to the southern and western gateways into downtown. The need to collect and
store storm water in the urban core will also provide opportunities to create urban parks and
complete streets. This plan suggests concentrating these efforts along Fourth Street, Vine, and
Walnut Streets to reinforce connections to the medical school site and the riverfront.
From a cultural perspective, the Plan embraces the desire to move the WWII vessel, the LST325,
to Tropicana’s former riverboat gaming facility dock. The Plan also promotes the efforts to connect
the urban core with Haynie’s Corner Arts District, the Jacobsville/North Main area (including some
of the region’s largest employers), West Franklin Street and the University of Evansville Area. To
improve livability for downtown residents, the Plan suggests the need to establish a permanent
home for a Farmer’s Market and perhaps the development of a “Food Destination” style market,
a convenience store and perhaps a gas station. Another focus that should be considered is
the development of the gateways into downtown under the Lloyd Expressway - especially the
linear property between the Third Street and Fifth Street transitions to First Avenue. Along with
enhancing the Coliseum, this development would provide an excellent anchor for the new
“Makers District” identified north of Court Street.

Public Space Improvements

TRANSFORMATIVE IDEAS

Four catalytic ideas emerged during the planning process. The application of these four ideas collectively create the downtown wide transformation of becoming 'an activated, innovative, connected neighborhood.’ These ideas are highlighted in the Community
Handbook for City Building, a Master Plan summary document designed to inform and encourage community involvement to bring the Plan
to life. The handbook also contains perspectives of Evansville residents who live, work and play in downtown.

TRANSFORMATIVE IDEAS 39

1:

A THRIVING
MAIN STREET

An active Main Street is the spine of a thriving downtown. Designating key blocks as an
'entertainment district' – initially from 2nd to 6th and ultimately extending from Riverside to Martin
Luther King once a critical mass of activity is established - will create a cluster of energy that will radiate
out to adjacent blocks on Main Street and throughout downtown to create a thriving city core. The
park at 4th and Main Street can be transformed into a thriving and active space that can serve as an
“anchor” for Main Street much in the same way Nordstrom or Macy’s is an anchor in a shopping mall
– creating a center of activity that positively influences the shops and spaces adjacent to it. The market
assessment indicates there is significant demand for more downtown housing and room for additional
restaurants, bars, shops, and attractions along Main Street (and throughout downtown in general). Key
elements of an energized Main Street include:
•
•
•

Activating ground floor retail space.
Designating an “entertainment district”
through incentives and regulatory relief for
new businesses, restaurants, and retail.
Reinforcing existing, and attracting more,
local businesses.

•
•
•

Adding outdoor café space.
Enhancing the pedestrian realm.
Activating 4th and Main Street Park
through a new design and year-round
programming and events.

AN ACTIVE
RIVERFRONT

A riverfront with activities that appeal to kids and seniors and everyone in between will create
one of the finest gathering places in the region. Calming traffic on Riverside Drive and making
it feel safer and easier to navigate on foot or bike will draw people naturally to the riverfront.
Ideas include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Extending existing park space with cantilevered shelves over existing piers along the river.
Enhancing park design including landscape, lighting, monuments and play equipment.
Adding new park features – swings, shade structures and furnishings.
Making it easier and safer to cross Riverside Drive to access the riverwalk and Greenway.
Slowing vehicular traffic to improve pedestrian and bicycle safety and enjoyment.
Separating pedestrian activity from vehicular traffic with landscaping and other treatments.
Creating a small destination area for dogs and pet caretakers.
Physical improvements such as landscaping, parking enhancements, streetscape or other
enhancements along Main Street, between 2nd and Riverside Drive to establish a stronger
connection between the downtown core and the Riverfront.
Creating visual connections from Main Street and other key locations to the river via design
elements and features such as fountains, lights, and signage.

NOCO MAKERS
DISTRICT

A place to live and work and create. ‘NoCo’ will be an eclectic mix of creative pursuits where
a variety of uses and building types are not only welcome, but encouraged. The district can
leverage Evansville’s rich history of manufacturing and production in a 21st century model.
Envisioned as a place that will attract both start-ups and established businesses, entrepreneurs of
all kinds, and cohorts ranging from millennials to Baby Boomers, the District (named for “North
of Court”) is a geographic area that is bound roughly by Fulton, the Lloyd Expressway, and Court.
Key NoCo elements can include:
•

A mix of uses – manufacturing, production,
art, fabrication, digitization.

•

A mix of building types – industrial,
residential, commercial, and mixed use.

•

Relaxed zoning – to attract and
encourage diverse uses, building styles,
and materiality.

•

Incentives to attract businesses,
residents, and development, including
expedited permitting, tax abatements,
and others as appropriate.

•

Unique branding, signage, wayfinding
and banners.

WHY IT'S
IMPORTANT

A vital Main Street is a crucial component
of a thriving downtown that attracts people,
activity, a skilled workforce, investment, and
residents to create a 24/7 neighborhood.
A vital Main Street will create energy that
expands throughout the downtown core.

A district dedicated to manufacturing,
producing, and creating technology, goods
and services will create a distinct asset in
Evansville attracting innovation and a creative
workforce.

Policies and incentives will attract new
investment to geographic areas, meet unmet
needs such as additional housing units, and
align with today’s market opportunities.

RELATIONSHIP
TO OTHER PLAN
ELEMENTS

A thriving Main Street is an important
element of a downtown neighborhood where
people want to live, gather, and socialize. An
appealing downtown core will attract more
housing development and more residents will
encourage investment in amenities – grocery,
dog park, and other services that create a
24/7 neighborhood.

A makers district, building on our historic
manufacturing roots, will capture the
fledgling innovative culture in Evansville,
allow a place for a variety of creative activities
and uses, and help brand Evansville as a
destination for skilled workers and business
creation.

Policies such as regulatory relief, financial
incentives, and tax abatement will be required
to implement plan recommendations
including NoCo and Main Street.

GOAL

From Riverfront to MLK, create incentives
and policies to support and encourage more
housing development, retail, restaurants,
nightlife, and neighborhood-serving goods
and amenities.

EXPERIENCE
4TH AND MAIN STREET PARK

RIVERFRONT ACTIVATION

DOWNTOWN FOR LIVING

WHY IT'S
IMPORTANT

There is currently no gathering space
downtown that is widely used for concerts,
programming, socializing, and lingering. The
4th and Main Park will be an amenity that will
attract more residents, shops, and investment
to the area. It is a critical location in the heart
of Evansville and can serve as an anchor for
new investment and overall revitalization.

The riverfront is a unique and appealing asset
that has potential to be a great space. Like
a thriving Main Street, a thriving riverfront
sets the stage for more investment and
development of all kinds to follow.

Residents – both young and old – will be
drawn downtown because of the riverfront,
Main Street, and nearby work and business
creation opportunities. Downtown housing
options will increase City population and
make Evansville more attractive to relocating
people and employers looking for workforce.

RELATIONSHIP
TO OTHER PLAN
ELEMENTS

Establishing a gathering space that serves
as “downtown’s living room” will create a
more appealing and enjoyable space that will
ultimately attract more people, investment,
and residents. Activated green space is a key
element of a successful downtown.

The riverfront has the potential to be a
world class gathering space unequalled
in the region. It enhances quality of life,
access to nature, and is a gathering place
for the community. When the riverfront and
downtown core are seamlessly connected,
Evansville will become more regionally
competitive.

When all of the Plan elements come
together, an activated, innovative, connected
neighborhood will emerge.

WHY IT'S
IMPORTANT

Getting around by bike and on foot is
an increasingly important quality of life
consideration. Millennials are much more
likely to move to and work in places that are
easy to access and move through without a
car. Pedestrian enhancements will improve
visitor experience.

The riverfront is a unique and appealing
asset that has potential to be a great space,
but getting there is difficult and not always
safe. Ensuring pedestrian and bicycle safety
through enhanced street crossings, lights,
and strategies to attract all ages to enjoy the
riverfront.

There is a great deal of hardscape in the
downtown core and not many opportunities
to enjoy public spaces. Encouraging people
to linger and enjoy a place is an important
aspect of creating a neighborhood.

RELATIONSHIP
TO OTHER PLAN
ELEMENTS

More appealing and accessible biking and
walking options appeal to Millennials and
Boomers alike and enhance downtown as a
livable destination in the region.

PLAN IMPLEMENTATION
Implementation will take dedicated leadership, staff and revenue. This final section looks at
how Downtown Evansville can align resources and efforts to bring this Plan to life. Forming
an organization specifically focused on improving downtown and a revenue stream to
support that organization are critical ingredients for the success of this Plan.

Evansville Downtown Alliance
A new organization called the Evansville Downtown Alliance (“EDA” or “Alliance”) is envisioned to be the self-sustaining, private sector champion
for implementing Plan recommendations and convening efforts to support, develop, and create downtown improvements. It is recommended the
Alliance incorporate as a 501(C)(6) and that it is initially hosted within the Southwest Indiana Chamber.
While there have been downtown-focused entities in Evansville in the past, today Evansville may be one of the largest cities in the U.S.
without a downtown-focused management organization. It is envisioned the Alliance will have a reliable source of revenue through an
Economic Improvement District (EID) – a finance mechanism that allows downtown property owners to assess themselves to pay for downtown
improvements. (The EID is described in more detail below.)
Throughout the country, downtown organizations have been very successful in advancing downtown advocacy and improvements.
Like those existing organizations, the Alliance can lead the charge in creating lasting change in Evansville, including:
•
•
•
•

Focusing on the management, marketing, activation, beautification and maintenance of downtown.
Attracting strategic development and investment.
Organizing and advocating to align the resources necessary to implement this Plan and others.
Being a unified voice and champion for all downtown stakeholders.

PLAN IMPLEMENTATION 64

"In Cleveland, I have
seen first-hand the
power of a private
sector program to
drive positive change
in a downtown. The
change was visible
in terms of improved
atmosphere, safety,
appearance...but
the greatest change
was attitudinal. The
power of this program
to drive positive
change in how the
community as a
whole viewed itself
was incredible."

The Alliance will be guided by a board of
downtown stakeholders representing a variety
of interests, an Executive Director, and support
staff. There will be ample opportunities for
the community to engage with the Alliance
on efforts through Plan Implementation
Committees. These committees will be
organized around creating an activated,
innovative, connected neighborhood. The
Alliance will lead downtown advocacy and be
positioned to align organizations, resources
and energy focused on implementing this Plan
and leveraging new investments, projects, and
resources. The Alliance will drive Evansville
as a regionally competitive destination for
investment and development.

- Bob Jones, President & CEO
Old National Bancorp

PLAN IMPLEMENTATION 65

Evansville Downtown Alliance Staff
The Alliance is envisioned to have 2 to 3 staff members, including an Executive Director and staff
to focus on areas to include marketing, communications, events, and daily management of the
district. In addition, contract employee(s) may be appropriate to fulfill specific tasks and skill sets.

Alliance Operating Board
The board of the Alliance will consist of downtown stakeholders representing business and
property owners, civic leaders, the Southwest Indiana Chamber, Downtown Neighborhood
Association, city leadership and others as appropriate. It is envisioned to have 15 to 17 board
members. The Alliance Operating Board will provide policy direction and oversight for the
Alliance, including interaction with the EID and other stakeholders. It is envisioned the Operating
Board will meet regularly, on a monthly or bi-monthly basis.

Plan Implementation Committees
The community will be able to be involved through the Plan Implementation Committees.
Downtown stakeholders interested in implementing the ideas outlined in this plan and rolling up
their sleeves will be a critical part of the effort to bring this Plan to fruition. The committees will be
organized around the Four Transformative projects:
•
•
•
•

Activating Main Street
Activating the Riverfront
Developing the NoCo Makers District
Public Space Improvements

It is envisioned Plan Implementation Committees will meet on an ad-hoc basis in order to
advance the transformative projects and specific projects related to the Transformative Ideas.
The Alliance can also serve as a clearing house for volunteer activities including events, festivals,
special projects or more which will take place in the downtown by providing resources, security,
permitting, insurance, and other needs for these activities.

PLAN IMPLEMENTATION 66

Economic Improvement District (EID)
Primary funding for the Alliance will come from an Economic Improvement District (EID).
EIDs are mechanisms whereby property owners within a specific geographic area agree to
assess themselves in order to pay for enhancements to that same area.
An EID is the critical component in implementing this Plan – it will provide the funding
to bring the Plan recommendations to life, including Alliance staffing, Plan activation,
programming and oversight to make the Plan and its recommendations successful. The
EID will facilitate a reliable, multi-year funding stream that will allow the Alliance to be
singularly focused on creating a vibrant, economically healthy and activated downtown.
EID funds can pay for a wide variety of improvements and activities downtown, including:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Special events and programming.
Maintenance of downtown improvements and green spaces.
Downtown advocacy.
Economic development.
Attracting new investment and development.
Small business support and recruitment.
Marketing and image.
Street beautification.
Capital Improvements.

The revenue generated by the EID can leverage other sources of funding, resources and
partnerships. EID Revenues can match grant funding, accelerate public projects and
investments, and attract private investment. Investors are often attracted to downtowns
that have EIDs as they generally represent a cooperative, forward-looking spirit and vision
among diverse stakeholders and property owners.
There are more than 1,000 EIDs in North America. Regional EIDs include downtown
districts in Fort Wayne, Louisville, and Cincinnati. In order to form an EID in Indiana,
formation steps include gathering petitions representing more than 50% of property
owners who collectively own more than 50% of property value in the designated district
boundaries. Upon the successful conclusion of the petition drive, City Council then holds a
hearing and passes an ordinance creating the EID.
PLAN IMPLEMENTATION 67

EID Board
•

The EID board will consist of 5 to 7 property owners who are ratepayers within the EID. It
will provide direction with regard to EID assessment allocation and budgeting, and general
representation of EID ratepayers. It is recommended the board is made up of a diverse crosssection of ratepayers including large and small property owners representing geographic
diversity within the district. The EID will be a budget and policy oversight board, as opposed
to an operating board, and therefore it is recommended the EID board meet relatively
infrequently, either quarterly or biannually.

•

It is envisioned that one or two members of the EID board also sit on the Alliance Operating
board to ensure smooth communication, transparency and accountability to EID ratepayers.

Southwest Indiana Chamber
To maximize the effectiveness of the Alliance it is recommended that it be hosted in the Southwest
Indiana Chamber. The Chamber would allow the Alliance to focus on Plan implementation
immediately upon its formation and avoid logistical and administrative complexities usually
undertaken by fledgling non-profit organizations. The Chamber would offer a nascent downtown
group a built-in structure by offering:
•

Financial resources during the Alliance start-up (Once established, it is expected the EID
property taxes to flow to the district in spring of 2018).

•

Close working relationships with like-minded organizations including the Chamber, the
Economic Development Coalition, the Growth Alliance for Greater Evansville, and the Indiana
Small Business Development Center.

•

The Chamber could provide logistical support for payroll, benefits, taxes, and other
bookkeeping services – lessening the need for duplicative administrative resources.

•

The Chamber’s Public Policy Director can provide ongoing advocacy support at a local, state
and federal level.

Ensuring clear separation between the Alliance and the Chamber so that the Alliance is held to a
high degree of accountability and transparency will be critical to minimize any real or perceived
conflicts between the two organizations and their missions.

"At the heart of every
vibrant city is a
thriving urban core
offering a diverse mix of
commercial, residential
and cultural activities.
That is why it's essential
for our community to
make every effort to
revitalize our downtown.
The Evansville
Downtown Master Plan
Update will help guide
future development over
the next five-to seven
years and ensure we
are on a right path for
positive progress and
long-term success."
- Lloyd Winnecke, Mayor
City of Evansville

PLAN IMPLEMENTATION 68

Moving Forward / Next Steps
The notion of forming an EID has been discussed during the planning process and has been
greeted with some enthusiasm. In order to move the effort forward, a formal EID initiative
should be undertaken. The initiative should be guided by private sector property owners in the
downtown core who want to see progress, investment and vitality. A significant aspect of that
initiative should include a concerted outreach and communication effort to engage as many
downtown stakeholders as possible to gauge willingness to pursue an EID.

PLAN IMPLEMENTATION 69

Long Term Aspirations
As this plan unfolds and progress is made toward implementing its recommendations, new,
longer-term opportunities will arise and be embraced by the community. Several longer term
aspirations have been brought up during this planning effort. While some are ten or more years
off, others might become realistic more quickly. Some of those aspirational goals include:
•
•
•
•
•
•

•
•
•

Enhancing the spaces adjacent to Mulzer Crushed Stone on Fulton with landscape
improvements and play enhancements to embrace its utilitarian function while encouraging
community awareness and interaction.
Attract boat cabs from Owensboro, Newburgh, Henderson and Mt. Vernon.
Build a protected cycle track from Main Street to Haynie's Corner area.
Create a parkour course and skate park along the river.
Encouraging mixed use development as an integral part of parking structures; automate
garages.
Develop sports facilities in the 'North Forty' Civic Center Parking Lot which could include:
- A Natatorium combined with a public pool and water play facility.
- A Velodrome for regional and national biking competitions.
- An indoor/outdoor soccer field for minor league soccer and for final games in
tournament play already happening in the market.
- A Dog Park and outdoor dog agility training course.
- Ballpark.
- Outdoor volleyball courts, pickleball courts, tennis facilities.
Temporary use of INDOT owned parcels along Lloyd Expressway for orchards, urban farming
or community gardens.
Developing an 'Adult Playground' near the Medical Campus, with outdoor ping-pong,
shuffleboard, bocce, and other stress-relieving activities including a beer garden.
Attract commercial development at the Sunset Park tennis courts for a collection of landmark
restaurants, condominiums and apartments.

provide space for events in conjunction with Ford Center uses.
Investigate floating development along Pigeon Creek, and connection to downtown.
Further discussions for 'wharf' development in gravel yard, containing residential, retail,
restaurants and entertainment opportunities.
Upscale outlet store recruitment to take advantage of the community's status as a regional
shopping destination.
Establish a 'satellite' branch of the Indiana State Museum.

PLAN IMPLEMENTATION 71

Looking Backwards, for a Plan for Tomorrow
In 1927, the Harland Bartholomew Plan also had this to say about moving forward:
“The advantages of Evansville’s position are obvious. It remains now to be seen whether the city
itself has been made fit for the responsibilities which attend the exploitation of these resources.
Despite the stimulus of first-class transportation, unlimited fuel and food supplies and an
abundance of raw materials for manufacturing, the growth of Evansville will be slow and uncertain
so long as living and working conditions in the city are unsatisfactory. Such handicaps to future
growth will not disappear unless greater interest is taken by the public in the very real and serious
problems attending the upbuilding of a large city.”
Ninety years later, the city again is at a time of upbuilding. The Plan has demonstrated the need
to change our approach to Downtown Evansville, the need to build an activated, innovated
connected neighborhood as a tool to retain and attract the talent needed to ‘upbuild’ the City
of Evansville, the whole Southwest Indiana region. The Plan is a bit different from our previous
ones: this Plan is based upon a series of actions, efforts, collaborations and strategic goals aligned
to develop population growth to which the market will respond with appropriate projects and
buildings. In a nutshell, the Plan says ‘let’s put people first.’ Evidence of the success of ‘people
first’ development is currently at work in Downtown Evansville with local developers responding
to the community’s desire for urban living with over 130 units of housing under construction in
Downtown Evansville.

The day after a master plan is released, the market will continue with properties being bought
and sold and businesses and families moving in and out of the target area. It is unlikely that
the images presented in this Plan will come to fruition as they are depicted. The people of the
City, officials, CEO’s, residents and workers, can start the wheel turning for community-oriented
downtown which will yield development similar to, or superior to the images presented here. Here
are some ways to bring this Plan to life:
•
•
•
•
•

Support Downtown Evansville by shopping and dining here; enjoy our sidewalks and paths.
Advocate with your City Council, your Mayor and your civic officials in support of
implementation of the Plan.
Support the formation of the EID if you own, rent or manage property in Downtown
Evansville.
Get involved in a Plan Implementation Committee.
Buy or rent a home in Downtown Evansville; or move your business here.

Thank you, in advance, for the part you will play in advancing this Plan.

Plan Description and Purpose

Downtown Specific Issues

This plan analyzes bicycling and walking in Evansville and makes recommendations
for future infrastructure and programming improvements to expand multimodal
transportation options throughout the City. Goals for future bike/pedestrian
infrastructure include economic development, attracting tourism activity, and increasing
transportation equity via the Create-A-Commuter program that equips low-income
residents with bicycles. The Plan calls for a number of bike/pedestrian improvements
at key locations throughout Evansville, including: more and better bike amenities and
programming; better connectivity between bicycling, walking, transit, and other modes; a
comprehensive Complete Streets policy, additional safe routes to school, traffic calming,
streetscape enhancements, wayfinding, and increased safety. Ensuring equitable access
to bike/pedestrian amenities is central to the plan.

This plan calls out Downtown as being particularly bike
and pedestrian friendly. A major challenge is the lack of
bike-and-pedestrian-friendly infrastructure moving outside
of Downtown, which discourages biking and walking
into Downtown from elsewhere in the city. Downtown
would benefit from additional bike amenities including
additional bicycle lanes, cycle tracks, and bike parking. Poor
connectivity across Lloyd Expressway creates a barrier for
bikers and pedestrians.

This report analyzes blight and vacancy in Evansville. The plan links blight to massive
population decline in the urban core, loss of manufacturing jobs, urban sprawl, absentee
landlords, and unqualified home buying. Solutions to combat blight include: a better tax
sale process to quickly sell abandoned properties; land banking as a way to redevelop
blighted properties; reducing crime; using code enforcement to prevent future blight; and
increasing the quality of neighborhoods and sense of security for homeowners.

This report calls out Downtown as an area of concentrated
blight. Recommended solutions specific to Downtown
include land banking as means to redevelopment and adding
new and affordable housing options to serve existing lowincome residents and future residents.

This report is a guide to branding the City of Evansville as a destination by calling
attention to the city’s unique characteristics, defining its identity, and promoting
Evansville to visitors and potential residents. The Evansville “brand” promises “a
fruitful, enabling and diverse environment to grow an idea, a business, and a family.”
The brand will be distributed via digital media, traditional advertising, public relations
campaigns, and corporate communications.

This report calls out Downtown as lacking identity and
vibrancy. Downtown has suffered from urban sprawl,
the “donut” effect, and young people leaving the region.
Successful branding will further Downtown revitalization by
retaining and attracting residents and employers.

DRAFT Final Report

As part of Indiana’s statewide Regional Cities Initiative, this plan makes recommendations
aimed at retaining and growing the population of southwest Indiana, specifically retaining
and attracting skilled young talent to power the workforce and drive the economy.
The plan takes a regional approach to economic development by proposing a number
of projects that will strengthen both the core of the region (Downtown Evansville) and
the wider region. Proposed projects include: updating the Evansville Regional Airport;
revitalizing and investing in Downtown Evansville; investing in public infrastructure to
support international USGA and PGA events; local food and arts projects; regional bike
and pedestrian trails; developing clusters of medical and wellness services; new gaming
and casino amenities; and supporting emerging and innovative industries.

The plan proposes Downtown projects that will strengthen
the region, with a goal of adding 2,500 residents and
transforming Downtown into a 24/7 urban event center by
2025. Recommended projects include: an IU Medical School
& Research Facility; an Urban Living Research Facility via
partnerships with Haier and Vectren; a Downtown YMCA
Housing & Fitness Campus; new housing; a regional trails
system; and a new Evansville Signature School Science
Center.

The Comprehensive Plan targets growth in Evansville and Vanderburgh County by
encouraging and supporting employment opportunities and livability. The plan
proposes infrastructure and program solutions to attract and retain a young skilled
workforce and foster continued job opportunities in the region. Recommendations
include: implementing high speed internet; adding full service office and industrial sites;
modernizing outdated industrial sites and infrastructure to meet the needs of smaller
tenants and new manufacturing types; adding education and training programs to
create a more qualified workforce; increasing the number of jobs paying a living wage;
encouraging new business start-ups at facilities like Innovation Pointe and in vacant or
underutilized industrial facilities; providing technical assistance, counseling and financing
assistance to small businesses; and developing diverse and affordable housing.

The plan calls out Downtown as a major employment center
for the region, but not a shopping, entertainment, and
residential hub. Reestablishing Downtown as the urban core
with distinctive shopping, entertainment, residential, social,
cultural, and service experiences will be key. Strategies for
accomplishing Downtown revitalization include developing
amenities like a grocery store, green space, and public
spaces. Key Downtown redevelopment strategies include:
prioritizing adaptive reuse and infill; developing new
multifamily housing; attracting residents and visitors from
surrounding neighborhoods by improving multimodal
linkages and reducing crime rates; and supporting physical
enhancement programs.

This report summarizes findings and recommendations from the Evansville Transit
Comprehensive Operations Analysis (COA) for improving METS bus service throughout
Evansville. Planned changes include: longer operating hours; more frequent service,
particularly on Saturday night and Sunday; new and consolidated routes; improved buses
and facilities; and more frequent service to large employers and major attractions. Current
Metropolitan Evansville challenges include: aging infrastructure and buses; lack of connectivity to bus stops and
Transit System (METS) stations; and safety issues on buses and near stations. The report includes long-term
funding and ridership projections and policies to guide future improvements.

This report calls for improved transit access to Downtown,
particularly from USI campus, Warrick County, and
Lawndale. Upgrades to the Downtown Transfer Center are
planned for 2016/2017. Downtown Trolley service upgrades
will include route realignment. User-friendly upgrades
will include live tracking of buses via smartphone apps,
using Twitter for delays and rider updates, and signage
improvements.

Greater Evansville: The Place
for Young Professionals

This analysis evaluates local market demand for a Downtown convention hotel.
The study found that the optimal hotel would be of high quality with full-service
amenities and offer between 240 and 270 rooms. The analysis found that Evansville
was not competitive as a convention host in 2012 compared to larger nearby cities.
The analysis identified local demand for corporate training events and meetings,
tradeshows, and other events from within the region. Critical factors for success
include a top hotel brand, adjacency to the convention center, and full-service
amenities.

The convention hotel would serve the Ford Arena and
the Old National Events Plaza, bringing corporate
events, tradeshows, and other meetings and events to
Downtown Evansville.

This survey and study was conducted to investigate consumer awareness,
perceptions, and visitation patterns in Evansville. The survey found four primary
visitor groups: family and friends visitors; family getaway visitors; casino visitors;
and amenities visitors. Visitors are generally a drive market from surrounding
metro areas. Evansville tends to exceed visitor expectations and generates return
visits. The City is considered to be accessible with small town charm and big city
amenities.

Top visitor activities include dining, shopping, recreating
along the Riverfront, and visiting the casino, all of which
are most likely done in Downtown.

This plan analyzes “brain drain” in the greater Evansville region and recommends
strengthening Downtown as the top strategy for attracting and retaining a young,
skilled talent pool. Specifically, the plan recommends reinvesting in Downtown
to create a vibrant core that will appeal to the young, diverse workforce that has
been leaving the area.

Downtown is called out as the heart, soul, and core
of Evansville. The report identifies the Riverwalk and
corridor from Main Street to the Ford Center as the
epicenter of Downtown revitalization. Downtown
redevelopment and infill activities should build upon the
success of these two public spaces, encouraging retail
amenities to fill in the gaps. Specific recommendations
include: developing a can’t-miss experience for visitors;
prioritizing housing affordability to meet the needs of
young professionals; and identifying strong advocates
to take ownership of Downtown revitalization.

The planning effort was aimed at providing the City of Evansville a streetscape
enhancement program. Specifically intended to encourage residents,
shoppers, and visitors to utilize downtown for business and entertainment. The
development plan prioritized incorporation of improvements such as cohesive
streetscape hardscapes, furnishings, lighting, plazas, landscaping and street
trees, fountains and public art. The development plan recommended pedestrian
linkages to activity centers than enhance the brand of the entire downtown area.

The deliberative reinforces the necessity of building
a green public amenity infrastructure that forms the
framework for private investment and creates the
neighborhood culture desired by residents searching for
urban living experiences.

This plan lays out a strategy to increase local food production, distribution and
access in the southwest Indiana region. The goal is to establish retail space for the
food hub that offers food sales and related activities like restaurants, bars, or art
galleries as well as a public gathering space outdoors.

Downtown is called out as an ideal location for a
regional food hub due to its central location, walkability,
bikeability, proximity to transit, and general accessibility
to everyone in the region.
