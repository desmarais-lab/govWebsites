Narratives
Areas of Greatest Need:
The City of Evansville analyzed four data sets provided by HUD: risk of foreclosure, subprime loans, foreclosure rates and vacancy rates, by
utilizing Geographic Information Systems (GIS) computer mapping software. The eligible census block groups were mapped with each of the
data sets. The boundaries of existing focus areas (CDBG Focus Area and Front Door Pride area) were then compared to the block group
data, to determine the geographic areas of greatest need within the City. In general, this methodology concluded that the areas of greatest
need are the same as the City&rsquos already defined focus areas, which includes census tracts 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, 220, 21,25 and
26. The focus areas are identified in the City of Evansville&rsquos 2005 &ndash 2009 Consolidated Plan, which details the resources and
activities funded with Community Development Block Grants, Emergency Shelter Grants and HOME Investment Partnership funds. It was
noted during this analysis that some census tracts appear to have fewer foreclosures, lower risk of foreclosures and fewer subprime
mortgages due to the high number of rental units. In addition, a large percentage of the homes in these &ldquohigh risk&rdquo census tracts
have elderly homeowners with no mortgages, thus foreclosures and subprime mortgage data may be skewed. This was determined previously
by reviewing property tax exemption data (i.e. Over 65 and homestead exemptions). Also, through local Code Enforcement data, evidence of
greater vacancy rates exists in these census tracts. Therefore in reality, the neighborhood housing status is in greater decline than the tables
reflect. The information above and past analysis of the housing needs within the city of Evansville indicate that the areas of greatest need for
NSP will continue within the predetermined focus areas. Although some of the activities may fall in other eligible census tract block groups.

Distribution and and Uses of Funds:
The City of Evansville will address NSP requirements for the distribution and uses of the $3.6 million allocated to the City through a
combination of financing mechanisms for home buyers, acquisition of foreclosed homes, demolition of blighted structures and rehabilitation
and new construction programs within the target areas. Financing mechanisms will utilize $400,000 of NSP funds to aid homebuyers between
80 and 120% AMI by providing funds to &ldquobuy down&rdquo mortgages for previously foreclosed on and subsequently reduce the need for
these borrowers to resort to subprime mortgages for financing homes. The Department of Metropolitan Development already partners with
Community Action Program of Evansville (CAPE) and HOPE of Evansville to provide down payment assistance. NSP funds will be used to
supplement the $5,000 maximum down payment currently available to cover the gap between development costs and actual appraised
values. This program will not only eliminate subprime mortgages but will also address the foreclosure risk and rates by aiding new
homebuyers with lower mortgage payments. Five hundred thousand dollars has been earmarked for demolition of blighted structures in the
Evansville NSP expenditure plan. Funds will be used by City Code Enforcement to remove slum and blight throughout the numerous eligible
census tract block groups. High vacancy rates and the elevated number of abandoned homes are contributing factors to the decline of
neighborhoods, further exacerbating the decline of property values. Prior program evaluations reveal poor construction of homes, older
declining housing stock, sub-standard/non-existent maintenance, etc. in the eligible block groups. The elimination of blighted housing will
increase the overall value of the housing stock and increase property values in the eligible neighborhoods and decrease the likelihood of
abandonment. It is estimated that 75 &ndash 100 blighted homes will be demolished with NSP funds. Acquisition of foreclosed properties will
be conducted by the Evansville Redevelopment Commission (ERC) and Evansville Brownfields Corp. (EBC). This component will utilize
$400,000 of NSP funds. Property foreclosures are completed after sheriff sales and typically it is the mortgage holder who buys the foreclosed
property at the sheriff sales. Therefore, both the ERC and EBC will use GIS software to map the location of all properties listed for sheriff
sales. Those properties within the eligible block groups will be evaluated for potential acquisition from the likely buyer (mortgage holder).
Lenders will be contacted regarding their foreclosed properties within the target areas, these properties will be earmarked for potential
acquisition. The bulk of the City NSP funding, $1.9 million, will be for rehabilitation of existing homes and new home construction to improve
the overall appeal of the targeted areas and increase marketable housing stock. The result will be increased mixed income neighborhoods,
higher housing values, stable homeownership via competitive fixed rate mortgages and reasonable terms, etc. These actions will dilute the

current inventory. A minimum of $901,301 of these funds will be utilized to provide rental and homeownership opportunities to families at or
below 50% AMI. The rehabilitation and new construction willbe managed both in-

Definitions and Descriptions:
we had to move $1235.50 for a late claim on Activity 9 under Project Reconstruction. We should be ready for NSP close out very soon. I
decreased the admin budget by $1235.50 and increased the Reconstruction Budget by $1235.50. Thanks.

Areas of Greatest Need:
The City of Evansville analyzed four data sets provided by HUD: risk of foreclosure, subprime loans, foreclosure rates and vacancy rates, by
utilizing Geographic Information Systems (GIS) computer mapping software. The eligible census block groups were mapped with each of the
data sets. The boundaries of existing focus areas (CDBG Focus Area and Front Door Pride area) were then compared to the block group

Overall Progress Narrative:
We continue to move towards closure of the last properties for sale that were NSP funded. The slow housing market
and difficulty in obtaining mortgages by low/mod income persons has hampered the effort, but we are confident that
within the near term the agencies will have beneficiaries in the two remaining homes.

Narratives
Areas of Greatest Need:
The City of Evansville analyzed four data sets provided by HUD: risk of foreclosure, subprime loans, foreclosure rates and vacancy rates, by
utilizing Geographic Information Systems (GIS) computer mapping software. The eligible census block groups were mapped with each of the
data sets. The boundaries of existing focus areas (CDBG Focus Area and Front Door Pride area) were then compared to the block group
data, to determine the geographic areas of greatest need within the City. In general, this methodology concluded that the areas of greatest
need are the same as the City’s already defined focus areas, which includes census tracts 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, 220, 21,25 and 26. The
focus areas are identified in the City of Evansville’s 2005 – 2009 Consolidated Plan, which details the resources and activities funded with
Community Development Block Grants, Emergency Shelter Grants and HOME Investment Partnership funds. It was noted during this analysis
that some census tracts appear to have fewer foreclosures, lower risk of foreclosures and fewer subprime mortgages due to the high number
of rental units. In addition, a large percentage of the homes in these “high risk” census tracts have elderly homeowners with no mortgages,
thus foreclosures and subprime mortgage data may be skewed. This was determined previously by reviewing property tax exemption data (i.e.
Over 65 and homestead exemptions). Also, through local Code Enforcement data, evidence of greater vacancy rates exists in these census
tracts. Therefore in reality, the neighborhood housing status is in greater decline than the tables reflect. The information above and past
analysis of the housing needs within the city of Evansville indicate that the areas of greatest need for NSP will continue within the
predetermined focus areas. Although some of the activities may fall in other eligible census tract block groups.

Distribution and and Uses of Funds:
The City of Evansville will address NSP requirements for the distribution and uses of the $3.6 million allocated to the City through a
combination of financing mechanisms for home buyers, acquisition of foreclosed homes, demolition of blighted structures and rehabilitation
and new construction programs within the target areas. Financing mechanisms will utilize $400,000 of NSP funds to aid homebuyers between
80 and 120% AMI by providing funds to “buy down” mortgages for previously foreclosed on and subsequently reduce the need for these
borrowers to resort to subprime mortgages for financing homes. The Department of Metropolitan Development already partners with
Community Action Program of Evansville (CAPE) and HOPE of Evansville to provide down payment assistance. NSP funds will be used to
supplement the $5,000 maximum down payment currently available to cover the gap between development costs and actual appraised
values. This program will not only eliminate subprime mortgages but will also address the foreclosure risk and rates by aiding new
homebuyers with lower mortgage payments. Five hundred thousand dollars has been earmarked for demolition of blighted structures in the
Evansville NSP expenditure plan. Funds will be used by City Code Enforcement to remove slum and blight throughout the numerous eligible
census tract block groups. High vacancy rates and the elevated number of abandoned homes are contributing factors to the decline of
neighborhoods, further exacerbating the decline of property values. Prior program evaluations reveal poor construction of homes, older
declining housing stock, sub-standard/non-existent maintenance, etc. in the eligible block groups. The elimination of blighted housing will
increase the overall value of the housing stock and increase property values in the eligible neighborhoods and decrease the likelihood of
abandonment. It is estimated that 75 – 100 blighted homes will be demolished with NSP funds. Acquisition of foreclosed properties will be
conducted by the Evansville Redevelopment Commission (ERC) and Evansville Brownfields Corp. (EBC). This component will utilize
$400,000 of NSP funds. Property foreclosures are completed after sheriff sales and typically it is the mortgage holder who buys the foreclosed
property at the sheriff sales. Therefore, both the ERC and EBC will use GIS software to map the location of all properties listed for sheriff
sales. Those properties within the eligible block groups will be evaluated for potential acquisition from the likely buyer (mortgage holder).
Lenders will be contacted regarding their foreclosed properties within the target areas, these properties will be earmarked for

potential acquisition. The bulk of the City NSP funding, $1.9 million, will be for rehabilitation of existing homes and new home construction to
improve the overall appeal of the targeted areas and increase marketable housing stock. The result will be increased mixed income
neighborhoods, higher housing values, stable homeownership via competitive fixed rate mortgages and reasonable terms, etc. These actions
will dilute the foreclosure rate, minimize subprime mortgages and decrease the foreclosure risk, while actively removing foreclosed properties
from the current inventory. A minimum of $901,301 of these funds will be utilized to provide rental and homeownership opportunities to
families at or below 50% AMI. The rehabilitation and new construction willbe managed both in-

Narratives
Areas of Greatest Need:
The City of Evansville analyzed four data sets provided by HUD: risk of foreclosure, subprime loans, foreclosure rates and vacancy rates, by
utilizing Geographic Information Systems (GIS) computer mapping software. The eligible census block groups were mapped with each of the
data sets. The boundaries of existing focus areas (CDBG Focus Area and Front Door Pride area) were then compared to the block group
data, to determine the geographic areas of greatest need within the City. In general, this methodology concluded that the areas of greatest
need are the same as the City&rsquos already defined focus areas, which includes census tracts 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, 220, 21,25 and
26. The focus areas are identified in the City of Evansville&rsquos 2005 &ndash 2009 Consolidated Plan, which details the resources and
activities funded with Community Development Block Grants, Emergency Shelter Grants and HOME Investment Partnership funds. It was
noted during this analysis that some census tracts appear to have fewer foreclosures, lower risk of foreclosures and fewer subprime
mortgages due to the high number of rental units. In addition, a large percentage of the homes in these &ldquohigh risk&rdquo census tracts
have elderly homeowners with no mortgages, thus foreclosures and subprime mortgage data may be skewed. This was determined previously
by reviewing property tax exemption data (i.e. Over 65 and homestead exemptions). Also, through local Code Enforcement data, evidence of
greater vacancy rates exists in these census tracts. Therefore in reality, the neighborhood housing status is in greater decline than the tables
reflect. The information above and past analysis of the housing needs within the city of Evansville indicate that the areas of greatest need for
NSP will continue within the predetermined focus areas. Although some of the activities may fall in other eligible census tract block groups.

Distribution and and Uses of Funds:
The City of Evansville will address NSP requirements for the distribution and uses of the $3.6 million allocated to the City through a
combination of financing mechanisms for home buyers, acquisition of foreclosed homes, demolition of blighted structures and rehabilitation
and new construction programs within the target areas. Financing mechanisms will utilize $400,000 of NSP funds to aid homebuyers between
80 and 120% AMI by providing funds to &ldquobuy down&rdquo mortgages for previously foreclosed on and subsequently reduce the need for
these borrowers to resort to subprime mortgages for financing homes. The Department of Metropolitan Development already partners with
Community Action Program of Evansville (CAPE) and HOPE of Evansville to provide down payment assistance. NSP funds will be used to
supplement the $5,000 maximum down payment currently available to cover the gap between development costs and actual appraised
values. This program will not only eliminate subprime mortgages but will also address the foreclosure risk and rates by aiding new
homebuyers with lower mortgage payments. Five hundred thousand dollars has been earmarked for demolition of blighted structures in the
Evansville NSP expenditure plan. Funds will be used by City Code Enforcement to remove slum and blight throughout the numerous eligible
census tract block groups. High vacancy rates and the elevated number of abandoned homes are contributing factors to the decline of
neighborhoods, further exacerbating the decline of property values. Prior program evaluations reveal poor construction of homes, older
declining housing stock, sub-standard/non-existent maintenance, etc. in the eligible block groups. The elimination of blighted housing will
increase the overall value of the housing stock and increase property values in the eligible neighborhoods and decrease the likelihood of
abandonment. It is estimated that 75 &ndash 100 blighted homes will be demolished with NSP funds. Acquisition of foreclosed properties will
be conducted by the Evansville Redevelopment Commission (ERC) and Evansville Brownfields Corp. (EBC). This component will utilize
$400,000 of NSP funds. Property foreclosures are completed after sheriff sales and typically it is the mortgage holder who buys the foreclosed
property at the sheriff sales. Therefore, both the ERC and EBC will use GIS software to map the location of all properties listed for sheriff
sales. Those properties within the eligible block groups will be evaluated for potential acquisition from the likely buyer (mortgage holder).
Lenders will be contacted regarding their foreclosed properties within the target areas, these properties will be earmarked for potential
acquisition. The bulk of the City NSP funding, $1.9 million, will be for rehabilitation of existing homes and new home construction to improve
the overall appeal of the targeted areas and increase marketable housing stock. The result will be increased mixed income neighborhoods,
higher housing values, stable homeownership via competitive fixed rate mortgages and reasonable terms, etc. These actions will dilute the
foreclosure rate, minimize subprime mortgages and decrease the foreclosure risk, while actively removing foreclosed properties from the
current inventory. A minimum of $901,301 of these funds will be utilized to provide rental and homeownership opportunities to families at or
2

below 50% AMI. The rehabilitation and new construction willbe managed both in-house by DMD staff, as well as with partner entities such as
the Affordable Housing Task Force (for low income and special populations) and market rate housing by private entities and non-profit
agencies.

separating the activities into landbanking acquisition and disposition. Voucher corrections will be made during the next quarter
to move acquisition costs that were drawn under disposition to the correct activity number. During the report period, we
continued the maintenance of 22 landbanked properties through mowing, trash removal, etc.

Plan Description:
The City of Evansville analyzed four data sets provided by HUD: risk of foreclosure, subprime loans, foreclosure
rates and vacancy rates, by utilizing Geographic Information Systems (GIS) computer mapping software. The
eligible census block groups were mapped with each of the data sets. The boundaries of existing focus areas
(CDBG Focus Area and Front Door Pride area) were then compared to the block group data, to determine the
geographic areas of greatest need within the City. In general, this methodology concluded that the areas of greatest
need are the same as the Citys already defined focus areas, which includes census tracts 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19,
220, 21,25 and 26. The focus areas are identified in the City of Evansvilles 2005 2009 Consolidated Plan, which
details the resources and activities funded with Community Development Block Grants, Emergency Shelter Grants
and HOME Investment Partnership funds. It was noted during this analysis that some census tracts appear to have
fewer foreclosures, lower risk of foreclosures and fewer subprime mortgages due to the high number of rental units.
In addition, a large percentage of the homes in these high risk census tracts have elderly homeowners with no
mortgages, thus foreclosures and subprime mortgage data may be skewed. This was determined previously by
reviewing property tax exemption data (i.e. Over 65 and homestead exemptions). Also, through local Code
Enforcement data, evidence of greater vacancy rates exists in these census tracts. Therefore in reality, the
neighborhood housing status is in greater decline than the tables reflect. The information above and past analysis of
the housing needs within the city of Evansville indicate that the areas of greatest need for NSP will continue within
the predetermined focus areas. Although some of the activities may fall in other eligible census tract block groups.

Recovery Needs:
The City of Evansville will address NSP requirements for the distribution and uses of the $3.6 million allocated to the
City through a combination of financing mechanisms for home buyers, acquisition of foreclosed homes, demolition of
blighted structures and rehabilitation and new construction programs within the target areas.
Financing mechanisms will utilize $400,000 of NSP funds to aid homebuyers between 80 and 120% AMI by
providing funds to buy down mortgages for previously foreclosed on and subsequently reduce the need for these
borrowers to resort to subprime mortgages for financing homes. The Department of Metropolitan Development
already partners with Community Action Program of Evansville (CAPE) and HOPE of Evansville to provide down
payment assistance. NSP funds will be used to supplement the $5,000 maximum down payment currently available
to cover the gap between development costs and actual appraised values. This program will not only eliminate
subprime mortgages but will also address the foreclosure risk and rates by aiding new homebuyers with lower
mortgage payments.
Five hundred thousand dollars has been earmarked for demolition of blighted structures in the Evansville NSP
expenditure plan. Funds will be used by City Code Enforcement to remove slum and blight throughout the
numerous eligible census tract block groups. High vacancy rates and the elevated number of abandoned homes
are contributing factors to the decline of neighborhoods, further exacerbating the decline of property values. Prior

program evaluations reveal poor construction of homes, older declining housing stock, sub-standard/non-existent
maintenance, etc. in the eligible block groups. The elimination of blighted housing will increase the overall value of
the housing stock and increase property values in the eligible neighborhoods and decrease the likelihood of
abandonment. It is estimated that 75 100 blighted homes will be demolished with NSP funds.
Acquisition of foreclosed properties will be conducted by the Evansville Redevelopment Commission (ERC) and
Evansville Brownfields Corp. (EBC). This component will utilize $400,000 of NSP funds. Property foreclosures are
completed after sheriff sales and typically it is the mortgage holder who buys the foreclosed property at the sheriff
sales. Therefore, both the ERC and EBC will use GIS software to map the location of all properties listed for sheriff
sales. Those properties within the eligible block groups will be evaluated for potential acquisition from the likely
buyer (mortgage holder). Lenders will be contacted regarding their foreclosed properties within the target areas,
these properties will be earmarked for potential acquisition.
The bulk of the City NSP funding, $1.9 million, will be for rehabilitation of existing homes and new home construction
to improve the overall appeal of the targeted areas and increase marketable housing stock. The result will be
increased mixed income neighborhoods, higher housing values, stable homeownership via competitive fixed rate
mortgages and reasonable terms, etc. These actions will dilute the foreclosure rate, minimize subprime mortgages
and decrease the foreclosure risk, while actively removing foreclosed properties from the current inventory. A
minimum of $901,301 of these funds will be utilized to provide rental and homeownership opportunities to families at
or below 50% AMI.
The rehabilitation and new construction will be managed both in-house by DMD staff, as well as with partner entities
such as the Affordable Housing Task Force (for low income and special populations) and market rate housing by
private entities and non-profit agencies.

Plan Description:
The City of Evansville analyzed four data sets provided by HUD: risk of foreclosure, subprime loans, foreclosure
rates and vacancy rates, by utilizing Geographic Information Systems (GIS) computer mapping software. The
eligible census block groups were mapped with each of the data sets. The boundaries of existing focus areas
(CDBG Focus Area and Front Door Pride area) were then compared to the block group data, to determine the
geographic areas of greatest need within the City. In general, this methodology concluded that the areas of greatest
need are the same as the Citys already defined focus areas, which includes census tracts 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19,
220, 21,25 and 26. The focus areas are identified in the City of Evansvilles 2005 2009 Consolidated Plan, which
details the resources and activities funded with Community Development Block Grants, Emergency Shelter Grants
and HOME Investment Partnership funds. It was noted during this analysis that some census tracts appear to have
fewer foreclosures, lower risk of foreclosures and fewer subprime mortgages due to the high number of rental units.
In addition, a large percentage of the homes in these high risk census tracts have elderly homeowners with no
mortgages, thus foreclosures and subprime mortgage data may be skewed. This was determined previously by
reviewing property tax exemption data (i.e. Over 65 and homestead exemptions). Also, through local Code
Enforcement data, evidence of greater vacancy rates exists in these census tracts. Therefore in reality, the
neighborhood housing status is in greater decline than the tables reflect. The information above and past analysis of

Plan Description:
The City of Evansville analyzed four data sets provided by HUD: risk of foreclosure, subprime loans, foreclosure
rates and vacancy rates, by utilizing Geographic Information Systems (GIS) computer mapping software. The
eligible census block groups were mapped with each of the data sets. The boundaries of existing focus areas
(CDBG Focus Area and Front Door Pride area) were then compared to the block group data, to determine the
geographic areas of greatest need within the City. In general, this methodology concluded that the areas of greatest
need are the same as the Citys already defined focus areas, which includes census tracts 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19,
220, 21,25 and 26. The focus areas are identified in the City of Evansvilles 2005 2009 Consolidated Plan, which
details the resources and activities funded with Community Development Block Grants, Emergency Shelter Grants
and HOME Investment Partnership funds. It was noted during this analysis that some census tracts appear to have
fewer foreclosures, lower risk of foreclosures and fewer subprime mortgages due to the high number of rental units.
In addition, a large percentage of the homes in these high risk census tracts have elderly homeowners with no
mortgages, thus foreclosures and subprime mortgage data may be skewed. This was determined previously by
reviewing property tax exemption data (i.e. Over 65 and homestead exemptions). Also, through local Code
Enforcement data, evidence of greater vacancy rates exists in these census tracts. Therefore in reality, the
neighborhood housing status is in greater decline than the tables reflect. The information above and past analysis of
the housing needs within the city of Evansville indicate that the areas of greatest need for NSP will continue within
the predetermined focus areas. Although some of the activities may fall in other eligible census tract block groups.

Recovery Needs:
The City of Evansville will address NSP requirements for the distribution and uses of the $3.6 million allocated to the
City through a combination of financing mechanisms for home buyers, acquisition of foreclosed homes, demolition of
blighted structures and rehabilitation and new construction programs within the target areas.
Financing mechanisms will utilize $400,000 of NSP funds to aid homebuyers between 80 and 120% AMI by
providing funds to buy down mortgages for previously foreclosed on and subsequently reduce the need for these
borrowers to resort to subprime mortgages for financing homes. The Department of Metropolitan Development
already partners with Community Action Program of Evansville (CAPE) and HOPE of Evansville to provide down
payment assistance. NSP funds will be used to supplement the $5,000 maximum down payment currently available
to cover the gap between development costs and actual appraised values. This program will not only eliminate
subprime mortgages but will also address the foreclosure risk and rates by aiding new homebuyers with lower
mortgage payments.
Five hundred thousand dollars has been earmarked for demolition of blighted structures in the Evansville NSP
expenditure plan. Funds will be used by City Code Enforcement to remove slum and blight throughout the
numerous eligible census tract block groups. High vacancy rates and the elevated number of abandoned homes
are contributing factors to the decline of neighborhoods, further exacerbating the decline of property values. Prior

program evaluations reveal poor construction of homes, older declining housing stock, sub-standard/non-existent
maintenance, etc. in the eligible block groups. The elimination of blighted housing will increase the overall value of
the housing stock and increase property values in the eligible neighborhoods and decrease the likelihood of
abandonment. It is estimated that 75 100 blighted homes will be demolished with NSP funds.
Acquisition of foreclosed properties will be conducted by the Evansville Redevelopment Commission (ERC) and
Evansville Brownfields Corp. (EBC). This component will utilize $400,000 of NSP funds. Property foreclosures are
completed after sheriff sales and typically it is the mortgage holder who buys the foreclosed property at the sheriff
sales. Therefore, both the ERC and EBC will use GIS software to map the location of all properties listed for sheriff
sales. Those properties within the eligible block groups will be evaluated for potential acquisition from the likely
buyer (mortgage holder). Lenders will be contacted regarding their foreclosed properties within the target areas,
these properties will be earmarked for potential acquisition.
The bulk of the City NSP funding, $1.9 million, will be for rehabilitation of existing homes and new home construction
to improve the overall appeal of the targeted areas and increase marketable housing stock. The result will be
increased mixed income neighborhoods, higher housing values, stable homeownership via competitive fixed rate
mortgages and reasonable terms, etc. These actions will dilute the foreclosure rate, minimize subprime mortgages
and decrease the foreclosure risk, while actively removing foreclosed properties from the current inventory. A
minimum of $901,301 of these funds will be utilized to provide rental and homeownership opportunities to families at
or below 50% AMI.
The rehabilitation and new construction will be managed both in-house by DMD staff, as well as with partner entities
such as the Affordable Housing Task Force (for low income and special populations) and market rate housing by
private entities and non-profit agencies.

Narratives
Areas of Greatest Need:
The City of Evansville analyzed four data sets provided by HUD: risk of foreclosure, subprime loans, foreclosure rates and vacancy rates, by
utilizing Geographic Information Systems (GIS) computer mapping software. The eligible census block groups were mapped with each of the
data sets. The boundaries of existing focus areas (CDBG Focus Area and Front Door Pride area) were then compared to the block group
data, to determine the geographic areas of greatest need within the City. In general, this methodology concluded that the areas of greatest
need are the same as the City&rsquos already defined focus areas, which includes census tracts 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, 220, 21,25 and
26. The focus areas are identified in the City of Evansville&rsquos 2005 &ndash 2009 Consolidated Plan, which details the resources and
activities funded with Community Development Block Grants, Emergency Shelter Grants and HOME Investment Partnership funds. It was
noted during this analysis that some census tracts appear to have fewer foreclosures, lower risk of foreclosures and fewer subprime
mortgages due to the high number of rental units. In addition, a large percentage of the homes in these &ldquohigh risk&rdquo census tracts
have elderly homeowners with no mortgages, thus foreclosures and subprime mortgage data may be skewed. This was determined previously
by reviewing property tax exemption data (i.e. Over 65 and homestead exemptions). Also, through local Code Enforcement data, evidence of
greater vacancy rates exists in these census tracts. Therefore in reality, the neighborhood housing status is in greater decline than the tables
reflect. The information above and past analysis of the housing needs within the city of Evansville indicate that the areas of greatest need for
NSP will continue within the predetermined focus areas. Although some of the activities may fall in other eligible census tract block groups.

Distribution and and Uses of Funds:
The City of Evansville will address NSP requirements for the distribution and uses of the $3.6 million allocated to the City through a
combination of financing mechanisms for home buyers, acquisition of foreclosed homes, demolition of blighted structures and rehabilitation
and new construction programs within the target areas. Financing mechanisms will utilize $400,000 of NSP funds to aid homebuyers between
80 and 120% AMI by providing funds to &ldquobuy down&rdquo mortgages for previously foreclosed on and subsequently reduce the need for
these borrowers to resort to subprime mortgages for financing homes. The Department of Metropolitan Development already partners with
Community Action Program of Evansville (CAPE) and HOPE of Evansville to provide down payment assistance. NSP funds will be used to
supplement the $5,000 maximum down payment currently available to cover the gap between development costs and actual appraised
values. This program will not only eliminate subprime mortgages but will also address the foreclosure risk and rates by aiding new
homebuyers with lower mortgage payments. Five hundred thousand dollars has been earmarked for demolition of blighted structures in the
Evansville NSP expenditure plan. Funds will be used by City Code Enforcement to remove slum and blight throughout the numerous eligible
census tract block groups. High vacancy rates and the elevated number of abandoned homes are contributing factors to the decline of
neighborhoods, further exacerbating the decline of property values. Prior program evaluations reveal poor construction of homes, older
declining housing stock, sub-standard/non-existent maintenance, etc. in the eligible block groups. The elimination of blighted housing will
increase the overall value of the housing stock and increase property values in the eligible neighborhoods and decrease the likelihood of
abandonment. It is estimated that 75 &ndash 100 blighted homes will be demolished with NSP funds. Acquisition of foreclosed properties will
be conducted by the Evansville Redevelopment Commission (ERC) and Evansville Brownfields Corp. (EBC). This component will utilize
$400,000 of NSP funds. Property foreclosures are completed after sheriff sales and typically it is the mortgage holder who buys the foreclosed
property at the sheriff sales. Therefore, both the ERC and EBC will use GIS software to map the location of all properties listed for sheriff
sales. Those properties within the eligible block groups will be evaluated for potential acquisition from the likely buyer (mortgage holder).
Lenders will be contacted regarding their foreclosed properties within the target areas, these properties will be earmarked for potential
acquisition. The bulk of the City NSP funding, $1.9 million, will be for rehabilitation of existing homes and new home construction to improve
the overall appeal of the targeted areas and increase marketable housing stock. The result will be increased mixed income neighborhoods,
higher housing values, stable homeownership via competitive fixed rate mortgages and reasonable terms, etc. These actions will dilute the
foreclosure rate, minimize subprime mortgages and decrease the foreclosure risk, while actively removing foreclosed properties from the

current inventory. A minimum of $901,301 of these funds will be utilized to provide rental and homeownership opportunities to families at or
below 50% AMI. The rehabilitation and new construction willbe managed both in-

Distribution and and Uses of Funds:

market rate housing by private entities and non-profit agencies.

Narratives
Areas of Greatest Need:
The City of Evansville analyzed four data sets provided by HUD: risk of foreclosure, subprime loans, foreclosure rates and vacancy rates, by
utilizing Geographic Information Systems (GIS) computer mapping software. The eligible census block groups were mapped with each of the
data sets. The boundaries of existing focus areas (CDBG Focus Area and Front Door Pride area) were then compared to the block group
data, to determine the geographic areas of greatest need within the City. In general, this methodology concluded that the areas of greatest
need are the same as the City&rsquos already defined focus areas, which includes census tracts 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, 220, 21,25 and
26. The focus areas are identified in the City of Evansville&rsquos 2005 &ndash 2009 Consolidated Plan, which details the resources and
activities funded with Community Development Block Grants, Emergency Shelter Grants and HOME Investment Partnership funds. It was
noted during this analysis that some census tracts appear to have fewer foreclosures, lower risk of foreclosures and fewer subprime
mortgages due to the high number of rental units. In addition, a large percentage of the homes in these &ldquohigh risk&rdquo census tracts
have elderly homeowners with no mortgages, thus foreclosures and subprime mortgage data may be skewed. This was determined previously
by reviewing property tax exemption data (i.e. Over 65 and homestead exemptions). Also, through local Code Enforcement data, evidence of
greater vacancy rates exists in these census tracts. Therefore in reality, the neighborhood housing status is in greater decline than the tables
reflect. The information above and past analysis of the housing needs within the city of Evansville indicate that the areas of greatest need for
NSP will continue within the predetermined focus areas. Although some of the activities may fall in other eligible census tract block groups.

Distribution and and Uses of Funds:
The City of Evansville will address NSP requirements for the distribution and uses of the $3.6 million allocated to the City through a
combination of financing mechanisms for home buyers, acquisition of foreclosed homes, demolition of blighted structures and rehabilitation
and new construction programs within the target areas. Financing mechanisms will utilize $400,000 of NSP funds to aid homebuyers between
80 and 120% AMI by providing funds to &ldquobuy down&rdquo mortgages for previously foreclosed on and subsequently reduce the need for
these borrowers to resort to subprime mortgages for financing homes. The Department of Metropolitan Development already partners with
Community Action Program of Evansville (CAPE) and HOPE of Evansville to provide down payment assistance. NSP funds will be used to
supplement the $5,000 maximum down payment currently available to cover the gap between development costs and actual appraised
values. This program will not only eliminate subprime mortgages but will also address the foreclosure risk and rates by aiding new
homebuyers with lower mortgage payments. Five hundred thousand dollars has been earmarked for demolition of blighted structures in the
Evansville NSP expenditure plan. Funds will be used by City Code Enforcement to remove slum and blight throughout the numerous eligible
census tract block groups. High vacancy rates and the elevated number of abandoned homes are contributing factors to the decline of
neighborhoods, further exacerbating the decline of property values. Prior program evaluations reveal poor construction of homes, older
declining housing stock, sub-standard/non-existent maintenance, etc. in the eligible block groups. The elimination of blighted housing will
increase the overall value of the housing stock and increase property values in the eligible neighborhoods and decrease the likelihood of
abandonment. It is estimated that 75 &ndash 100 blighted homes will be demolished with NSP funds. Acquisition of foreclosed properties will
be conducted by the Evansville Redevelopment Commission (ERC) and Evansville Brownfields Corp. (EBC). This component will utilize
$400,000 of NSP funds. Property foreclosures are completed after sheriff sales and typically it is the mortgage holder who buys the foreclosed
property at the sheriff sales. Therefore, both the ERC and EBC will use GIS software to map the location of all properties listed for sheriff
sales. Those properties within the eligible block groups will be evaluated for potential acquisition from the likely buyer (mortgage holder).
Lenders will be contacted regarding their foreclosed properties within the target areas, these properties will be earmarked for potential
acquisition. The bulk of the City NSP funding, $1.9 million, will be for rehabilitation of existing homes and new home construction to improve
the overall appeal of the targeted areas and increase marketable housing stock. The result will be increased mixed income neighborhoods,
higher housing values, stable homeownership via competitive fixed rate mortgages and reasonable terms, etc. These actions will dilute the
foreclosure rate, minimize subprime mortgages and decrease the foreclosure risk, while actively removing foreclosed properties from the

below 50% AMI. The rehabilitation and new construction willbe managed both in-

Narratives
Areas of Greatest Need:
The City of Evansville analyzed four data sets provided by HUD: risk of foreclosure, subprime loans, foreclosure rates and vacancy rates, by
utilizing Geographic Information Systems (GIS) computer mapping software. The eligible census block groups were mapped with each of the
data sets. The boundaries of existing focus areas (CDBG Focus Area and Front Door Pride area) were then compared to the block group
data, to determine the geographic areas of greatest need within the City. In general, this methodology concluded that the areas of greatest
need are the same as the City’s already defined focus areas, which includes census tracts 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, 220, 21,25 and 26. The
focus areas are identified in the City of Evansville’s 2005 – 2009 Consolidated Plan, which details the resources and activities funded with
Community Development Block Grants, Emergency Shelter Grants and HOME Investment Partnership funds. It was noted during this analysis
that some census tracts appear to have fewer foreclosures, lower risk of foreclosures and fewer subprime mortgages due to the high number
of rental units. In addition, a large percentage of the homes in these “high risk” census tracts have elderly homeowners with no mortgages,
thus foreclosures and subprime mortgage data may be skewed. This was determined previously by reviewing property tax exemption data (i.e.
Over 65 and homestead exemptions). Also, through local Code Enforcement data, evidence of greater vacancy rates exists in these census
tracts. Therefore in reality, the neighborhood housing status is in greater decline than the tables reflect. The information above and past
analysis of the housing needs within the city of Evansville indicate that the areas of greatest need for NSP will continue within the
predetermined focus areas. Although some of the activities may fall in other eligible census tract block groups.

Distribution and and Uses of Funds:
The City of Evansville will address NSP requirements for the distribution and uses of the $3.6 million allocated to the City through a
combination of financing mechanisms for home buyers, acquisition of foreclosed homes, demolition of blighted structures and rehabilitation
and new construction programs within the target areas. Financing mechanisms will utilize $400,000 of NSP funds to aid homebuyers between
80 and 120% AMI by providing funds to “buy down” mortgages for previously foreclosed on and subsequently reduce the need for these
borrowers to resort to subprime mortgages for financing homes. The Department of Metropolitan Development already partners with
Community Action Program of Evansville (CAPE) and HOPE of Evansville to provide down payment assistance. NSP funds will be used to
supplement the $5,000 maximum down payment currently available to cover the gap between development costs and actual appraised
values. This program will not only eliminate subprime mortgages but will also address the foreclosure risk and rates by aiding new
homebuyers with lower mortgage payments. Five hundred thousand dollars has been earmarked for demolition of blighted structures in the
Evansville NSP expenditure plan. Funds will be used by City Code Enforcement to remove slum and blight throughout the numerous eligible
census tract block groups. High vacancy rates and the elevated number of abandoned homes are contributing factors to the decline of
neighborhoods, further exacerbating the decline of property values. Prior program evaluations reveal poor construction of homes, older
declining housing stock, sub-standard/non-existent maintenance, etc. in the eligible block groups. The elimination of blighted housing will
increase the overall value of the housing stock and increase property values in the eligible neighborhoods and decrease the likelihood of
abandonment. It is estimated that 75 – 100 blighted homes will be demolished with NSP funds. Acquisition of foreclosed properties will be
conducted by the Evansville Redevelopment Commission (ERC) and Evansville Brownfields Corp. (EBC). This component will utilize
$400,000 of NSP funds. Property foreclosures are completed after sheriff sales and typically it is the mortgage holder who buys the foreclosed
property at the sheriff sales. Therefore, both the ERC and EBC will use GIS software to map the location of all properties listed for sheriff
sales. Those properties within the eligible block groups will be evaluated for potential acquisition from the likely buyer (mortgage holder).
Lenders will be contacted regarding their foreclosed properties within the target areas, these properties will be earmarked for

potential acquisition. The bulk of the City NSP funding, $1.9 million, will be for rehabilitation of existing homes and new home construction to
improve the overall appeal of the targeted areas and increase marketable housing stock. The result will be increased mixed income
neighborhoods, higher housing values, stable homeownership via competitive fixed rate mortgages and reasonable terms, etc. These actions
will dilute the foreclosure rate, minimize subprime mortgages and decrease the foreclosure risk, while actively removing foreclosed properties
from the current inventory. A minimum of $901,301 of these funds will be utilized to provide rental and homeownership opportunities to
families at or below 50% AMI. The rehabilitation and new construction willbe managed both in-house by DMD staff, as well as with partner
entities such as the Affordable Housing Task Force (for low income and special populations) and market rate housing by private entities and
non-profit agencies.

Definitions and Descriptions:
We had to move $1235.50 for a late claim on Activity 9 under Project Reconstruction. We should be ready for NSP close out very soon. I
decreased the admin budget by $1235.50 and increased the Reconstruction Budget by $1235.50. Thanks.
