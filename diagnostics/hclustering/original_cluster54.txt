Summary of Distribution and Uses of NSP Funds:
The City of Elkhart utilized the HUD NSP3 mapping tool as well as the needs data provided by HUD to determine a general area of need for
the community. This information was then compared with the existing NSP1 area and the Neighborhood Revitalization Strategy Area as well
as a list of tax delinquent properties available from Elkhart County to narrow the area of need down to a smaller area. This area was then
mapped and determined to be the area of greatest need for the NSP3 program.
The first phase of this evaluation was to use the NSP3 needs data. The City of Elkhart has 82 Census Block Groups (CBG) in this data set.
Each of those CBGs had an NSP3 needs score of 18 or greater. This indicated that any of the CBGs in Elkhart would meet the minimum
requirement of an NSP3 needs score of 17. Several of the CDBs had fewer than 3 households so those were removed from the evaluation
because the area was not considered to be residential in nature. This process left 60 CBGs to be reviewed for percent of households that are
51% or greater low-mod-medium income level. Of those 60 CBGs, 54 met that criterion. This provided the largest potential area for the NSP3
program. This area was then compared to two defined areas of need in the community, the NSP1 area and the CDBG Neighborhood
Revitalization Strategy Area.
The data for these CBGs was then reviewed for vacancy rates (COMBINED VAC), agreement numbers (HMDA), high cost agreements (HCRATES), seriously delinquent agreements (SDQ-RATES), number of foreclosure starts (STARTS), completed foreclosures (REO), and
number of projects to make an impact (IMPACT).
From this data it was determined that each block group is eligible under NSP3 by having a Needs Score of 17 or more. When the additional
data points are reviewed it becomes clear that each CGB has some characteristic that makes it relatively higher or lower in need based on
that data point. This data is useful in providing an overview of a large eligible area but does not provide a clear picture of a reasonable sized
area of greatest need.
The City of Elkhart is a recipient of NSP1 funds as well as an entitlement community for CDBG funds. The NSP1 area is very similar to the
existing NRSA for the City of Elkhart. This area has been shown over time and through the NSP1 and the CDBG Consolidated Plan planning
processes to be the area in the community that has the greatest needs. The decision to focus NSP3 efforts in the same general areas as
these existing redevelopment efforts was in great part due to a desire by the City to provide comprehensive redevelopment of an area already
determined to be in the greatest need in our community.
NRSA Census Block Group Data plus CBG 22.5
Elkhart County&rsquos list of tax delinquent properties that did not sell in the October 2010 tax sale contained one hundred four parcels. The
City and County worked together in 2010 to transfer tax-delinquent properties that had not sold at one or more tax sales to the City of Elkhart
Redevelopment Commission for use in the NSP1 program. The intent for NSP3 is to continue with this model for several reasons, including
but not limited to the following:
> 1. The tax-foreclosure process makes these properties eligible for acquisition under the NSP3 rules.
> 2. These properties can be acquired with clean title through the tax-foreclosure process.
> 3. Tax-delinquent properties that are not redeemed by owners or purchased at the tax sale are generally
>
less marketable and least likely to be redeveloped by the private sector as proven by the lack of interest
>
in keeping or obtaining ownership.
> 4. These properties are generally in very poor condition due to the lack of interest or financial capacity of
>
the owner and create a blighting influence on the neighborhood.
> 5. These properties can be acquired at a very low cost, allowing the NSP3 project to impact more
>
properties.
>When the list of tax sale parcels was mapped in relation to the existing NSP1 and NRSA boundaries, 83 of the 104 parcels were inside those
boundaries furthering the argument that this is the area of greatest need. That said this area was deemed to be too large to serve as the
NSP3 area. For this reason NSP1 and CDBG funded projects were mapped as well to determine if a cluster of projects would be found. This

This map provides locations of NSP1 projects and projects funded with CDBG since 2008 in brown. The green markers indicate the location
of the 104 tax delinquent parcels. The red outline is the current NRSA. As noted, many of the tax delinquent properties fall within the existing
NRSA. To finalize the NSP3 area of greatest need, the City decided to extend the designated central area of the NRSA an additional three
blocks south of the current southern boundary to take advantage of a cluster of eligible tax delinquent properties that lay just outside the
existing NRSA boundaries.

How Fund Use Addresses Market Conditions:
Housing Type & Quality Analysis
Housing professionals are most often concerned about the provision of affordable housing to low, moderate and middle-income individuals
and families. In order to be considered of these income, a family&rsquos income must be at or below 120 percent of the Area Median Income
(AMI) for their particular family size. Low income is considered to be 50 percent of the AMI, and very low income is considered to be at 30
percent of the AMI. Income limits based on these percentages are used to determine eligibility for various assistance programs.
The City of Elkhart has more than 23,000 housing units (owner and rental). Of these units, 87 percent are occupied and 13 percent are vacant.
The homeowner vacancy rate is more than 5 percent; the rental vacancy rate is just over 8 percent. Fifty-four percent of Elkhart&rsquos
housing units are owner-occupied and 46 percent are renter occupied (Source: American Community Survey, 2006-2008).
Owner-Occupied Units
Recent changes in the local and national economies and, in particular the housing market, have had profound effects on Elkhart&rsquos
housing values, housing stock, and housing conditions. Increases in the City&rsquos and region&rsquos unemployment rates, from the
County&rsquos 5.3 percent unemployment rate in January 2008 to an unemployment high of 18.8 percent in March 2009 to the current 15.6
percent in January 2010have increasd the number of housing units listed for sale, decreased the number of units sol, and decreased the sale
price to list price ratio.
It is anticipated that the Michiana real estate market will remain sluggish as the outcomes in financial markets and the regional economy (in
particular the recreational vehicle and manufactured housing industries) remain uncertain. Elkhart will likely continue to face weak housing
markets because of the weak demand, growing inventories of existing homes, and tougher credit markets.
The 2004 Housing Needs Assessment found that there was a "booming housing market" for middle and upper middle income homes, while
the low to moderate income housing market had not kept pace. Additionally, it was determined that the housing stock available to low and
moderate income residents was deteriorating due to inadequacies in public policy and insufficient maintenance resources.
Housing values, as a whole, have decreased throughout Elkhart, the State of Indiana, the Midwest, and many other locations throughout the
United States. The decrease in values has increased the number of housing units considered "affordable." The City has not increased its
affordable housing inventory; the market has devalued the existing housing inventory (through an oversupply of units and lower demands).
Thus, the choice of housing units, at all price points, has increased for employed potential homeowners who qualify for a mortgage and have a
sufficient down payment.
Renter-Occupied Units
In 2008, 46 percent of Elkhart&rsquos housing units were renter-occupied (Source: American Community Survey). According to forecasts by
ESRI, in 2014, it is anticipated that the percentage of renter-occupied units will decrease to 38 percent. It is important to note that rental unit
vacancies increased from just over eight percent to 13 percent between 2000 an2008 respectively. Te attributed to the sluggish economy,
along with increased property taxes (re-assessments in the mid-2000s), higher insurance premiums, increased utility bills, and an increased
number or rental properties for sale and in foreclosure.
The 2008 median rent was $627 per month. The Elkhart-Goshen MSA 2009 Fair Market Rent (FMR) is $731 per month for a two-bedroom
unit, which is greater than the Indiana FMR of $697 per month (Source: National Low Income Housing Coalition, 2009). Nearly 68 percent of
Elkhart&rsquos rental housing stock rents for less than the FMR. However, 42 percent of renters are unable to afford FMR. (Source: American
Community Survey, 2006-2008). The maximum affordable monthly housing cost for a family of four at 30 percent of the AMI is $444 per
month.Analysis
The basic unit of housing consumption is the household. Housing demand can be assessed by examining various demographic characteristics
relating to the number and composition of households within a community. These primary characteristics are:
• Population
• Number of Households
• Persons per Household
• Age of the Population
• Income Levels
Housing demand is also influenced by individual household choices relative to housing type, location, and cost. Furthermore, households
make individual decisions concerning what they are willing and able to pay for housing. Vacancy rates are an important housing indicator
because they often reflect the degree of housing chices available. A high vacancy rate usually suggests a high degree of choice, while a low
vacancy rate is often indicative of a relatively low degree of choice and higher housing costs.
Currently, the general Elkhart housing supply exceeds the general demand. The table below illustrates the housing supply product as an
index of housing availability, in particular for potential homeowners. When calculating the housing supply product for the overall Elkhart
population, there is an inventory of housing units, both rental and owner occupied, available (more than 23,000) for more than 20,000
households. These calculations are based on ESRI&rsquos population projections for 2009.
Households earning up to 120 percent of the AMI, $$71,150 or less for a family of four, have sufficient choice in housing options as well.
Available housing units were determined by multiplying an annual household income by three to determine house purchase price. In the case
of a 120 percent AMI household, the maximum purchase price, or value, is $213,120. There is an estimated 23,000 units with a value of less
than $213,120. It is important to note that this calculation of total units includes all housing units, both owner-occupied and rental. This
indicates that all rental units and all but approximately 700 of the for sale units would be affordable to this income groups. This reflects the
decrease in housing values that has occurred in the last two years, coupled with an increase of supply obtained through new construction and
annexation.

Households earning 80 percent of the AMI, $47,360 or less for a family of four, have sufficient choice in housing options as well. Available
housing units were determined by multiplying an annual household income by three to determine house purchase price. In the case of an 80
percent AMIhousehold, the maximum purchase price,orvalue,is $142, 080. There is an estimated 22,073 units with a value of less than
$142,080. This is more than double the number of units at this price point in 2000. It is important to note that this calculation of total units
includes all housing units, both owner-occupied and rental. This reflects the decrease in housing values that has occurred in the last two
years, coupled with an increase of supply obtained through new construction and annexation.
Housing options for low and very low income residents are limited by affordability and availability. The housing supply product for households
earning 50 percent of the AMI, $29,600 or less for a family of four is lower than the demand. It is estimated that there is approximately 5,500
housing units with a purchase price/value of $88,800 or less for more than 7,000 households in this income category. There is an inadequate
supply of housing for households considered low and very low income and it can be surmised that the quality and location of the available
affordable units are also inadequate.

The City of Elkhart will enforce rent and occupancy requirements through a recorded agreement. This agreement will contain all programmatic
conditions and will be signed at the property closing. The agreement will then be recorded with the Elkhart County Recorder&rsquos Office.
The property owner will be expected to provide proof of income-qualified tenants at the initial time of occupancy of the entire term of the
affordability period.
It is important to note that if the assistance for this project was made to meet the set-aside requirement to serve persons at or below 50% AMI
all subsequent tenants must meet the same income standards of 50% AMI at initial occupancy during the term of the affordability period.
The agreement will be released upon completion of the affordability period. If the property would transfer ownership within the affordability
period, the new owner would assume the agreement and all programmatic conditions involved.
For Homebuyer Activities the following chart provides affordability period requirements.

programmatic conditions and will be signed at the property closing. The agreement will then be recorded with the Elkhart County
Recorder&rsquos Office. The agreement will be released upon completion of the affordability period. If the property would transfer ownership
within the affordability period, the new owner would assume the agreement and all programmatic conditions involved.
It is important to note that if the sale is made to persons at or below 50% AMI and that sale was used to meet the minimum investment for
persons at or below 50%AMI, the subsequent sale during the affordability period would have to be to a person at or below 50% AMI to meet
the regulator requirement of the NSP program.
If an income-qualified homebuyer cannot be identified by the owner, assistance from local partners, including but not limited to, La Casa Inc.,
Habitat for Humanity, and other local housing agencies will be utilized to find an income eligible homebuyer.

Definition of Blighted Structure:
The term "blighted structure" is not defined in any City of Elkhart ordinance nor is it defined in the State of Indiana Unsafe Building Law or in
the 2006 International Property Maintenance Code that has been adopted by the City of Elkhart. For this reason the City of Elkhart will
consider "blighted structure" to be equivalent to the term "unsafe building" as defined in the State of Indiana Unsafe Building Law:

Definition of Affordable Rents:
C. Definitions and Description
The following definition of affordable rent is to replace the former definition provided in the NSP plan.
(2) Definition of "affordable rents."
Note: Grantees may use the definition they have adopted for their CDBG program but should review their existing definition to ensure
compliance with NSP program &ndashspecific requirements such as continued affordability.
Response:
"Affordable Rents" is defined as the rent limits provided by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) annually. This rent
limit is designed to ensure that units built using program funds are affordable to low- and very low-income households. The rent limit for a
given unit is the maximum rent a property owner may charge for the unit. Any rental housing produced with NSP funds will follow HOME rent
limits for the entire affordability period based on the NSP lien recorded for that property. Rental units produced to meet the set-aside
requirements for households at or below 50% AMI must use the Low HOME rent limits. For housing units not subject to the 50% AMI set-aside
requirements, the fair market rent or High HOME rent limits, which ever is higher, will act as the maximum rent allowable unless other
provisions are noted in the NSP lien document recorded for the property.

Housing Rehabilitation/New Construction Standards:
The City of Elkhart has adopted the following building codes for residential properties in the City&rsquos jurisdiction.
Indiana Residential Code, 2005 Edition. (This includes Structural, Plumbing and Mechanical Rules) 2003 International Residential Code for

All properties renovated with the NSP funds will be brought into compliance with the applicable residential codes for existing home
rehabilitation in addition to the following HUD required standards.
•
• All gut rehabilitation or new construction (i.e., general replacement of the interior of a building that may or may not include changes to
structural elements such as flooring systems, columns or load bearing interior or exterior walls) of residential buildings up to three stories must
be designed to meet the standard for Energy Star Qualified New Homes.
• All gut rehabilitation or new construction of mid- or high-rise multifamily housing must be designed to meet American Society of
Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Standard 90.1-2004, Appendix G plus 20 percent (which is the Energy Star
standard for multifamily buildings piloted by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy).
• Other rehabilitation must meet these standards to the extent applicable to the rehabilitation work undertaken, e.g., replace older
obsolete products and appliances (such as windows, doors, lighting, hot water heaters, furnaces, boilers, air conditioning units, refrigerators,
clothes washers and dishwashers) with Energy Star-46 labeled products.
• Water efficient toilets, showers, and faucets, such as those with the WaterSense label, must be installed.

Vicinity Hiring:
The City of Elkhart is committed to implementing the vicinity hiring preference in its NSP3 activities. The City of Elkhart has a Section 3 plan
that currently requires that all job announcements for contractors with CDBG or NSP contracts must be posted with the Elkhart Housing
Authority and the Work Force Development Office. These offices are within the area of greatest need. City staff will also review existing
CDBG-approved contractors to determine if any are located within the area of greatest need. Staff will also review the local phone book for
contractors located within the area of greatest need. These contractors will be notified that they will be eligible for the NSP3 vicinity hiring
preference with all NSP3 contracts. City staff will participate in the webinar scheduled to provide guidance on the vicinity hiring preference on
March 3, 2011.

Procedures for Preferences for Affordable Rental Dev.:
This is the City of Elkhart&rsquos preference for development of affordable rental housing with NSP3. The housing market in Elkhart has been
negatively impacted by the extreme economic down turn the area has experienced. According to CHAS data used in the housing needs
assessment conducted for the 2010-2015 Consolidated Plan, the City of Elkhart had 810 vacant homes for sale and 1,315 vacant units for
rent. The data from the US Census for 2005-2009 American Community Survey indicates that the vacancy rate for homeowner units is only
5
Community Development Systems
Disaster Recovery Grant Reporting System (DRGR)

4.5% while it is 14.2% for rental units.
Given high vacancy rates specifically in rental units, the project will provide for development of rental units that are owned by local not-forprofits and will focus those units on persons with special needs such as persons who are homeless, disabled, veterans, or victims of domestic
violence. By providing rental housing for special needs populations, the City can meet the goal of the NSP3 program to develop affordable
rental housing in a manner that addresses the high vacancy rates in rental housing units.
City staff will work closely with local not-for-profit agencies to identify housing units that would meet the needs the agency and their clients that
also meet NSP3 requirments of vacant, abandon, or foreclosed upon. Identifying properties that meet the location, unit size and number,
accessibilty needs, and low costs of operations of the agency and clients is critical to finding a local partner to acquire and manage the rental
units after the units are rehabiltation with NSP3 funds.
It is expected that funds used for this activity will be used to meet the low-income housing requirement for those below 50% of area median
income (AMI). The City will work with local partner housing and social service agencies to find tenants who are income qualified and in need of
affordable housing opportunities in our city, paying special attention to persons at or below 50% AMI.

Overall Progress Narrative:
The City of Elkhart NSP3 program in underway. Staff has been working to secrure tax deeds for NSP3 properties
from the 2011 tax sale as well as managing existing properties in the Land Bank. The construction manager for the
City has been working with a local architect to develop the scope of work for the renovations of 209 North Second
Street for a rental projects. The NSP resource specailist has been working on the demolition projects as well as
general book keeping. The City's Community and Redevelopment Manager has been working on over all project
administration and program design. As the work load on NSP3 increases staff salaries will be charge to the
program starting in the 3rd quarter 2012 up to this point we have charged staff costs to NSP1 as the number or
properties from NSP3 were a small portion of total staff time.
A substaintial amendment was made to the NSP3 plan during this quarter that amended the definition of affordable
rents and updated the budgets based on current needs. Significant budget changes include the reduction of
landbank funds due to experience with NSP1 that demonstrated the landbank maintenance and disposition was not
as costly as projected and the increase in the rehabilitation budget for the set-aside rental units. After the building at
209 North Second was acquired it was determined the renovation would cost significantly more than projected.

Activity Description:
funds to pay for administration and planning for the NSP3 Program

Location Description:
activity to be carried out at the Municipal Building 229 South Second Street, Elkhart, IN 46516

Activity Progress Narrative:
No administrative funds were drawn during this quarter because the City will be using many of the documents and other
administrative resources from the NSP1 program so there was not a need to recreate them. As the work load for NSP3
projects increases with additional properties and NSP1 projects wind down, funds to pay for adminstrative staff will be drawn in
larger part from NSP3. Proposed admin expenses moving forward are salaries for the program administrator and NSP
specialist as well as any legal services and a part-time file management and admin assistant staff person. These expenses will
begin in the 3rd quarter 2012.

The NSP3 land bank currently has 10 properties that are listed below. Funds for this quarter have been spent to maintain these
properties. 7 of those properties have buildings that will or have already been demolished; the other 3 are vacant land. The
property listed as 1822 S. 6th is actually a vacant lot near that address, but I could not note that in the address or it would not
accept it during the validation process.
During this quarter 3 of the 7 homes for demolition in the land bank were demolished. This information will be reported in the
demolition activity.

Narratives
Summary of Distribution and Uses of NSP Funds:
The City of Elkhart utilized the HUD NSP3 mapping tool as well as the needs data provided by HUD to determine a general area of need for
the community. This information was then compared with the existing NSP1 area and the Neighborhood Revitalization Strategy Area as well
as a list of tax delinquent properties available from Elkhart County to narrow the area of need down to a smaller area. This area was then
mapped and determined to be the area of greatest need for the NSP3 program.
The first phase of this evaluation was to use the NSP3 needs data. The City of Elkhart has 82 Census Block Groups (CBG) in this data set.
Each of those CBGs had an NSP3 needs score of 18 or greater. This indicated that any of the CBGs in Elkhart would meet the minimum
requirement of an NSP3 needs score of 17. Several of the CDBs had fewer than 3 households so those were removed from the evaluation
because the area was not considered to be residential in nature. This process left 60 CBGs to be reviewed for percent of households that are
51% or greater low-mod-medium income level. Of those 60 CBGs, 54 met that criterion. This provided the largest potential area for the NSP3
program. This area was then compared to two defined areas of need in the community, the NSP1 area and the CDBG Neighborhood
Revitalization Strategy Area.
The data for these CBGs was then reviewed for vacancy rates (COMBINED VAC), agreement numbers (HMDA), high cost agreements (HCRATES), seriously delinquent agreements (SDQ-RATES), number of foreclosure starts (STARTS), completed foreclosures (REO), and
number of projects to make an impact (IMPACT).
From this data it was determined that each block group is eligible under NSP3 by having a Needs Score of 17 or more. When the additional
data points are reviewed it becomes clear that each CGB has some characteristic that makes it relatively higher or lower in need based on
that data point. This data is useful in providing an overview of a large eligible area but does not provide a clear picture of a reasonably-sized
area of greatest need.
The City of Elkhart is a recipient of NSP1 funds as well as an entitlement community for CDBG funds. The NSP1 area is very similar to the
existing NRSA for the City of Elkhart. This area has been shown over time and through the NSP1 and the CDBG Consolidated Plan planning
processes to be the area in the community that has the greatest needs. The decision to focus NSP3 efforts in the same general areas as
these existing redevelopment efforts was in great part due to a desire by the City to provide comprehensive redevelopment of an area already
determined to be in the greatest need in our community.
NRSA Census Block Group Data plus CBG 22.5
Elkhart County&rsquos list of tax delinquent properties that did not sell in the October 2010 tax sale contained one hundred four parcels. The
City and County worked together in 2010 to transfer tax-delinquent properties that had not sold at one or more tax sales to the City of Elkhart
Redevelopment Commission for use in the NSP1 program. The intent for NSP3 is to continue with this model for several reasons, including
but not limited to the following:
> 1. The tax-foreclosure process makes these properties eligible for acquisition under the NSP3 rules.
> 2. These properties can be acquired with clean title through the tax-foreclosure process.
> 3. Tax-delinquent properties that are not redeemed by owners or purchased at the tax sale are generally
>
less marketable and least likely to be redeveloped by the private sector as proven by the lack of interest
>
in keeping or obtaining ownership.
> 4. These properties are generally in very poor condition due to the lack of interest or financial capacity of
>
the owner and create a blighting influence on the neighborhood.
> 5. These properties can be acquired at a very low cost, allowing the NSP3 project to impact more
>
properties.
>When the list of tax sale parcels was mapped in relation to the existing NSP1 and NRSA boundaries, 83 of the 104 parcels were inside those
boundaries furthering the argument that this is the area of greatest need. That said, this area was deemed to be too large to serve as the
NSP3 area. For this reason NSP1- and CDBG-funded projects were mapped as well to determine if a cluster of projects would be found. This

Community Development Systems
Disaster Recovery Grant Reporting System (DRGR)

mapping process provided a basis for the NSP3 mapping area defined in the NSP3 mapping tool.
This map provides locations of NSP1 projects and projects funded with CDBG since 2008 in brown. The green markers indicate the location
of the 104 tax delinquent parcels. The red outline is the current NRSA. As noted, many of the tax delinquent properties fall within the existing
NRSA. To finalize the NSP3 area of greatest need, the City decided to extend the designated central area of the NRSA an additional three
blocks south of the current southern boundary to take advantage of a cluster of eligible tax delinquent properties that lay just outside the
existing NRSA boundaries.

How Fund Use Addresses Market Conditions:
Housing Type & Quality Analysis
Housing professionals are most often concerned about the provision of affordable housing to low, moderate and middle-income individuals
and families. In order to be considered of these income, a family&rsquos income must be at or below 120 percent of the Area Median Income
(AMI) for their particular family size. Low income is considered to be 50 percent of the AMI, and very low income is considered to be at 30
percent of the AMI. Income limits based on these percentages are used to determine eligibility for various assistance programs.
The City of Elkhart has more than 23,000 housing units (owner and rental). Of these units, 87 percent are occupied and 13 percent are vacant.
The homeowner vacancy rate is more than 5 percent; the rental vacancy rate is just over 8 percent. Fifty-four percent of Elkhart&rsquos
housing units are owneroccupied and 46 percent are renter occupied. (Source: American Community Survey, 2006-2008)
Owner-Occupied Units
Recent changes in the local and national economies and, in particular, the housing market have had profound effects on Elkhart&rsquos
housing values, housing stock, and housing conditions. Increases in the City&rsquos and region&rsquos unemployment rates, from the
County&rsquos 5.3 percent unemployment rate in January 2008 to an unemployment high of 18.8 percent in March 2009 to the current 15.6
percent in January 2010 have increasd the number of housing units listed for sale, decreased the number of units sold, and decreased the
sale price to list price ratio.
It is anticipated that the Michiana real estate market will remain sluggish as the outcomes in financial markets and the regional economy (in
particular the recreational vehicle and manufactured housing industries) remain uncertain. Elkhart will likely continue to face weak housing
markets because of the weak demand, growing inventories of existing homes, and tougher credit markets.
The 2004 Housing Needs Assessment found that there was a "booming housing market" for middle- and upper-middle-income homes, while
the low- to moderate-income housing market had not kept pace. Additionally, it was determined that the housing stock available to low- and
moderate-income residents was deteriorating due to inadequacies in public policy and insufficient maintenance resources.
Housing values, as a whole, have decreased throughout Elkhart, the State of Indiana, the Midwest, and many other locations throughout the
United States. The decrease in values has increased the number of housing units considered "affordable." The City has not increased its
affordable housing inventory; the market has devalued the existing housing inventory (through an oversupply of units and lower demands).
Thus, the choice of housing units, at all price points, has increased for employed potential homeowners who qualify for a mortgage and have a
sufficient down payment.
Renter-Occupied Units
In 2008, 46 percent of Elkhart&rsquos housing units were renter occupied (Source: American Community Survey). According to forecasts by
ESRI, in 2014, it is anticipated that the percentage of renter-occupied units will decrease to 38 percent. It is important to note that rental unit
vacancies increased from just over eight percent to 13 percent between 2000 and 2008 respectivly. The attributed to the sluggish economy,
along with increased property taxes (re-assessments in the mid-2000s), higher insurance premiums, increased utility bills, and an increased
number of rental properties for sale and in foreclosure.
The 2008 median rent was $627 per month. The Elkhart-Goshen MSA 2009 Fair Market Rent (FMR) is $731 per month for a two-bedroom
unit, which is greater than the Indiana FMR of $697 per month. (Source: National Low Income Housing Coalition, 2009) Nearly 68 percent of
Elkhart&rsquos rental housing stock rents for less than the FMR. However, 42 percent of renters are unable to afford FMR. (Source: American
Community Survey, 2006-2008) The maximum affordable monthly housing cost for a family of four at 30 percent of the AMI is $444 per month.
The basic unit of housing consumption is the household. Housing demand can be assessed by examining various demographic characteristics
relating to the number and composition of households within a community. These primary characteristics are:
• Population
• Number of Households
• Persons per Household
• Age of the Population
• Income Levels
Housing demand is also influenced by individual household choices relative to housing type, location, and cost. Furthermore, households
make individual decisions concerning what they are willing and able to pay for housing. Vacancy rates are an important housing indicator
because they often reflect the degree of housing choices available. A high vacancy rate usually suggests a high degree of choice, while a low
vacancy rate is often indicative of a relatively low degree of choice and higher housing costs.
Currently, the general Elkhart housing supply exceeds the general demand. The table below illustrates the housing supply product as an
index of housing availability, in particular for potential homeowners. When calculating the housing supply product for the overall Elkhart
population, there is an inventory of housing units, both rental and owner occupied, available (more than 23,000) for more than 20,000
households. These calculations are based on ESRI&rsquos population projections for 2009.
Households earning up to 120 percent of the AMI, $$71,150 or less for a family of four, have sufficient choice in housing options as well.
Available housing units were determined by multiplying an annual household income by three to determine house purchase price. In the case
of a 120 percent AMI household, the maximum purchase price, or value, is $213,120. There are an estimated 23,000 units with a value of less
than $213,120. It is important to note that this calculation of total units includes all housing units, both owner occupied and rental. This
indicates that all rental units and all but approximately 700 of the for sale units would be affordable to this income groups. This reflects the
decrease in housing values that has occurred in the last two years, coupled with an increase of supply obtained through new construction and
annexation.
Households earning 80 percent of the AMI, $47,360 or less for a family of four, have sufficient choice in housing options as well. Available

housing units were determined by multiplying an annual household income by three to determine house purchase price. In the case of an 80
percent AMI household, the maximum purchase price, or value, is $142, 080. There are an estimated 22,073 units with a value of less than
$142,080. This is more than double the number of units at this price point in 2000. It is important to note that this calculation of total units
includes all housing units, both owner occupied and rental. This reflects the decrease in housing values that has occurred in the last two
years, coupled with an increase of supply obtained through new construction and annexation.
Housing options for low- and very-low-income residents are limited by affordability and availability. The housing supply product for households
earning 50 percent of the AMI, $29,600 or less for a family of four, is lower than the demand. It is estimated that there are approximately 5,500
housing units with a purchase price/value of $88,800 or less for more than 7,000 households in this income category. There is an inadequate
supply of housing for households considered low- and very-low-income, and it can be surmised that the quality and location of the available
affordable units are also inadequate.

The City of Elkhart will enforce rent and occupancy requirements through a recorded agreement. This agreement will contain all programmatic
conditions and will be signed at the property closing. The agreement will then be recorded with the Elkhart County Recorder&rsquos Office.
The property owner will be expected to provide proof of income-qualified tenants at the initial time of occupancy of the entire term of the
affordability period.
It is important to note that, if the assistance for this project was made to meet the set-aside requirement to serve persons at or below 50%
AMI, all subsequent tenants must meet the same income standards of 50% AMI at initial occupancy during the term of the affordability period.
The agreement will be released upon completion of the affordability period. If the property would transfer ownership within the affordability
period, the new owner would assume the agreement and all programmatic conditions involved.
For Homebuyer Activities the following chart provides affordability period requirements.

programmatic conditions and will be signed at the property closing. The agreement will then be recorded with the Elkhart County
Recorder&rsquos Office. The agreement will be released upon completion of the affordability period. If the property would transfer ownership
within the affordability period, the new owner would assume the agreement and all programmatic conditions involved.
It is important to note, that if the sale is made to persons at or below 50% AMI and that sale was used to meet the minimum investment for
persons at or below 50%AMI, the subsequent sale during the affordability period would have to be to a person at or below 50% AMI to meet
the regulatory requirement of the NSP program.
If an income-qualified homebuyer cannot be identified by the owner, assistance from local partners, including but not limited to, La Casa Inc.,
Habitat for Humanity, and other local housing agencies will be utilized to find an income eligible homebuyer.

Definition of Blighted Structure:
The term "blighted structure" is not defined in any City of Elkhart ordinance nor is it defined in the State of Indiana Unsafe Building Law or in
the 2006 International Property Maintenance Code that has been adopted by the City of Elkhart. For this reason the City of Elkhart will
consider "blighted structure" to be equivalent to the term "unsafe building" as defined in the State of Indiana Unsafe Building Law:
IC 36-7-9-4 Unsafe buildings and unsafe premises described:
Sec. 4. (a) For purposes of this chapter, a building or structure, or any part of a building or structure, that is:
>
(1) in an impaired structural condition that makes it unsafe to a person or property;
>
(2) a fire hazard;
>
(3) a hazard to the public health;
(4) a public nuisance;
>
(5) dangerous to a person or property because of a violation of a statute or ordinance concerning building condition or maintenance; or
>
(6) vacant and not maintained in a manner that would allow human habitation, occupancy, or use under the requirements of a statute or
an ordinance; is considered an unsafe building.
> (b) For purposes of this chapter:
>
(1) an unsafe building; and
>
(2) the tract of real property on which the unsafe building is located; are considered unsafe premises.
> (c) For purposes of this chapter, a tract of real property that does not contain a building or structure, not including land used for production
agriculture, is considered an unsafe premises if the tract of real property is:
>
(1) a fire hazard;
>
(2) a hazard to public health;
>
(3) a public nuisance; or
>
(4) dangerous to a person or property because of a violation of a statute or an ordinance.
>As added by Acts 1981, P.L.309, SEC.28. Amended by P.L.14-1991, SEC.9; P.L.66-2005, SEC.1.

Definition of Affordable Rents:
C. Definitions and Description
The following definition of affordable rent is to replace the former definition provided in the NSP plan.
(2) Definition of "affordable rents."
Note: Grantees may use the definition they have adopted for their CDBG program but should review their existing definition to ensure
compliance with NSP program &ndashspecific requirements such as continued affordability.
Response:
"Affordable Rents" is defined as the rent limits provided by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) annually. This rent
limit is designed to ensure that units built using program funds are affordable to low- and very low-income households. The rent limit for a
given unit is the maximum rent a property owner may charge for the unit. Any rental housing produced with NSP funds will follow HOME rent
limits for the entire affordability period based on the NSP lien recorded for that property. Rental units produced to meet the set-aside
requirements for households at or below 50% AMI must use the Low HOME rent limits. For housing units not subject to the 50% AMI set-aside
requirements, the fair market rent or High HOME rent limits, whichever is higher, will act as the maximum rent allowable unless other
provisions are noted in the NSP lien document recorded for the property.

Housing Rehabilitation/New Construction Standards:
The City of Elkhart has adopted the following building codes for residential properties in the City&rsquos jurisdiction.
Indiana Residential Code, 2005 Edition. (This includes Structural, Plumbing and Mechanical Rules) 2003 International Residential Code for
One- and Two-Family Dwellings, fifth printing, and Chapter 43 of the 2006 International Residential Code for One- and Two-Family Dwellings,
first printing, published by the International Code Council, 5203 Leesburg Pike, Suite 708, Falls Church, Virginia 22041-3401, as amended by
the State of Indiana.
Indiana Electrical Code, 2005 Edition. National Electrical Code, 2005 edition, first printing, and errata to the first printing, as amended by the
State of Indiana.
Indiana Visitability Rule (Accessibility for One- and Two-Family Dwellings) This rule applies only to the design and construction of one (1) or
more visitability features in one-(1) and two-(2) family dwellings and Class 1 townhouses. In accordance with IC 22-13-4-7(g), the provisions of
this rule are not mandatory unless a person contracts with a designer or a builder for construction of a visitability feature adopted in this rule in
the new construction of a dwelling, in which case the designer and builder shall comply with the standards adopted in this rule for the design
and construction of the visitability feature.
Projects on three or more dwellings as well as all commercial projects are governed by:
Indiana Building Code, 2008 Edition. International Building Code, 2006 Edition, first printing, as amended.
Indiana Plumbing Code, 1999 Edition. Uniform Plumbing Code, 1997 Edition, as amended
Indiana Mechanical Code, 2008 Edition. International Mechanical Code, 2006 Edition, first printing, as amended
Indiana Fuel Gas Code, 2008 Edition. International Fuel Gas Code, 2006 Edition, first printing, as amended
Indiana Fire Code, 2008 Edition. International Fire Code, 2006 Edition, first printing, as amended
Indiana Electrical Code, 2005 Edition. National Electrical Code, 2005 edition, first printing, and errata to the first printing, as amended by the
State of Indiana.
All properties renovated with the NSP funds will be brought into compliance with the applicable residential codes for existing home
rehabilitation in addition to the following HUD required standards:

• All gut rehabilitation or new construction (i.e., general replacement of the interior of a building that may or may not include changes to
structural elements such as flooring systems, columns or load-bearing interior or exterior walls) of residential buildings up to three stories must
be designed to meet the standard for Energy Star Qualified New Homes.
• All gut rehabilitation or new construction of mid- or high-rise multifamily housing must be designed to meet American Society of
Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Standard 90.1-2004, Appendix G plus 20 percent (which is the Energy Star
standard for multifamily buildings piloted by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy).
• Other rehabilitation must meet these standards to the extent applicable to the rehabilitation work undertaken; e.g., replace older
obsolete products and appliances (such as windows, doors, lighting, hot water heaters, furnaces, boilers, air conditioning units, refrigerators,
clothes washers and dishwashers) with Energy Star-46 labeled products.
• Water efficient toilets, showers, and faucets, such as those with the WaterSense label, must be installed.

Vicinity Hiring:
The City of Elkhart is committed to implementing the vicinity hiring preference in its NSP3 activities. The City of Elkhart has a Section 3 plan
that currently requires that all job announcements for contractors with CDBG or NSP contracts must be posted with the Elkhart Housing
Authority and the Work Force Development Office. These offices are within the area of greatest need. City staff will also review existing
CDBG-approved contractors to determine if any are located within the area of greatest need. Staff will also review the local phone book for
contractors located within the area of greatest need. These contractors will be notified that they will be eligible for the NSP3 vicinity hiring
preference with all NSP3 contracts. City staff will participate in the webinar scheduled to provide guidance on the vicinity hiring preference on
March 3, 2011.

Procedures for Preferences for Affordable Rental Dev.:
This is the City of Elkhart&rsquos preference for development of affordable rental housing with NSP3. The housing market in Elkhart has been
negatively impacted by the extreme economic down turn the area has experienced. According to CHAS data used in the housing needs
assessment conducted for the 2010-2015 Consolidated Plan, the City of Elkhart had 810 vacant homes for sale and 1,315 vacant units for
rent. The data from the US Census for 2005-2009 American Community Survey indicates that the vacancy rate for homeowner units is only
4.5% while it is 14.2% for rental units.
Given high vacancy rates, specifically in rental units, the project will provide for development of rental units that are owned by local not-forprofits and will focus those units on persons with special needs such as persons who are homeless, disabled, veterans, or victims of domestic
violence. By providing rental housing for special needs populations, the City can meet the goal of the NSP3 program to develop affordable
5
Community Development Systems
Disaster Recovery Grant Reporting System (DRGR)

rental housing in a manner that addresses the high vacancy rates in rental housing units.
City staff will work closely with local not-for-profit agencies to identify housing units that would meet the needs of the agencies and their clients
that also meet NSP3 requirements of vacant, abandoned, or foreclosed upon. Identifying properties that meet the location, unit size and
number, accessibilty needs, and low costs of operations of the agency and clients is critical to finding a local partner to acquire and manage
the rental units after the units are rehabiltated with NSP3 funds.
It is expected that funds used for this activity will be used to meet the low-income housing requirement for those below 50% of area median
income (AMI). The City will work with local partner housing and social service agencies to find tenants who are income qualified and in need of
affordable housing opportunities in our city, paying special attention to persons at or below 50% AMI.

Summary of Distribution and Uses of NSP Funds:
The City of Elkhart utilized the HUD NSP3 mapping tool as well as the needs data provided by HUD to determine a general area of need for
the community. This information was then compared with the existing NSP1 area and the Neighborhood Revitalization Strategy Area as well
as a list of tax delinquent properties available from Elkhart County to narrow the area of need down to a smaller area. This area was then
mapped and determined to be the area of greatest need for the NSP3 program.
The first phase of this evaluation was to use the NSP3 needs data. The City of Elkhart has 82 Census Block Groups (CBG) in this data set.
Each of those CBGs had an NSP3 needs score of 18 or greater. This indicated that any of the CBGs in Elkhart would meet the minimum
requirement of an NSP3 needs score of 17. Several of the CDBs had fewer than 3 households so those were removed from the evaluation
because the area was not considered to be residential in nature. This process left 60 CBGs to be reviewed for percent of households that are
51% or greater low-mod-medium income level. Of those 60 CBGs, 54 met that criterion. This provided the largest potential area for the NSP3
program. This area was then compared to two defined areas of need in the community, the NSP1 area and the CDBG Neighborhood
Revitalization Strategy Area.
The data for these CBGs was then reviewed for vacancy rates (COMBINED VAC), agreement numbers (HMDA), high cost agreements (HCRATES), seriously delinquent agreements (SDQ-RATES), number of foreclosure starts (STARTS), completed foreclosures (REO), and
number of projects to make an impact (IMPACT).
From this data it was determined that each block group is eligible under NSP3 by having a Needs Score of 17 or more. When the additional
data points are reviewed it becomes clear that each CGB has some characteristic that makes it relatively higher or lower in need based on
that data point. This data is useful in providing an overview of a large eligible area but does not provide a clear picture of a reasonably-sized
area of greatest need.
The City of Elkhart is a recipient of NSP1 funds as well as an entitlement community for CDBG funds. The NSP1 area is very similar to the
existing NRSA for the City of Elkhart. This area has been shown over time and through the NSP1 and the CDBG Consolidated Plan planning
processes to be the area in the community that has the greatest needs. The decision to focus NSP3 efforts in the same general areas as
these existing redevelopment efforts was in great part due to a desire by the City to provide comprehensive redevelopment of an area already
determined to be in the greatest need in our community.
NRSA Census Block Group Data plus CBG 22.5
Elkhart County’s list of tax delinquent properties that did not sell in the October 2010 tax sale contained one hundred four parcels. The City
and County worked together in 2010 to transfer tax-delinquent properties that had not sold at one or more tax sales to the City of Elkhart
Redevelopment Commission for use in the NSP1 program. The intent for NSP3 is to continue with this model for several reasons, including
but not limited to the following:
1. The tax-foreclosure process makes these properties eligible for acquisition under the NSP3 rules.
2. These properties can be acquired with clean title through the tax-foreclosure process.
3. Tax-delinquent properties that are not redeemed by owners or purchased at the tax sale are generally
less marketable and least likely to be redeveloped by the private sector as proven by the lack of interest
in keeping or obtaining ownership.
4. These properties are generally in very poor condition due to the lack of interest or financial capacity of
the owner and create a blighting influence on the neighborhood.
5. These properties can be acquired at a very low cost, allowing the NSP3 project to impact more
properties.
When the list of tax sale parcels was mapped in relation to the existing NSP1 and NRSA boundaries, 83 of the 104 parcels were inside those
boundaries furthering the argument that this is the area of greatest need. That said, this area was deemed to be too large to serve as the
NSP3 area. For this reason NSP1- and CDBG-funded projects were mapped as well to determine if a cluster of projects would be found. This
mapping process provided a basis for the NSP3 mapping area defined in the NSP3 mapping

This map provides locations of NSP1 projects and projects funded with CDBG since 2008 in brown. The green markers indicate the location
of the 104 tax delinquent parcels. The red outline is the current NRSA. As noted, many of the tax delinquent properties fall within the existing
NRSA. To finalize the NSP3 area of greatest need, the City decided to extend the designated central area of the NRSA an additional three
blocks south of the current southern boundary to take advantage of a cluster of eligible tax delinquent properties that lay just outside the
existing NRSA boundaries.

How Fund Use Addresses Market Conditions:
Housing Type & Quality Analysis
Housing professionals are most often concerned about the provision of affordable housing to low, moderate and middle-income individuals
and families. In order to be considered of these income, a family’s income must be at or below 120 percent of the Area Median Income (AMI)
for their particular family size. Low income is considered to be 50 percent of the AMI, and very low income is considered to be at 30 percent of
the AMI. Income limits based on these percentages are used to determine eligibility for various assistance programs.
The City of Elkhart has more than 23,000 housing units (owner and rental). Of these units, 87 percent are occupied and 13 percent are vacant.
The homeowner vacancy rate is more than 5 percent; the rental vacancy rate is just over 8 percent. Fifty-four percent of Elkhart’s housing
units are owneroccupied and 46 percent are renter occupied. (Source: American Community Survey, 2006-2008)
Owner-Occupied Units
Recent changes in the local and national economies and, in particular, the housing market have had profound effects on Elkhart’s housing
values, housing stock, and housing conditions. Increases in the City’s and region’s unemployment rates, from the County’s 5.3 percent
unemployment rate in January 2008 to an unemployment high of 18.8 percent in March 2009 to the current 15.6 percent in January 2010 have
increasd the number of housing units listed for sale, decreased the number of units sold, and decreased the sale price to list price ratio.
It is anticipated that the Michiana real estate market will remain sluggish as the outcomes in financial markets and the regional economy (in
particular the recreational vehicle and manufactured housing industries) remain uncertain. Elkhart will likely continue to face weak housing
markets because of the weak demand, growing inventories of existing homes, and tougher credit markets.
The 2004 Housing Needs Assessment found that there was a "booming housing market" for middle- and upper-middle-income homes, while
the low- to moderate-income housing market had not kept pace. Additionally, it was determined that the housing stock available to low- and
moderate-income residents was deteriorating due to inadequacies in public policy and insufficient maintenance resources.
Housing values, as a whole, have decreased throughout Elkhart, the State of Indiana, the Midwest, and many other locations throughout the
United States. The decrease in values has increased the number of housing units considered "affordable." The City has not increased its
affordable housing inventory; the market has devalued the existing housing inventory (through an oversupply of units and lower demands).
Thus, the choice of housing units, at all price points, has increased for employed potential homeowners who qualify for a mortgage and have a
sufficient down payment.
Renter-Occupied Units
In 2008, 46 percent of Elkhart’s housing units were renter occupied (Source: American Community Survey). According to forecasts by ESRI, in
2014, it is anticipated that the percentage of renter-occupied units will decrease to 38 percent. It is important to note that rental unit vacancies
increased from just over eight percent to 13 percent between 2000 and 2008 respectivattributed to the sluggish economy, along with
increased property taxes (re-assessments in the mid-2000s), higher insurance premiums, increased utility bills, and an increased number of
rental properties for sale and in foreclosure.
The 2008 median rent was $627 per month. The Elkhart-Goshen MSA 2009 Fair Market Rent (FMR) is $731 per month for a two-bedroom
unit, which is greater than the Indiana FMR of $697 per month. (Source: National Low Income Housing Coalition, 2009) Nearly 68 percent of
Elkhart’s rental housing stock rents for less than the FMR. However, 42 percent of renters are unable to afford FMR. (Source: American
Community Survey, 2006-2008) The maximum affordable monthly housing cost for a family of four at 30 percent of the AMI is $444 per month.
The basic unit of housing consumption is the household. Housing demand can be assessed by examining various demographic characteristics
relating to the number and composition of households within a community. These primary characteristics are:
,
,
• Population
,
• Number of Households
,
• Persons per Household
,
• Age of the Population
,
• Income Levels
,
,
Housing demand is also influenced by individual household choices relative to housing type, location, and cost. Furthermore, households
make individual decisions concerning what they are willing and able to pay for housing. Vacancy rates are an important housing indicator
because they often reflect the degree of housing choices available. A high vacancy rate usually suggests a high degree of choice, while a low
vacancy rate is often indicative of a relatively low degree of choice and higher housing costs.

Currently, the general Elkhart housing supply exceeds the general demand. The table below illustrates the housing supply product as an
index of housing availability, in particular for potential homeowners. When calculating the housing supply product for the overall Elkhart
population, there is an inventory of housing units, both rental and owner occupied, available (more than 23,000) for more than 20,000
households. These calculations are based on ESRI’s population projections for 2009.
Households earning up to 120 percent of the AMI, $$71,150 or less for a family of four, have sufficient choice in housing options as well.
Available housing units were determined by multiplying an annual household income by three to determine house purchase price. In the case
of a 120 percent AMI household, the maximum purchase price, or value, is $213,120. There are an estimated 23,000 units with a value of less
than $213,120. It is important to note that this calculation of total units includes all housing units, both owner occupied and rental. This
indicates that all rental units and all but approximately 700 of the for sale units would be affordable to this income groups. This reflects the
decrease in housing values that has occurred in the last two years, coupled with an increase of supply obtained through new construction and
annexation.
Households earning 80 percent of the AMI, $47,360 or less for a family of four, have sufficient choice in housing options as well. Available
housing units were determined by multiplying an annual household income by three to determine house purchase price. In the case of an 80
percent AMI household, the maximum purchase price, or value, is $142, 080. There are an estimated 22,073 units with a value of less than
$142,080. This is more than double the number of units at this price point in 2000. It is important to note that this calculation of total units
includes all housing units, both owner occupied and rental. This reflects the decrease in housing values that has occurred in the last two
years, coupled with an increase of supply obtained through new construction and annexation.
Housing options for low- and very-low-income residents are limited by affordability and availability. The housing supply product for households
earning 50 percent of the AMI, $29,600 or less for a family of four, is lower than the demand. It is estimated that there are approximately 5,500
housing units with a purchase price/value of $88,800 or less for more than 7,000 households in this income category. There is an inadequate
supply of housing for households considered low- and very-low-income, and it can be surmised that the quality and location of the available
affordable units are also inadequate.

The City of Elkhart will enforce rent and occupancy requirements through a recorded agreement. This agreement will contain all programmatic
conditions and will be signed at the property closing. The agreement will then be recorded with the Elkhart County Recorder’s Office. The
property owner will be expected to provide proof of income-qualified tenants at the initial time of occupancy of the entire term of the
affordability period.
It is important to note that, if the assistance for this project was made to meet the set-aside requirement to serve persons at or below 50%
AMI, all subsequent tenants must meet the same income standards of 50% AMI at initial occupancy during the term of the affordability period.
The agreement will be released upon completion of the affordability period. If the property would transfer ownership within the affordability
period, the new owner would assume the agreement and all programmatic conditions involved.
For Homebuyer Activities the following chart provides affordability period requirements.

The City of Elkhart will enforce the affordability period through a recorded agreement. This agreement will refer to a note containing all
programmatic conditions and will be signed at the property closing. The agreement will then be recorded with the Elkhart County Recorder’s
Office. The agreement will be released upon completion of the affordability period. If the property would transfer ownership within the
affordability period, the new owner would assume the agreement and all programmatic conditions involved.
It is important to note, that if the sale is made to persons at or below 50% AMI and that sale was used to meet the minimum investment for
persons at or below 50%AMI, the subsequent sale during the affordability period would have to be to a person at or below 50% AMI to meet
the regulatory requirement of the NSP program.
If an income-qualified homebuyer cannot be identified by the owner, assistance from local partners, including but not limited to, La Casa Inc.,
Habitat for Humanity, and other local housing agencies will be utilized to find an income eligible homebuyer.

Definition of Blighted Structure:
The term "blighted structure" is not defined in any City of Elkhart ordinance nor is it defined in the State of Indiana Unsafe Building Law or in
the 2006 International Property Maintenance Code that has been adopted by the City of Elkhart. For this reason the City of Elkhart will
consider "blighted structure" to be equivalent to the term "unsafe building" as defined in the State of Indiana Unsafe Building Law:
IC 36-7-9-4 Unsafe buildings and unsafe premises described:
Sec. 4. (a) For purposes of this chapter, a building or structure, or any part of a building or structure, that is:
(1) in an impaired structural condition that makes it unsafe to a person or property;
(2) a fire hazard;
(3) a hazard to the public health;
(4) a public nuisance;
(5) dangerous to a person or property because of a violation of a statute or ordinance concerning building condition or

4
Community Development Systems
Disaster Recovery Grant Reporting System (DRGR)

maintenance; or
(6) vacant and not maintained in a manner that would allow human habitation, occupancy, or use under the requirements of a statute or
an ordinance; is considered an unsafe building.
(b) For purposes of this chapter:
(1) an unsafe building; and
(2) the tract of real property on which the unsafe building is located; are considered unsafe premises.
(c) For purposes of this chapter, a tract of real property that does not contain a building or structure, not including land used for production
agriculture, is considered an unsafe premises if the tract of real property is:
(1) a fire hazard;
(2) a hazard to public health;
(3) a public nuisance; or
(4) dangerous to a person or property because of a violation of a statute or an ordinance.
As added by Acts 1981, P.L.309, SEC.28. Amended by P.L.14-1991, SEC.9; P.L.66-2005, SEC.1.

Definition of Affordable Rents:
C. Definitions and Description
The following definition of affordable rent is to replace the former definition provided in the NSP plan.
(2) Definition of "affordable rents."
Note: Grantees may use the definition they have adopted for their CDBG program but should review their existing definition to ensure
compliance with NSP program –specific requirements such as continued affordability.
(2) Definition of “affordable rents.”
Response:
“Affordable Rents” is defined as the rentlimits provided by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) annually. This rent
limit is designed to ensure that units built using program funds are affordable to low- and very low-income households. The rent limit for a
given unit is the maximum rent a property owner may charge a tenant for the unit. Any rental housing produced with NSP funds will follow
HOME rent limits for the entire affordability period based on the NSP lien recorded for that property. For housing units not subject to the 50%
AMI set-aside requirements or where the tenant occupying a 50% AMI set-aside unit is a participant in a rent subsidy program, the fair market
rent or High HOME rent limits, which ever is higher, will act as the maximum rent allowable. Rental units produced to meet the set-aside
requirements for households at or below 50% AMI must use the Low HOME rent limits when the tenant is not a participant in a rent subsidy
program and is responsible for paying their entire rent obligation.

Housing Rehabilitation/New Construction Standards:

All properties renovated with the NSP funds will be brought into compliance with the applicable residential codes for existing home
rehabilitation in addition to the following HUD required standards:
,
,
,
• All gut rehabilitation or new construction (i.e., general replacement of the interior of a building that may or may not include changes to
structural elements such as flooring systems, columns or load-bearing interior or exterior walls) of residential buildings up to three stories must
be designed to meet the standard for Energy Star Qualified New Homes.
,
• All gut rehabilitation or new construction of mid- or high-rise multifamily housing must be designed to meet American Society of
Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Standard 90.1-2004, Appendix G plus 20 percent (which is the Energy Star
standard for multifamily buildings piloted by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department
5
Community Development Systems
Disaster Recovery Grant Reporting System (DRGR)

of Energy).
,
• Other rehabilitation must meet these standards to the extent applicable to the rehabilitation work undertaken; e.g., replace older
obsolete products and appliances (such as windows, doors, lighting, hot water heaters, furnaces, boilers, air conditioning units, refrigerators,
clothes washers and dishwashers) with Energy Star-46 labeled products.
,
• Water efficient toilets, showers, and faucets, such as those with the WaterSense label, must be installed.
,
,

Vicinity Hiring:
The City of Elkhart is committed to implementing the vicinity hiring preference in its NSP3 activities. The City of Elkhart has a Section 3 plan
that currently requires that all job announcements for contractors with CDBG or NSP contracts must be posted with the Elkhart Housing
Authority and the Work Force Development Office. These offices are within the area of greatest need. City staff will also review existing
CDBG-approved contractors to determine if any are located within the area of greatest need. Staff will also review the local phone book for
contractors located within the area of greatest need. These contractors will be notified that they will be eligible for the NSP3 vicinity hiring
preference with all NSP3 contracts. City staff will participate in the webinar scheduled to provide guidance on the vicinity hiring preference on
March 3, 2011.

Procedures for Preferences for Affordable Rental Dev.:
This is the City of Elkhart’s preference for development of affordable rental housing with NSP3. The housing market in Elkhart has been
negatively impacted by the extreme economic down turn the area has experienced. According to CHAS data used in the housing needs
assessment conducted for the 2010-2015 Consolidated Plan, the City of Elkhart had 810 vacant homes for sale and 1,315 vacant units for
rent. The data from the US Census for 2005-2009 American Community Survey indicates that the vacancy rate for homeowner units is only
4.5% while it is 14.2% for rental units.
Given high vacancy rates, specifically in rental units, the project will provide for development of rental units that are owned by local not-forprofits and will focus those units on persons with special needs such as persons who are homeless, disabled, veterans, or victims of domestic
violence. By providing rental housing for special needs populations, the City can meet the goal of the NSP3 program to develop affordable
rental housing in a manner that addresses the high vacancy rates in rental housing units.
City staff will work closely with local not-for-profit agencies to identify housing units that would meet the needs of the agencies and their clients
that also meet NSP3 requirements of vacant, abandoned, or foreclosed upon. Identifying properties that meet the location, unit size and
number, accessibilty needs, and low costs of operations of the agency and clients is critical to finding a local partner to acquire and manage
the rental units after the units are rehabiltated with NSP3 funds.
It is expected that funds used for this activity will be used to meet the low-income housing requirement for those below 50% of area median
income (AMI). The City will work with local partner housing and social service agencies to find tenants who are income qualified and in need of
affordable housing opportunities in our city, paying special attention to persons at or below 50% AMI.

Overall Progress Narrative:
The six unit apartment building at 209 N. 2nd St. is completly filled with Section 8 clients. Rent/Program Income
received this quarter was $511.37. Paperwork delays with the Housing Authority caused the delay in some of the
rent being collected. This has been resolved and will be received next quarter. Renovation of 1033 Hubbard Ave. is
very near completion and will be on the market for sale next quarter. Maintenance on the land banked properties
continues.

Summary of Distribution and Uses of NSP Funds:
The City of Elkhart utilized the HUD NSP3 mapping tool as well as the needs data provided by HUD to determine a general area of need for
the community. This information was then compared with the existing NSP1 area and the Neighborhood Revitalization Strategy Area as well
as a list of tax delinquent properties available from Elkhart County to narrow the area of need down to a smaller area. This area was then
mapped and determined to be the area of greatest need for the NSP3 program.
The first phase of this evaluation was to use the NSP3 needs data. The City of Elkhart has 82 Census Block Groups (CBG) in this data set.
Each of those CBGs had an NSP3 needs score of 18 or greater. This indicated that any of the CBGs in Elkhart would meet the minimum
requirement of an NSP3 needs score of 17. Several of the CDBs had fewer than 3 households so those were removed from the evaluation
because the area was not considered to be residential in nature. This process left 60 CBGs to be reviewed for percent of households that are
51% or greater low-mod-medium income level. Of those 60 CBGs, 54 met that criterion. This provided the largest potential area for the NSP3
program. This area was then compared to two defined areas of need in the community, the NSP1 area and the CDBG Neighborhood
Revitalization Strategy Area.
The data for these CBGs was then reviewed for vacancy rates (COMBINED VAC), agreement numbers (HMDA), high cost agreements (HCRATES), seriously delinquent agreements (SDQ-RATES), number of foreclosure starts (STARTS), completed foreclosures (REO), and
number of projects to make an impact (IMPACT).
From this data it was determined that each block group is eligible under NSP3 by having a Needs Score of 17 or more. When the additional
data points are reviewed it becomes clear that each CGB has some characteristic that makes it relatively higher or lower in need based on
that data point. This data is useful in providing an overview of a large eligible area but does not provide a clear picture of a reasonably-sized
area of greatest need.
The City of Elkhart is a recipient of NSP1 funds as well as an entitlement community for CDBG funds. The NSP1 area is very similar to the
existing NRSA for the City of Elkhart. This area has been shown over time and through the NSP1 and the CDBG Consolidated Plan planning
processes to be the area in the community that has the greatest needs. The decision to focus NSP3 efforts in the same general areas as
these existing redevelopment efforts was in great part due to a desire by the City to provide comprehensive redevelopment of an area already
determined to be in the greatest need in our community.
NRSA Census Block Group Data plus CBG 22.5
Elkhart County&rsquos list of tax delinquent properties that did not sell in the October 2010 tax sale contained one hundred four parcels. The
City and County worked together in 2010 to transfer tax-delinquent properties that had not sold at one or more tax sales to the City of Elkhart
Redevelopment Commission for use in the NSP1 program. The intent for NSP3 is to continue with this model for several reasons, including
but not limited to the following:
> 1. The tax-foreclosure process makes these properties eligible for acquisition under the NSP3 rules.
> 2. These properties can be acquired with clean title through the tax-foreclosure process.
> 3. Tax-delinquent properties that are not redeemed by owners or purchased at the tax sale are generally
>
less marketable and least likely to be redeveloped by the private sector as proven by the lack of interest
>
in keeping or obtaining ownership.
> 4. These properties are generally in very poor condition due to the lack of interest or financial capacity of
>
the owner and create a blighting influence on the neighborhood.
> 5. These properties can be acquired at a very low cost, allowing the NSP3 project to impact more
>
properties.
>When the list of tax sale parcels was mapped in relation to the existing NSP1 and NRSA boundaries, 83 of the 104 parcels were inside those
boundaries furthering the argument that this is the area of greatest need. That said, this area was deemed to be too large to serve as the
NSP3 area. For this reason NSP1- and CDBG-funded projects were mapped as well to determine if a cluster of projects would be found. This

mapping process provided a basis for the NSP3 mapping area defined in the NSP3 mapping tool.
This map provides locations of NSP1 projects and projects funded with CDBG since 2008 in brown. The green markers indicate the location
of the 104 tax delinquent parcels. The red outline is the current NRSA. As noted, many of the tax delinquent properties fall within the existing
NRSA. To finalize the NSP3 area of greatest need, the City decided to extend the designated central area of the NRSA an additional three
blocks south of the current southern boundary to take advantage of a cluster of eligible tax delinquent properties that lay just outside the
existing NRSA boundaries.

How Fund Use Addresses Market Conditions:
Housing Type & Quality Analysis
Housing professionals are most often concerned about the provision of affordable housing to low, moderate and middle-income individuals
and families. In order to be considered of these income, a family&rsquos income must be at or below 120 percent of the Area Median Income
(AMI) for their particular family size. Low income is considered to be 50 percent of the AMI, and very low income is considered to be at 30
percent of the AMI. Income limits based on these percentages are used to determine eligibility for various assistance programs.
The City of Elkhart has more than 23,000 housing units (owner and rental). Of these units, 87 percent are occupied and 13 percent are vacant.
The homeowner vacancy rate is more than 5 percent; the rental vacancy rate is just over 8 percent. Fifty-four percent of Elkhart&rsquos
housing units are owneroccupied and 46 percent are renter occupied. (Source: American Community Survey, 2006-2008)
Owner-Occupied Units
Recent changes in the local and national economies and, in particular, the housing market have had profound effects on Elkhart&rsquos
housing values, housing stock, and housing conditions. Increases in the City&rsquos and region&rsquos unemployment rates, from the
County&rsquos 5.3 percent unemployment rate in January 2008 to an unemployment high of 18.8 percent in March 2009 to the current 15.6
percent in January 2010 have increasd the number of housing units listed for sale, decreased the number of units sold, and decreased the
sale price to list price ratio.
It is anticipated that the Michiana real estate market will remain sluggish as the outcomes in financial markets and the regional economy (in
particular the recreational vehicle and manufactured housing industries) remain uncertain. Elkhart will likely continue to face weak housing
markets because of the weak demand, growing inventories of existing homes, and tougher credit markets.
The 2004 Housing Needs Assessment found that there was a "booming housing market" for middle- and upper-middle-income homes, while
the low- to moderate-income housing market had not kept pace. Additionally, it was determined that the housing stock available to low- and
moderate-income residents was deteriorating due to inadequacies in public policy and insufficient maintenance resources.
Housing values, as a whole, have decreased throughout Elkhart, the State of Indiana, the Midwest, and many other locations throughout the
United States. The decrease in values has increased the number of housing units considered "affordable." The City has not increased its
affordable housing inventory; the market has devalued the existing housing inventory (through an oversupply of units and lower demands).
Thus, the choice of housing units, at all price points, has increased for employed potential homeowners who qualify for a mortgage and have a
sufficient down payment.
Renter-Occupied Units
In 2008, 46 percent of Elkhart&rsquos housing units were renter occupied (Source: American Community Survey). According to forecasts by
ESRI, in 2014, it is anticipated that the percentage of renter-occupied units will decrease to 38 percent. It is important to note that rental unit
vacancies increased from just over eight percent to 13 percent between 2000 and 2008 respectivly. The attributed to the sluggish economy,
along with increased property taxes (re-assessments in the mid-2000s), higher insurance premiums, increased utility bills, and an increased
number of rental properties for sale and in foreclosure.
The 2008 median rent was $627 per month. The Elkhart-Goshen MSA 2009 Fair Market Rent (FMR) is $731 per month for a two-bedroom
unit, which is greater than the Indiana FMR of $697 per month. (Source: National Low Income Housing Coalition, 2009) Nearly 68 percent of
Elkhart&rsquos rental housing stock rents for less than the FMR. However, 42 percent of renters are unable to afford FMR. (Source: American
Community Survey, 2006-2008) The maximum affordable monthly housing cost for a family of four at 30 percent of the AMI is $444 per month.
The basic unit of housing consumption is the household. Housing demand can be assessed by examining various demographic characteristics
relating to the number and composition of households within a community. These primary characteristics are:
• Population
• Number of Households
• Persons per Household
• Age of the Population
• Income Levels
Housing demand is also influenced by individual household choices relative to housing type, location, and cost. Furthermore, households
make individual decisions concerning what they are willing and able to pay for housing. Vacancy rates are an important housing indicator
because they often reflect the degree of housing choices available. A high vacancy rate usually suggests a high degree of choice, while a low
vacancy rate is often indicative of a relatively low degree of choice and higher housing costs.
Currently, the general Elkhart housing supply exceeds the general demand. The table below illustrates the housing supply product as an
index of housing availability, in particular for potential homeowners. When calculating the housing supply product for the overall Elkhart
population, there is an inventory of housing units, both rental and owner occupied, available (more than 23,000) for more than 20,000
households. These calculations are based on ESRI&rsquos population projections for 2009.
Households earning up to 120 percent of the AMI, $$71,150 or less for a family of four, have sufficient choice in housing options as well.
Available housing units were determined by multiplying an annual household income by three to determine house purchase price. In the case
of a 120 percent AMI household, the maximum purchase price, or value, is $213,120. There are an estimated 23,000 units with a value of less
than $213,120. It is important to note that this calculation of total units includes all housing units, both owner occupied and rental. This
indicates that all rental units and all but approximately 700 of the for sale units would be affordable to this income groups. This reflects the
decrease in housing values that has occurred in the last two years, coupled with an increase of supply obtained through new construction and
annexation.
Households earning 80 percent of the AMI, $47,360 or less for a family of four, have sufficient choice in housing options as well. Available

3
Community Development Systems

housing units were determined by multiplying an annual household income by three to determine house purchase price. In the case of an 80
percent AMI household, the maximum purchase price, or value, is $142, 080. There are an estimated 22,073 units with a value of less than
$142,080. This is more than double the number of units at this price point in 2000. It is important to note that this calculation of total units
includes all housing units, both owner occupied and rental. This reflects the decrease in housing values that has occurred in the last two
years, coupled with an increase of supply obtained through new construction and annexation.
Housing options for low- and very-low-income residents are limited by affordability and availability. The housing supply product for households
earning 50 percent of the AMI, $29,600 or less for a family of four, is lower than the demand. It is estimated that there are approximately 5,500
housing units with a purchase price/value of $88,800 or less for more than 7,000 households in this income category. There is an inadequate
supply of housing for households considered low- and very-low-income, and it can be surmised that the quality and location of the available
affordable units are also inadequate.

The City of Elkhart will enforce rent and occupancy requirements through a recorded agreement. This agreement will contain all programmatic
conditions and will be signed at the property closing. The agreement will then be recorded with the Elkhart County Recorder&rsquos Office.
The property owner will be expected to provide proof of income-qualified tenants at the initial time of occupancy of the entire term of the
affordability period.
It is important to note that, if the assistance for this project was made to meet the set-aside requirement to serve persons at or below 50%
AMI, all subsequent tenants must meet the same income standards of 50% AMI at initial occupancy during the term of the affordability period.
The agreement will be released upon completion of the affordability period. If the property would transfer ownership within the affordability
period, the new owner would assume the agreement and all programmatic conditions involved.
For Homebuyer Activities the following chart provides affordability period requirements.

The City of Elkhart will enforce the affordability period through a recorded agreement. This agreement will refer to a note containing all
programmatic conditions and will be signed at the property closing. The agreement will then be recorded with the Elkhart County
Recorder&rsquos Office. The agreement will be released upon completion of the affordability period. If the property would transfer ownership
within the affordability period, the new owner would assume the agreement and all programmatic conditions involved.
It is important to note, that if the sale is made to persons at or below 50% AMI and that sale was used to meet the minimum investment for
persons at or below 50%AMI, the subsequent sale during the affordability period would have to be to a person at or below 50% AMI to meet
the regulatory requirement of the NSP program.
If an income-qualified homebuyer cannot be identified by the owner, assistance from local partners, including but not limited to, La Casa Inc.,
Habitat for Humanity, and other local housing agencies will be utilized to find an income eligible homebuyer.

Definition of Blighted Structure:
The term "blighted structure" is not defined in any City of Elkhart ordinance nor is it defined in the State of Indiana Unsafe Building Law or in
the 2006 International Property Maintenance Code that has been adopted by the City of Elkhart. For this reason the City of Elkhart will
consider "blighted structure" to be equivalent to the term "unsafe building" as defined in the State of Indiana Unsafe Building Law:
IC 36-7-9-4 Unsafe buildings and unsafe premises described:
Sec. 4. (a) For purposes of this chapter, a building or structure, or any part of a building or structure, that is:
>
(1) in an impaired structural condition that makes it unsafe to a person or property;
>
(2) a fire hazard;
>
(3) a hazard to the public health;
(4) a public nuisance;
>
(5) dangerous to a person or property because of a violation of a statute or ordinance concerning building condition or maintenance; or
>
(6) vacant and not maintained in a manner that would allow human habitation, occupancy, or use under the requirements of a statute or
an ordinance; is considered an unsafe building.
> (b) For purposes of this chapter:
>
(1) an unsafe building; and
>
(2) the tract of real property on which the unsafe building is located; are considered unsafe premises.
> (c) For purposes of this chapter, a tract of real property that does not contain a building or structure, not including land used for production
agriculture, is considered an unsafe premises if the tract of real property is:
>
(1) a fire hazard;
>
(2) a hazard to public health;
>
(3) a public nuisance; or
>
(4) dangerous to a person or property because of a violation of a statute or an ordinance.
>As added by Acts 1981, P.L.309, SEC.28. Amended by P.L.14-1991, SEC.9; P.L.66-2005, SEC.1.

Definition of Affordable Rents:
C. Definitions and Description
The following definition of affordable rent is to replace the former definition provided in the NSP plan.
(2) Definition of "affordable rents."
Note: Grantees may use the definition they have adopted for their CDBG program but should review their existing definition to ensure
compliance with NSP program &ndashspecific requirements such as continued affordability.
Response:
"Affordable Rents" is defined as the rent limits provided by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) annually. This rent
limit is designed to ensure that units built using program funds are affordable to low- and very low-income households. The rent limit for a
given unit is the maximum rent a property owner may charge for the unit. Any rental housing produced with NSP funds will follow HOME rent
limits for the entire affordability period based on the NSP lien recorded for that property. Rental units produced to meet the set-aside
requirements for households at or below 50% AMI must use the Low HOME rent limits. For housing units not subject to the 50% AMI set-aside
requirements, the fair market rent or High HOME rent limits, whichever is higher, will act as the maximum rent allowable unless other
provisions are noted in the NSP lien document recorded for the property.

Housing Rehabilitation/New Construction Standards:
The City of Elkhart has adopted the following building codes for residential properties in the City&rsquos jurisdiction.
Indiana Residential Code, 2005 Edition. (This includes Structural, Plumbing and Mechanical Rules) 2003 International Residential Code for
One- and Two-Family Dwellings, fifth printing, and Chapter 43 of the 2006 International Residential Code for One- and Two-Family Dwellings,
first printing, published by the International Code Council, 5203 Leesburg Pike, Suite 708, Falls Church, Virginia 22041-3401, as amended by
the State of Indiana.
Indiana Electrical Code, 2005 Edition. National Electrical Code, 2005 edition, first printing, and errata to the first printing, as amended by the
State of Indiana.
Indiana Visitability Rule (Accessibility for One- and Two-Family Dwellings) This rule applies only to the design and construction of one (1) or
more visitability features in one-(1) and two-(2) family dwellings and Class 1 townhouses. In accordance with IC 22-13-4-7(g), the provisions of
this rule are not mandatory unless a person contracts with a designer or a builder for construction of a visitability feature adopted in this rule in
the new construction of a dwelling, in which case the designer and builder shall comply with the standards adopted in this rule for the design
and construction of the visitability feature.
Projects on three or more dwellings as well as all commercial projects are governed by:
Indiana Building Code, 2008 Edition. International Building Code, 2006 Edition, first printing, as amended.
Indiana Plumbing Code, 1999 Edition. Uniform Plumbing Code, 1997 Edition, as amended
Indiana Mechanical Code, 2008 Edition. International Mechanical Code, 2006 Edition, first printing, as amended
Indiana Fuel Gas Code, 2008 Edition. International Fuel Gas Code, 2006 Edition, first printing, as amended
Indiana Fire Code, 2008 Edition. International Fire Code, 2006 Edition, first printing, as amended
Indiana Electrical Code, 2005 Edition. National Electrical Code, 2005 edition, first printing, and errata to the first printing, as amended by the
State of Indiana.
All properties renovated with the NSP funds will be brought into compliance with the applicable residential codes for existing home
rehabilitation in addition to the following HUD required standards:

• All gut rehabilitation or new construction (i.e., general replacement of the interior of a building that may or may not include changes to
structural elements such as flooring systems, columns or load-bearing interior or exterior walls) of residential buildings up to three stories must
be designed to meet the standard for Energy Star Qualified New Homes.
• All gut rehabilitation or new construction of mid- or high-rise multifamily housing must be designed to meet American Society of
Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Standard 90.1-2004, Appendix G plus 20 percent (which is the Energy Star
standard for multifamily buildings piloted by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy).
• Other rehabilitation must meet these standards to the extent applicable to the rehabilitation work undertaken; e.g., replace older
obsolete products and appliances (such as windows, doors, lighting, hot water heaters, furnaces, boilers, air conditioning units, refrigerators,
clothes washers and dishwashers) with Energy Star-46 labeled products.
• Water efficient toilets, showers, and faucets, such as those with the WaterSense label, must be installed.

Vicinity Hiring:
The City of Elkhart is committed to implementing the vicinity hiring preference in its NSP3 activities. The City of Elkhart has a Section 3 plan
that currently requires that all job announcements for contractors with CDBG or NSP contracts must be posted with the Elkhart Housing
Authority and the Work Force Development Office. These offices are within the area of greatest need. City staff will also review existing
CDBG-approved contractors to determine if any are located within the area of greatest need. Staff will also review the local phone book for
contractors located within the area of greatest need. These contractors will be notified that they will be eligible for the NSP3 vicinity hiring
preference with all NSP3 contracts. City staff will participate in the webinar scheduled to provide guidance on the vicinity hiring preference on
March 3, 2011.

Procedures for Preferences for Affordable Rental Dev.:
This is the City of Elkhart&rsquos preference for development of affordable rental housing with NSP3. The housing market in Elkhart has been
negatively impacted by the extreme economic down turn the area has experienced. According to CHAS data used in the housing needs
assessment conducted for the 2010-2015 Consolidated Plan, the City of Elkhart had 810 vacant homes for sale and 1,315 vacant units for
rent. The data from the US Census for 2005-2009 American Community Survey indicates that the vacancy rate for homeowner units is only
4.5% while it is 14.2% for rental units.
Given high vacancy rates, specifically in rental units, the project will provide for development of rental units that are owned by local not-forprofits and will focus those units on persons with special needs such as persons who are homeless, disabled, veterans, or victims of domestic
violence. By providing rental housing for special needs populations, the City can meet the goal of the NSP3 program to develop affordable
5
Community Development Systems
Disaster Recovery Grant Reporting System (DRGR)

rental housing in a manner that addresses the high vacancy rates in rental housing units.
City staff will work closely with local not-for-profit agencies to identify housing units that would meet the needs of the agencies and their clients
that also meet NSP3 requirements of vacant, abandoned, or foreclosed upon. Identifying properties that meet the location, unit size and
number, accessibilty needs, and low costs of operations of the agency and clients is critical to finding a local partner to acquire and manage
the rental units after the units are rehabiltated with NSP3 funds.
It is expected that funds used for this activity will be used to meet the low-income housing requirement for those below 50% of area median
income (AMI). The City will work with local partner housing and social service agencies to find tenants who are income qualified and in need of
affordable housing opportunities in our city, paying special attention to persons at or below 50% AMI.

funds to pay for acquisition and rehab of rental properties for persons at or below 50% AMI

Location Description:

Activity Progress Narrative:
Funds from this activity have been used to finalize construction drawings and clean-out the units in preparation for the
construction phase of the project during the 1st quarter of 2013. This project is the largest single activity in the NSP3 plan due
to the importance of the property as a historically significantly home in Elkhart but also to provide quality, affordable rental units
in an area that has seen a decline. This investment of NSP3 funds has already spurred interest in an adjacent duplex.

Funds to pay for acquisition, maintenance, management, and disposition of Land Banked properties

Location Description:
NSP 3 Area

Activity Progress Narrative:
Funds for the Landbank have been spent for maintenance of properties as well as the acquisition of an additional ten
properties. These properties will be cleared if necessary and placed in the Landbank for future housing development
opportunities in the NSP3 area. The Landbank is a critical component of the City's NSP3 strategy due to the large number of
dilapidated structures and vacant land where dilapidated structures were removed. By utilizing the landbanking technique, the
City can help eliminate the negative impacts of neglected properties while investing in existing structures to stabilize the
neighborhood. As housing demand increases, these lots will provide the future development sites for our revitalized
neighborhoods.

Location Description:
NSP3 area

Activity Progress Narrative:
Funds have been used to demolish dilapidated homes in the NSP3 area. The final demolitions for this project are expected in
the first quarter of 2013. This project is important to the NSP3 project in that these buildings are having a negative impact on
the neighborhood. The removal of these blighting influences immediately has a positive impact on the area. These properties
are then placed in the NSP3 land bank to provide future housing opportunities in the area as the neighborhood is stabilized by
other community projects and reinvestment.

Narratives
Summary of Distribution and Uses of NSP Funds:
The City of Elkhart utilized the HUD NSP3 mapping tool as well as the needs data provided by HUD to determine a general area of need for
the community. This information was then compared with the existing NSP1 area and the Neighborhood Revitalization Strategy Area as well
as a list of tax delinquent properties available from Elkhart County to narrow the area of need down to a smaller area. This area was then
mapped and determined to be the area of greatest need for the NSP3 program.
The first phase of this evaluation was to use the NSP3 needs data. The City of Elkhart has 82 Census Block Groups (CBG) in this data set.
Each of those CBGs had an NSP3 needs score of 18 or greater. This indicated that any of the CBGs in Elkhart would meet the minimum
requirement of an NSP3 needs score of 17. Several of the CDBs had fewer than 3 households so those were removed from the evaluation
because the area was not considered to be residential in nature. This process left 60 CBGs to be reviewed for percent of households that are
51% or greater low-mod-medium income level. Of those 60 CBGs, 54 met that criterion. This provided the largest potential area for the NSP3
program. This area was then compared to two defined areas of need in the community, the NSP1 area and the CDBG Neighborhood
Revitalization Strategy Area.
The data for these CBGs was then reviewed for vacancy rates (COMBINED VAC), agreement numbers (HMDA), high cost agreements (HCRATES), seriously delinquent agreements (SDQ-RATES), number of foreclosure starts (STARTS), completed foreclosures (REO), and
number of projects to make an impact (IMPACT).
From this data it was determined that each block group is eligible under NSP3 by having a Needs Score of 17 or more. When the additional
data points are reviewed it becomes clear that each CGB has some characteristic that makes it relatively higher or lower in need based on
that data point. This data is useful in providing an overview of a large eligible area but does not provide a clear picture of a reasonably-sized
area of greatest need.
The City of Elkhart is a recipient of NSP1 funds as well as an entitlement community for CDBG funds. The NSP1 area is very similar to the
existing NRSA for the City of Elkhart. This area has been shown over time and through the NSP1 and the CDBG Consolidated Plan planning
processes to be the area in the community that has the greatest needs. The decision to focus NSP3 efforts in the same general areas as
these existing redevelopment efforts was in great part due to a desire by the City to provide comprehensive redevelopment of an area already
determined to be in the greatest need in our community.
NRSA Census Block Group Data plus CBG 22.5
Elkhart County&rsquos list of tax delinquent properties that did not sell in the October 2010 tax sale contained one hundred four parcels. The
City and County worked together in 2010 to transfer tax-delinquent properties that had not sold at one or more tax sales to the City of Elkhart
Redevelopment Commission for use in the NSP1 program. The intent for NSP3 is to continue with this model for several reasons, including
but not limited to the following:
> 1. The tax-foreclosure process makes these properties eligible for acquisition under the NSP3 rules.
> 2. These properties can be acquired with clean title through the tax-foreclosure process.
> 3. Tax-delinquent properties that are not redeemed by owners or purchased at the tax sale are generally
>
less marketable and least likely to be redeveloped by the private sector as proven by the lack of interest
>
in keeping or obtaining ownership.
> 4. These properties are generally in very poor condition due to the lack of interest or financial capacity of
>
the owner and create a blighting influence on the neighborhood.
> 5. These properties can be acquired at a very low cost, allowing the NSP3 project to impact more
>
properties.
>When the list of tax sale parcels was mapped in relation to the existing NSP1 and NRSA boundaries, 83 of the 104 parcels were inside those
boundaries furthering the argument that this is the area of greatest need. That said, this area was deemed to be too large to serve as the
NSP3 area. For this reason NSP1- and CDBG-funded projects were mapped as well to determine if a cluster of projects would be found. This

Community Development Systems

mapping process provided a basis for the NSP3 mapping area defined in the NSP3 mapping tool.
This map provides locations of NSP1 projects and projects funded with CDBG since 2008 in brown. The green markers indicate the location
of the 104 tax delinquent parcels. The red outline is the current NRSA. As noted, many of the tax delinquent properties fall within the existing
NRSA. To finalize the NSP3 area of greatest need, the City decided to extend the designated central area of the NRSA an additional three
blocks south of the current southern boundary to take advantage of a cluster of eligible tax delinquent properties that lay just outside the
existing NRSA boundaries.

How Fund Use Addresses Market Conditions:
Housing Type & Quality Analysis
Housing professionals are most often concerned about the provision of affordable housing to low, moderate and middle-income individuals
and families. In order to be considered of these income, a family&rsquos income must be at or below 120 percent of the Area Median Income
(AMI) for their particular family size. Low income is considered to be 50 percent of the AMI, and very low income is considered to be at 30
percent of the AMI. Income limits based on these percentages are used to determine eligibility for various assistance programs.
The City of Elkhart has more than 23,000 housing units (owner and rental). Of these units, 87 percent are occupied and 13 percent are vacant.
The homeowner vacancy rate is more than 5 percent; the rental vacancy rate is just over 8 percent. Fifty-four percent of Elkhart&rsquos
housing units are owneroccupied and 46 percent are renter occupied. (Source: American Community Survey, 2006-2008)
Owner-Occupied Units
Recent changes in the local and national economies and, in particular, the housing market have had profound effects on Elkhart&rsquos
housing values, housing stock, and housing conditions. Increases in the City&rsquos and region&rsquos unemployment rates, from the
County&rsquos 5.3 percent unemployment rate in January 2008 to an unemployment high of 18.8 percent in March 2009 to the current 15.6
percent in January 2010 have increasd the number of housing units listed for sale, decreased the number of units sold, and decreased the
sale price to list price ratio.
It is anticipated that the Michiana real estate market will remain sluggish as the outcomes in financial markets and the regional economy (in
particular the recreational vehicle and manufactured housing industries) remain uncertain. Elkhart will likely continue to face weak housing
markets because of the weak demand, growing inventories of existing homes, and tougher credit markets.
The 2004 Housing Needs Assessment found that there was a "booming housing market" for middle- and upper-middle-income homes, while
the low- to moderate-income housing market had not kept pace. Additionally, it was determined that the housing stock available to low- and
moderate-income residents was deteriorating due to inadequacies in public policy and insufficient maintenance resources.
Housing values, as a whole, have decreased throughout Elkhart, the State of Indiana, the Midwest, and many other locations throughout the
United States. The decrease in values has increased the number of housing units considered "affordable." The City has not increased its
affordable housing inventory; the market has devalued the existing housing inventory (through an oversupply of units and lower demands).
Thus, the choice of housing units, at all price points, has increased for employed potential homeowners who qualify for a mortgage and have a
sufficient down payment.
Renter-Occupied Units
In 2008, 46 percent of Elkhart&rsquos housing units were renter occupied (Source: American Community Survey). According to forecasts by
ESRI, in 2014, it is anticipated that the percentage of renter-occupied units will decrease to 38 percent. It is important to note that rental unit
vacancies increased from just over eight percent to 13 percent between 2000 and 2008 respectivly. The attributed to the sluggish economy,
along with increased property taxes (re-assessments in the mid-2000s), higher insurance premiums, increased utility bills, and an increased
number of rental properties for sale and in foreclosure.
The 2008 median rent was $627 per month. The Elkhart-Goshen MSA 2009 Fair Market Rent (FMR) is $731 per month for a two-bedroom
unit, which is greater than the Indiana FMR of $697 per month. (Source: National Low Income Housing Coalition, 2009) Nearly 68 percent of
Elkhart&rsquos rental housing stock rents for less than the FMR. However, 42 percent of renters are unable to afford FMR. (Source: American
Community Survey, 2006-2008) The maximum affordable monthly housing cost for a family of four at 30 percent of the AMI is $444 per month.
The basic unit of housing consumption is the household. Housing demand can be assessed by examining various demographic characteristics
relating to the number and composition of households within a community. These primary characteristics are:
• Population
• Number of Households
• Persons per Household
• Age of the Population
• Income Levels
Housing demand is also influenced by individual household choices relative to housing type, location, and cost. Furthermore, households
make individual decisions concerning what they are willing and able to pay for housing. Vacancy rates are an important housing indicator
because they often reflect the degree of housing choices available. A high vacancy rate usually suggests a high degree of choice, while a low
vacancy rate is often indicative of a relatively low degree of choice and higher housing costs.
Currently, the general Elkhart housing supply exceeds the general demand. The table below illustrates the housing supply product as an
index of housing availability, in particular for potential homeowners. When calculating the housing supply product for the overall Elkhart
population, there is an inventory of housing units, both rental and owner occupied, available (more than 23,000) for more than 20,000
households. These calculations are based on ESRI&rsquos population projections for 2009.
Households earning up to 120 percent of the AMI, $$71,150 or less for a family of four, have sufficient choice in housing options as well.
Available housing units were determined by multiplying an annual household income by three to determine house purchase price. In the case
of a 120 percent AMI household, the maximum purchase price, or value, is $213,120. There are an estimated 23,000 units with a value of less
than $213,120. It is important to note that this calculation of total units includes all housing units, both owner occupied and rental. This
indicates that all rental units and all but approximately 700 of the for sale units would be affordable to this income groups. This reflects the
decrease in housing values that has occurred in the last two years, coupled with an increase of supply obtained through new construction and
annexation.
Households earning 80 percent of the AMI, $47,360 or less for a family of four, have sufficient choice in housing options as well. Available

housing units were determined by multiplying an annual household income by three to determine house purchase price. In the case of an 80
percent AMI household, the maximum purchase price, or value, is $142, 080. There are an estimated 22,073 units with a value of less than
$142,080. This is more than double the number of units at this price point in 2000. It is important to note that this calculation of total units
includes all housing units, both owner occupied and rental. This reflects the decrease in housing values that has occurred in the last two
years, coupled with an increase of supply obtained through new construction and annexation.
Housing options for low- and very-low-income residents are limited by affordability and availability. The housing supply product for households
earning 50 percent of the AMI, $29,600 or less for a family of four, is lower than the demand. It is estimated that there are approximately 5,500
housing units with a purchase price/value of $88,800 or less for more than 7,000 households in this income category. There is an inadequate
supply of housing for households considered low- and very-low-income, and it can be surmised that the quality and location of the available
affordable units are also inadequate.

The City of Elkhart will enforce rent and occupancy requirements through a recorded agreement. This agreement will contain all programmatic
conditions and will be signed at the property closing. The agreement will then be recorded with the Elkhart County Recorder&rsquos Office.
The property owner will be expected to provide proof of income-qualified tenants at the initial time of occupancy of the entire term of the
affordability period.
It is important to note that, if the assistance for this project was made to meet the set-aside requirement to serve persons at or below 50%
AMI, all subsequent tenants must meet the same income standards of 50% AMI at initial occupancy during the term of the affordability period.
The agreement will be released upon completion of the affordability period. If the property would transfer ownership within the affordability
period, the new owner would assume the agreement and all programmatic conditions involved.
For Homebuyer Activities the following chart provides affordability period requirements.

programmatic conditions and will be signed at the property closing. The agreement will then be recorded with the Elkhart County
Recorder&rsquos Office. The agreement will be released upon completion of the affordability period. If the property would transfer ownership
within the affordability period, the new owner would assume the agreement and all programmatic conditions involved.
It is important to note, that if the sale is made to persons at or below 50% AMI and that sale was used to meet the minimum investment for
persons at or below 50%AMI, the subsequent sale during the affordability period would have to be to a person at or below 50% AMI to meet
the regulatory requirement of the NSP program.
If an income-qualified homebuyer cannot be identified by the owner, assistance from local partners, including but not limited to, La Casa Inc.,
Habitat for Humanity, and other local housing agencies will be utilized to find an income eligible homebuyer.

Definition of Blighted Structure:
The term "blighted structure" is not defined in any City of Elkhart ordinance nor is it defined in the State of Indiana Unsafe Building Law or in
the 2006 International Property Maintenance Code that has been adopted by the City of Elkhart. For this reason the City of Elkhart will
consider "blighted structure" to be equivalent to the term "unsafe building" as defined in the State of Indiana Unsafe Building Law:
IC 36-7-9-4 Unsafe buildings and unsafe premises described:
Sec. 4. (a) For purposes of this chapter, a building or structure, or any part of a building or structure, that is:
>
(1) in an impaired structural condition that makes it unsafe to a person or property;
>
(2) a fire hazard;
>
(3) a hazard to the public health;
(4) a public nuisance;
>
(5) dangerous to a person or property because of a violation of a statute or ordinance concerning building condition or maintenance; or
>
(6) vacant and not maintained in a manner that would allow human habitation, occupancy, or use under the requirements of a statute or
an ordinance; is considered an unsafe building.
> (b) For purposes of this chapter:
>
(1) an unsafe building; and
>
(2) the tract of real property on which the unsafe building is located; are considered unsafe premises.
> (c) For purposes of this chapter, a tract of real property that does not contain a building or structure, not including land used for production
agriculture, is considered an unsafe premises if the tract of real property is:
>
(1) a fire hazard;
>
(2) a hazard to public health;
>
(3) a public nuisance; or
>
(4) dangerous to a person or property because of a violation of a statute or an ordinance.
>As added by Acts 1981, P.L.309, SEC.28. Amended by P.L.14-1991, SEC.9; P.L.66-2005, SEC.1.

Definition of Affordable Rents:
C. Definitions and Description
The following definition of affordable rent is to replace the former definition provided in the NSP plan.
(2) Definition of "affordable rents."
Note: Grantees may use the definition they have adopted for their CDBG program but should review their existing definition to ensure
compliance with NSP program &ndashspecific requirements such as continued affordability.
Response:
"Affordable Rents" is defined as the rent limits provided by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) annually. This rent
limit is designed to ensure that units built using program funds are affordable to low- and very low-income households. The rent limit for a
given unit is the maximum rent a property owner may charge for the unit. Any rental housing produced with NSP funds will follow HOME rent
limits for the entire affordability period based on the NSP lien recorded for that property. Rental units produced to meet the set-aside
requirements for households at or below 50% AMI must use the Low HOME rent limits. For housing units not subject to the 50% AMI set-aside
requirements, the fair market rent or High HOME rent limits, whichever is higher, will act as the maximum rent allowable unless other
provisions are noted in the NSP lien document recorded for the property.

Housing Rehabilitation/New Construction Standards:
The City of Elkhart has adopted the following building codes for residential properties in the City&rsquos jurisdiction.
Indiana Residential Code, 2005 Edition. (This includes Structural, Plumbing and Mechanical Rules) 2003 International Residential Code for
One- and Two-Family Dwellings, fifth printing, and Chapter 43 of the 2006 International Residential Code for One- and Two-Family Dwellings,
first printing, published by the International Code Council, 5203 Leesburg Pike, Suite 708, Falls Church, Virginia 22041-3401, as amended by
the State of Indiana.
Indiana Electrical Code, 2005 Edition. National Electrical Code, 2005 edition, first printing, and errata to the first printing, as amended by the
State of Indiana.
Indiana Visitability Rule (Accessibility for One- and Two-Family Dwellings) This rule applies only to the design and construction of one (1) or
more visitability features in one-(1) and two-(2) family dwellings and Class 1 townhouses. In accordance with IC 22-13-4-7(g), the provisions of
this rule are not mandatory unless a person contracts with a designer or a builder for construction of a visitability feature adopted in this rule in
the new construction of a dwelling, in which case the designer and builder shall comply with the standards adopted in this rule for the design
and construction of the visitability feature.
Projects on three or more dwellings as well as all commercial projects are governed by:
Indiana Building Code, 2008 Edition. International Building Code, 2006 Edition, first printing, as amended.
Indiana Plumbing Code, 1999 Edition. Uniform Plumbing Code, 1997 Edition, as amended
Indiana Mechanical Code, 2008 Edition. International Mechanical Code, 2006 Edition, first printing, as amended
Indiana Fuel Gas Code, 2008 Edition. International Fuel Gas Code, 2006 Edition, first printing, as amended
Indiana Fire Code, 2008 Edition. International Fire Code, 2006 Edition, first printing, as amended
Indiana Electrical Code, 2005 Edition. National Electrical Code, 2005 edition, first printing, and errata to the first printing, as amended by the
State of Indiana.
All properties renovated with the NSP funds will be brought into compliance with the applicable residential codes for existing home
rehabilitation in addition to the following HUD required standards:

• All gut rehabilitation or new construction (i.e., general replacement of the interior of a building that may or may not include changes to
structural elements such as flooring systems, columns or load-bearing interior or exterior walls) of residential buildings up to three stories must
be designed to meet the standard for Energy Star Qualified New Homes.
• All gut rehabilitation or new construction of mid- or high-rise multifamily housing must be designed to meet American Society of
Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Standard 90.1-2004, Appendix G plus 20 percent (which is the Energy Star
standard for multifamily buildings piloted by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy).
• Other rehabilitation must meet these standards to the extent applicable to the rehabilitation work undertaken; e.g., replace older
obsolete products and appliances (such as windows, doors, lighting, hot water heaters, furnaces, boilers, air conditioning units, refrigerators,
clothes washers and dishwashers) with Energy Star-46 labeled products.
• Water efficient toilets, showers, and faucets, such as those with the WaterSense label, must be installed.

Vicinity Hiring:
The City of Elkhart is committed to implementing the vicinity hiring preference in its NSP3 activities. The City of Elkhart has a Section 3 plan
that currently requires that all job announcements for contractors with CDBG or NSP contracts must be posted with the Elkhart Housing
Authority and the Work Force Development Office. These offices are within the area of greatest need. City staff will also review existing
CDBG-approved contractors to determine if any are located within the area of greatest need. Staff will also review the local phone book for
contractors located within the area of greatest need. These contractors will be notified that they will be eligible for the NSP3 vicinity hiring
preference with all NSP3 contracts. City staff will participate in the webinar scheduled to provide guidance on the vicinity hiring preference on
March 3, 2011.

Procedures for Preferences for Affordable Rental Dev.:
This is the City of Elkhart&rsquos preference for development of affordable rental housing with NSP3. The housing market in Elkhart has been
negatively impacted by the extreme economic down turn the area has experienced. According to CHAS data used in the housing needs
assessment conducted for the 2010-2015 Consolidated Plan, the City of Elkhart had 810 vacant homes for sale and 1,315 vacant units for
rent. The data from the US Census for 2005-2009 American Community Survey indicates that the vacancy rate for homeowner units is only
4.5% while it is 14.2% for rental units.
Given high vacancy rates, specifically in rental units, the project will provide for development of rental units that are owned by local not-forprofits and will focus those units on persons with special needs such as persons who are homeless, disabled, veterans, or victims of domestic
violence. By providing rental housing for special needs populations, the City can meet the goal of the NSP3 program to develop affordable
5
Community Development Systems
Disaster Recovery Grant Reporting System (DRGR)

rental housing in a manner that addresses the high vacancy rates in rental housing units.
City staff will work closely with local not-for-profit agencies to identify housing units that would meet the needs of the agencies and their clients
that also meet NSP3 requirements of vacant, abandoned, or foreclosed upon. Identifying properties that meet the location, unit size and
number, accessibilty needs, and low costs of operations of the agency and clients is critical to finding a local partner to acquire and manage
the rental units after the units are rehabiltated with NSP3 funds.
It is expected that funds used for this activity will be used to meet the low-income housing requirement for those below 50% of area median
income (AMI). The City will work with local partner housing and social service agencies to find tenants who are income qualified and in need of
affordable housing opportunities in our city, paying special attention to persons at or below 50% AMI.

Activity Description:
funds to pay for administration and planning for the NSP3 Program

Location Description:
activity to be carried out at the Municipal Building 229 South Second Street, Elkhart, IN 46516

Activity Progress Narrative:
Funds for this activity were spent on general adminstrative needs such as legal advice. Some staff expenses will be drawn
against the NSP-3 administrative activity in the 4th quarter 2012 to reconcile staff time during the program that has been
charged to NSP1 or CDBG. The need to reconcile the project expenses is due to the City of Elkhart's payrole system that uses
a set percentage of hours per budget line. The system is set up to take a percentage based on budgeted time for each payroll
issued. The staff then provides details of actual hours worked during the reconcilation process. If there is a difference between
the estimated percentage and actual the differnce is drawn or reimbured at that time.

Activity Description:
funds to pay for acquisition and rehab of rental properties for persons at or below 50% AMI

Location Description:
NPS 3 area

Activity Progress Narrative:
This activity will provide 6 units of rental housing for people at or below 50% AMI. To date funds have been spent to clean out
the building and plans for reuse. Because the building had been 9 very small and oddly shaped apartments, it was important to
remove walls and clean-out debris as well as conduct asbestos removal before the architect, staff, and developer could start
to work on plan for a redesign of the building. After many meetings and tours the current plan of a 6 unit building was
developed. The timeline will be aggressive but the plans are to have the building 75% complete by the March 2013 deadline for
50% NSP3 funds drawn. This project has the largest budget of any of the projects for NSP3. It is a large part of the strategy
for the City to meet the 50% drawn deadline. Contracts for re-roofing should be signed in November 2012 and significant
additional construction contracts before the end of the year for the rough in floor plans, windows, and the front porch
reconstruction.

Summary of Distribution and Uses of NSP Funds:
The City of Elkhart utilized the HUD NSP3 mapping tool as well as the needs data provided by HUD to determine a general area of need for
the community. This information was then compared with the existing NSP1 area and the Neighborhood Revitalization Strategy Area as well
as a list of tax delinquent properties available from Elkhart County to narrow the area of need down to a smaller area. This area was then
mapped and determined to be the area of greatest need for the NSP3 program.
,
The first phase of this evaluation was to use the NSP3 needs data. The City of Elkhart has 82 Census Block Groups (CBG) in this data set.
Each of those CBGs had an NSP3 needs score of 18 or greater. This indicated that any of the CBGs in Elkhart would meet the minimum
requirement of an NSP3 needs score of 17. Several of the CDBs had fewer than 3 households so those were removed from the evaluation
because the area was not considered to be residential in nature. This process left 60 CBGs to be reviewed for percent of households that are
51% or greater low-mod-medium income level. Of those 60 CBGs, 54 met that criterion. This provided the largest potential area for the NSP3
program. This area was then compared to two defined areas of need in the community, the NSP1 area and the CDBG Neighborhood
Revitalization Strategy Area.
,
The data for these CBGs was then reviewed for vacancy rates (COMBINED VAC), agreement numbers (HMDA), high cost agreements (HCRATES), seriously delinquent agreements (SDQ-RATES), number of foreclosure starts (STARTS), completed foreclosures (REO), and
number of projects to make an impact (IMPACT).
,
From this data it was determined that each block group is eligible under NSP3 by having a Needs Score of 17 or more. When the additional
data points are reviewed it becomes clear that each CGB has some characteristic that makes it relatively higher or lower in need based on
that data point. This data is useful in providing an overview of a large eligible area but does not provide a clear picture of a reasonably-sized
area of greatest need.
,
The City of Elkhart is a recipient of NSP1 funds as well as an entitlement community for CDBG funds. The NSP1 area is very similar to the
existing NRSA for the City of Elkhart. This area has been shown over time and through the NSP1 and the CDBG Consolidated Plan planning
processes to be the area in the community that has the greatest needs. The decision to focus NSP3 efforts in the same general areas as
these existing redevelopment efforts was in great part due to a desire by the City to provide comprehensive redevelopment of an area already
determined to be in the greatest need in our community.
,
NRSA Census Block Group Data plus CBG 22.5
,
Elkhart County&rsquos list of tax delinquent properties that did not sell in the October 2010 tax sale contained one hundred four parcels. The
City and County worked together in 2010 to transfer tax-delinquent properties that had not sold at one or more tax sales to the City of Elkhart
Redevelopment Commission for use in the NSP1 program. The intent for NSP3 is to continue with this model for several reasons, including
but not limited to the following:
> 1. The tax-foreclosure process makes these properties eligible for acquisition under the NSP3 rules.
> 2. These pro

perties can be acquired with clean title through the tax-foreclosure process.
> 3. Tax-delinquent properties that are not redeemed by owners or purchased at the tax sale are generally
>
less marketable and least likely to be redeveloped by the private sector as proven by the lack of interest
>
in keeping or obtaining ownership.
> 4. These properties are generally in very poor condition due to the lack of interest or financial capacity of
>
the owner and create a blighting influence on the neighborhood.
> 5. These properties can be acquired at a very low cost, allowing the NSP3 project to impact more
>
properties.
>When the list of tax sale parcels was mapped in relation to the existing NSP1 and NRSA boundaries, 83 of the 104 parcels were inside those
boundaries furthering the argument that this is the area of greatest need. That said, this area was deemed to be too large to serve as the
NSP3 area. For this reason NSP1- and CDBG-funded projects were mapped as well to determine if a cluster of projects would be found. This
mapping process provided a basis for the NSP3 mapping area defined in the NSP3 mapping tool. ,
This map provides locations of NSP1 projects and projects funded with CDBG since 2008 in brown. The green markers indicate the location
of the 104 tax delinquent parcels. The red outline is the current NRSA. As noted, many of the tax delinquent properties fall within the existing
NRSA. To finalize the NSP3 area of greatest need, the City decided to extend the designated central area of the NRSA an additional three
blocks south of the current southern boundary to take advantage of a cluster of eligible tax delinquent properties that lay just outside the
existing NRSA boundaries.

How Fund Use Addresses Market Conditions:
Housing Type & Quality Analysis
,
Housing professionals are most often concerned about the provision of affordable housing to low, moderate and middle-income individuals
and families. In order to be considered of these income, a family&rsquos income must be at or below 120 percent of the Area Median Income
(AMI) for their particular family size. Low income is considered to be 50 percent of the AMI, and very low income is considered to be at 30
percent of the AMI. Income limits based on these percentages are used to determine eligibility for various assistance programs.
,
The City of Elkhart has more than 23,000 housing units (owner and rental). Of these units, 87 percent are occupied and 13 percent are vacant.
The homeowner vacancy rate is more than 5 percent; the rental vacancy rate is just over 8 percent. Fifty-four percent of Elkhart&rsquos
housing units are owneroccupied and 46 percent are renter occupied. (Source: American Community Survey, 2006-2008)
,
Owner-Occupied Units
,
Recent changes in the local and national economies and, in particular, the housing market have had profound effects on Elkhart&rsquos
housing values, housing stock, and housing conditions. Increases in the City&rsquos and region&rsquos unemployment rates, from the
County&rsquos 5.3 percent unemployment rate in January 2008 to an unemployment high of 18.8 percent in March 2009 to the current 15.6
percent in January 2010 have increasd the number of housing units listed for sale, decreased the number of units sold, and decreased the
sale price to list price ratio.
,
It is anticipated that the Michiana real estate market will remain sluggish as the outcomes in financial markets and the regional economy (in
particular the recreational vehicle and manufactured housing industries) remain uncertain. Elkhart will likely continue to face weak housing
markets because of the weak demand, growing inventories of existing homes, and tougher credit markets.
,
The 2004 Housing Needs Assessment found that there was a "booming housing market" for middle- and upper-middle-income homes, while
the low- to moderate-income housing market had not kept pace. Additionally, it was determined that the housing stock available to low- and
moderate-income residents was deteriorating due to inadequacies in public policy and insufficient maintenance resources.
,
Housing values, as a whole, have decreased throughout Elkhart, the State of Indiana, the Midwest, and many other locations throughout the
United States. The decrease in values has increased the number of housing units considered "affordable." The City has not increased its
affordable housing inventory; the market has devalued the existing housing inventory (through an oversupply of units and lower demands).
Thus, the choice of housing units, at all price points, has increased for employed potential homeowners who qualify for a mortgage and have a
sufficient down payment.
,
Renter-Occupied Units
,
In 2008, 46 percent of Elkhart&rsquos housing units were renter occupied (Source: American Community Survey). According to forecasts by
ESRI, in 2014, it is anticipated that the percentage of renter-occupied units will decrease to 38 percent. It is important to note that rental unit
vacancies increased from just over eight percent to 13 percent between 2000 and 2008 respectiv

How Fund Use Addresses Market Conditions:
he attributed to the sluggish economy, along with increased property taxes (re-assessments in the mid-2000s), higher insurance premiums,
increased utility bills, and an increased number of rental properties for sale and in foreclosure.,
The 2008 median rent was $627 per month. The Elkhart-Goshen MSA 2009 Fair Market Rent (FMR) is $731 per month for a two-bedroom

unit, which is greater than the Indiana FMR of $697 per month. (Source: National Low Income Housing Coalition, 2009) Nearly 68 percent of
Elkhart&rsquos rental housing stock rents for less than the FMR. However, 42 percent of renters are unable to afford FMR. (Source: American
Community Survey, 2006-2008) The maximum affordable monthly housing cost for a family of four at 30 percent of the AMI is $444 per month.
,
The basic unit of housing consumption is the household. Housing demand can be assessed by examining various demographic characteristics
relating to the number and composition of households within a community. These primary characteristics are:
,
,
• Population
,
• Number of Households
,
• Persons per Household
,
• Age of the Population
,
• Income Levels
,
,
Housing demand is also influenced by individual household choices relative to housing type, location, and cost. Furthermore, households
make individual decisions concerning what they are willing and able to pay for housing. Vacancy rates are an important housing indicator
because they often reflect the degree of housing choices available. A high vacancy rate usually suggests a high degree of choice, while a low
vacancy rate is often indicative of a relatively low degree of choice and higher housing costs.
,
Currently, the general Elkhart housing supply exceeds the general demand. The table below illustrates the housing supply product as an
index of housing availability, in particular for potential homeowners. When calculating the housing supply product for the overall Elkhart
population, there is an inventory of housing units, both rental and owner occupied, available (more than 23,000) for more than 20,000
households. These calculations are based on ESRI&rsquos population projections for 2009.
,
Households earning up to 120 percent of the AMI, $$71,150 or less for a family of four, have sufficient choice in housing options as well.
Available housing units were determined by multiplying an annual household income by three to determine house purchase price. In the case
of a 120 percent AMI household, the maximum purchase price, or value, is $213,120. There are an estimated 23,000 units with a value of less
than $213,120. It is important to note that this calculation of total units includes all housing units, both owner occupied and rental. This
indicates that all rental units and all but approximately 700 of the for sale units would be affordable to this income groups. This reflects the
decrease in housing values that has occurred in the last two years, coupled with an increase of supply obtained through new construction and
annexation.
,
Households earning 80 percent of the AMI, $47,360 or less for a family of four, have sufficient choice in housing options as well. Available
housing units were determined by multiplying an annual household income by three to determine house purchase price. In the case of an 80
percent AMI household, the maximum purchase price, or value, is $142, 080. There ar

How Fund Use Addresses Market Conditions:
e an estimated 22,073 units with a value of less than $142,080. This is more than double the number of units at this price point in 2000. It is
important to note that this calculation of total units includes all housing units, both owner occupied and rental. This reflects the decrease in
housing values that has occurred in the last two years, coupled with an increase of supply obtained through new construction and annexation.,
Housing options for low- and very-low-income residents are limited by affordability and availability. The housing supply product for households
earning 50 percent of the AMI, $29,600 or less for a family of four, is lower than the demand. It is estimated that there are approximately 5,500
housing units with a purchase price/value of $88,800 or less for more than 7,000 households in this income category. There is an inadequate
supply of housing for households considered low- and very-low-income, and it can be surmised that the quality and location of the available
affordable units are also inadequate.

The City of Elkhart will enforce rent and occupancy requirements through a recorded agreement. This agreement will contain all programmatic
conditions and will be signed at the property closing. The agreement will then be recorded with the Elkhart County Recorder&rsquos Office.
The property owner will be expected to provide proof of income-qualified tenants at the initial time of occupancy of the entire term of the
affordability period.
,
It is important to note that, if the assistance for this project was made to meet the set-aside requirement to serve persons at or below 50%
AMI, all subsequent tenants must meet the same income standards of 50% AMI at initial occupancy during the term of the affordability period.
,
The agreement will be released upon completion of the affordability period. If the property would transfer ownership within the affordability
period, the new owner would assume the agreement and all programmatic conditions involved.

,
It is important to note, that if the sale is made to persons at or below 50% AMI and that sale was used to meet the minimum investment for
persons at or below 50%AMI, the subsequent sale during the affordability period would have to be to a person at or below 50% AMI to meet
the regulatory requirement of the NSP program.
,
If an income-qualified homebuyer cannot be identified by the owner, assistance from local partners, including but not limited to, La Casa Inc.,
Habitat for Humanity, and other local housing agencies will be utilized to find an income eligible homebuyer.

Definition of Blighted Structure:
The term "blighted structure" is not defined in any City of Elkhart ordinance nor is it defined in the State of Indiana Unsafe Building Law or in
the 2006 International Property Maintenance Code that has been adopted by the City of Elkhart. For this reason the City of Elkhart will
consider "blighted structure" to be equivalent to the term "unsafe building" as defined in the State of Indiana Unsafe Building Law:
,
IC 36-7-9-4 Unsafe buildings and unsafe premises described:
,
Sec. 4. (a) For purposes of this chapter, a building or structure, or any part of a building or structure, that is:
>
(1) in an impaired structural condition that makes it unsafe to a person or property;
>
(2) a fire hazard;
>
(3) a hazard to the public health;
,
(4) a public nuisance;
>
(5) dangerous to a person or property because of a violation of a statute or ordinance concerning building condition or maintenance; or
>
(6) vacant and not maintained in a manner that would allow human habitation, occupancy, or use under the requirements of a statute or
an ordinance; is considered an unsafe building.
> (b) For purposes of this chapter:
>
(1) an unsafe building; and
>
(2) the tract of real property on which the unsafe building is located; are considered unsafe premises.
> (c) For purposes of this chapter, a tract of real property that does not contain a building or structure, not including land used for production
agriculture, is considered an unsafe premises if the tract of real property is:
>
(1) a fire hazard;
>
(2) a hazard to public health;
>
(3) a public nuisance; or
>
(4) dangerous to a person or property because of a violation of a statute or an ordinance.

Note: Grantees may use the definition they have adopted for their CDBG program but should review their existing definition to ensure
compliance with NSP program &ndashspecific requirements such as continued affordability.
,
Response:
,
"Affordable Rents" is defined as the rent limits provided by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) annually. This rent
limit is designed to ensure that units built using program funds are affordable to low- and very low-income households. The rent limit for a
given unit is the maximum rent a property owner may charge for the unit. Any rental housing produced with NSP funds will follow HOME rent
limits for the entire affordability period based on the NSP lien recorded for that property. Rental units produced to meet the set-aside
requirements for households at or below 50% AMI must use the Low HOME rent limits. For housing units not subject to the 50% AMI set-aside
requirements, the fair market rent or High HOME rent limits, whichever is higher, will act as the maximum rent allowable unless other
provisions are noted in the NSP lien document recorded for the property.

Housing Rehabilitation/New Construction Standards:
The City of Elkhart has adopted the following building codes for residential properties in the City&rsquos jurisdiction.
,
Indiana Residential Code, 2005 Edition. (This includes Structural, Plumbing and Mechanical Rules) 2003 International Residential Code for

Vicinity Hiring:
The City of Elkhart is committed to implementing the vicinity hiring preference in its NSP3 activities. The City of Elkhart has a Section 3 plan
that currently requires that all job announcements for contractors with CDBG or NSP contracts must be posted with the Elkhart Housing
Authority and the Work Force Development Office. These offices are within the area of greatest need. City staff will also review existing
CDBG-approved contractors to determine if any are located within the area of greatest need. Staff will also review the local phone book for
contractors located within the area of greatest need. These contractors will be notified that they will be eligible for the NSP3 vicinity hiring
preference with all NSP3 contracts. City staff will participate in the webinar scheduled to provide guidance on the vicinity hiring preference on
March 3, 2011.

Procedures for Preferences for Affordable Rental Dev.:
This is the City of Elkhart&rsquos preference for development of affordable rental housing with NSP3. The housing market in Elkhart has been
negatively impacted by the extreme economic down turn the area has experienced. According to CHAS data used in the housing needs
assessment conducted for the 2010-2015 Consolidated Plan, the City of Elkhart had 810 vacant homes for sale and 1,315 vacant units for
rent. The data from the US Census for 2005-2009 American Community Survey indicates that the vacancy rate for homeowner units is only
4.5% while it is 14.2% for rental units.
,
Given high vacancy rates, specifically in rental units, the project will provide for development of rental units that are owned by local not-forprofits and will focus those units on persons with special needs such as persons who are homeless, disabled, veterans, or victims of domestic
violence. By providing rental housing for special needs populations, the City can meet the goal of the NSP3 program to develop affordable
rental housing in a manner that addresses the high vacancy rates in rental housing units.
,
City staff will work closely with local not-for-profit agencies to identify housing units that would meet the needs of the agencies and their clients
that also meet NSP3 requirements of vacant, abandoned, or foreclosed upon. Identifying properties that meet the location, unit size and
number, accessibilty needs, and low costs of operations of the agency and clients is critical to finding a local partner to acquire and manage
the rental units after the units are rehabiltated with NSP3 funds.
,
It is expected that funds used for this activity will be used to meet the low-income housing requirement for those below 50% of area median
income (AMI). The City will work with local partner housing and social service agencies to find tenants who are income qualified and in need of
affordable housing opportunities in our city, paying special attention to persons at or below 50% AMI.

Summary of Distribution and Uses of NSP Funds:
The City of Elkhart utilized the HUD NSP3 mapping tool as well as the needs data provided by HUD to determine a general area of need for
the community. This information was then compared with the existing NSP1 area and the Neighborhood Revitalization Strategy Area as well
as a list of tax delinquent properties available from Elkhart County to narrow the area of need down to a smaller area. This area was then
mapped and determined to be the area of greatest need for the NSP3 program.
,
The first phase of this evaluation was to use the NSP3 needs data. The City of Elkhart has 82 Census Block Groups (CBG) in this data set.
Each of those CBGs had an NSP3 needs score of 18 or greater. This indicated that any of the CBGs in Elkhart would meet the minimum
requirement of an NSP3 needs score of 17. Several of the CDBs had fewer than 3 households so those were removed from the evaluation
because the area was not considered to be residential in nature. This process left 60 CBGs to be reviewed for percent of households that are
51% or greater low-mod-medium income level. Of those 60 CBGs, 54 met that criterion. This provided the largest potential area for the NSP3
program. This area was then compared to two defined areas of need in the community, the NSP1 area and the CDBG Neighborhood
Revitalization Strategy Area.
,
The data for these CBGs was then reviewed for vacancy rates (COMBINED VAC), agreement numbers (HMDA), high cost agreements (HCRATES), seriously delinquent agreements (SDQ-RATES), number of foreclosure starts (STARTS), completed foreclosures (REO), and
number of projects to make an impact (IMPACT).
,
From this data it was determined that each block group is eligible under NSP3 by having a Needs Score of 17 or more. When the additional
data points are reviewed it becomes clear that each CGB has some characteristic that makes it relatively higher or lower in need based on
that data point. This data is useful in providing an overview of a large eligible area but does not provide a clear picture of a reasonably-sized
area of greatest need.
,
The City of Elkhart is a recipient of NSP1 funds as well as an entitlement community for CDBG funds. The NSP1 area is very similar to the
existing NRSA for the City of Elkhart. This area has been shown over time and through the NSP1 and the CDBG Consolidated Plan planning
processes to be the area in the community that has the greatest needs. The decision to focus NSP3 efforts in the same general areas as
these existing redevelopment efforts was in great part due to a desire by the City to provide comprehensive redevelopment of an area already
determined to be in the greatest need in our community.
,
NRSA Census Block Group Data plus CBG 22.5
,
Elkhart County&rsquos list of tax delinquent properties that did not sell in the October 2010 tax sale contained one hundred four parcels. The
City and County worked together in 2010 to transfer tax-delinquent properties that had not sold at one or more tax sales to the City of Elkhart
Redevelopment Commission for use in the NSP1 program. The intent for NSP3 is to continue with this model for several reasons, including
but not limited to the following:
> 1. The tax-foreclosure process makes these properties eligible for acquisition under the NSP3 rules.
> 2. These properties can be acquired with clean title through the tax-foreclosure process.
> 3. Tax-delinquent properties that are not redeemed by owners or purchased at the tax sale are generally
>
less marketable and least likely to be redeveloped by the private sector as proven by the lack of interest
>
in keeping or obtaining ownership.
> 4. These properties are generally in very poor condition due to the lack of interest or financial capacity of

>
the owner and create a blighting influence on the neighborhood.
> 5. These properties can be acquired at a very low cost, allowing the NSP3 project to impact more
>
properties.
>When the list of tax sale parcels was mapped in relation to the existing NSP1 and NRSA boundaries, 83 of the 104 parcels were inside those
boundaries furthering the argument that this is the area of greatest need. That said, this area was deemed to be too large to serve as the
NSP3 area. For this reason NSP1- and CDBG-funded projects were mapped as well to determine if a cluster of projects would be found. This
mapping process provided a basis for the NSP3 mapping area defined in the NSP3 mapping tool.
,
This map provides locations of NSP1 projects and projects funded with CDBG since 2008 in brown. The green markers indicate the location
of the 104 tax delinquent parcels. The red outline is the current NRSA. As noted, many of the tax delinquent properties fall within the existing
NRSA. To finalize the NSP3 area of greatest need, the City decided to extend the designated central area of the NRSA an additional three
blocks south of the current southern boundary to take advantage of a cluster of eligible tax delinquent properties that lay just outside the
existing NRSA boundaries.

How Fund Use Addresses Market Conditions:
Housing Type & Quality Analysis
,
Housing professionals are most often concerned about the provision of affordable housing to low, moderate and middle-income individuals
and families. In order to be considered of these income, a family&rsquos income must be at or below 120 percent of the Area Median Income
(AMI) for their particular family size. Low income is considered to be 50 percent of the AMI, and very low income is considered to be at 30
percent of the AMI. Income limits based on these percentages are used to determine eligibility for various assistance programs.
,
The City of Elkhart has more than 23,000 housing units (owner and rental). Of these units, 87 percent are occupied and 13 percent are vacant.
The homeowner vacancy rate is more than 5 percent; the rental vacancy rate is just over 8 percent. Fifty-four percent of Elkhart&rsquos
housing units are owneroccupied and 46 percent are renter occupied. (Source: American Community Survey, 2006-2008)
,
Owner-Occupied Units
,
Recent changes in the local and national economies and, in particular, the housing market have had profound effects on Elkhart&rsquos
housing values, housing stock, and housing conditions. Increases in the City&rsquos and region&rsquos unemployment rates, from the
County&rsquos 5.3 percent unemployment rate in January 2008 to an unemployment high of 18.8 percent in March 2009 to the current 15.6
percent in January 2010 have increasd the number of housing units listed for sale, decreased the number of units sold, and decreased the
sale price to list price ratio.
,
It is anticipated that the Michiana real estate market will remain sluggish as the outcomes in financial markets and the regional economy (in
particular the recreational vehicle and manufactured housing industries) remain uncertain. Elkhart will likely continue to face weak housing
markets because of the weak demand, growing inventories of existing homes, and tougher credit markets.
,
The 2004 Housing Needs Assessment found that there was a "booming housing market" for middle- and upper-middle-income homes, while
the low- to moderate-income housing market had not kept pace. Additionally, it was determined that the housing stock available to low- and
moderate-income residents was deteriorating due to inadequacies in public policy and insufficient maintenance resources.
,
Housing values, as a whole, have decreased throughout Elkhart, the State of Indiana, the Midwest, and many other locations throughout the
United States. The decrease in values has increased the number of housing units considered "affordable." The City has not increased its
affordable housing inventory; the market has devalued the existing housing inventory (through an oversupply of units and lower demands).
Thus, the choice of housing units, at all price points, has increased for employed potential homeowners who qualify for a mortgage and have a
sufficient down payment.
,
Renter-Occupied Units
,
In 2008, 46 percent of Elkhart&rsquos housing units were renter occupied (Source: American Community Survey). According to forecasts by
ESRI, in 2014, it is anticipated that the percentage of renter-occupied units will decrease to 38 percent. It is important to note that rental unit
vacancies increased from just over eight percent to 13 percent between 2000 and 2008 respectivhe attributed to the sluggish economy, along
with increased property taxes (re-assessments in the mid-2000s), higher insurance premiums, increased utility bills, and an increased number
of rental properties for sale and in foreclosure.
,
The 2008 median rent was $627 per month. The Elkhart-Goshen MSA 2009 Fair Market Rent (FMR) is $731 per month for a two-bedroom
unit, which is greater than the Indiana FMR of $697 per month. (Source: National Low Income Housing Coalition, 2009) Nearly 68 percent of
Elkhart&rsquos rental housing stock rents for less than the FMR. However, 42 percent of renters are unable to afford FMR. (Source: American
Community Survey, 2006-2008) The maximum affordable monthly housing cost for a family of four at 30 percent of the AMI is $444 per month.
,
The basic unit of housing consumption is the household. Housing demand can be assessed by examining various demographic characteristics
relating to the number and composition of households within a community. These primary characteristics are:
,

Community Development Systems
Disaster Recovery Grant Reporting System (DRGR)

,
• Population
,
• Number of Households
,
• Persons per Household
,
• Age of the Population
,
• Income Levels
,
,
Housing demand is also influenced by individual household choices relative to housing type, location, and cost. Furthermore, households
make individual decisions concerning what they are willing and able to pay for housing. Vacancy rates are an important housing indicator
because they often reflect the degree of housing choices available. A high vacancy rate usually suggests a high degree of choice, while a low
vacancy rate is often indicative of a relatively low degree of choice and higher housing costs.
,
Currently, the general Elkhart housing supply exceeds the general demand. The table below illustrates the housing supply product as an
index of housing availability, in particular for potential homeowners. When calculating the housing supply product for the overall Elkhart
population, there is an inventory of housing units, both rental and owner occupied, available (more than 23,000) for more than 20,000
households. These calculations are based on ESRI&rsquos population projections for 2009.
,
Households earning up to 120 percent of the AMI, $$71,150 or less for a family of four, have sufficient choice in housing options as well.
Available housing units were determined by multiplying an annual household income by three to determine house purchase price. In the case
of a 120 percent AMI household, the maximum purchase price, or value, is $213,120. There are an estimated 23,000 units with a value of less
than $213,120. It is important to note that this calculation of total units includes all housing units, both owner occupied and rental. This
indicates that all rental units and all but approximately 700 of the for sale units would be affordable to this income groups. This reflects the
decrease in housing values that has occurred in the last two years, coupled with an increase of supply obtained through new construction and
annexation.
,
Households earning 80 percent of the AMI, $47,360 or less for a family of four, have sufficient choice in housing options as well. Available
housing units were determined by multiplying an annual household income by three to determine house purchase price. In the case of an 80
percent AMI household, the maximum purchase price, or value, is $142, 080. There are an estimated 22,073 units with a value of less than
$142,080. This is more than double the number of units at this price point in 2000. It is important to note that this calculation of total units
includes all housing units, both owner occupied and rental. This reflects the decrease in housing values that has occurred in the last two
years, coupled with an increase of supply obtained through new construction and annexation.
,
Housing options for low- and very-low-income residents are limited by affordability and availability. The housing supply product for households
earning 50 percent of the AMI, $29,600 or less for a family of four, is lower than the demand. It is estimated that there are approximately 5,500
housing units with a purchase price/value of $88,800 or less for more than 7,000 households in this income category. There is an inadequate
supply of housing for households considered low- and very-low-income, and it can be surmised that the quality and location of the available
affordable units are also inadequate.

The City of Elkhart will enforce rent and occupancy requirements through a recorded agreement. This agreement will contain all programmatic
conditions and will be signed at the property closing. The agreement will then be recorded with the Elkhart County Recorder&rsquos Office.
The property owner will be expected to provide proof of income-qualified tenants at the initial time of occupancy of the entire term of the
affordability period.

,
It is important to note, that if the sale is made to persons at or below 50% AMI and that sale was used to meet the minimum investment for
persons at or below 50%AMI, the subsequent sale during the affordability period would have to be to a person at or below 50% AMI to meet
the regulatory requirement of the NSP program.
,
If an income-qualified homebuyer cannot be identified by the owner, assistance from local partners, including but not limited to, La Casa Inc.,
Habitat for Humanity, and other local housing agencies will be utilized to find an income eligible homebuyer.

Definition of Blighted Structure:
The term "blighted structure" is not defined in any City of Elkhart ordinance nor is it defined in the State of Indiana Unsafe Building Law or in
the 2006 International Property Maintenance Code that has been adopted by the City of Elkhart. For this reason the City of Elkhart will
consider "blighted structure" to be equivalent to the term "unsafe building" as defined in the State of Indiana Unsafe Building Law:
,
IC 36-7-9-4 Unsafe buildings and unsafe premises described:
,
Sec. 4. (a) For purposes of this chapter, a building or structure, or any part of a building or structure, that is:
>
(1) in an impaired structural condition that makes it unsafe to a person or property;
>
(2) a fire hazard;
>
(3) a hazard to the public health;
,
(4) a public nuisance;
>
(5) dangerous to a person or property because of a violation of a statute or ordinance concerning building condition or maintenance; or
>
(6) vacant and not maintained in a manner that would allow human habitation, occupancy, or use under the requirements of a statute or
an ordinance; is considered an unsafe building.
> (b) For purposes of this chapter:
>
(1) an unsafe building; and
>
(2) the tract of real property on which the unsafe building is located; are considered unsafe premises.
> (c) For purposes of this chapter, a tract of real property that does not contain a building or structure, not including land used for production
agriculture, is considered an unsafe premises if the tract of real property is:
>
(1) a fire hazard;
>
(2) a hazard to public health;
>
(3) a public nuisance; or
>
(4) dangerous to a person or property because of a violation of a statute or an ordinance.
>As added by Acts 1981, P.L.309, SEC.28. Amended by P.L.14-1991, SEC.9; P.L.66-2005, SEC.1.

Definition of Affordable Rents:
C. Definitions and Description
,
The following definition of affordable rent is to replace the former definition provided in the NSP plan.
,
(2) Definition of "affordable rents."
,
Note: Grantees may use the definition they have adopted for their CDBG program but should review their existing definition to ensure
compliance with NSP program &ndashspecific requirements such as continued affordability.
,
Response:
,
"Affordable Rents" is defined as the rent limits provided by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) annually. This rent
limit is designed to ensure that units built using program funds are affordable to low- and very low-income households. The rent limit for a
given unit is the maximum rent a property owner may charge for the unit. Any rental housing produced with NSP funds will follow HOME rent
limits for the entire affordability period based on the NSP lien recorded for that property. Rental units produced to meet the set-aside
requirements for households at or below 50% AMI must use the Low HOME rent limits. For housing units not subject to the 50% AMI set-aside
5
Community Development Systems
Disaster Recovery Grant Reporting System (DRGR)

requirements, the fair market rent or High HOME rent limits, whichever is higher, will act as the maximum rent allowable unless other
provisions are noted in the NSP lien document recorded for the property.

Housing Rehabilitation/New Construction Standards:
The City of Elkhart has adopted the following building codes for residential properties in the City&rsquos jurisdiction.
,
Indiana Residential Code, 2005 Edition. (This includes Structural, Plumbing and Mechanical Rules) 2003 International Residential Code for
One- and Two-Family Dwellings, fifth printing, and Chapter 43 of the 2006 International Residential Code for One- and Two-Family Dwellings,

more visitability features in one-(1) and two-(2) family dwellings and Class 1 townhouses. In accordance with IC 22-13-4-7(g), the provisions of
this rule are not mandatory unless a person contracts with a designer or a builder for construction of a visitability feature adopted in this rule in
the new construction of a dwelling, in which case the designer and builder shall comply with the standards adopted in this rule for the design
and construction of the visitability feature.
,
Projects on three or more dwellings as well as all commercial projects are governed by:
,
Indiana Building Code, 2008 Edition. International Building Code, 2006 Edition, first printing, as amended.
,
Indiana Plumbing Code, 1999 Edition. Uniform Plumbing Code, 1997 Edition, as amended
,

,
Indiana Electrical Code, 2005 Edition. National Electrical Code, 2005 edition, first printing, and errata to the first printing, as amended by the
State of Indiana.
,
All properties renovated with the NSP funds will be brought into compliance with the applicable residential codes for existing home
rehabilitation in addition to the following HUD required standards:
,
,
,
• All gut rehabilitation or new construction (i.e., general replacement of the interior of a building that may or may not include changes to
structural elements such as flooring systems, columns or load-bearing interior or exterior walls) of residential buildings up to three stories must
be designed to meet the standard for Energy Star Qualified New Homes.
,
• All gut rehabilitation or new construction of mid- or high-rise multifamily housing must be designed to meet American Society of
Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Standard 90.1-2004, Appendix G plus 20 percent (which is the Energy Star
standard for multifamily buildings piloted by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy).
,
• Other rehabilitation must meet these standards to the extent applicable to the rehabilitation work undertaken; e.g., replace older
obsolete products and appliances (such as windows, doors, lighting, hot water heaters, furnaces, boilers, air conditioning units, refrigerators,
clothes washers and dishwashers) with Energy Star-46 labeled products.
,
• Water efficient toilets, showers, and faucets, such as those with the WaterSense label, must be installed.
,
,

Vicinity Hiring:
The City of Elkhart is committed to implementing the vicinity hiring preference in its NSP3 activities. The City of Elkhart has a Section 3 plan
that currently requires that all job announcements for contractors with CDBG or NSP contracts must be posted with the Elkhart Housing
Authority and the Work Force Development Office. These offices are within the area of greatest need. City staff will also review existing
CDBG-approved contractors to determine if any are located within the area of greatest need. Staff will also review the local phone book for
contractors located within the area of greatest need. These contractors will be notified that they will be eligible for the NSP3 vicinity hiring
preference with all NSP3 contracts. City staff will participate in the webinar scheduled to provide guidance on the vicinity hiring preference on
March 3, 2011.

Procedures for Preferences for Affordable Rental Dev.:
This is the City of Elkhart&rsquos preference for development of affordable rental housing with NSP3. The housing market in Elkhart has been
negatively impacted by the extreme economic down turn the area has experienced. According to CHAS data used in the housing needs
assessment conducted for the 2010-2015 Consolidated Plan, the City of Elkhart had 810 vacant homes for sale and 1,315 vacant units for
rent. The data from the US Census for 2005-2009 American Community Survey indicates that the vacancy rate for homeowner units is only
4.5% while it is 14.2% for rental units.
,
Given high vacancy rates, specifically in rental units, the project will provide for development of rental units that are owned by local not-forprofits and will focus those units on persons with special needs such as persons who are homeless, disabled, veterans, or victims of domestic
violence. By providing rental housing for special needs populations, the City can meet the goal of the NSP3 program to develop affordable
rental housing in a manner that addresses the high vacancy rates in rental housing units.
,
City staff will work closely with local not-for-profit agencies to identify housing units that would meet the needs of the agencies and their clients
that also meet NSP3 requirements of vacant, abandoned, or foreclosed upon. Identifying properties that meet the location, unit size and
number, accessibilty needs, and low costs of operations of the agency and clients is critical to finding a local partner to acquire and manage
the rental units after the units are rehabiltated with NSP3 funds.
,
It is expected that funds used for this activity will be used to meet the low-income housing requirement for those below 50% of area median
income (AMI). The City will work with local partner housing and social service agencies to find tenants who are income qualified and in need of
affordable housing opportunities in our city, paying special attention to persons at or below 50% AMI.

Narratives
Summary of Distribution and Uses of NSP Funds:
The City of Elkhart utilized the HUD NSP3 mapping tool as well as the needs data provided by HUD to determine a general area of need for
the community. This information was then compared with the existing NSP1 area and the Neighborhood Revitalization Strategy Area as well
as a list of tax delinquent properties available from Elkhart County to narrow the area of need down to a smaller area. This area was then
mapped and determined to be the area of greatest need for the NSP3 program.
,
The first phase of this evaluation was to use the NSP3 needs data. The City of Elkhart has 82 Census Block Groups (CBG) in this data set.
Each of those CBGs had an NSP3 needs score of 18 or greater. This indicated that any of the CBGs in Elkhart would meet the minimum
requirement of an NSP3 needs score of 17. Several of the CDBs had fewer than 3 households so those were removed from the evaluation
because the area was not considered to be residential in nature. This process left 60 CBGs to be reviewed for percent of households that are
51% or greater low-mod-medium income level. Of those 60 CBGs, 54 met that criterion. This provided the largest potential area for the NSP3
program. This area was then compared to two defined areas of need in the community, the NSP1 area and the CDBG Neighborhood
Revitalization Strategy Area.
,
The data for these CBGs was then reviewed for vacancy rates (COMBINED VAC), agreement numbers (HMDA), high cost agreements (HCRATES), seriously delinquent agreements (SDQ-RATES), number of foreclosure starts (STARTS), completed foreclosures (REO), and
number of projects to make an impact (IMPACT).
,
From this data it was determined that each block group is eligible under NSP3 by having a Needs Score of 17 or more. When the additional
data points are reviewed it becomes clear that each CGB has some characteristic that makes it relatively higher or lower in need based on
that data point. This data is useful in providing an overview of a large eligible area but does not provide a clear picture of a reasonably-sized
area of greatest need.
,
The City of Elkhart is a recipient of NSP1 funds as well as an entitlement community for CDBG funds. The NSP1 area is very similar to the
existing NRSA for the City of Elkhart. This area has been shown over time and through the NSP1 and the CDBG Consolidated Plan planning
processes to be the area in the community that has the greatest needs. The decision to focus NSP3 efforts in the same general areas as
these existing redevelopment efforts was in great part due to a desire by the City to provide comprehensive redevelopment of an area already
determined to be in the greatest need in our community.
,
NRSA Census Block Group Data plus CBG 22.5
,
Elkhart County&rsquos list of tax delinquent properties that did not sell in the October 2010 tax sale contained one hundred four parcels. The
City and County worked together in 2010 to transfer tax-delinquent properties that had not sold at one or more tax sales to the City of Elkhart
Redevelopment Commission for use in the NSP1 program. The intent for NSP3 is to continue with this model for several reasons, including
but not limited to the following:
> 1. The tax-foreclosure process makes these properties eligible for acquisition under the NSP3 rules.
> 2. These pro

perties can be acquired with clean title through the tax-foreclosure process.
> 3. Tax-delinquent properties that are not redeemed by owners or purchased at the tax sale are generally
>
less marketable and least likely to be redeveloped by the private sector as proven by the lack of interest
>
in keeping or obtaining ownership.
> 4. These properties are generally in very poor condition due to the lack of interest or financial capacity of
>
the owner and create a blighting influence on the neighborhood.
> 5. These properties can be acquired at a very low cost, allowing the NSP3 project to impact more
>
properties.
>When the list of tax sale parcels was mapped in relation to the existing NSP1 and NRSA boundaries, 83 of the 104 parcels were inside those
boundaries furthering the argument that this is the area of greatest need. That said, this area was deemed to be too large to serve as the
NSP3 area. For this reason NSP1- and CDBG-funded projects were mapped as well to determine if a cluster of projects would be found. This
mapping process provided a basis for the NSP3 mapping area defined in the NSP3 mapping tool. ,
This map provides locations of NSP1 projects and projects funded with CDBG since 2008 in brown. The green markers indicate the location
of the 104 tax delinquent parcels. The red outline is the current NRSA. As noted, many of the tax delinquent properties fall within the existing
NRSA. To finalize the NSP3 area of greatest need, the City decided to extend the designated central area of the NRSA an additional three
blocks south of the current southern boundary to take advantage of a cluster of eligible tax delinquent properties that lay just outside the
existing NRSA boundaries.

How Fund Use Addresses Market Conditions:
Housing Type & Quality Analysis
,
Housing professionals are most often concerned about the provision of affordable housing to low, moderate and middle-income individuals
and families. In order to be considered of these income, a family&rsquos income must be at or below 120 percent of the Area Median Income
(AMI) for their particular family size. Low income is considered to be 50 percent of the AMI, and very low income is considered to be at 30
percent of the AMI. Income limits based on these percentages are used to determine eligibility for various assistance programs.
,
The City of Elkhart has more than 23,000 housing units (owner and rental). Of these units, 87 percent are occupied and 13 percent are vacant.
The homeowner vacancy rate is more than 5 percent; the rental vacancy rate is just over 8 percent. Fifty-four percent of Elkhart&rsquos
housing units are owneroccupied and 46 percent are renter occupied. (Source: American Community Survey, 2006-2008)
,
Owner-Occupied Units
,
Recent changes in the local and national economies and, in particular, the housing market have had profound effects on Elkhart&rsquos
housing values, housing stock, and housing conditions. Increases in the City&rsquos and region&rsquos unemployment rates, from the
County&rsquos 5.3 percent unemployment rate in January 2008 to an unemployment high of 18.8 percent in March 2009 to the current 15.6
percent in January 2010 have increasd the number of housing units listed for sale, decreased the number of units sold, and decreased the
sale price to list price ratio.
,
It is anticipated that the Michiana real estate market will remain sluggish as the outcomes in financial markets and the regional economy (in
particular the recreational vehicle and manufactured housing industries) remain uncertain. Elkhart will likely continue to face weak housing
markets because of the weak demand, growing inventories of existing homes, and tougher credit markets.
,
The 2004 Housing Needs Assessment found that there was a "booming housing market" for middle- and upper-middle-income homes, while
the low- to moderate-income housing market had not kept pace. Additionally, it was determined that the housing stock available to low- and
moderate-income residents was deteriorating due to inadequacies in public policy and insufficient maintenance resources.
,
Housing values, as a whole, have decreased throughout Elkhart, the State of Indiana, the Midwest, and many other locations throughout the
United States. The decrease in values has increased the number of housing units considered "affordable." The City has not increased its
affordable housing inventory; the market has devalued the existing housing inventory (through an oversupply of units and lower demands).
Thus, the choice of housing units, at all price points, has increased for employed potential homeowners who qualify for a mortgage and have a
sufficient down payment.
,
Renter-Occupied Units

In 2008, 46 percent of Elkhart&rsquos housing units were renter occupied (Source: American Community Survey). According to forecasts by
ESRI, in 2014, it is anticipated that the percentage of renter-occupied units will decrease to 38 percent. It is important to note that rental unit
vacancies increased from just over eight percent to 13 percent between 2000 and 2008 respectiv

he attributed to the sluggish economy, along with increased property taxes (re-assessments in the mid-2000s), higher insurance premiums,
increased utility bills, and an increased number of rental properties for sale and in foreclosure.,
The 2008 median rent was $627 per month. The Elkhart-Goshen MSA 2009 Fair Market Rent (FMR) is $731 per month for a two-bedroom

unit, which is greater than the Indiana FMR of $697 per month. (Source: National Low Income Housing Coalition, 2009) Nearly 68 percent of
Elkhart&rsquos rental housing stock rents for less than the FMR. However, 42 percent of renters are unable to afford FMR. (Source: American
Community Survey, 2006-2008) The maximum affordable monthly housing cost for a family of four at 30 percent of the AMI is $444 per month.
,
The basic unit of housing consumption is the household. Housing demand can be assessed by examining various demographic characteristics
relating to the number and composition of households within a community. These primary characteristics are:
,
,
• Population
,
• Number of Households
,
• Persons per Household
,
• Age of the Population
,
• Income Levels
,
,
Housing demand is also influenced by individual household choices relative to housing type, location, and cost. Furthermore, households
make individual decisions concerning what they are willing and able to pay for housing. Vacancy rates are an important housing indicator
because they often reflect the degree of housing choices available. A high vacancy rate usually suggests a high degree of choice, while a low
vacancy rate is often indicative of a relatively low degree of choice and higher housing costs.
,
Currently, the general Elkhart housing supply exceeds the general demand. The table below illustrates the housing supply product as an
index of housing availability, in particular for potential homeowners. When calculating the housing supply product for the overall Elkhart
population, there is an inventory of housing units, both rental and owner occupied, available (more than 23,000) for more than 20,000
households. These calculations are based on ESRI&rsquos population projections for 2009.
,
Households earning up to 120 percent of the AMI, $$71,150 or less for a family of four, have sufficient choice in housing options as well.
Available housing units were determined by multiplying an annual household income by three to determine house purchase price. In the case
of a 120 percent AMI household, the maximum purchase price, or value, is $213,120. There are an estimated 23,000 units with a value of less
than $213,120. It is important to note that this calculation of total units includes all housing units, both owner occupied and rental. This
indicates that all rental units and all but approximately 700 of the for sale units would be affordable to this income groups. This reflects the
decrease in housing values that has occurred in the last two years, coupled with an increase of supply obtained through new construction and
annexation.
,
Households earning 80 percent of the AMI, $47,360 or less for a family of four, have sufficient choice in housing options as well. Available
housing units were determined by multiplying an annual household income by three to determine house purchase price. In the case of an 80
percent AMI household, the maximum purchase price, or value, is $142, 080. There ar

How Fund Use Addresses Market Conditions:
e an estimated 22,073 units with a value of less than $142,080. This is more than double the number of units at this price point in 2000. It is
important to note that this calculation of total units includes all housing units, both owner occupied and rental. This reflects the decrease in
housing values that has occurred in the last two years, coupled with an increase of supply obtained through new construction and annexation.,
Housing options for low- and very-low-income residents are limited by affordability and availability. The housing supply product for households
earning 50 percent of the AMI, $29,600 or less for a family of four, is lower than the demand. It is estimated that there are approximately 5,500
housing units with a purchase price/value of $88,800 or less for more than 7,000 households in this income category. There is an inadequate
supply of housing for households considered low- and very-low-income, and it can be surmised that the quality and location of the available
affordable units are also inadequate.

The City of Elkhart will enforce rent and occupancy requirements through a recorded agreement. This agreement will contain all programmatic
conditions and will be signed at the property closing. The agreement will then be recorded with the Elkhart County Recorder&rsquos Office.
The property owner will be expected to provide proof of income-qualified tenants at the initial time of occupancy of the entire term of the
affordability period.
,
It is important to note that, if the assistance for this project was made to meet the set-aside requirement to serve persons at or below 50%
AMI, all subsequent tenants must meet the same income standards of 50% AMI at initial occupancy during the term of the affordability period.
,
The agreement will be released upon completion of the affordability period. If the property would transfer ownership within the affordability
period, the new owner would assume the agreement and all programmatic conditions involved.

It is important to note, that if the sale is made to persons at or below 50% AMI and that sale was used to meet the minimum investment for
persons at or below 50%AMI, the subsequent sale during the affordability period would have to be to a person at or below 50% AMI to meet
the regulatory requirement of the NSP program.

If an income-qualified homebuyer cannot be identified by the owner, assistance from local partners, including but not limited to, La Casa Inc.,
Habitat for Humanity, and other local housing agencies will be utilized to find an income eligible homebuyer.

Definition of Blighted Structure:
The term "blighted structure" is not defined in any City of Elkhart ordinance nor is it defined in the State of Indiana Unsafe Building Law or in
the 2006 International Property Maintenance Code that has been adopted by the City of Elkhart. For this reason the City of Elkhart will
consider "blighted structure" to be equivalent to the term "unsafe building" as defined in the State of Indiana Unsafe Building Law:
,
IC 36-7-9-4 Unsafe buildings and unsafe premises described:
,
Sec. 4. (a) For purposes of this chapter, a building or structure, or any part of a building or structure, that is:
>
(1) in an impaired structural condition that makes it unsafe to a person or property;
>
(2) a fire hazard;
>
(3) a hazard to the public health;
,
(4) a public nuisance;
>
(5) dangerous to a person or property because of a violation of a statute or ordinance concerning building condition or maintenance; or
>
(6) vacant and not maintained in a manner that would allow human habitation, occupancy, or use under the requirements of a statute or
an ordinance; is considered an unsafe building.
> (b) For purposes of this chapter:
>
(1) an unsafe building; and
>
(2) the tract of real property on which the unsafe building is located; are considered unsafe premises.
> (c) For purposes of this chapter, a tract of real property that does not contain a building or structure, not including land used for production
agriculture, is considered an unsafe premises if the tract of real property is:
>
(1) a fire hazard;
>
(2) a hazard to public health;
>
(3) a public nuisance; or
>
(4) dangerous to a person or property because of a violation of a statute or an ordinance.

Note: Grantees may use the definition they have adopted for their CDBG program but should review their existing definition to ensure
compliance with NSP program &ndashspecific requirements such as continued affordability.
,
Response:
,
"Affordable Rents" is defined as the rent limits provided by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) annually. This rent
limit is designed to ensure that units built using program funds are affordable to low- and very low-income households. The rent limit for a
given unit is the maximum rent a property owner may charge for the unit. Any rental housing produced with NSP funds will follow HOME rent
limits for the entire affordability period based on the NSP lien recorded for that property. Rental units produced to meet the set-aside
requirements for households at or below 50% AMI must use the Low HOME rent limits. For housing units not subject to the 50% AMI set-aside
requirements, the fair market rent or High HOME rent limits, whichever is higher, will act as the maximum rent allowable unless other
provisions are noted in the NSP lien document recorded for the property.

Vicinity Hiring:
The City of Elkhart is committed to implementing the vicinity hiring preference in its NSP3 activities. The City of Elkhart has a Section 3 plan
that currently requires that all job announcements for contractors with CDBG or NSP contracts must be posted with the Elkhart Housing
Authority and the Work Force Development Office. These offices are within the area of greatest need. City staff will also review existing
CDBG-approved contractors to determine if any are located within the area of greatest need. Staff will also review the local phone book for
contractors located within the area of greatest need. These contractors will be notified that they will be eligible for the NSP3 vicinity hiring
preference with all NSP3 contracts. City staff will participate in the webinar scheduled to provide guidance on the vicinity hiring preference on
March 3, 2011.

Procedures for Preferences for Affordable Rental Dev.:
This is the City of Elkhart&rsquos preference for development of affordable rental housing with NSP3. The housing market in Elkhart has been
negatively impacted by the extreme economic down turn the area has experienced. According to CHAS data used in the housing needs
assessment conducted for the 2010-2015 Consolidated Plan, the City of Elkhart had 810 vacant homes for sale and 1,315 vacant units for
rent. The data from the US Census for 2005-2009 American Community Survey indicates that the vacancy rate for homeowner units is only
4.5% while it is 14.2% for rental units.
,
Given high vacancy rates, specifically in rental units, the project will provide for development of rental units that are owned by local not-forprofits and will focus those units on persons with special needs such as persons who are homeless, disabled, veterans, or victims of domestic
violence. By providing rental housing for special needs populations, the City can meet the goal of the NSP3 program to develop affordable
rental housing in a manner that addresses the high vacancy rates in rental housing units.
,
City staff will work closely with local not-for-profit agencies to identify housing units that would meet the needs of the agencies and their clients
that also meet NSP3 requirements of vacant, abandoned, or foreclosed upon. Identifying properties that meet the location, unit size and
number, accessibilty needs, and low costs of operations of the agency and clients is critical to finding a local partner to acquire and manage
the rental units after the units are rehabiltated with NSP3 funds.
,
It is expected that funds used for this activity will be used to meet the low-income housing requirement for those below 50% of area median
income (AMI). The City will work with local partner housing and social service agencies to find tenants who are income qualified and in need of
affordable housing opportunities in our city, paying special attention to persons at or below 50% AMI.

Narratives
Summary of Distribution and Uses of NSP Funds:
The City of Elkhart utilized the HUD NSP3 mapping tool as well as the needs data provided by HUD to determine a general area of need for
the community. This information was then compared with the existing NSP1 area and the Neighborhood Revitalization Strategy Area as well
as a list of tax delinquent properties available from Elkhart County to narrow the area of need down to a smaller area. This area was then
mapped and determined to be the area of greatest need for the NSP3 program.
The first phase of this evaluation was to use the NSP3 needs data. The City of Elkhart has 82 Census Block Groups (CBG) in this data set.
Each of those CBGs had an NSP3 needs score of 18 or greater. This indicated that any of the CBGs in Elkhart would meet the minimum
requirement of an NSP3 needs score of 17. Several of the CDBs had fewer than 3 households so those were removed from the evaluation
because the area was not considered to be residential in nature. This process left 60 CBGs to be reviewed for percent of households that are
51% or greater low-mod-medium income level. Of those 60 CBGs, 54 met that criterion. This provided the largest potential area for the NSP3
program. This area was then compared to two defined areas of need in the community, the NSP1 area and the CDBG Neighborhood
Revitalization Strategy Area.
The data for these CBGs was then reviewed for vacancy rates (COMBINED VAC), agreement numbers (HMDA), high cost agreements (HCRATES), seriously delinquent agreements (SDQ-RATES), number of foreclosure starts (STARTS), completed foreclosures (REO), and
number of projects to make an impact (IMPACT).
From this data it was determined that each block group is eligible under NSP3 by having a Needs Score of 17 or more. When the additional
data points are reviewed it becomes clear that each CGB has some characteristic that makes it relatively higher or lower in need based on
that data point. This data is useful in providing an overview of a large eligible area but does not provide a clear picture of a reasonably-sized
area of greatest need.
The City of Elkhart is a recipient of NSP1 funds as well as an entitlement community for CDBG funds. The NSP1 area is very similar to the
existing NRSA for the City of Elkhart. This area has been shown over time and through the NSP1 and the CDBG Consolidated Plan planning
processes to be the area in the community that has the greatest needs. The decision to focus NSP3 efforts in the same general areas as
these existing redevelopment efforts was in great part due to a desire by the City to provide comprehensive redevelopment of an area already
determined to be in the greatest need in our community.
NRSA Census Block Group Data plus CBG 22.5
Elkhart County&rsquos list of tax delinquent properties that did not sell in the October 2010 tax sale contained one hundred four parcels. The
City and County worked together in 2010 to transfer tax-delinquent properties that had not sold at one or more tax sales to the City of Elkhart
Redevelopment Commission for use in the NSP1 program. The intent for NSP3 is to continue with this model for several reasons, including
but not limited to the following:
> 1. The tax-foreclosure process makes these properties eligible for acquisition under the NSP3 rules.
> 2. These properties can be acquired with clean title through the tax-foreclosure process.
> 3. Tax-delinquent properties that are not redeemed by owners or purchased at the tax sale are generally
>
less marketable and least likely to be redeveloped by the private sector as proven by the lack of interest
>
in keeping or obtaining ownership.
> 4. These properties are generally in very poor condition due to the lack of interest or financial capacity of
>
the owner and create a blighting influence on the neighborhood.
> 5. These properties can be acquired at a very low cost, allowing the NSP3 project to impact more
>
properties.
>When the list of tax sale parcels was mapped in relation to the existing NSP1 and NRSA boundaries, 83 of the 104 parcels were inside those
boundaries furthering the argument that this is the area of greatest need. That said, this area was deemed to be too large to serve as the
NSP3 area. For this reason NSP1- and CDBG-funded projects were mapped as well to determine if a cluster of projects would be found. This

mapping process provided a basis for the NSP3 mapping area defined in the NSP3 mapping tool.
This map provides locations of NSP1 projects and projects funded with CDBG since 2008 in brown. The green markers indicate the location
of the 104 tax delinquent parcels. The red outline is the current NRSA. As noted, many of the tax delinquent properties fall within the existing
NRSA. To finalize the NSP3 area of greatest need, the City decided to extend the designated central area of the NRSA an additional three
blocks south of the current southern boundary to take advantage of a cluster of eligible tax delinquent properties that lay just outside the
existing NRSA boundaries.

How Fund Use Addresses Market Conditions:
Housing Type & Quality Analysis
Housing professionals are most often concerned about the provision of affordable housing to low, moderate and middle-income individuals
and families. In order to be considered of these income, a family&rsquos income must be at or below 120 percent of the Area Median Income
(AMI) for their particular family size. Low income is considered to be 50 percent of the AMI, and very low income is considered to be at 30
percent of the AMI. Income limits based on these percentages are used to determine eligibility for various assistance programs.
The City of Elkhart has more than 23,000 housing units (owner and rental). Of these units, 87 percent are occupied and 13 percent are vacant.
The homeowner vacancy rate is more than 5 percent; the rental vacancy rate is just over 8 percent. Fifty-four percent of Elkhart&rsquos
housing units are owneroccupied and 46 percent are renter occupied. (Source: American Community Survey, 2006-2008)
Owner-Occupied Units
Recent changes in the local and national economies and, in particular, the housing market have had profound effects on Elkhart&rsquos
housing values, housing stock, and housing conditions. Increases in the City&rsquos and region&rsquos unemployment rates, from the
County&rsquos 5.3 percent unemployment rate in January 2008 to an unemployment high of 18.8 percent in March 2009 to the current 15.6
percent in January 2010 have increasd the number of housing units listed for sale, decreased the number of units sold, and decreased the
sale price to list price ratio.
It is anticipated that the Michiana real estate market will remain sluggish as the outcomes in financial markets and the regional economy (in
particular the recreational vehicle and manufactured housing industries) remain uncertain. Elkhart will likely continue to face weak housing
markets because of the weak demand, growing inventories of existing homes, and tougher credit markets.
The 2004 Housing Needs Assessment found that there was a "booming housing market" for middle- and upper-middle-income homes, while
the low- to moderate-income housing market had not kept pace. Additionally, it was determined that the housing stock available to low- and
moderate-income residents was deteriorating due to inadequacies in public policy and insufficient maintenance resources.
Housing values, as a whole, have decreased throughout Elkhart, the State of Indiana, the Midwest, and many other locations throughout the
United States. The decrease in values has increased the number of housing units considered "affordable." The City has not increased its
affordable housing inventory; the market has devalued the existing housing inventory (through an oversupply of units and lower demands).
Thus, the choice of housing units, at all price points, has increased for employed potential homeowners who qualify for a mortgage and have a
sufficient down payment.
Renter-Occupied Units
In 2008, 46 percent of Elkhart&rsquos housing units were renter occupied (Source: American Community Survey). According to forecasts by
ESRI, in 2014, it is anticipated that the percentage of renter-occupied units will decrease to 38 percent. It is important to note that rental unit
vacancies increased from just over eight percent to 13 percent between 2000 and 2008 respectiv. The attributed to the sluggish economy,
along with increased property taxes (re-assessments in the mid-2000s), higher insurance premiums, increased utility bills, and an increased
number of rental properties for sale and in foreclosure.
The 2008 median rent was $627 per month. The Elkhart-Goshen MSA 2009 Fair Market Rent (FMR) is $731 per month for a two-bedroom
unit, which is greater than the Indiana FMR of $697 per month. (Source: National Low Income Housing Coalition, 2009) Nearly 68 percent of
Elkhart&rsquos rental housing stock rents for less than the FMR. However, 42 percent of renters are unable to afford FMR. (Source: American
Community Survey, 2006-2008) The maximum affordable monthly housing cost for a family of four at 30 percent of the AMI is $444 per month.
The basic unit of housing consumption is the household. Housing demand can be assessed by examining various demographic characteristics
relating to the number and composition of households within a community. These primary characteristics are:
• Population
• Number of Households
• Persons per Household
• Age of the Population
• Income Levels
Housing demand is also influenced by individual household choices relative to housing type, location, and cost. Furthermore, households
make individual decisions concerning what they are willing and able to pay for housing. Vacancy rates are an important housing indicator
because they often reflect the degree of housing choices available. A high vacancy rate usually suggests a high degree of choice, while a low
vacancy rate is often indicative of a relatively low degree of choice and higher housing costs.
Currently, the general Elkhart housing supply exceeds the general demand. The table below illustrates the housing supply product as an
index of housing availability, in particular for potential homeowners. When calculating the housing supply product for the overall Elkhart
population, there is an inventory of housing units, both rental and owner occupied, available (more than 23,000) for more than 20,000
households. These calculations are based on ESRI&rsquos population projections for 2009.
Households earning up to 120 percent of the AMI, $$71,150 or less for a family of four, have sufficient choice in housing options as well.
Available housing units were determined by multiplying an annual household income by three to determine house purchase price. In the case
of a 120 percent AMI household, the maximum purchase price, or value, is $213,120. There are an estimated 23,000 units with a value of less
than $213,120. It is important to note that this calculation of total units includes all housing units, both owner occupied and rental. This
indicates that all rental units and all but approximately 700 of the for sale units would be affordable to this income groups. This reflects the
decrease in housing values that has occurred in the last two years, coupled with an increase of supply obtained through new construction and
annexation.
Households earning 80 percent of the AMI, $47,360 or less for a family of four, have sufficient choice in housing options as well. Available

housing units were determined by multiplying an annual household income by three to determine house purchase price. In the case of an 80
percent AMI household, the maximum purchase price, or value, is $142, 080. There are an estimated 22,073 units with a value of less than
$142,080. This is more than double the number of units at this price point in 2000. It is important to note that this calculation of total units
includes all housing units, both owner occupied and rental. This reflects the decrease in housing values that has occurred in the last two
years, coupled with an increase of supply obtained through new construction and annexation.
Housing options for low- and very-low-income residents are limited by affordability and availability. The housing supply product for households
earning 50 percent of the AMI, $29,600 or less for a family of four, is lower than the demand. It is estimated that there are approximately 5,500
housing units with a purchase price/value of $88,800 or less for more than 7,000 households in this income category. There is an inadequate
supply of housing for households considered low- and very-low-income, and it can be surmised that the quality and location of the available
affordable units are also inadequate.

The City of Elkhart will enforce rent and occupancy requirements through a recorded agreement. This agreement will contain all programmatic
conditions and will be signed at the property closing. The agreement will then be recorded with the Elkhart County Recorder&rsquos Office.
The property owner will be expected to provide proof of income-qualified tenants at the initial time of occupancy of the entire term of the
affordability period.
It is important to note that, if the assistance for this project was made to meet the set-aside requirement to serve persons at or below 50%
AMI, all subsequent tenants must meet the same income standards of 50% AMI at initial occupancy during the term of the affordability period.
The agreement will be released upon completion of the affordability period. If the property would transfer ownership within the affordability
period, the new owner would assume the agreement and all programmatic conditions involved.
For Homebuyer Activities the following chart provides affordability period requirements.

The City of Elkhart will enforce the affordability period through a recorded agreement. This agreement will refer to a note containing all
programmatic conditions and will be signed at the property closing. The agreement will then be recorded with the Elkhart County
Recorder&rsquos Office. The agreement will be released upon completion of the affordability period. If the property would transfer ownership
within the affordability period, the new owner would assume the agreement and all programmatic conditions involved.
It is important to note, that if the sale is made to persons at or below 50% AMI and that sale was used to meet the minimum investment for
persons at or below 50%AMI, the subsequent sale during the affordability period would have to be to a person at or below 50% AMI to meet
the regulatory requirement of the NSP program.
If an income-qualified homebuyer cannot be identified by the owner, assistance from local partners, including but not limited to, La Casa Inc.,
Habitat for Humanity, and other local housing agencies will be utilized to find an income eligible homebuyer.

Definition of Blighted Structure:
The term "blighted structure" is not defined in any City of Elkhart ordinance nor is it defined in the State of Indiana Unsafe Building Law or in
the 2006 International Property Maintenance Code that has been adopted by the City of Elkhart. For this reason the City of Elkhart will
consider "blighted structure" to be equivalent to the term "unsafe building" as defined in the State of Indiana Unsafe Building Law:
IC 36-7-9-4 Unsafe buildings and unsafe premises described:
Sec. 4. (a) For purposes of this chapter, a building or structure, or any part of a building or structure, that is:
>
(1) in an impaired structural condition that makes it unsafe to a person or property;
>
(2) a fire hazard;
>
(3) a hazard to the public health;
(4) a public nuisance;
>
(5) dangerous to a person or property because of a violation of a statute or ordinance concerning building condition or maintenance; or
>
(6) vacant and not maintained in a manner that would allow human habitation, occupancy, or use under the requirements of a statute or
an ordinance; is considered an unsafe building.
> (b) For purposes of this chapter:
>
(1) an unsafe building; and
>
(2) the tract of real property on which the unsafe building is located; are considered unsafe premises.
> (c) For purposes of this chapter, a tract of real property that does not contain a building or structure, not including land used for production
agriculture, is considered an unsafe premises if the tract of real property is:
>
(1) a fire hazard;
>
(2) a hazard to public health;
>
(3) a public nuisance; or
>
(4) dangerous to a person or property because of a violation of a statute or an ordinance.
>As added by Acts 1981, P.L.309, SEC.28. Amended by P.L.14-1991, SEC.9; P.L.66-2005, SEC.1.

Definition of Affordable Rents:
C. Definitions and Description
The following definition of affordable rent is to replace the former definition provided in the NSP plan.
(2) Definition of "affordable rents."
Note: Grantees may use the definition they have adopted for their CDBG program but should review their existing definition to ensure
compliance with NSP program &ndashspecific requirements such as continued affordability.
Response:
"Affordable Rents" is defined as the rent limits provided by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) annually. This rent
limit is designed to ensure that units built using program funds are affordable to low- and very low-income households. The rent limit for a
given unit is the maximum rent a property owner may charge for the unit. Any rental housing produced with NSP funds will follow HOME rent
limits for the entire affordability period based on the NSP lien recorded for that property. Rental units produced to meet the set-aside
requirements for households at or below 50% AMI must use the Low HOME rent limits. For housing units not subject to the 50% AMI set-aside
requirements, the fair market rent or High HOME rent limits, whichever is higher, will act as the maximum rent allowable unless other
provisions are noted in the NSP lien document recorded for the property.

Housing Rehabilitation/New Construction Standards:
The City of Elkhart has adopted the following building codes for residential properties in the City&rsquos jurisdiction.
Indiana Residential Code, 2005 Edition. (This includes Structural, Plumbing and Mechanical Rules) 2003 International Residential Code for

rehabilitation in addition to the following HUD required standards:

• All gut rehabilitation or new construction (i.e., general replacement of the interior of a building that may or may not include changes to
structural elements such as flooring systems, columns or load-bearing interior or exterior walls) of residential buildings up to three stories must
be designed to meet the standard for Energy Star Qualified New Homes.
• All gut rehabilitation or new construction of mid- or high-rise multifamily housing must be designed to meet American Society of
Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Standard 90.1-2004, Appendix G plus 20 percent (which is the Energy Star
standard for multifamily buildings piloted by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy).
• Other rehabilitation must meet these standards to the extent applicable to the rehabilitation work undertaken; e.g., replace older
obsolete products and appliances (such as windows, doors, lighting, hot water heaters, furnaces, boilers, air conditioning units, refrigerators,
clothes washers and dishwashers) with Energy Star-46 labeled products.
• Water efficient toilets, showers, and faucets, such as those with the WaterSense label, must be installed.

Vicinity Hiring:
The City of Elkhart is committed to implementing the vicinity hiring preference in its NSP3 activities. The City of Elkhart has a Section 3 plan
that currently requires that all job announcements for contractors with CDBG or NSP contracts must be posted with the Elkhart Housing
Authority and the Work Force Development Office. These offices are within the area of greatest need. City staff will also review existing
CDBG-approved contractors to determine if any are located within the area of greatest need. Staff will also review the local phone book for
contractors located within the area of greatest need. These contractors will be notified that they will be eligible for the NSP3 vicinity hiring
preference with all NSP3 contracts. City staff will participate in the webinar scheduled to provide guidance on the vicinity hiring preference on
March 3, 2011.

Procedures for Preferences for Affordable Rental Dev.:
This is the City of Elkhart&rsquos preference for development of affordable rental housing with NSP3. The housing market in Elkhart has been
negatively impacted by the extreme economic down turn the area has experienced. According to CHAS data used in the housing needs
assessment conducted for the 2010-2015 Consolidated Plan, the City of Elkhart had 810 vacant homes for sale and 1,315 vacant units for
rent. The data from the US Census for 2005-2009 American Community Survey indicates that the vacancy rate for homeowner units is only
4.5% while it is 14.2% for rental units.
Given high vacancy rates, specifically in rental units, the project will provide for development of rental units that are owned by local not-forprofits and will focus those units on persons with special needs such as persons who are homeless, disabled, veterans, or victims of domestic
violence. By providing rental housing for special needs populations, the City can meet the goal of the NSP3 program to develop affordable

rental housing in a manner that addresses the high vacancy rates in rental housing units.
City staff will work closely with local not-for-profit agencies to identify housing units that would meet the needs of the agencies and their clients
that also meet NSP3 requirements of vacant, abandoned, or foreclosed upon. Identifying properties that meet the location, unit size and
number, accessibilty needs, and low costs of operations of the agency and clients is critical to finding a local partner to acquire and manage
the rental units after the units are rehabiltated with NSP3 funds.
It is expected that funds used for this activity will be used to meet the low-income housing requirement for those below 50% of area median
income (AMI). The City will work with local partner housing and social service agencies to find tenants who are income qualified and in need of
affordable housing opportunities in our city, paying special attention to persons at or below 50% AMI.

Narratives
Summary of Distribution and Uses of NSP Funds:
The City of Elkhart utilized the HUD NSP3 mapping tool as well as the needs data provided by HUD to determine a general area of need for
the community. This information was then compared with the existing NSP1 area and the Neighborhood Revitalization Strategy Area as well
as a list of tax delinquent properties available from Elkhart County to narrow the area of need down to a smaller area. This area was then
mapped and determined to be the area of greatest need for the NSP3 program.
The first phase of this evaluation was to use the NSP3 needs data. The City of Elkhart has 82 Census Block Groups (CBG) in this data set.
Each of those CBGs had an NSP3 needs score of 18 or greater. This indicated that any of the CBGs in Elkhart would meet the minimum
requirement of an NSP3 needs score of 17. Several of the CDBs had fewer than 3 households so those were removed from the evaluation
because the area was not considered to be residential in nature. This process left 60 CBGs to be reviewed for percent of households that are
51% or greater low-mod-medium income level. Of those 60 CBGs, 54 met that criterion. This provided the largest potential area for the NSP3
program. This area was then compared to two defined areas of need in the community, the NSP1 area and the CDBG Neighborhood
Revitalization Strategy Area.
The data for these CBGs was then reviewed for vacancy rates (COMBINED VAC), agreement numbers (HMDA), high cost agreements (HCRATES), seriously delinquent agreements (SDQ-RATES), number of foreclosure starts (STARTS), completed foreclosures (REO), and
number of projects to make an impact (IMPACT).
From this data it was determined that each block group is eligible under NSP3 by having a Needs Score of 17 or more. When the additional
data points are reviewed it becomes clear that each CGB has some characteristic that makes it relatively higher or lower in need based on
that data point. This data is useful in providing an overview of a large eligible area but does not provide a clear picture of a reasonable sized
area of greatest need.
The City of Elkhart is a recipient of NSP1 funds as well as an entitlement community for CDBG funds. The NSP1 area is very similar to the
existing NRSA for the City of Elkhart. This area has been shown over time and through the NSP1 and the CDBG Consolidated Plan planning
processes to be the area in the community that has the greatest needs. The decision to focus NSP3 efforts in the same general areas as
these existing redevelopment efforts was in great part due to a desire by the City to provide comprehensive redevelopment of an area already
determined to be in the greatest need in our community.
NRSA Census Block Group Data plus CBG 22.5
Elkhart County&rsquos list of tax delinquent properties that did not sell in the October 2010 tax sale contained one hundred four parcels. The
City and County worked together in 2010 to transfer tax-delinquent properties that had not sold at one or more tax sales to the City of Elkhart
Redevelopment Commission for use in the NSP1 program. The intent for NSP3 is to continue with this model for several reasons, including
but not limited to the following:
> 1. The tax-foreclosure process makes these properties eligible for acquisition under the NSP3 rules.
> 2. These properties can be acquired with clean title through the tax-foreclosure process.
> 3. Tax-delinquent properties that are not redeemed by owners or purchased at the tax sale are generally
>
less marketable and least likely to be redeveloped by the private sector as proven by the lack of interest
>
in keeping or obtaining ownership.
> 4. These properties are generally in very poor condition due to the lack of interest or financial capacity of
>
the owner and create a blighting influence on the neighborhood.
> 5. These properties can be acquired at a very low cost, allowing the NSP3 project to impact more
>
properties.
>When the list of tax sale parcels was mapped in relation to the existing NSP1 and NRSA boundaries, 83 of the 104 parcels were inside those
boundaries furthering the argument that this is the area of greatest need. That said this area was deemed to be too large to serve as the
2

NSP3 area. For this reason NSP1 and CDBG funded projects were mapped as well to determine if a cluster of projects would be found. This
mapping process provided a basis for the NSP3 mapping area defined in the NSP3 mapping tool.
This map provides locations of NSP1 projects and projects funded with CDBG since 2008 in brown. The green markers indicate the location
of the 104 tax delinquent parcels. The red outline is the current NRSA. As noted, many of the tax delinquent properties fall within the existing
NRSA. To finalize the NSP3 area of greatest need, the City decided to extend the designated central area of the NRSA an additional three
blocks south of the current southern boundary to take advantage of a cluster of eligible tax delinquent properties that lay just outside the
existing NRSA boundaries.

How Fund Use Addresses Market Conditions:
Housing Type & Quality Analysis
Housing professionals are most often concerned about the provision of affordable housing to low, moderate and middle-income individuals
and families. In order to be considered of these income, a family&rsquos income must be at or below 120 percent of the Area Median Income
(AMI) for their particular family size. Low income is considered to be 50 percent of the AMI, and very low income is considered to be at 30
percent of the AMI. Income limits based on these percentages are used to determine eligibility for various assistance programs.
The City of Elkhart has more than 23,000 housing units (owner and rental). Of these units, 87 percent are occupied and 13 percent are vacant.
The homeowner vacancy rate is more than 5 percent; the rental vacancy rate is just over 8 percent. Fifty-four percent of Elkhart&rsquos
housing units are owner-occupied and 46 percent are renter occupied (Source: American Community Survey, 2006-2008).
Owner-Occupied Units
Recent changes in the local and national economies and, in particular the housing market, have had profound effects on Elkhart&rsquos
housing values, housing stock, and housing conditions. Increases in the City&rsquos and region&rsquos unemployment rates, from the
County&rsquos 5.3 percent unemployment rate in January 2008 to an unemployment high of 18.8 percent in March 2009 to the current 15.6
percent in January 2010have increasd the number of housing units listed for sale, decreased the number of units sol, and decreased the sale
price to list price ratio.
It is anticipated that the Michiana real estate market will remain sluggish as the outcomes in financial markets and the regional economy (in
particular the recreational vehicle and manufactured housing industries) remain uncertain. Elkhart will likely continue to face weak housing
markets because of the weak demand, growing inventories of existing homes, and tougher credit markets.
The 2004 Housing Needs Assessment found that there was a "booming housing market" for middle and upper middle income homes, while
the low to moderate income housing market had not kept pace. Additionally, it was determined that the housing stock available to low and
moderate income residents was deteriorating due to inadequacies in public policy and insufficient maintenance resources.
Housing values, as a whole, have decreased throughout Elkhart, the State of Indiana, the Midwest, and many other locations throughout the
United States. The decrease in values has increased the number of housing units considered "affordable." The City has not increased its
affordable housing inventory; the market has devalued the existing housing inventory (through an oversupply of units and lower demands).
Thus, the choice of housing units, at all price points, has increased for employed potential homeowners who qualify for a mortgage and have a
sufficient down payment.
Renter-Occupied Units
In 2008, 46 percent of Elkhart&rsquos housing units were renter-occupied (Source: American Community Survey). According to forecasts by
ESRI, in 2014, it is anticipated that the percentage of renter-occupied units will decrease to 38 percent. It is important to note that rental unit
vacancies increased from just over eight percent to 13 percent between 2000 an2008 respectively. Tbe attributed to the sluggish economy,
along with increased property taxes (re-assessments in the mid-2000s), higher insurance premiums, increased utility bills, and an increased
number or rental properties for sale and in foreclosure.
The 2008 median rent was $627 per month. The Elkhart-Goshen MSA 2009 Fair Market Rent (FMR) is $731 per month for a two-bedroom
unit, which is greater than the Indiana FMR of $697 per month (Source: National Low Income Housing Coalition, 2009). Nearly 68 percent of
Elkhart&rsquos rental housing stock rents for less than the FMR. However, 42 percent of renters are unable to afford FMR. (Source: American
Community Survey, 2006-2008). The maximum affordable monthly housing cost for a family of four at 30 percent of the AMI is $444 per
month.Analysis
The basic unit of housing consumption is the household. Housing demand can be assessed by examining various demographic characteristics
relating to the number and composition of households within a community. These primary characteristics are:
• Population
• Number of Households
• Persons per Household
• Age of the Population
• Income Levels
Housing demand is also influenced by individual household choices relative to housing type, location, and cost. Furthermore, households
make individual decisions concerning what they are willing and able to pay for housing. Vacancy rates are an important housing indicator
because they often reflect the degree of housing chices available. A high vacancy rate usually suggests a high degree of choice, while a low
vacancy rate is often indicative of a relatively low degree of choice and higher housing costs.
Currently, the general Elkhart housing supply exceeds the general demand. The table below illustrates the housing supply product as an
index of housing availability, in particular for potential homeowners. When calculating the housing supply product for the overall Elkhart
population, there is an inventory of housing units, both rental and owner occupied, available (more than 23,000) for more than 20,000
households. These calculations are based on ESRI&rsquos population projections for 2009.
Households earning up to 120 percent of the AMI, $$71,150 or less for a family of four, have sufficient choice in housing options as well.
Available housing units were determined by multiplying an annual household income by three to determine house purchase price. In the case
of a 120 percent AMI household, the maximum purchase price, or value, is $213,120. There is an estimated 23,000 units with a value of less
than $213,120. It is important to note that this calculation of total units includes all housing units, both owner-occupied and rental. This
indicates that all rental units and all but approximately 700 of the for sale units would be affordable to this income groups. This reflects the
decrease in housing values that has occurred in the last two years, coupled with an increase of supply obtained through new construction and

3

annexation.
Households earning 80 percent of the AMI, $47,360 or less for a family of four, have sufficient choice in housing options as well. Available
housing units were determined by multiplying an annual household income by three to determine house purchase price. In the case of an 80
percent AMIhousehold, the maximum purchase price,orvalue, is $142, 080. There is an estimated 22,073 units with a value of less than
$142,080. This is more than double the number of units at this price point in 2000. It is important to note that this calculation of total units
includes all housing units, both owner-occupied and rental. This reflects the decrease in housing values that has occurred in the last two
years, coupled with an increase of supply obtained through new construction and annexation.
Housing options for low and very low income residents are limited by affordability and availability. The housing supply product for households
earning 50 percent of the AMI, $29,600 or less for a family of four is lower than the demand. It is estimated that there is approximately 5,500
housing units with a purchase price/value of $88,800 or less for more than 7,000 households in this income category. There is an inadequate
supply of housing for households considered low and very low income and it can be surmised that the quality and location of the available
affordable units are also inadequate.

The City of Elkhart will enforce rent and occupancy requirements through a recorded agreement. This agreement will contain all programmatic
conditions and will be signed at the property closing. The agreement will then be recorded with the Elkhart County Recorder&rsquos Office.
The property owner will be expected to provide proof of income-qualified tenants at the initial time of occupancy of the entire term of the
affordability period.
It is important to note that if the assistance for this project was made to meet the set-aside requirement to serve persons at or below 50% AMI
all subsequent tenants must meet the same income standards of 50% AMI at initial occupancy during the term of the affordability period.
The agreement will be released upon completion of the affordability period. If the property would transfer ownership within the affordability
period, the new owner would assume the agreement and all programmatic conditions involved.
For Homebuyer Activities the following chart provides affordability period requirements.

Recorder&rsquos Office. The agreement will be released upon completion of the affordability period. If the property would transfer ownership
within the affordability period, the new owner would assume the agreement and all programmatic conditions involved.
It is important to note that if the sale is made to persons at or below 50% AMI and that sale was used to meet the minimum investment for
persons at or below 50%AMI, the subsequent sale during the affordability period would have to be to a person at or below 50% AMI to meet
the regulator requirement of the NSP program.
If an income-qualified homebuyer cannot be identified by the owner, assistance from local partners, including but not limited to, La Casa Inc.,
Habitat for Humanity, and other local housing agencies will be utilized to find an income eligible homebuyer.

Definition of Blighted Structure:
The term "blighted structure" is not defined in any City of Elkhart ordinance nor is it defined in the State of Indiana Unsafe Building Law or in
the 2006 International Property Maintenance Code that has been adopted by the City of Elkhart. For this reason the City of Elkhart will
consider "blighted structure" to be equivalent to the term "unsafe building" as defined in the State of Indiana Unsafe Building Law:
The term "blighted structure" is not defined in any City of Elkhart ordinance nor is it defined in the State of Indiana Unsafe Building Law or in

consider "blighted structure" to be equivalent to the term "unsafe building" as defined in the State of Indiana Unsafe Building Law:
IC 36-7-9-4 Unsafe buildings and unsafe premises described:
Sec. 4. (a) For purposes of this chapter, a building or structure, or any part of a building or structure, that is:

Definition of Affordable Rents:
"Affordable Rents" for the NSP3 program are defined as the HOME rent limits provided by HUD annually to ensure that units built using
program funds are affordable to low- and very low-income households. The rent limit for a given unit is the maximum rent a property owner
may charge for the unit. The following table provides current HOME program rents for the Elkhart-Goshen MSA. Any rental housing produced
with NSP3 funds will follow HOME rent limits for the entire affordability period for households earning 60% or less of AMI. For households over
60% AMI and up to 120% AMI, the fair market rent will act as the maximum rent allowable.

Housing Rehabilitation/New Construction Standards:
The City of Elkhart has adopted the following building codes for residential properties in the City&rsquos jurisdiction.
Indiana Residential Code, 2005 Edition. (This includes Structural, Plumbing and Mechanical Rules) 2003 International Residential Code for
One and Two Family Dwellings, fifth printing, and Chapter 43 of the 2006 International Residential Code for One- and Two-Family Dwellings,

more visitability features in one-(1) and two-(2) family dwellings and Class 1 townhouses. In accordance with IC 22-13-4-7(g), the provisions of
this rule are not mandatory unless a person contracts with a designer or a builder for construction of a visitability feature adopted in this rule in
the new construction of a dwelling, in which case the designer and builder shall comply with the standards adopted in this rule for the design
and construction of the visitability feature.
Projects on three or more dwellings as well as all commercial projects are governed by:
Indiana Building Code, 2008 Edition.International Building Code, 2006 Edition, first printing, as amended.
Indiana Plumbing Code, 1999 Edition. Uniform Plumbing Code, 1997 Edition, as amended
Indiana Mechanical Code, 2008 Edition. International Mechanical Code, 2006 Edition, first printing, as amended

Indiana Electrical Code, 2005 Edition. National Electrical Code, 2005 edition, first printing, and errata to the first printing, as amended by the
State of Indiana.
All properties renovated with the NSP funds will be brought into compliance with the applicable residential codes for existing home
rehabilitation in addition to the following HUD required standards.
•
• All gut rehabilitation or new construction (i.e., general replacement of the interior of a building that may or may not include changes to
structural elements such as flooring systems, columns or load bearing interior or exterior walls) of residential buildings up to three stories must
be designed to meet the standard for Energy Star Qualified New Homes.
• All gut rehabilitation or new construction of mid- or high-rise multifamily housing must be designed to meet American Society of
Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Standard 90.1-2004, Appendix G plus 20 percent (which is the Energy Star
standard for multifamily buildings piloted by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy).
• Other rehabilitation must meet these standards to the extent applicable to the rehabilitation work undertaken, e.g., replace older
obsolete products and appliances (such as windows, doors, lighting, hot water heaters, furnaces, boilers, air conditioning units, refrigerators,
clothes washers and dishwashers) with Energy Star-46 labeled products.
• Water efficient toilets, showers, and faucets, such as those with the WaterSense label, must be installed.

Vicinity Hiring:
The City of Elkhart is committed to implementing the vicinity hiring preference in its NSP3 activities. The City of Elkhart has a Section 3 plan
that currently requires that all job announcements for contractors with CDBG or NSP contracts must be posted with the Elkhart Housing
Authority and the Work Force Development Office. These offices are within the area of greatest need. City staff will also review existing
CDBG-approved contractors to determine if any are located within the area of greatest need. Staff will also review the local phone book for
contractors located within the area of greatest need. These contractors will be notified that they will be eligible for the NSP3 vicinity hiring
preference with all NSP3 contracts. City staff will participate in the webinar scheduled to provide guidance on the vicinity hiring preference on
March 3, 2011.

Procedures for Preferences for Affordable Rental Dev.:
This is the City of Elkhart&rsquos preference for development of affordable rental housing with NSP3. The housing market in Elkhart has been
negatively impacted by the extreme economic down turn the area has experienced. According to CHAS data used in the housing needs
assessment conducted for the 2010-2015 Consolidated Plan, the City of Elkhart had 810 vacant homes for sale and 1,315 vacant units for
5
Community Development Systems
Disaster Recovery Grant Reporting System (DRGR)

rent. The data from the US Census for 2005-2009 American Community Survey indicates that the vacancy rate for homeowner units is only
4.5% while it is 14.2% for rental units.
Given high vacancy rates specifically in rental units, the project will provide for development of rental units that are owned by local not-forprofits and will focus those units on persons with special needs such as persons who are homeless, disabled, veterans, or victims of domestic
violence. By providing rental housing for special needs populations, the City can meet the goal of the NSP3 program to develop affordable
rental housing in a manner that addresses the high vacancy rates in rental housing units.
City staff will work closely with local not-for-profit agencies to identify housing units that would meet the needs the agency and their clients that
also meet NSP3 requirments of vacant, abandon, or foreclosed upon. Identifying properties that meet the location, unit size and number,
accessibilty needs, and low costs of operations of the agency and clients is critical to finding a local partner to acquire and manage the rental
units after the units are rehabiltation with NSP3 funds.
It is expected that funds used for this activity will be used to meet the low-income housing requirement for those below 50% of area median
income (AMI). The City will work with local partner housing and social service agencies to find tenants who are income qualified and in need of
affordable housing opportunities in our city, paying special attention to persons at or below 50% AMI.

Activity Progress Narrative:
Actual addresses for this activity have not yet been determined. Staff is in the process of evaluating the tax properties for their
suitablity for renovation. Since we acquired the properties site unseen, it is important that we evaluate their best use. The
addresses and project type will be determined during the 2nd quarter 2012 and reported in that QPR.
