Frequently Asked Questions (FAQS)
Q: What is the Clean Zone?
A: The Clean Zone is a geographically defined area where an Event Sponsor can approve temporary
activity based upon the content or type of activity. This approval is limited to temporary activity and
decisions are made in conjunction with the City of Indianapolis to ensure that the interests of residents
and neighbors are balanced with those of the event.

Q: How will my existing business operation be affected by the Clean Zone?
A: All lawful, existing business operations not engaging in temporary activity will not be affected by a
special event or creation of a Clean Zone. If you wish to make an improvement during this period that is
not temporary, you must use the typical process to obtain permits, Regional Center approval, etc.

Q: If I am erecting a temporary structure that has advertising signs or mobile
food set up within it, do I need to obtain multiple LDLs?
A: Yes, a separate LDL application, fee, and approval are required for each type of temporary activity.
For example, a tent that has a large advertisement imprinted on its roof would require an LDL for the
temporary structure and the temporary sign. Any sales within the tent would also require a separate LDL
for temporary vending.

Q: Where should I go to apply for a LDL?
A: LDL applications can be found at www.indy.gov/specialevent. Applications can be returned via email
to specialevents@indy.gov, in person, or mailed to the Department of Business & Neighborhood
Services, located at 1200 Madison Avenue, Suite 100, Indianapolis, Indiana 46225.

Q: How do I pay for a LDL?
A: Payments are not required at the time the application is submitted. If you do wish to pay in advance,
you may include a check with your application(s) made payable to the ‚ÄòCity of Indianapolis.‚Äô Otherwise,
once your application is processed you will receive an email with online payment instructions. Most LDLs
are $75.00. LDLs that require a bond or inspection are $139.00.

Frequently Asked Questions
Are residents able to ‚Äúopt out‚Äù of city-wide trash pick up entirely? No. Unfortunately, residents cannot ‚Äúopt out‚Äù of
this service in its entirety. In order to maintain a low rate, all residents must participate. This has not changed.
Are residents able to ‚Äútemporarily suspend‚Äù their garbage service? Yes! For those residents who have their
water/well and/or sewer service suspended, and are current with their garbage bill, you will have the opportunity to ‚Äútemporarily
suspend‚Äù garbage service. This would include vacant properties and those residents who travel south for the winter. This has
not changed.

When will I receive my trash tote from Earth First? Trash totes will be delivered to residents during the first three (3)
weeks of January, 2013. Until your tote arrives, all residents are asked to place their trash in plastic bags or other non-paper
containers and set it out at the curb on your regularly scheduled trash pick-up day. If you haven‚Äôt received your tote by January
25, 2013, please contact Earth First at 436-8700.

When will I receive my single stream recycling tote from Earth First? If you are a current recycling customer, your
recycling tote will be delivered during the first three (3) weeks of January, 2013. Until your recycle tote arrives, all residents are
asked to place any recyclables in plastic bags or other non-paper containers and set it out at the curb (separate from your trash)
on your regularly scheduled recycling pick-up day. If you haven‚Äôt received your recycling tote by January 25, 2013, please
contact Earth First at 436-8700. Recycling totes will be a green tote with a blue lid and clearly marked ‚ÄúRecyclables Only‚Äù.

What items can I recycle? Recycling is simple. Single stream recycling is the easiest way to recycle. That means all
recycling materials simply go into one recycling tote. Materials to be recycled will remain the same. For a complete list of what
you can and cannot put in your recycle container, visit the Earth First website at www.earthfirstservices.com.

How do I sign up for recycling service? All residents are encouraged to recycle. To sign up for recycling services, please
contact Earth First at 436-8700.

What is the designated day for garbage pick up?

Your collection day will not change!

What is the designated day for optional recycling service? Recycling collection is a bi-weekly service and will begin
the week of January 7th and will be on the same day as your garbage collection day.

Collection Hours - The hours for garbage collection will be from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Will the garbage fee be included on my water bill? No! Customers will receive a separate invoice from Earth First.
This has not changed.

When will I receive my first bill from Earth First? Earth First bills in advance, so you should expect to see your first bill
in early January. The service dates on your first invoice will be from January ‚Äì March, 2013. Since customers are billed every 3
months, you will be invoiced from Earth First only 4 times each year. For any billing questions, please contact Earth First at
436-8700.

Where should I set my tote(s) out for collection? Trash totes will need to be placed at your front curb at least 3 feet of
clearance around each tote for easy pick up. Earth First vehicles will not travel down alleys for garbage pick up. Do not set
your tote behind your house in the alley.

Do I need to contact National Serv-All and cancel service? No. National Serv-All indicated that they will not invoice
customers beyond December 31st. Customers should contact National Serv-All at 747-4117 for any invoices received after
December 31st.

When will National Serv-All pick up my tote? National Serv-All will pick up their totes after their last week of service is
completed ‚Äì which is the last week in December. National Serv-All has requested that customers leave their totes out at the curb
after the last collection so they can easily be picked up shortly after. If you have additional questions, please contact National
Serv-All at 747-4117. Note: For your last scheduled pick up of the year, please plan to leave your National Serv-All tote at the curb.
Collection Questions and Residents who Require Special Assistance ‚Äì Questions on garbage collection and any
residents who require special assistance (i.e., elderly and disabled) should contact Earth First Customer Service.

Brian Redman, front, and Carl Leonard, both of Mitchell, buried line last week
for new high-speed Internet service being planned for Jasper by Smithville
Communications. The crew was working on the corner of St. Charles Street and
Pleasant View Drive.
By CANDY NEAL
cneal@dcherald.com

JASPER ‚Äî Officials from a Monroe County communications company will soon be
ready to begin connecting neighborhoods to a fiber network that will provide
potential customers in Jasper as much as one gigabyte of high-speed Internet
service.

Which neighborhoods will be connected first will depend on demand.

Smithville Telecom, a subsidiary of Smithville Communications of Ellettsville,
is installing fiber-optic lines throughout the city.

The company will announce in mid-October the first six neighborhoods eligible
for the service. Which one of those six will be first will depend on how many
people in those neighborhoods preregister for service, said Dave Brodin, chief
technology officer for Smithville.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to follow in order of demand,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúEventually every
fiber build-out will be done.‚Äù
About 70 percent of the trunk ring surrounding the city has been installed. The
ring is the network of cabling through which the digital service will move.

‚ÄúThe ring is what provides redundancy in the area,‚Äù Brodin said.
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what the (digital) traffic is traveling around. The traffic will be
moving pretty quickly on that ring.‚Äù

The ring is made of three-fourth-inch conduits that have fibers inside; each
conduit holds 144 fibers. ‚ÄúThe fibers are very thin,‚Äù Brodin said.

Most of the ring will be buried underground using a boring machine; a conduit
that is about 2 inches wide will be installed and hold the smaller three-
fourth-inch conduits. Some of the ring will be above ground, with the conduits
being strung across poles Smithville has gotten permission to use.

The work remaining to be done on the ring is on the city‚Äôs southeast side,
Brodin said.

‚ÄúWe expect to be done with the ring before we turn on the first set of
customers,‚Äù he said.

The company is also working on four network cabinets, which will house
networking equipment.

The concrete pad for the first cabinet has been poured at the corner of
Kluemper Road and Evans Lane; work has started for placing a second cabinet at
the intersection of St. Charles Street and Pleasant View Drive.

‚ÄúNow that we know where the first cabinets are being placed,‚Äù Brodin said,
‚Äúwe can start mapping where fiber would go in those neighborhoods.‚Äù

Service will come from the ring, go through one of the cabinets and then be
dispensed to orbitals that will be placed in neighborhoods. An orbital looks a
lot like a cabinet ‚Äî it‚Äôs also metal ‚Äî but is about the third of the size
of a cabinet. Like a network cabinet, an orbital will sit on the ground.

From there, cabling will run from an orbital to a building that subscribes to
the digital service. The location of the orbitals will be determined after the
cabinets are placed.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs where the service to the customers will come from,‚Äù Brodin said.
‚ÄúThe neighborhoods will be served out of those cabinets and orbitals.‚Äù

Once the company announces the first six neighborhoods eligible for service, it
will announce how people in those neighborhood can preregister for service.

‚ÄúAt the end of one month, the neighborhood that has most registrations will
go first,‚Äù Brodin said.

Usually, a Smithville representative goes ahead of the construction crew to
talk to the residents about the work that will be done in or near their yards.

‚ÄúSometimes there is confusion about right of way. A lot of people think they
own to the road. But there is a right of way for providers to install lines,‚Äù
Brodin said. ‚ÄúWe like to talk to everybody and tell them there will be a time
where it will be messy and assure them that it will be cleaned up.‚Äù

After a neighborhood is selected, crews will be in that neighborhood doing
construction. That‚Äôs likely when residents will hear more directly from
workers.

‚ÄúAt that point, there will be quite a bit of interaction,‚Äù Brodin said.
‚ÄúHomeowners who want service will have to give permission for us to go across
their property.‚Äù

Most of the work will be done underground. ‚ÄúBut if there is a challenge, like
a water line under the yard,‚Äù Brodin said, ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt want to hit that. So
we may have to go in their yard instead.‚Äù

Smithville plans to have public information sessions before it starts to
connecting buildings to the service.

‚ÄúOne of the big questions people have is, What are you going to do to my
home?‚Äô‚Äù Brodin said. ‚ÄúAt the sessions, we will show them the equipment
that will be placed on their home and take any other questions.‚Äù

The estimated $7 million project, which Smithville is funding, will be finished
in three years.
