First major infrastructure investment of McBarnes‚Äô administration focused on
children‚Äôs safety
Frankfort, IN ‚Äì In another achievement of his 100-Day Plan, Mayor Chris
McBarnes announced the City is pledging $29,000 to Frankfort Community Schools
to build new sidewalks leading to Suncrest Elementary School as the first major
community infrastructure improvement of his administration.
     Monies from the Economic Development Income Tax (EDIT) fund out of
     this year‚Äôs City budget will pay for the sidewalks.
     ‚ÄúI am pleased to announce this cooperative partnership between City
     government and our school system. There is no greater goal than
     maintaining our children‚Äôs safety. New sidewalks enhance the
     walkability of our community, a major component of my neighborhood
     revitalization cornerstone.
     ‚ÄúCurrently, we are working with the School Board to determine the
     specific sidewalks needing attention. This project demonstrates the
     benefits that can be achieved by municipal government reaching out to
     entities in the community and joining forces to enhance the overall
     quality of life for all residents,‚Äù McBarnes said.
Approximately 5,800 feet of new sidewalks will be constructed with the EDIT
funds, including areas along Kyger Street, Barner Street and Walsh Avenue.
Suncrest Elementary is within Frankfort‚Äôs one-mile walk zone. Last year, the
School Board instituted full enforcement of the one-mile walk zone, meaning
that any students living within one mile of a Frankfort school cannot be
transported there by a school bus, thereby requiring students to either walk or
be driven to school by a parent or guardian.
According to Frankfort School Board Secretary Carol Bartley, the Board is
excited to be partnering with the City to provide the much needed sidewalks for
the safety of the walking population.
     ‚ÄúThe safety of our children is our top priority, so we are pleased
     to work with Mayor McBarnes to put new infrastructure in place to
     safeguard our kids‚Äô well-being. We are looking forward to a great
     partnership with the City on this project and to more opportunities
     in the future,‚Äù Bartley said.
Plans call for the infrastructure project to be bid immediately with an
anticipated construction start date of early May.
For questions or interview requests, contact Mayor McBarnes at 654-7332.

&#8211; No collection on city holidays

****** Frankfort_trash_&#8211;_No_collection_on_city_holidays ******
    * Published on February 1, 2012
    * under News, Street_Department_Updates

Frankfort, IN ‚Äì In order to save Frankfort taxpayers money and to avoid
confusion, trash will not be collected on City holidays.
According to Parks and Streets Superintendent George Belmore, the City used to
have ‚Äúfloating holidays‚Äù that caused some confusion for residents.
     ‚ÄúSometimes trash was collected on a holiday and sometimes it was
     not. In order to provide residents with a consistent approach, they
     can know that on the following City holidays, they should not put out
     their trash until their next normal trash collection day.
     ‚ÄúTrash is collected on Mondays and Thursdays for half of our City
     residents and Tuesdays and Fridays for the other half. Wednesdays are
     recycling pick-up for the entire community,‚Äù Belmore explained.
City holidays ‚Äì no trash or recycling pick-up:
    * Monday, Feb. 20, 2012 &#8211; Presidents‚Äô Day
    * Friday, April 6, 2012¬ &#8211;¬ Good Friday
    * Tuesday, May 8, 2012¬ &#8211;¬ Primary Election
    * Monday, May 28, 2012¬ &#8211;¬ Memorial Day
    * Wednesday, July 4, 2012¬ &#8211;¬ 4th of July (no recycling pick-up)
    * Monday, Sept. 3, 2012¬ &#8211;¬ Labor Day
    * Monday, October 8, 2012¬ &#8211;¬ Columbus Day
    * Tuesday, November 6, 0212¬ &#8211;¬ Election Day
    * Monday, November 12, 2012¬ &#8211;¬ Veteran&#8217;s Day
    * Thursday, November 22, 2012¬ &#8211;¬ Thanksgiving Day
    * Friday, November 23, 2012¬ &#8211;¬ Thanksgiving Holiday
    * Monday, December 24, 2012¬ &#8211;¬ Christmas Eve
    * Tuesday, December 25, 2012¬ &#8211;¬ Christmas
    * Monday, December 31, 2012¬ &#8211;¬ New Year&#8217;s Eve
     ‚ÄúWe have a five-trash bag limit per household and an easy way for
     residents to remember when to put out their trash: no earlier than 7:
     00 p.m. the night before and no later than 7:00 a.m. on trash days.
     It‚Äôs a 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. timeframe,‚Äù Belmore said.
With a five-bag limit, residents can place their trash (preferably in animal-
resistant metal trash cans with lids) at their curb or alley. Residents whose
trash is found blowing around the streets are at risk of receiving a citation
from the Frankfort Police Department.
     ‚ÄúNot having our Street Department crews in on the most recent City
     holiday, Martin Luther King Day, January 16, saved our taxpayers
     money in employee wages and fuel consumption. Given that only about
     half of those scheduled for pick-up on Mondays put their garbage out
     on these holidays, it made sense for us to establish a consistent
     approach while saving money,‚Äù Belmore said.
In addition to participating in curbside recycling on Wednesdays, residents can
drop-off their recyclables at the Frankfort Street Department at 905 Burlington
Avenue from 8:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. Saturday drop-off times do vary with the
season, so residents are encouraged to contact the Street Department at 659-
2912 for updated information.
For questions or interview requests, contact Parks and Streets Superintendent
George Belmore at 765-659-2912.

****** Police_offer_Halloween_safety_tips ******
    * Published on October 27, 2012

Frankfort, IN ‚Äì With the City‚Äôs official Halloween hours set for 5:00 ‚Äì
9:00 p.m. next Wednesday, Frankfort Police, in partnership with the National
Child Safety Council, are offering safety tips for trick-or-treaters.
According to Police Chief Troy Bacon, trick-or-treaters of all ages are
encouraged to take the following precautions to help ensure a safe evening:
chose a well-lit path of travel, only visit homes of those you know and that
have porch lights on and travel in groups of four or five.
     ‚ÄúWe also encourage everyone to wear reflective clothing and make
     sure costumes are fire resistant. Always walk ‚Äì don‚Äôt run ‚Äì and
     look both ways when crossing the street.
     ‚ÄúWhile we always encourage motorists to be aware of their
     surroundings, on Halloween in particular, we ask drivers to pay extra
     attention for youngsters crossing the street or darting out between
     cars. This is an evening with a great deal of extra foot traffic
     happening and we want everyone ‚Äì in and out of costumes ‚Äì to be
     safe,‚Äù Bacon said.
Frankfort firefighters and police officers will be handing out candy at each of
the City‚Äôs three fire stations (Headquarters: 257 South Clay Street, Engine
Company #2: 508 North Main Street, Engine Company #3: 1400 West Barner Street)
and the Police Department (201 West Washington Street) during trick-or-treating
hours Wednesday night.
In addition to trick-or-treating within their neighborhoods, Frankfort‚Äôs
ghosts, witches, superheroes and goblins can visit the annual Trunk-or-Treat on
the Square from 5:30 ‚Äì 7:30 p.m. where representatives from churches,
businesses and organizations along with residents will hand out candy.
For questions or interview requests, contact Chief Bacon at 654-4245.

    * Published on December 15, 2015
    * under Mayor_Updates, News, Parks_Department_Updates

Frankfort, Ind. ‚Äì December 15, 2015 ‚ÄìFollowing Parks Superintendent George
Belmore‚Äôs recent resignation, City officials are advertising for a new parks
superintendent, placing ads in local and surrounding area media outlets as well
as on the City‚Äôs Web site and Facebook pages.
According to Mayor Chris McBarnes, the ad lists the responsibilities and skills
necessary for the position, along with benefits offered by the City.
     ‚ÄúIn losing George and all he has brought to our team, we are
     focused on finding Frankfort‚Äôs next talented parks superintendent
     who can become a valued member of our leadership team. We encourage
     anyone who believes he or she is qualified to pick up an application
     at Clerk-Treasurer Judy Sheets‚Äô office located in Old Stoney at 301
     East Clinton Street.
     ‚ÄúThe deadline to apply is 4:00 p.m. Friday, January 8, 2016. It‚Äôs
     important to note the selected candidate must be willing to locate to
     Frankfort within a reasonable time period after he or she is hired,
     if not already a resident,‚Äù McBarnes explained.
Belmore‚Äôs last day with the City will be Sunday, January 10, 2016. The
City‚Äôs Web site: www.frankfort-in.gov¬  has an entire section on the Parks
Department, along with all other City departments.

Ranking of Air Quality ‚Äì Gary Schools
December 2008
USA Today Survey

Methodology
Children are uniquely susceptible to the dangers posed by many sorts of toxic chemicals because
they breathe more deeply than adults, and because their bodies are still developing1. That's why
USA TODAY worked with the researchers and scientists at the University of MassachusettsAmherst, Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, and the University of Maryland in College
Park to analyze exposure to industrial pollution at schools across the nation. The goal: To
determine what sort of toxic chemicals children breathe when they go to school.

Schools List
USA TODAY gathered information on about 127,800 public and private schools from the
National Center for Education Statistics and more than two dozen state education agencies2.
While we attempted to make the list as comprehensive as possible, it may not include some
recently opened buildings. It also includes some schools that have closed since 2005. We also
excluded some schools whose locations we could not map. If you don't find your school among
those listed in our database, let us know by sending the school's name and address to
smokestack@usatoday.com.

Toxicity Assessments
Toxicity assessments for each school are based on emissions data collected by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency as part of its Toxics Release Inventory program, also known
as TRI. More than 20,000 industrial and government facilities are required to tell the agency
about their emissions of hundreds of chemicals that are known to harm humans or the
environment. Most facilities do not measure their emissions; rather, their reports to the TRI are
estimates (PDF). It is difficult to verify the accuracy of those estimates, but some critics have
complained that TRI reports generally understate emissions3. Generally, only large industrial and
government facilities are required to report to the TRI, meaning there are many other potential
sources of pollution that are not included in the agency's data. As a result, those sources also are
not included in toxicity assessments for schools.
To assess how those emissions affect the air outside nearby schools, USA TODAY partnered
with researchers from the University of Massachusetts-Amherst's Political Economy Research
Institute. After more than two years of effort, the researchers obtained data from an EPA model
known as the Risk-Screening Environmental Indicators, which scores chemicals based on their
potential danger. The model also uses information about industrial facilities ‚Äì such as the height
of its smokestacks and the way each chemical disperses in the air ‚Äì to estimate where
concentrations of the chemicals they release will be highest. The model allows the EPA to assess
pollution's impact on every square kilometer of the nation, and the agency uses that information
to help identify potential problems spots. The University of Massachusetts researchers used those
findings to produce lists of chemicals that contributed to the air toxicity at each of the nation's
127,800 schools in 2005, the most recent year for which the EPA has completed its model. With

2
the help of the University of Massachusetts researchers and other experts, and after consulting
with the EPA, USA TODAY used those records to create three measures of a school's exposure
to industrial toxics:
‚Ä¢

‚Ä¢

‚Ä¢

Overall toxicity: This is the primary measure of toxicity from industrial pollution outside
a school. It reflects both the concentration of chemicals the EPA's model shows impacted
the school in 2005, as well as the potential harm associated with those chemicals. That
measurement is ranked against each of the other 127,800 schools for which USA
TODAY developed toxicity information, and is displayed as a percentile. For example, if
you see a school whose overall toxicity shows up in the second percentile, you'll know
only 1% of the nation's schools had higher toxicity levels.
Exposure to cancer-causing chemicals: This ranking is similar to the overall toxicity
measure, but includes only those chemicals known or thought to cause cancer4. The
measure shows how one school ranks relative to all of the nation's other schools.
Exposure to other toxic chemicals: This ranking shows the potential severity of
exposure to chemicals that do not cause cancer. For each chemical thought to cause
health problems other than cancer, we compared the likely concentration of that chemical
at each school to the EPA's reference concentration, the agency's exposure threshold. In
other words, the higher a school ranks on this scale, the more likely it is that noncarcinogens could exceed that threshold.

Because these measures are based on a model and estimates of emissions, they are subject to
some limitations. For example, the model makes certain assumptions about topography, the
height of smokestacks and the toxicity of certain chemicals, any of which could influence the
assessment of toxicity in a particular location. In some cases, the EPA model appeared to
underestimate exposure to toxic chemicals 5. In others, it appeared to overstate it6. Also, the
model is not meant to assess risk ‚Äì your chances of getting sick.
Because it is based on reports from 2005 and includes only some potential sources of pollution,
the model may not fully reflect the current situation at each school. For example, some facilities
have closed since 2005, and others have opened. Also, large industrial sites account for only a
fraction of the nation's toxic air pollution. The EPA estimates that in 2002, cars, smaller
businesses and other sources accounted for 85% of the toxic chemicals in the nation's air.

Monitoring
Under the guidance of scientists from Johns Hopkins University and the University of Maryland
School of Public Health, USA TODAY monitored air quality near 95 public and private schools
throughout the nation. We placed monitors mainly ‚Äì but not exclusively ‚Äì near schools the EPA
model suggests face higher exposure to industrial pollution. To make the most complete
assessment possible, we used three main types of monitors, depending on the types of chemicals
the model suggested would be present:
‚Ä¢

Badges: We hung simple badge-like monitors near 95 schools in 30 states. The badges
collect a class of chemicals known as volatile organic compounds. We also used a similar
badge to detect ethylene oxide, a known carcinogen, near 23 schools. We left the badges
in place for between four days and a week before returning them to the University of
Maryland for analysis.

3
‚Ä¢

‚Ä¢

Active monitors: Because some chemicals, such as metals, cannot be picked up on
badge monitors, USA TODAY employees set up pumps to collect samples of metals near
17 schools and polycyclic aromatic compounds near 23 schools. At those schools, we
monitored the air for between 72 and 96 hours. Filters that picked up metals were
analyzed by Johns Hopkins; the rest were analyzed by the University of Maryland.
Ultraviolet monitors: To find chemicals that cannot be easily measured either by badges
or active samplers, we used an ultraviolet detection system made by Cerex Monitoring
Solutions to conduct additional monitoring near eight schools in Ohio, Pennsylvania and
Texas. That monitor delivers its findings in real time and does not require laboratory
analysis.

The monitoring work was conducted by employees of USA TODAY and other affiliated
newspapers and television stations. In every case, we attempted to place the monitors within
about 100 yards of a school, though a few had to be placed slightly farther away. Scientists at the
University of Maryland and Johns Hopkins analyzed each sample, and interpreted those results.
Because USA TODAY was able to monitor near schools only for a comparatively short period of
time, our findings may not reflect the extent of long-term exposure to pollutants at a particular
location. For example, changes in wind direction or activity levels at a particular industrial
facility can significantly influence the concentration levels near a school on any given day.
1

See, for example, A Framework for Addressing Health Risks of Environmental Exposure to
Children by the EPA's National Center for Environmental Assessment, published in 2006.
2

Includes Alabama, California, Colorado, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky,
Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma,
South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.
3

For example, Houston Mayor Bill White asked the EPA this year to adjust its emissions
estimates for petrochemical and refining plants, pointing to studies showing their emissions were
under-reported.
4

For chemicals that are linked to both cancer and other health effects, we used the severity
weighting the EPA assigned to the cancer-causing attributes of the chemical.
5

At Salina Elementary in Dearborn, Mich., for example, the EPA model did not suggest students
were exposed to acrolein, but an air monitoring station near the school detected high levels of the
chemical.

6

At Cesar Chavez High School in Houston, for example, the EPA model suggests students were
exposed to levels of 1,3-butadiene significantly higher than the levels detected by an air
monitoring station about a block away.

Questions and Answers
Question: What is considered a high or dangerous ranking on this database ‚Äî top 1%, top
10%, everything above 50%, or something else?
Answer: There is no clear line between dangerous and safe in these rankings. The lower the
ranking, the greater the likelihood that toxic chemicals could be present at levels that could
threaten children's health. Those schools that rank above or just below Meredith Hitchens
Elementary School, about 450th in the rankings, would seem most at risk; Hitchens, near
Cincinnati, was closed in 2005 after Ohio EPA found high levels of two cancer-causing
chemicals in the air.
Question: When I type in the name of my school, it shows me all the chemicals outside and
tells me how it ranks compared to other schools. My school seems to rank pretty high.
Should I be worried?
Answer: Experts say the model is meant as "a screening tool. It isn't an in-depth analysis," says
Nick Bouwes, who helped create the model for EPA. That means you should take what the
model says and ask more questions. Its purpose is to compare one location against another to
determine which one might indicate more pollution problems.
Question: Why did USA TODAY choose to use this particular computer simulation to
identify schools that might be in toxic hot spots? I've heard the EPA has said it's not the
proper tool.
Answer: After weeks of talking with officials at the U.S. EPA and those who created the model,
USA TODAY determined that Risk-Screening Environmental Indicators, or RSEI, offered the
most current way to track industrial pollution around the nation. In many discussions with EPA
officials, reporters explained exactly how USA TODAY planned to use the model. During one
interview, for instance, the EPA official who helps oversee the model, Bob Lee, told a reporter
that USA TODAY's efforts "strike me as a highly appropriate use for RSEI and the kind of thing
that makes a lot of sense." Nick Bouwes, a former EPA staff member who helped create the
model, also said the way USA TODAY used the model to identify schools that may be in hot
spots is "exactly" how it is supposed to be used.
Question: How accurate are the school rankings?
Answer: The EPA model produces estimates of how each school ranks nationally based on its
exposure to industrial air pollution, and the hazards those chemicals can pose. But those rankings
are estimates. They are based on emission reports companies filed each year with the EPA. The
model also makes other assumptions about how those chemicals will travel through the air. For
more information about how the model works and its limitations, see a description of our
methodology.
In some places, the model likely overstates the levels of toxic chemicals in the air. For example,
the model ranks Ashland City Elementary School in Ashland City, Tenn., as having the worst air
in the country. That estimate is based on emissions reports by a hot water heater manufacturer in

16
the city. A spokesman says most of the manganese is trapped in tiny shards of steel that are
swept up from the shop floor and discarded, but is not emitted into the air, as its report said. USA
TODAY monitored the air near Ashland twice, and both times found manganese levels
significantly lower than what the model predicted. That said, environmental experts such as
Johns Hopkins University scientist Patrick Breysse stress that monitoring for longer periods is
necessary before residents can know for certain what's in the air.
In other cases, the model understates the extent to which children are exposed. For example, it
ranked Pacific Elementary School, in Davenport, Calif., among the best in the country, but this
summer a state agency found high levels of hexavalent chromium, which can cause cancer, near
the school. The discrepancy appears to have been caused by the model misplacing a cement plant
in town, moving it much farther from the school.
When the model overstates or understates emissions, the effect can reach far beyond the school
closest to the plant. Sometimes, a mistake in one place can change the ranking of schools as
much as 30 miles away; for example, the high emission reports in Ashland City affected the
ranking of schools in other areas around Nashville.
The most important point to remember: The EPA's model cannot say definitively whether
anyone is at risk. Instead, it is a screening tool to help identify places where industrial pollution
might pose problems.
Question: I tried to find my school in the database and couldn't. Why not?
Answer: USA TODAY collected data from the U.S. Department of Education and at least two
dozen states in an attempt to account for as many public, parochial and private schools as
possible. In some cases, states might not have submitted the most recent addresses for some new
schools. In other cases, schools may have moved or closed since the data were reported. USA
TODAY used the best data the government made available. If you know of a school that is not
included in the database, please email us at smokestack@usatoday.com.
Question: What does it mean if my school ranks low compared to other schools?
Answer: Experts say a low ranking means your school is probably exposed to fewer chemicals
from industrial sources. But that's not the same as a clean bill of health. The EPA model includes
only emissions from large industrial and government facilities; it does not account for toxic
chemicals released by smaller businesses or automobiles.
Question: I don't see any chemicals or industries associated with my school. Why not?
Answer: That happens when the model indicates very low pollution levels around a school. In
some cases, the levels reported by any facility are too low to be meaningful. That doesn't mean
the model indicates no chemicals in the air; it means it estimated them at extremely low levels.
I've heard environmental or school officials in my state say the information isn't up-to-date
or doesn't offer a full picture of what's really happening near my school. Is that true?

17
Answer: USA TODAY used the most current version of the model, which contains data from
2005. In that sense, it represents a snapshot in time of what pollution might have been like at
these locations then. Some companies say they've curbed emissions since. In a news release, the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection said USA TODAY's analysis "fails to
take into account mobile sources that can greatly elevate health risks." That's correct. Experts tell
us that what we identified was the tip of the pollution iceberg, and as we pointed out, other
sources -- such as cars and smaller polluters -- might contribute as much as five or six times the
level of pollution that the model we used shows.
Question: What do I do with this information?
Answer: The first step is to see whether the company that the government model indicates is
responsible is 1) still operating; and 2) has reported its emissions correctly. Although the model
is the government's most up-to-date gauge of industrial pollution, the emissions reports it uses
come from 2005. That means some of the companies might have gone out of business or cut
production. One way to check is to see whether that company reported emissions last year. Also,
contact your local school district and ask officials what they know. They should be able to direct
you to local environmental authorities who can tell you whether they have monitored the air
nearby.
You can also contact environmental advocacy groups that might help you find relatively
inexpensive ways to determine what's in the air. Groups such as Global Community Monitor
work with local groups to develop ways to check air quality in their communities.
Question: Until I know for sure, should I pull my kids from school and put my house up for
sale?
Answer: No, say environmental experts. Don't panic, but push for answers. Most of the
chemicals that might be outside your school are in small enough quantities that they likely pose
no immediate threats.
Question: Then why should I be concerned?
Answer: For many reasons. First, scientists aren't certain how specific chemicals affect children.
Kids are particularly vulnerable because they're still growing and they breathe more air than
adults, but safety standards are based largely on how chemicals affect adults in the workplace.
Second, the same companies that may be responsible for the pollution sometimes have spills or
accidents during which much larger amounts of toxic chemicals are released. The model does not
account for those. Third, thousands of other, smaller businesses aren't obligated to report their
emissions to the government. That means monitoring the air might be the only way to account
for what they release. Fourth, if you don't push for answers, no one else might; laws in most
states don't require school or environmental authorities to examine toxic chemicals in the air
outside schools.
Question: What about the air inside my school?
Answer: The model deals with the air outside the building, but experts say air quality outside
affects air quality inside. "You probably have a lot of pollutants collecting on the inside," says

18
Claire Barnett, executive director of the non-profit group Healthy Schools Network. "You do
need some very close monitoring to find out what's actually going on. You need to look indoors
as well."
Question: Why do two schools near each other have very different rankings?
Answer: To measure industrial pollution across the country, the EPA model divides the USA
into thousands of squares, each measuring one kilometer by one kilometer. Then it estimates the
potential impact of industrial pollution for each of those areas. Any schools within the same
square will have the same ranking. Sometimes, however, two schools near each other will be in
different squares. Their rankings will be different. Sometimes - especially for chemicals not
likely to travel very far in the air - the differences will be substantial.

****** Team Effort Leading Auburn Electric ******
    * Posted on April 17, 2017

By Chris Schweitzer &#8211; General Manager, Auburn Electric
Here‚Äôs the amazing thing about leadership: If you do it right, it‚Äôs not
just you. The best leaders‚Äîwhether they‚Äôre CEOs, military generals or
coaches‚Äîsurround themselves with highly skilled people to help execute plans
and drive excellence throughout an organization. That‚Äôs exactly the case at
Auburn Electric.
As General Manager, I am charged with leading the overall operations and growth
of the City of Auburn‚Äôs electric utility.¬ To help me do that, we have built
a team I trust‚Äîone with a combined 120+ years of experience at Auburn
Electric, I might add‚Äîto lead the day-to-day operations and set long-term
strategic goals.
I‚Äôm energized by this team and what they bring to Auburn Electric and,
ultimately, all of us who rely on this important city utility:
    * John Armstrong ‚Äì Operations Manager:With 43 years of service to the
      City of Auburn and Electric Department, John will continue to chart out
      the planned construction and maintenance of the distribution network, as
      well as be a central resource for guiding the utility‚Äôs future. And
      perhaps most important, John cares about people. The vision he has cast
      for us reflects a focus on people and their purpose.
    * Jeff Tuttle ‚Äì Transmission, Substation &amp; Power: With nearly 42
      years of service to the electric utility, Jeff is the most experienced
      lineman on staff and possesses special expertise in transmission and
      substation systems.¬ He will prepare our linemen with sound understanding
      and skills across all facets of the integrated utility (substation,
      transmission, distribution, street light and metering).¬ His knowledge
      and skill set are vital to planning the utility‚Äôs future.
    * Troy Stahly ‚Äì Distribution Supervisor:Troy has nearly 26 years of
      experience at Auburn Electric, giving him the unique ability to provide
      the line crews with supervision that is laser-focused on safety,
      collaboration and productivity.
    * Rob Higgins ‚Äì Outside Plant Manager: With 10 years of experience at the
      utility, Rob is central to the management and stewardship of both the
      electric and fiber outside plant. He will identify and coordinate common
      interests, as well as help manage key vendor, customer and city
      relationships.
As you can see, the leadership at Auburn Electric is a team effort‚Äîand I‚Äôm
grateful for that.
Initial Goals &amp; the Road Ahead
The focus for this new leadership team in the year ahead is on items central to
our future success.
    * Safety: First and foremost is lineman and staff safety. Being an electric
      lineman is one of the top ten most dangerous jobs in the US. As you can
      imagine, we rely on our lineman greatly, and they rely on each other. We
      want to leverage their experience to become even more effective and keep
      them safe‚Äîalways.
    * People and Organization:Our people are Auburn Electric. We will focus on
      who we are and how we work. We know a healthy work culture gives us the
      best chance for high performance and sustainable results.
    * Customer Focus:Our purpose is simple: provide reliable power for our
      community. We desire to have a relationship with our rate payers that is
      communicative, accessible, aware and accountable. We aim to set high
      standards for customer response and project management.
    * System Health: Finally, we‚Äôll be very focused on our electric
      distribution system. While it‚Äôs in good shape overall, we want to
      improve maintenance and invest in appropriate equipment upgrades that
      will help us minimize outages and provide the best service possible.
These may seem like basic goals, but they are integral to the 24/7 service we
provide to the community.
How We Work Matters
As a leadership team, we believe how we work matters. That is, the way we work
will directly influence our success. As a result, we believe there are three
things central to working effectively:
    * Active Leadership:Every single person who works for Auburn Electric has
      the responsibility to lead by example.
    * Communication: All staff must choose to communicate openly. Issues get
      identified and resolved more quickly (and effectively) when communication
      is open, honest and timely.
    * Accountability: We understand that we are most effective when we are
      accountable to one another.
I‚Äôm excited about this team and the entire staff at Auburn Electric. I look
forward to sharing more about the utility and the improvements we‚Äôre putting
in place. If you have any questions, please contact us by phone at
260.925.8232, email @ electric@ci.auburn.in.us, or stop in the office at 5066
CO RD 29.
