Hochgesang, a controller for Meyer Distributing Inc, were present.
Hochgesang said the project estimated completion date is December 31, 2017 and
they are ahead of schedule. Council member Gregory Schnarr said last year
Meyer Distributing‚Äôs form showed 13 additional employees and its salaries. The
form this year shows 14 additional employees with a substantial increase in the
salary amount. For just one more employee, Schnarr asked why such a
difference. Hochgesang said he could not answer the question because he did not
have the support documentation of the numbers with him.
A motion was made by Council member Kevin Manley and seconded by Council
member Dean Vonderheide to find that Meyer Distributing Inc is in substantial
compliance with its statement of benefits for personal property [CF-1/PP] and
Braun Family Properties LLC is in substantial compliance with its statement of

for real property [CF-1/PP and CF-1/real property]. Motion carried 7-0.

abatement [Form CF-1/real property] and for personal property tax abatement
[Form CF-1/PP] for Jasper Chair Company Inc for 2016 pay 2017 were
previously distributed to the council members for their review.
Jeff Barth, president of Jasper Chair Company Inc, was unable to attend the
meeting so prior to the meeting he sent a letter to the council. The letter stated
their project completion date was estimated for August 2014. They have
exceeded their project cost estimates and have hired the three additional
employees that were projected.

Only thirty-three employees have been added.
Bauersfeld said in 2015 Stens revised their new position forecast to four new
positions in 2015 and four new positions for 2016. Five positions were added in
2015. He commented that Stens business continues to grow and they continue to
invest in the Jasper location. The average wage per employee has increased and
they plan to continue increasing the average wages of employees each year.
Bauersfeld added that Stens committed to investing $1,000,000 in this facility.
The total capital investment is $1,312,363. Bauersfeld felt they would have
scored enough points for the ten-year abatement if they would have estimated
fewer than ninety-eight new employees on the tax abatement application.
3

After several comments about whether or not Stens could revise the number of
additional employees after the application was accepted, City Attorney Renee
Kabrick explained the law regarding the council‚Äôs role in determining whether a
business is or is not in substantial compliance. Council member Kevin Manley
added that the labor market is tight so it may be difficult to hire people but they
did meet their capital investment.
Thereafter, a motion was made by Council member Kevin Manley and seconded
by Council member David Hurst to find that Stens is in substantial compliance
with its statement of benefits for personal property [CF-1/PP] and that Haddad
Properties LLC is in substantial compliance with its statement of benefits for real
property [CF-1/real property]. Motion carried 7-0.

TOUR FACILITIES
Council member Dean Vonderheide suggested the council members tour the
facilities of the businesses that applied for tax abatement in order to see what
capital investments have been made and see what new positions it created.

member Earl Schmitt to find that Cash Waggner and Associates P.C. is in
substantial compliance with its statement of benefits for personal property [CF1/PP] and that 3 PEPLS Properties LLC is in substantial compliance with its
