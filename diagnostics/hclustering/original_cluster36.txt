MEMORANDUM
TO:

Carmel City Council

FROM:

Adrienne Keeling
Department of Community Services

SUBJECT:

Z-613-16

DATE:

May 27, 2016

Please find information on the following item forwarded by the Plan Commission attached. This item will appear on your June 6th agenda.

Forwarded with a favorable recommendation:
Ordinance Z-613-16 (Docket No. 16010006 OA): Fences, Accessory Buildings, Schedule of Uses and Bicycle
Parking Amendment. The applicant seeks to amend the Carmel Zoning Ordinance in order to update the permitting
process, fees, definitions and standards for the placement, construction and modification of Accessory Buildings,
Accessory Uses, Fences and Retaining Walls. Amendments are also proposed to the Schedule of Uses and Bicycle
Parking standards. Filed by the Dept. of Community Services on behalf of the Carmel Plan Commission.
Overview:
The proposed amendments are summarized as follows:
1.

ZO Chapter 3.07 Definitions: Several definitions are referenced for your information as you review new standards for
fencing, accessory buildings and accessory uses. Several are also included here because they were inadvertently moved to
the Flood Ordinance in 2014. New bicycle parking definitions were added.

2.

ZO Chapter 25.01 Accessory Buildings and Uses: Clarified that permits are required; increase distance from an alley from
3 to 5 feet; increase the number of hens permitted to 6 to match the City Code; limit commercial accessory buildings and uses
to 1/3 of the gross floor area of all buildings on a site. Updated the Indiana Code citation for Residential Swimming Pools.

3.

ZO Chapter 25.02 Fences: Require permits for new fences, adding language to clarify requirements regarding corner lots,
front yards and maintenance.

4.

ZO Chapter 27.06 Bicycle Parking: Proposed requirements for Long-term Bicycle Parking and Employee shower and
locker facilities. Added language to clarify when bicycle parking standards are triggered, deleted exemptions from bicycle
parking, deleted maximum bicycle parking, adjusted requirements for schools, clarified that there should be 5’ clear zone
around bicycle racks, allow racks to be spread amongst multiple entrances.

5.

ZO Chapter 29.06.02 Improvement Location Permit Fees: Added the fees for new fence permits.

6.

ZO Appendix A: Schedule of Uses: Removed churches as Permitted Uses from business districts, added
cultural/entertainment uses as Permitted Uses to C-1 & C-2, changed storage to an Accessory Use in the B-3, I-1 and M-3
districts. Added Library, Dry Cleaner (without on-site plant) and Historic Site as Permitted Uses in the C-1 and C-2
Districts.

Plan Commission Summary:
The Plan Commission and its Special Studies Committee spent several months reviewing this proposal. Members of the public raised
concern about the requirement of building permits for fences as well as adding more permitted uses to the C-2 district without
restrictions when next to single family. Members of the Plan Commission made suggestions regarding chicken tractors, reorganization/clarification of the fence regulations, the protection of bike racks, pool covers/fences, and to not make the cost of fence
permits prohibitive. Over the course of the Committee meetings many of the concerns were addressed. Ultimately, the proposal was
forwarded to the Council with a favorable recommendation.
The information in this packet is arranged in the following order:
1.
Certification (expires August 23, 2016).

Proposed Ordinance Z-613-16.

CARMEL HISTORIC PRESERVATION COMMISSION
QUARTERLY REPORT TO CARMEL CITY COUNCIL
JULY 2016
APRIL 2016 – JULY 2016
In this quarter, the Carmel Historic Preservation Commission received Certified Local
Government status and completed a major outreach program.
On June 14, 2016, the City of Carmel was recognized as a Certified Local Government by the
National Park Service. The City of Carmel met the strict requirements for participation in the
Certified Local Government program, which includes a Commission and its staff comprised of
professionals with preservation related expertise. By participating in the Certified Local
Government program, the Carmel Historic Preservation Commission is provided with additional
authority over federal preservation programs along with the opportunity for additional grant
funding. The City of Carmel is the 20th Certified Local Government in the State of Indiana.
In an effort to raise awareness about the Commission’s activities, the Commission sent a postal
mailing to all property owners in the City of Carmel identified in the 2014 Historic Architecture
Survey of Carmel and Clay Township. The purpose of this mailing was to educate property
owners identified in the survey about the Historic Preservation Commission. Additionally, the
mailing served to inform these property owners that they are eligible for the Commission’s new
façade grant program. The Commission’s staff and Chairperson received dozens of follow up emails and phone calls in response to this mailing, which were overwhelmingly positive. As a
result of the mailing, the Commission received several applications for its façade grant program.
The Commission will review these at their next regularly scheduled meeting on July 14th (held
after this report is due to the Clerk-Treasurer’s Office).
The Commission partnered with the Carmel Clay Historical Society to offer a walking tour of
Old Town Carmel on Sunday, June 21st. The Commission promoted Indiana Landmarks MidCentury Modern Home Tour in Carmel on June 4th, which drew an audience of 900 attendees.
The Commission continues to be interested in the relocation of the Haines House on West Main
Street. Additionally, the Commission is going to undertake an assessment of outreach activities
and identify new ways to communicate with the public about its programs.

Respectfully submitted,
Mark Dollase, Carmel Historic Preservation Commission Administrator

CITY OF CARMEL
DOCS DEPARTMENT REPORT TO THE COUNCIL
December 29, 2016
Clay Corner PUD Rezone (with Primary Plat).
•
•
•
•
•

Plan Commission Docket No. 16060020 Z
Rezone 34.5 acres from S-1/Residential to PUD/Planned Unit Development
Site is located at the southwest corner of Main St. and Clay Center Rd.
76 single family lots proposed, for a density of 2.2 units/acre
A minimum of 10.5 acres (31%) of the subdivision will be Common Areas, which includes the gas pipeline easement.

Planning and Zoning Analysis
• Comprehensive Plan (Comp Plan):
o Calls for Very Low Intensity at 1.3 units/acre or less. (2.2 units/acre proposed)
o Proposed development would be classified as Suburban Residential and would be a Conditional Fit next to the
neighboring estate lots, and a Best Fit next to the neighboring subdivisions which are Low Intensity Suburban
Residential.
• Primary Plat, Site Plan, and Parking:
o The homes will be laid out in a grid street pattern with alleys, and one access point to Clay Center Road and one
access point to Main Street. The existing home on the site will remain as one of the 76 lots.
o There are three different lot types within the subdivision, all with different lot size standards to provide transitions
from the adjoining properties.
o Each home must have a minimum of two parking spaces and driveways will be required to be 20’ long
o There is a gas pipeline easement that runs diagonally across the south portion of this site which will be open space.
o Heavily wooded area at the southwest corner of the site surrounding a creek will be saved as Tree Preservation.
o Landscaping proposed along Main Street and Clay Center Road in Common Areas to provide some buffer.
o Path will run through the southern portion of the site for pedestrian connectivity and recreational use.
o Drainage will be routed to the detention pond on the south portion of the site, adjacent to the pipeline easement.
• Architectural Design:
o Architecture will meet the standards from the VOWC contained in their Residential Standards Handbook.
o The HOA of Clay Corner would have an Architectural Review Board that would review each home design prior to it
being built. They would ensure that the Residential Standards Handbook is followed and that each home will be
unique and constructed with the highest quality materials and design.
• Ch. 31 PUD Decision Criteria:
o The extent to which the PUD District Ordinance provides (1) a mixed use development or (2) addresses unusual site
conditions or surroundings: There is a pipeline easement that runs through the southern portion of the property.
o The Comp Plan and any other applicable, adopted planning studies or reports: Analysis provided above.
o The extent to which the proposal fulfills the general purposes of the Subdivision Control and Zoning Ordinances:
The proposal provides a platted, residential development with appropriate streets, sidewalks, and drainage,
however, varies from the standards of the S-1 zone to allow a variety of lot sizes.
o Current conditions and the character of current structures and uses in each district and its surroundings: This PUD
will continue residential development in the area and preserve some existing trees.
o The most desirable use for which the land is adapted: The Comp Plan and existing zoning calls for residential, and
that is what is proposed.
o The conservation of property values throughout the City and the Township: This development will have a very
similar design and architecture style as the subdivision to the west and will continue those property values.
o Responsible development and growth: Residential subdivision that would be slightly higher density than
subdivisions in the area, but similar to the one to the west, and which provides vehicular and pedestrian
connectivity, high quality architectural design, as well as appropriate buffers and transitions.
Negotiations with Petitioner during Plan Commission process
• An access point from Main Street was added and an access point form Clay Center Road was removed.
• The name of the subdivision and the design of the signage was changed so it wasn’t similar to the VOWC.
• A central park space was added and 2 two lots were removed from the original proposal.
• Increased buffering to the south with some tree preservation and some prairie grass plantings.
DOCS Staff found that the proposed PUD and primary plat provides appropriate transition with the larger lots to the west; is well
designed with a grid type street system, alleys, and sidewalks; provides appropriate vehicular and pedestrian connectivity; has a
central park area and recreational trail; preserves existing trees; and has high architectural standards and homes fronting Main Street.
We recommended that the Plan Commission forward this item to City Council with a Favorable Recommendation. They voted, 6-4 for
a favorable recommendation to City Council.

and use of “speed humps” within the City of Carmel’s (the “City”) corporate limits, which criteria have
been codified in Carmel City Code Section 8-38;
WHEREAS, pursuant to City Code Section 8-38, the cost of removing a speed hump is borne by
the City;
WHEREAS, it is in the public interest to require the neighborhood requesting the installation of a
speed hump to bear the costs of its removal should the neighborhood later ask for its removal;

City locations where at the installation and use of “speed humps” has been approved in accordance with
City Code Section 8-38; and
WHEREAS, the Common Council finds that the installation and use of a “speed hump” in the
City on Windy Knoll Lane between Millbrae Drive and Cardinal Way, such location being more
particularly described on the document attached hereto and incorporated herein as Exhibit A, meets all of
the criteria set forth in City Code Section 8-38, as established by the document attached hereto and

ORDINANCE Z-620-16
AN ORDINANCE OF THE COMMON COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF CARMEL,
INDIANA, ESTABLISHING THE SHADOW WOOD

Synopsis
The Ordinance would establish the Shadow Wood Planned Unit Development
District. The Ordinance would rezone 20.30+/- acres located southwest of the intersection of
146th Street and Towne Road from the S-1 zoning classification to a Planned Unit Development
District allowing for the development of a 29 lot single family residential neighborhood, which
results in a density of approximately 1.43 units per acre. The PUD provides for enhanced
architectural and landscaping standards, which includes requirements for all four sides of a
home. The PUD Ordinance also contains variable development standards and modified rightof-way, which allows for increased preservation of the wooded areas of the subject real estate.
WHEREAS, Section 31.06.04 of the Carmel/Clay Zoning Ordinance Z-289, as amended
(the “Zoning Ordinance”), provides for the establishment of a PUD District in accordance with
the requirements of IC 36-7-4-1500 et. seq. (the “PUD Statute”);
WHEREAS, Pulte Homes of Indiana, LLC, an Indiana limited liability company
(“Pulte”), submitted an application to the Carmel/Clay Plan Commission (the “Plan
Commission”) to adopt a PUD District Ordinance for certain real estate located in the City of
Carmel, Hamilton County, Indiana, as legally described in Exhibit A attached hereto (the "Real
Estate");
WHEREAS, Pulte’s application is consistent with the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance
and the PUD Statute;
WHEREAS, after proper notice, and pursuant to the provisions of the PUD Statute and
the Zoning Ordinance, the Plan Commission conducted a public hearing concerning Pulte’s
application for a PUD District Ordinance on September 20, 2016 at 6:00 p.m.;
WHEREAS, the Plan Commission, at its public hearing on November 15, 2016 at 6:00
p.m., gave a favorable recommendation to the ordinance set forth herein which establishes the
Shadow Wood Planned Unit Development District (the “Shadow Wood District”);
NOW, THEREFORE, be it ordained by the common council of the City of Carmel,
Indiana (the “Council”), that pursuant to IC 36-7-4-1500 et. seq., (i) it adopts this ordinance (the
"Shadow Wood Ordinance") as an amendment to the Zone Map, all prior ordinances or parts
thereof inconsistent with any provision of this Shadow Wood Ordinance and its exhibits are

DOCS DEPARTMENT REPORT TO THE COUNCIL
December 29, 2016
Clay Corner PUD Rezone (with Primary Plat).
•
•
•
•
•

Plan Commission Docket No. 16060020 Z
Rezone 34.5 acres from S-1/Residential to PUD/Planned Unit Development
Site is located at the southwest corner of Main St. and Clay Center Rd.
76 single family lots proposed, for a density of 2.2 units/acre
A minimum of 10.5 acres (31%) of the subdivision will be Common Areas, which includes the gas pipeline easement.

Planning and Zoning Analysis
• Comprehensive Plan (Comp Plan):
o Calls for Very Low Intensity at 1.3 units/acre or less. (2.2 units/acre proposed)
o Proposed development would be classified as Suburban Residential and would be a Conditional Fit next to the
neighboring estate lots, and a Best Fit next to the neighboring subdivisions which are Low Intensity Suburban
Residential.
• Primary Plat, Site Plan, and Parking:
o The homes will be laid out in a grid street pattern with alleys, and one access point to Clay Center Road and one
access point to Main Street. The existing home on the site will remain as one of the 76 lots.
o There are three different lot types within the subdivision, all with different lot size standards to provide transitions
from the adjoining properties.
o Each home must have a minimum of two parking spaces and driveways will be required to be 20’ long
o There is a gas pipeline easement that runs diagonally across the south portion of this site which will be open space.
o Heavily wooded area at the southwest corner of the site surrounding a creek will be saved as Tree Preservation.
o Landscaping proposed along Main Street and Clay Center Road in Common Areas to provide some buffer.
o Path will run through the southern portion of the site for pedestrian connectivity and recreational use.
o Drainage will be routed to the detention pond on the south portion of the site, adjacent to the pipeline easement.
• Architectural Design:
o Architecture will meet the standards from the VOWC contained in their Residential Standards Handbook.
o The HOA of Clay Corner would have an Architectural Review Board that would review each home design prior to it
being built. They would ensure that the Residential Standards Handbook is followed and that each home will be
unique and constructed with the highest quality materials and design.
• Ch. 31 PUD Decision Criteria:
o The extent to which the PUD District Ordinance provides (1) a mixed use development or (2) addresses unusual site
conditions or surroundings: There is a pipeline easement that runs through the southern portion of the property.
o The Comp Plan and any other applicable, adopted planning studies or reports: Analysis provided above.
o The extent to which the proposal fulfills the general purposes of the Subdivision Control and Zoning Ordinances:
The proposal provides a platted, residential development with appropriate streets, sidewalks, and drainage,
however, varies from the standards of the S-1 zone to allow a variety of lot sizes.
o Current conditions and the character of current structures and uses in each district and its surroundings: This PUD
will continue residential development in the area and preserve some existing trees.
o The most desirable use for which the land is adapted: The Comp Plan and existing zoning calls for residential, and
that is what is proposed.
o The conservation of property values throughout the City and the Township: This development will have a very
similar design and architecture style as the subdivision to the west and will continue those property values.
o Responsible development and growth: Residential subdivision that would be slightly higher density than
subdivisions in the area, but similar to the one to the west, and which provides vehicular and pedestrian
connectivity, high quality architectural design, as well as appropriate buffers and transitions.
Negotiations with Petitioner during Plan Commission process
• An access point from Main Street was added and an access point form Clay Center Road was removed.
• The name of the subdivision and the design of the signage was changed so it wasn’t similar to the VOWC.
• A central park space was added and 2 two lots were removed from the original proposal.
• Increased buffering to the south with some tree preservation and some prairie grass plantings.
DOCS Staff found that the proposed PUD and primary plat provides appropriate transition with the larger lots to the west; is well
designed with a grid type street system, alleys, and sidewalks; provides appropriate vehicular and pedestrian connectivity; has a
central park area and recreational trail; preserves existing trees; and has high architectural standards and homes fronting Main Street.
We recommended that the Plan Commission forward this item to City Council with a Favorable Recommendation. They voted, 6-4 for
a favorable recommendation to City Council.

TO:

Carmel City Council

FROM:

Adrienne Keeling
Department of Community Services

SUBJECT:

Z-612-16

DATE:

May 6, 2016

Please find information on the following item forwarded by the Plan Commission attached. This item will appear
on your May 16th agenda.
Forwarded with a favorable recommendation:
Ordinance Z-612-16 (Docket No. 15120002 Z): Midtown C-2 Rezone.
The applicant seeks to rezone 68 parcels in the Old Town and Midtown areas from the B-1/Business, B-2/Business
and I-1/Industrial District within the Old Town District Overlay Zone and the Carmel Drive – Range Line Road
Overlay Zone to the C-2/Mixed Use District. The properties are generally located near Main Street and Range Line
Road and extend south to City Center Drive and westward to 3rd Avenue SW and Industrial Drive. Filed by the Dept.
of Community Services on behalf of the Plan Commission.
Overview:
The purpose of this proposal is to extend the C-2 District southward and westward to apply consistent zoning to the entire
area between Old Town and City Center. The C-2 District will position the area for a more coordinated mixed use and
walkable development pattern similar to City Center, the development recently approved in the Midtown PUD, and as
envisioned by Jeff Speck’s Midtown concept plan.
The proposal would rezone properties from the B-1/Business, B-2 Business and I-1/Industrial District within the Old
Town District Overlay Zone and the Carmel Drive – Range Line Road Overlay Zone to the C-2/Mixed Use District. The
C-2 District allows residential and business uses to transition in a mixed use environment; the standards may be found in
Chapter 20F of the Carmel Zoning Ordinance. If approved, no changes would be required for existing businesses;
rather, this proposal is intended to affect future development.
Plan Commission Summary:
The Plan Commission and its Special Studies Committee spent several months reviewing this proposal. Members of the
public initially voiced their concerns about building heights and commercial uses next to single family homes, the loss of
viable industrial areas, the delegation of approval authority to the Director, and the removal of parking requirements
without a city commitment to support transit or invest in structured parking east of Range Line. The effect of the C-2 on
the Monon Greenway was also questioned.
Over the course of several Committee meetings many of the concerns were addressed, particularly by the amendment of
the C-2 District to add building height restrictions and Bufferyard requirements to developments adjacent to single-family
residential. Staff also clarified that the Monon Right-of-Way width is determined by the Thoroughfare Plan, regardless of
its zoning district, and that there are parking requirements in the C-2 District which must be followed. Ultimately the
proposal was forwarded to the Council with a favorable recommendation.

Purpose and Intent.

The purpose of the C-2 Mixed Use District is to define and support land areas for the redevelopment of parcels
in the North Central and South Central areas of the City. The intent of the City of Carmel is that all
redevelopment proposals for this area should incorporate significant civic value and mercantile activity and
provide opportunities to improve the fabric of the urban setting. It is further intended that the availability of C-2
zoning in this area should foster a successful public/private relationship between the City of Carmel and
prospective developers, while ensuring the compatibility of any redevelopment proposals with existing building
codes and zoning regulations.
20F.00.02

Tract Requirements.

Land areas shall be rezoned C-2 only upon application by the City of Carmel itself. All activities associated with
commercial, transportation, service, office and residential activities shall be conducted within completely
enclosed buildings in such a manner that any nuisance factors are not emitted outside of the building.

CUMULATIVE CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT FUND AND REAFFIRMING
CARMEL CITY CODE CHAPTER 2, ARTICLE 4, SECTION 2-91, ACCORDINGLY
Synopsis: Annual re-establishment of the Cumulative Capital Development required to maintain
the property tax rate of 0.0500 adopted last year.

Whereas, Indiana Code 6-1.1-41-1 et seq. and 36-9-15.5-1 et seq. permit the City of Carmel to
establish a cumulative capital development fund and to impose a property tax for the cumulative fund;
Whereas, in or about 1990 it was the determination of the City of Carmel, Indiana, and its
Common Council, that a need existed for the establishment of the Carmel Cumulative Capital
Development Fund, such Fund being most recently re-established in 2015 by City Ordinance No. D-221515, pursuant to Indiana Code 6-1.1-41-2 and 36-9-15.5-2, for any and all uses and purposes permitted
under Indiana Code 36-9-16-3, for capital improvements; for any purposes permitted under Indiana Code
36-9-16.5, for public ways and sidewalks; for any purposes permitted under Indiana Code 36-9-26, for
sewers; for any purposes permitted under Indiana Code 36-9-17, for general improvement; for any
purposes permitted under Indiana Code 36-8-14, for firefighting building and equipment and police
radios; for any purposes permitted under Indiana Code 36-10-4-36, for parks; for any purposes permitted
under Indiana Code 36-9-16-2 for public buildings and rights-of-way; for any and all uses and permitted
under Indiana Code 36-9-26 for municipal sewers; for purpose permitted under Indiana Code 36-9-27-100
for drainage; and for any purposes permitted under Indiana Code 36-10-3-21 for parks and recreation;
Whereas, notwithstanding the above, under Indiana Code 36-9-15.5-8(c), funds accumulated in
the Carmel Cumulative Capital Development Fund may be spent for purposes other than those uses and
purposes stated herein, provided that the purpose of such expenditure is to protect the public health,
welfare or safety in a declared emergency situation or as otherwise authorized by law;
Whereas, an ad valorem property tax levy was imposed and the revenues from the levy were
retained in the City Cumulative Capital Development Fund, with the maximum rate of levy so imposed
not to exceed the highest rate of levy allowed by Indiana law;
Whereas, pursuant to Indiana Code 6-1.1-41-11, once the levy has been approved, the Common
Council may reduce or rescind the annual levy, if it considers it advisable;
Whereas, pursuant to Indiana Code 6-1.1-41-13, once the Fund is established, a property tax may
be levied annually at the tax rate approved and advertised annually as other tax levies are advertised;
Whereas, for taxes due and payable in the year 2017, the tax will be levied on all taxable real and
personal property within the taxing district and will not exceed $.05 per $100 assessed valuation; and
Whereas, the policy of the Indiana Department of Local Government Finance is to require reestablishment of cumulative funds when the property tax rate in the ensuing year is to exceed the property
tax rate in the current year.

MEMORANDUM
TO:

Carmel City Council

FROM:

Adrienne Keeling
Department of Community Services

SUBJECT:

Z-613-16

DATE:

May 27, 2016

Please find information on the following item forwarded by the Plan Commission attached. This item will appear on your June 6th agenda.

Forwarded with a favorable recommendation:
Ordinance Z-613-16 (Docket No. 16010006 OA): Fences, Accessory Buildings, Schedule of Uses and Bicycle
Parking Amendment. The applicant seeks to amend the Carmel Zoning Ordinance in order to update the permitting
process, fees, definitions and standards for the placement, construction and modification of Accessory Buildings,
Accessory Uses, Fences and Retaining Walls. Amendments are also proposed to the Schedule of Uses and Bicycle
Parking standards. Filed by the Dept. of Community Services on behalf of the Carmel Plan Commission.
Overview:
The proposed amendments are summarized as follows:
1.

ZO Chapter 3.07 Definitions: Several definitions are referenced for your information as you review new standards for
fencing, accessory buildings and accessory uses. Several are also included here because they were inadvertently moved to
the Flood Ordinance in 2014. New bicycle parking definitions were added.

2.

ZO Chapter 25.01 Accessory Buildings and Uses: Clarified that permits are required; increase distance from an alley from
3 to 5 feet; increase the number of hens permitted to 6 to match the City Code; limit commercial accessory buildings and uses
to 1/3 of the gross floor area of all buildings on a site. Updated the Indiana Code citation for Residential Swimming Pools.

3.

ZO Chapter 25.02 Fences: Require permits for new fences, adding language to clarify requirements regarding corner lots,
front yards and maintenance.

4.

ZO Chapter 27.06 Bicycle Parking: Proposed requirements for Long-term Bicycle Parking and Employee shower and
locker facilities. Added language to clarify when bicycle parking standards are triggered, deleted exemptions from bicycle
parking, deleted maximum bicycle parking, adjusted requirements for schools, clarified that there should be 5’ clear zone
around bicycle racks, allow racks to be spread amongst multiple entrances.

5.

ZO Chapter 29.06.02 Improvement Location Permit Fees: Added the fees for new fence permits.

6.

ZO Appendix A: Schedule of Uses: Removed churches as Permitted Uses from business districts, added
cultural/entertainment uses as Permitted Uses to C-1 & C-2, changed storage to an Accessory Use in the B-3, I-1 and M-3
districts. Added Library, Dry Cleaner (without on-site plant) and Historic Site as Permitted Uses in the C-1 and C-2
Districts.

Plan Commission Summary:
The Plan Commission and its Special Studies Committee spent several months reviewing this proposal. Members of the public raised
concern about the requirement of building permits for fences as well as adding more permitted uses to the C-2 district without
restrictions when next to single family. Members of the Plan Commission made suggestions regarding chicken tractors, reorganization/clarification of the fence regulations, the protection of bike racks, pool covers/fences, and to not make the cost of fence
permits prohibitive. Over the course of the Committee meetings many of the concerns were addressed. Ultimately, the proposal was
forwarded to the Council with a favorable recommendation.
The information in this packet is arranged in the following order:

Certification (expires August 23, 2016).

CITY OF CARMEL
DOCS DEPARTMENT REPORT TO THE COUNCIL
November 23, 2016
Shadow Wood PUD Rezone (with Primary Plat).
•
•
•
•
•

Plan Commission Docket No. 16070015 Z
Rezone 20.3 acres from S-1/Residential to PUD/Planned Unit Development
Site is located at the southwest corner of 146th St. and Towne Rd.
29 single family lots proposed, for a density of 1.42 units/acre
Tree and Wetland preservation included in common areas for a total of 10.5 acres of common area (50% of the site).

Planning and Zoning Analysis
• Comprehensive Plan:
o Calls for Very Low Intensity at 1.3 units/acre or less. (only 1.42 units/acre proposed)
o Proposed development would be classified as Suburban Residential and would be a Best Fit next to the neighboring
subdivisions, which would share the same category.
• Primary Plat, Site Plan, and Parking:
o Right-of-way was taken at Towne Rd. and 146th St. for a round-a-bout and an access road along 146th St.
o The proposed subdivision will have a street connection to the Lincolnshire neighborhood to the south.
o Interior subdivision streets will be 50 ft. right-of-way instead of 56 ft. (City standard) in turn, saving more trees.
o 5 ft. sidewalks and 5 ft. tree lawns will be provided, however, when the street abuts a tree preservation area,
sidewalk will not be required on that side of the street.
o There is an existing 10 ft. wide asphalt path along Towne Rd.
o Proposed site plan tries to avoid existing wetlands and preserve them, as well as the trees, in Common Area.
• Architectural Design:
o Proposed one story homes.
o Minimum masonry requirement on 50% of the front façade of the building.
o Masonry wainscot required on all sides of homes and all windows to be trimmed.
o Front loaded garages, but cannot project more than 4 ft. from the front elevation of the home.
o 3 ft. wide pedestrian strip required along driveways to provide a place to walk when cars are parked in the driveway.
o Monotony mitigation provided.
• Ch. 31 PUD Decision Criteria:
o The extent to which the PUD District Ordinance provides (1) a mixed use development or (2) addresses unusual site
conditions or surroundings: About 50% of the site is wooded and there are several wetlands on site. A large area
of land was also taken for 146th St. improvements.
o The Comprehensive Plan and any other applicable, adopted planning studies or reports: Comprehensive Plan
analysis provided above.
o The extent to which the proposal fulfills the general purposes of the Subdivision Control and Zoning Ordinances:
The proposal provides a residential development, as the S-1 zoning would require, however, varies from the
standards of the S-1 zone. Thus, the request for a PUD.
o Current conditions and the character of current structures and uses in each district and its surroundings: This PUD
will continue residential development in the area and preserve existing wetlands and trees.
o The most desirable use for which the land in each district is adapted: The Comprehensive Plan and existing zoning
calls for residential, and that is what is proposed.
o The conservation of property values throughout the City and the Township: The development of new homes in the
area along with tree preservation should help to retain, if not raise property values.
o Responsible development and growth: Residential subdivision that would be similar to other subdivisions in the
area, provides vehicular and pedestrian connectivity, as well as preserves existing trees and wetland areas.
Negotiations with Petitioner during Plan Commission process
• Adjustments were made to the lot standards and right-of-way reduced to preserve more trees.
• Architectural standards changed to require masonry wainscot, trim around all windows, and roof overhang on all sides.
• Enhanced buffering width along south subdivision border and required a minimum 8 ft. native planting strip along the pond.
• Drainage concerns addressed with neighbors.
• A temporary construction barrier to Lincolnshire subdivision will be put in place during construction.
DOCS Staff found that the proposed PUD and primary plat respected the surrounding homes and developments, as well as provided
for necessary future connections and tree preservation. We recommended that the Plan Commission forward this item to City Council
with a Favorable Recommendation. They voted unanimously, 11-0.

Synopsis
The Ordinance would establish the Shadow Wood Planned Unit Development
District. The Ordinance would rezone 20.30+/- acres located southwest of the intersection of
146th Street and Towne Road from the S-1 zoning classification to a Planned Unit Development
District allowing for the development of a 29 lot single family residential neighborhood, which
results in a density of approximately 1.43 units per acre. The PUD provides for enhanced
architectural and landscaping standards, which includes requirements for all four sides of a
home. The PUD Ordinance also contains variable development standards and modified rightof-way, which allows for increased preservation of the wooded areas of the subject real estate.
WHEREAS, Section 31.06.04 of the Carmel/Clay Zoning Ordinance Z-289, as amended
(the “Zoning Ordinance”), provides for the establishment of a PUD District in accordance with

Estate");
WHEREAS, Pulte’s application is consistent with the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance
and the PUD Statute;
WHEREAS, after proper notice, and pursuant to the provisions of the PUD Statute and
the Zoning Ordinance, the Plan Commission conducted a public hearing concerning Pulte’s
application for a PUD District Ordinance on September 20, 2016 at 6:00 p.m.;
WHEREAS, the Plan Commission, at its public hearing on November 15, 2016 at 6:00
p.m., gave a favorable recommendation to the ordinance set forth herein which establishes the

RESOLUTION-CC-12-05-16-03
RESOLUTION OF THE COMMON COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF CARMEL,
INDIANA, TO PETITION THE INDIANA DEPARTMENT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT
FINANCE TO ADJUST THE LEVY LIMIT OF THE CITY FOR THE YEAR 2017.
Synopsis: The resolution would authorize the Department of Local Government Finance
to adjust the City’s 2017 property tax levy to recover up to $500,000 of shortfalls caused
by property tax billing errors in past years. The effect would be for the City to receive the
full amount of the duly adopted budget levies for the past years.
WHEREAS, the Common Council adopts each year a property tax budget levy of a
certain amount, needed to fund necessary and desirable City services; and
WHEREAS, the City’s property tax rate is calculated based on estimated, rather than
actual, assessed value, and, accordingly, the rate frequently results in property tax revenue that is
not equal to the duly adopted property tax budget levy; and
WHEREAS, when property tax revenue exceeds the duly adopted property tax budget
levy, the law provides for an automatic reduction in a subsequent year of the City’s property tax
levy limit; and
WHEREAS, when property tax revenue falls short of the duly adopted property tax
budget levy, the law provides for a compensating adjustment in a subsequent year of the City’s
property tax levy limit only if the fiscal body requests the adjustment by resolution; and
WHEREAS, the aggregate effect of all such property tax excesses and shortfalls, over
time, results in taxpayers paying the correct amount of the aggregate duly adopted property tax
budget levies; and
WHEREAS, the City has experienced property tax shortfalls that have not yet been
recovered.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Common Council of the City of Carmel,
Indiana:
The Common Council, as fiscal body, petitions the Indiana Department of Local Government
Finance in accordance with IC 6-1.1-18.5-16 to adjust the City’s 2017 property tax levy limit in
an amount up to $500,000 to compensate for property tax levy shortfalls.

ADOPTED by the Common Council of the City of Carmel, Indiana, this _____ day of
____________________, 2016, by a vote of ______ ayes and ______ nays.
Prepared by Benjamin W. Roeger on November 10, 2016, as suggested language only and not as legal advice. No subsequent
