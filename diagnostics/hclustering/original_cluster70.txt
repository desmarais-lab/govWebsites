Step Feed and Contact Stabilization Study
Purpose
Section E, Paragraph 20.c. of the Consent Decree states the following:
Defendants shall conduct a study of the effectiveness of the step feed and contact stabilization
modes of operation in the secondary aeration basins to maximize wet weather flow through the
secondary treatment system. By no later than November 1, 2011, Defendants shall submit to
Plaintiffs for review and approval pursuant to Section XV (Review and Approval Procedures) a
report presenting the results of this study for review and approval by Plaintiffs pursuant to
Section XV (Review and Approval Procedures). The report shall also describe a wet weather
operating plan that incorporates step feed and contact stabilization, as appropriate, into the wet
weather operations of the West WWTP. Upon submittal of the wet weather operation plan, the
Defendants shall immediately implement the wet weather operation plan and shall make any
changes, if applicable, required by Plaintiffs pursuant to Section XV (Review and Approval
Procedures).

The purpose of this report is to present the results of the study of the West WWTP’s
activated sludge process and the different operational modes available. The study included
the development of process and hydraulic models of the West WWTP, an evaluation of past
WWTP operational data, and interviews with WWTP operations staff.

Approach
A process model was used to determine necessary operating conditions in the activated
sludge process to comply with permit effluent limits reliably. The primary model output is
the required mixed liquor concentration at the solids retention time (SRT) necessary for
permit compliance at peak month load and minimum month wastewater temperature. The
mixed liquor concentration is then evaluated in a solids flux analysis to determine the flow
that corresponds to the maximum acceptable solids loading rate to the secondary clarifiers.
Return activated sludge (RAS) rates and solids settleability characteristics as measured by
the sludge volume index (SVI) are factors considered in the solids flux analysis. The solids
loading based maximum WWTP influent flow was determined for the following three
operating modes:
•
•
•

Plug flow (the current operating mode)
Step feed
Contact stabilization

Although step feed and contact stabilization increase capacity in terms of solids loading
rate, maximum treatment capacity is determined by the lesser of maximum allowable
secondary clarifiers solids loading rate, maximum allowable secondary clarifiers surface
overflow rate, and hydraulic capacity. The maximum capacity was determined considering
all three of the potentially limiting criteria for each of the three operating modes to allow
determination of the potential capacity increase resulting from step feed or contact
stabilization.

WEST WWTP STEP FEED AND CONTACT STABILIZATION STUDY

Description of Secondary Treatment Facilities
Aeration Tanks
A site plan and treatment plant schematic are shown in Figures 1-1 and 1-2, respectively, at
the end of this document.
There are three rectangular aeration tanks, each 342 feet long and 30 feet wide, with a 15-foot
side water depth. Each aeration tank has three passes—labeled A, B, and C—currently
operated in a serpentine plug flow configuration. The volume per tank is 153,900 cubic
feet (ft3), with a total aeration tank volume of 461,700 ft3 (3.45 million gallons [MG]). There are
4 positive displacement blowers, each rated at 5,050 standard cubic feet per minute (scfm) at
7.5 pounds per square inch (psi).
The aeration tanks were designed and constructed to have the flexibility to operate in
different activated sludge modes: conventional plug flow, step feed, and contact
stabilization. Generally, the plug flow mode of operation provides better effluent quality
during normal dry weather conditions, but it has a lower peak wet weather process
capacity. Conversely, contact stabilization has a higher peak wet weather process capacity
but does not provide the same level of treatment as plug flow. Step feed is a compromise
between the two other modes. Switching between modes would require manual operation
of large diameter buried valves on the primary effluent. The operators for the valves are in
valve boxes requiring a tee handle wrench to open or close the valves.

Secondary Clarifiers
There are three circular, flat-bottom final clarifiers, each 105 feet in diameter with a 12-foot
side water depth. Each clarifier has a surface area of 8,659 square feet (ft2), providing a total
final clarifier surface area of 25,977 ft2. The clarifiers are peripheral feed with a common
wall separating the mixed liquor peripheral feed channel from the clarified effluent launder.
Baffling was added in 2011 to prevent short circuiting.
Secondary clarifier process capacity is a function of both surface overflow rate and solids
loading rate. At excessive surface overflow rates, effluent suspended solids increase
because velocities up over the weirs are too high relative to settling velocities of the
suspended solids, because of short circuiting, and because of turbulence. At excessive solids
loading rates, the sludge blanket builds up to the point of solids being swept from the top of
the blanket over the weir and into the effluent launder. Because solids loading rate capacity
is dependent on the mixed liquor concentration and sludge settleability, the solids loading
rate capacity of the secondary clarifiers cannot be defined independent of the aeration tanks.

Secondary Treatment Capacity Evaluation
Process Modeling to Determine Solids Loading Rate Capacity
Secondary treatment is often the process capacity limiting step at a WWTP. Secondary
treatment capacity at the Evansville West WWTP is the sum of the biological aerated filtration
(BAF) and conventional activated sludge treatment capacities. The scope of this study is
limited to the evaluation of the conventional activated sludge system.

WEST WWTP STEP FEED AND CONTACT STABILIZATION STUDY

The solids loading rate is a function of the mixed liquor suspended solids concentration
from the aeration tanks and flow including RAS. The acceptable solids loading rate is very
dependent on the sludge settleability typically measured as the SVI of the mixed liquor. The
solids loading capacity is best estimated using process modeling and secondary clarifier
solids flux analysis. Because both the solids loading rate and SVI are dependent on the
activated sludge process, the solids loading rate capacity of the secondary clarifiers cannot
be defined independent of the aeration tanks.
Process modeling was performed to estimate the West WWTP activated sludge process
treatment capacity for plug flow, step feed, and contact stabilization operating modes. The
modeling was conducted using traditional capacity analyses assumptions, such as the
maximum 30-day loadings (based on January 1, 2007, through September 2010 data) during
minimum month cold-weather conditions. Maximum 30-day loadings and minimum
month temperatures are assumed because the WWTP must meet monthly permit limits, not
only during average loadings, but also during peak month loadings and winter
temperatures when biological treatment rates are slowest. The traditional capacity analyses
is conservative because it assumes maximum 30-day, 5-day biochemical oxygen demand
(BOD5), total suspended solids (TSS), ammonia loads, and minimum month temperatures
all occur concurrently during a calendar month.
Capacity determination is very sensitive to the accuracy of the model’s prediction of mixed
liquor concentration at a given SRT. The mixed liquor concentration predictions are highly
dependent on influent wastewater characteristics. Therefore, specialized influent
characterization was conducted to improve the accuracy of the process model. This was
accomplished by collecting 24-hour composite wastewater samples on 4 separate days over
the course of 2 weeks and performing multiple nonroutine analyses. The data were
analyzed and the results were input into the model.
Raw influent and final effluent wastewater temperature is monitored at the West WWTP.
However, WWTP staff face various data acquisition and data management challenges. Due
to these challenges temperature data was not readily available for process modeling;
therefore, based on judgment at other WWTPs at the same approximate latitude, 12 degrees
Celsius (54 degrees Fahrenheit) was assumed. Once the data acquisition and data
management challenges are sufficiently addressed, wastewater temperature data can be
used for future capacity analysis refinementHaving a database of wastewater temperature is
especially important with ammonia limits because the bacteria responsible for nitrification
are very temperature dependent.
Ammonia limits were added to the proposed National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES) permit. Therefore, model runs were done to estimate capacity with
nitrification. Based on the assumed minimum month temperature of 12 degrees Celsius and
the assumption that ammonia limits apply in the winter, an SRT of 6.5 days, which provides
nominally a 1.5 nitrification safety factor, was used to estimate capacity with nitrification.
Because secondary treatment capacity is very dependent on the settleability of the sludge,
capacity was estimated at two levels of sludge settleability as measured by the SVI. The city
believes that it can maintain an SVI of 150 or less for purposes of maximizing capacity
during wet weather events. Based on historical data, the SVI average for the 3 aeration
tanks is less than 150, 97 percent of the time. Based on historical data, the SVI average for

WBG102111133029MKE

3

WEST WWTP STEP FEED AND CONTACT STABILIZATION STUDY

the three aeration tanks is less than 100, two-thirds (66 percent) of the time. If a wet weather
event were to occur when the SVI is less than 100, a higher flow of wastewater can be
treated if solids loading to the secondary clarifiers is controlling. The flow at which solids
loading failure occurred based on solids flux analysis was determined for each modeled
condition. Then, the maximum acceptable flow was determined as 14 percent less than the
flow. This margin of safety was applied because research indicates that the solids flux
analysis may over-predict actual solids loading capacity (Water Environment & Technology,
January 2010).
The modeling was conducted assuming the BAF treated 14 mgd of the primary effluent.
Wastewater treated by the BAF results in less load to the activated sludge process. The
reduced load to activated sludge process results in a higher activated sludge treatment
capacity in terms of flow than if the BAF did not exist.
The modeling and solids flux analysis results are discussed in the sections below. Model
run details and solids flux analysis results are included in Appendix A.

Surface Overflow Rate
A second factor that can limit capacity is the surface overflow rate of the secondary
clarifiers. The surface overflow rate is a function of flow rate and is reported without the
RAS flow. The surface overflow rate expressed in gallons per day per square foot (gpd/ft2)
is an alternative expression of average upward flow velocity. Particles with settling
velocities less than the upward flow velocity will not be removed. High surface overflow
rates can also result in short circuiting flow patterns and turbulence. Any one of the factors
can result in high effluent suspended solids concentrations. The baffling that was installed
earlier this year is intended to mitigate the short circuiting that can occur at peak flows.
An evaluation of secondary clarifier performance at peak flows would be necessary to
define the maximum overflow rate capacity of the secondary clarifiers more accurately.
The evaluation typically requires stress testing to compare overflow rate versus permitted
effluent limits unless the WWTP has been operated at high enough flows and the effluent
TSS were recorded during these events. If the effluent TSS increase to unacceptable levels
because of a high sludge blanket, then the stress test results are indicative of solids loading
rate capacity at the SVI conditions tested, rather than overflow rate capacity. Therefore,
measurement of the sludge blanket depth, mixed liquor concentration, and RAS flow in
addition to wastewater flow, and visual observation are necessary during stress testing to
distinguish between an overflow rate failure and a solids loading rate failure. Because
wastewater characteristics can vary from day to day, each stress test represents only a
snapshot. Therefore, stress tests on a few separate days are recommended to provide a
better basis for estimating the maximum reliable surface overflow rate.
Based on the “Recommended Standards for Wastewater Facilities,” the recommended
design peak hour surface overflow rate is 1,200 gpd/ft2. Until stress testing is performed,
this maximum allowable overflow rate was assumed. Based on the total surface area, this
corresponds to a maximum secondary clarifier capacity of 31.2 million gallons per day (mgd),
which is shown in the column titled “Clarifier Surface Overflow Rate Capacity” in
Tables 1-1 and 1-2.

WEST WWTP STEP FEED AND CONTACT STABILIZATION STUDY

Hydraulic Capacity
Hydraulic capacity must also be considered when determining capacity. Simply put, the
wet weather treatment capacity cannot be greater than the hydraulic capacity. Hydraulic
capacity analysis is required to ensure there is sufficient freeboard in tanks to prevent an
overflow onto the ground, and to prevent short circuiting that could result from submerged
flow splitting facilities, weirs, and partitions interior to tank walls.
A hydraulic model of the entire West WWTP was developed during development of the
West WWTP Wet Weather Standard Operating Procedure (SOP). Since that time, surveying
has been conducted and field measurements have been collected to resolve inconsistencies
between field observations and model predictions. The results of the updated hydraulic
modeling are shown in the column titled “Activated Sludge Hydraulic Capacity” in Tables
1-1 and 1-2.

Current Plug Flow Operating Mode
Solids Loading Capacity
The results of the process modeling analysis of the activated sludge system with the current
plug flow configuration are shown in the column titled “Clarifier Solids Flux Capacity” in
Table 1-1. As can be seen from this analysis, activated sludge solids flux capacity ranges
from 25 to 36 mgd with nitrification, depending on sludge settleability as measured by SVI
and whether one or both RAS pumps are used per clarifier.

Surface Overflow Rate
Based on this analysis the solids flux capacity is less than the clarifier surface overflow rate
capacity except when the SVI is 100 or less and the spare RAS pump is used. Similarly, the
hydraulic capacity is less than the clarifier surface overflow rate capacity at the assumed
maximum acceptable surface overflow rate. Therefore, unless stress testing indicates the
maximum acceptable secondary clarifier surface overflow rate is less than hydraulic
capacity; surface overflow rate is not limiting capacity.

Hydraulic Capacity
Hydraulic capacity controls the maximum allowable wet weather flow through activated
sludge secondary treatment to 25 mgd when 14 mgd is treated through the BAF. Hydraulic
capacity controls wet weather treatment activated sludge capacity except for the one
condition noted in Table 1-1 where hydraulic capacity and solids flux capacity are both
25 mgd. The activated sludge hydraulic capacity is reduced to 21 mgd with 20 mgd through
the BAF.

Plug Flow Activated Sludge Capacity
Considering all three capacity limiting criteria when operated in the existing plug
configuration, the activated sludge system’s capacity at peak month loads and an SVI of 150
or less is limited to 25 mgd when 14 mgd is treated through BAF and to 21 mgd when
20 mgd is treated through BAF. The 25 and 21 mgd maximum wet weather activated sludge
capacity with 14 mgd and 20 mgd treated through BAF respectively are controlled by
hydraulic capacity rather than process capacity.

WEST WWTP STEP FEED AND CONTACT STABILIZATION STUDY

Step Feed and Contact Stabilization Operating Modes
Operating the aeration tanks in step feed or contact stabilization mode reduces the amount
of solids entering the secondary clarifiers, thereby increasing their maximum wet weather
flow capacity when solids loading is limiting capacity.
The WWTP was designed to allow step feed and contact stabilization operating modes. The
current plug flow operating mode consists of feeding all primary effluent to the upstream
end of the first pass of the aeration tanks. The step feed operating mode would split the
primary effluent between the upstream ends of two or three of the three passes of the
aeration tanks. The contact stabilization mode would not send any primary effluent to the
first pass and instead primary effluent would be fed to the upstream end of the second pass
of the aeration tanks. Changing from the current plug flow operating mode to either the
step feed or contact stabilization operating mode would require multiple large diameter
buried valves to be opened or closed. Because the valves have not been operated in many
years, the condition of the valves is not known and would need to be evaluated prior to
operating in step feed or contact stabilization mode.
Additional process modeling was performed to estimate the West WWTP activated sludge
treatment capacity if the mode of operation was changed from plug flow to step feed or
contact stabilization. The process loads, temperatures, SRT, SVI, nitrification, and other
assumptions were the same as those described above for the plug flow operating mode
process modeling analysis.

Solids Loading Capacity
The results of the process capacity analysis of the activated sludge system with step feed
and contact stabilization operating modes are shown in the column titled “Clarifier Solids
Flux Capacity” in Table 1-2.
With nitrification, the activated sludge solids flux capacity ranges from 47 to 54 mgd in step
feed operating mode and 57 to 63 mgd in contact stabilization operating mode, depending
on sludge settleability as measured by SVI and whether one or both RAS pumps are used
per clarifier. As shown in Table 1-2, the solids loading capacity with either step feed or
contact stabilization would be greater than the surface overflow rate and hydraulic capacity
and therefore not limiting.

Surface Overflow Rate
The surface overflow rate capacity is the same as described above for plug flow. This rate is
shown in the column titled “Clarifier Surface Overflow Rate Capacity” in Table 1-2.
In all cases, the clarifier surface overflow rate capacity is less than the clarifier solids flux
capacity and therefore is limiting process capacity. However, the hydraulic capacity is
lower yet and therefore controlling capacity. Therefore, unless stress testing indicates the
maximum acceptable secondary clarifier surface overflow rate is less than hydraulic
capacity, surface overflow rate is not limiting capacity.

WBG102111133029MKE

WEST WWTP STEP FEED AND CONTACT STABILIZATION STUDY

Hydraulic Modeling
The hydraulic modeling described above under the plug flow operating mode was assumed
to be applicable to the step feed and contact stabilization operating mode. Although the
actual hydraulic profile may change slightly, the differences are expected to be insignificant.
The activated sludge treatment hydraulic capacity is shown in the column titled “Activated
Sludge Hydraulic Capacity” in Table 1-2. This capacity is consistently less than process
capacity and therefore is controlling. Therefore, with step feed or contact stabilization,
maximum wet weather treatment capacity through secondary activated sludge is limited to
25 mgd when 14 mgd is treated through BAF and to 21 mgd when 20 mgd is treated
through BAF.

Activated Sludge Capacity
Considering all 3 capacity limiting criteria, the activated sludge system as operated in step
feed or contact stabilization configurations is limited to 25 mgd. Modeling results show no
advantage to switching from the current plug flow operating mode even with the proposed
effluent ammonia permit limits. Therefore, no additional modeling was conducted to
determine the impact of ammonia limits on capacity in the plug flow operating mode. The
primary reasons solids flux to the secondary clarifiers is limiting at the West WWTP and not
at the East WWTP are:
•

A portion of the load is being treated in the BAF. This reduces the load to the activated
sludge process and results in lower solids loading rates to the secondary clarifiers.

•

BOD5 and TSS loads to the West Plant have been lower than to the East Plant resulting
in lower solids loading rates to the secondary clarifiers.

•

The aeration tanks and secondary clarifiers are slightly larger at the West Plant resulting
in lower solids loading rates to the secondary clarifiers.

Conclusions Regarding Increasing Activated Sludge Secondary
Treatment Capacity with Step Feed or Contact Stabilization
Step feed or contact stabilization will not increase activated sludge secondary treatment
because hydraulic capacity is controlling.
Secondary effluent quality, particularly with respect to effluent ammonia concentration, is
expected to be better with plug flow than with step feed or contact stabilization. Therefore,
continued operation in the plug flow operating mode is recommended.

Step Feed and Contact Stabilization Study
Purpose
Section E, Paragraph 19.a. of the Consent Decree states the following:
Defendants shall conduct a study of the effectiveness of the step feed and contact stabilization
modes of operation in the secondary aeration basins to maximize wet weather flow through
the secondary treatment system. By no later than November 1, 2011, Defendants shall
submit to Plaintiffs a report presenting the results of this study for review and approval by
Plaintiffs pursuant to Section XV (Review and Approval Procedures). The report shall also
describe a wet weather operating plan that incorporates step feed and contact stabilization
modes, as appropriate, into the wet weather operations of the East WWTP. Upon submittal
of the wet weather operation plan, the Defendants shall immediately implement the wet
weather operation plan and shall make any changes, if applicable, required by Plaintiffs
pursuant to Section XV (Review and Approval Procedures).
The purpose of this report is to present the results of the study of the East Wastewater
Treatment Plant’s (WWTP’s) activated sludge process and the different operational modes
available. The study included the development of process and hydraulic models of the
East WWTP, an evaluation of past WWTP operational data, and interviews with WWTP
operations staff.

Approach
A process model was used to determine necessary operating conditions in the activated
sludge process to comply with permit effluent limits reliably. The primary model output is
the required mixed liquor concentration at the solids retention time (SRT) necessary for permit
compliance at peak month load and minimum month wastewater temperature. The mixed
liquor concentration is then evaluated in a solids flux analysis to determine the flow that
corresponds to the maximum acceptable solids loading rate to the secondary clarifiers. Return
activated sludge (RAS) rates and solids settleability characteristics as measured by the sludge
volume index (SVI) are factors considered in the solids flux analysis. The solids loading based
maximum plant influent flow was determined for the following three operating modes:




Plug flow (the current operating mode)
Step feed
Contact stabilization

Although step feed and contact stabilization typically increase capacity in terms of solids
loading rate, maximum treatment capacity is determined by the lesser of maximum
allowable secondary clarifiers solids loading rate, maximum allowable secondary clarifiers
surface overflow rate, and hydraulic capacity. The maximum capacity was determined
considering all three of the potentially limiting criteria for each of the three operating modes
to allow determination of the potential capacity increase resulting from step feed or contact
stabilization.

EAST WWTP STEP FEED AND CONTACT STABILIZATION STUDY

Description of Secondary Treatment Facilities
Aeration Tanks
A site plan and treatment plant schematic are shown in Figures 1-1 and 1-2, respectively,
at the end of this document.
There are three rectangular aeration tanks, each 300 feet long and 30 feet wide, with a 15-foot
side water depth. Each aeration tank has three passes—labeled A, B, and C—currently
operated in a serpentine plug flow configuration. The volume per tank is 135,000 cubic
feet (ft3), with a total aeration tank volume of 405,000 ft3 (3.03 million gallons [MG]). There are
4 positive displacement blowers, each rated at 5,050 standard cubic feet per minute (scfm)
at 7.5 pounds per square inch (psi).
The aeration tanks were designed and constructed to have the flexibility to operate in
different activated sludge modes: conventional plug flow, step feed, and contact
stabilization. Generally, the plug flow mode of operation provides better effluent quality
during normal dry weather conditions, but it has a lower peak wet weather process
capacity. Conversely, contact stabilization typically has a higher peak wet weather process
capacity but does not provide the same level of treatment as plug flow. Step feed is a
compromise between the two other modes. Switching between modes would require
manual operation of large diameter buried valves on the primary effluent. The operators
for the valves are in valve boxes requiring a tee handle wrench to open or close the valves.

Secondary Clarifiers
There are three circular, flat-bottom final clarifiers, each 100 feet in diameter with a 12-foot
side water depth. Each clarifier has a surface area of 7,854 square feet (ft2), providing a total
final clarifier surface area of 23,562 ft2. The clarifiers are peripheral feed with a common
wall separating the mixed liquor peripheral feed channel from the clarified effluent launder.
Baffling was recently added to prevent short circuiting.
Secondary clarifier process capacity is a function of both surface overflow rate and solids
loading rate. At excessive surface overflow rates, effluent suspended solids increase
because velocities up over the weirs are too high relative to settling velocities of the
suspended solids, because of short circuiting, and because of turbulence. At excessive solids
loading rates, the sludge blanket builds up to the point of solids being swept from the top of
the blanket over the weir and into the effluent launder. Because solids loading rate capacity
is dependent on the mixed liquor concentration and sludge settleability, the solids loading
rate capacity of the secondary clarifiers cannot be defined independent of the aeration tanks.

Secondary Treatment Capacity Evaluation
Process Modeling to Determine Solids Loading Rate Capacity
Secondary treatment is often the process capacity limiting step at a WWTP. Secondary
treatment at the Evansville East WWTP consists of the aeration tanks and secondary clarifiers.
The solids loading rate is a function of the mixed liquor suspended solids concentration
from the aeration tanks and flow including RAS. The acceptable solids loading rate is very
dependent on the sludge settleability typically measured as the SVI of the mixed liquor.

EAST WWTP STEP FEED AND CONTACT STABILIZATION STUDY

The solids loading capacity is best estimated using process modeling and secondary clarifier
solids flux analysis. Because both the solids loading rate and SVI are dependent on the
activated sludge process, the solids loading rate capacity of the secondary clarifiers cannot
be defined independent of the aeration tanks.
Process modeling was performed to estimate the East WWTP activated sludge process
treatment capacity for plug flow, step feed, and contact stabilization operating modes.
The modeling was conducted using traditional capacity analysis assumptions, such as the
maximum 30-day loadings (based on January 1, 2007, through June 2011 data) during
minimum month cold-weather conditions. Maximum 30-day loadings and minimum
month temperatures are assumed because the WWTP must meet monthly permit limits, not
only during average loadings, but also during peak month loadings and winter
temperatures when biological treatment rates are slowest. The traditional capacity analysis
is conservative because it assumes maximum 30-day, 5-day biochemical oxygen demand
(BOD5), total suspended solids (TSS), ammonia loads, and minimum month temperatures
all occur concurrently during a calendar month. Treatment capacity will be greater during
periods of lower loading, lower SVIs, and higher wastewater temperature.
Capacity determination is very sensitive to the accuracy of the model’s prediction of mixed
liquor concentration at a given SRT. The mixed liquor concentration predictions are highly
dependent on influent wastewater characteristics. Therefore, specialized influent
characterization was conducted to improve the accuracy of the process model. This was
accomplished by collecting 24-hour composite wastewater samples on 4 separate days over
the course of 2 weeks and performing multiple nonroutine analyses. The data were
analyzed and the results were input into the model.
Raw influent and final effluent wastewater temperature is monitored at the West WWTP.
However, WWTP staff face various data acquisition and data management challenges. Due
to the challenges, temperature data was not readily available for process modeling;
therefore, based on judgment at other WWTPs at the same approximate latitude, 12 degrees
Celsius (54 degrees Fahrenheit) was assumed. Once the data acquisition and data
management challenges are sufficiently addressed, wastewater temperature data can be
used for future capacity analysis refinement. Having a database of wastewater temperature
is especially important with ammonia limits because the bacteria responsible for nitrification
are very temperature dependent.
Ammonia limits were added to the most recent National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES) permit. Therefore, model runs were done to estimate capacity with
nitrification. Based on the assumed minimum month temperature of 12 degrees Celsius and
the assumption that ammonia limits apply in the winter, an SRT of 6.5 days, which provides
nominally a 1.5 nitrification safety factor, was used to estimate capacity with nitrification for
the plug flow and the step feed operating modes. The modeling indicated this was not a
sufficient SRT for the contact stabilization mode to meet the ammonia limits at both average
and wet weather flows. This can be explained by the fact that bypassing primary effluent to
the second pass uses only two-thirds of the total basin volume for nitrification of the
primary effluent. The first pass only results in nitrification of residual ammonia recycled
with the RAS. Because of this, a SRT of 9 days was required for contact stabilization to meet
the ammonia limit at both average and wet weather flows.

EAST WWTP STEP FEED AND CONTACT STABILIZATION STUDY

Because secondary treatment capacity is very dependent on the settleability of the sludge,
capacity was estimated at two levels of sludge settleability as measured by the SVI. The city
believes that it can maintain an SVI of 150 or less for purposes of maximizing capacity during
wet weather events. Based on historical data, the SVI average for the 3 aeration tanks is less
than 150, 97 percent of the time. Based on historical data, the SVI average for the three
aeration tanks is less than 100, two-thirds (66 percent) of the time. If a wet weather event were
to occur when the SVI is less than 100, a higher flow of wastewater can be treated if solids
loading to the secondary clarifiers is controlling. The flow at which solids loading failure
occurred based on solids flux analysis was determined for each modeled condition. Then, the
maximum acceptable flow was determined as 14 percent less than this flow. This margin of
safety was applied because research indicates that the solids flux analysis may over-predict
actual solids loading capacity (Water Environment & Technology, January 2010).
The modeling and solids flux analysis results are discussed in the sections below. Model
run details and solids flux analysis results are included in Appendix A.

Surface Overflow Rate
A second factor that can limit capacity is the surface overflow rate of the secondary
clarifiers. The surface overflow rate is a function of flow rate and is reported without the
RAS flow. The surface overflow rate expressed in gallons per day per square foot (gpd/ft2)
is an alternative expression of average upward flow velocity. Particles with settling
velocities less than the upward flow velocity will not be removed. High surface overflow
rates can also result in short circuiting flow patterns and turbulence. Any one of the factors
can result in high effluent suspended solids concentrations. The baffling that was recently
installed is intended to mitigate the short circuiting that can occur at peak flows.
An evaluation of secondary clarifier performance at peak flows would be necessary to
define the maximum overflow rate capacity of the secondary clarifiers more accurately.
The evaluation typically requires stress testing to compare overflow rate versus permitted
effluent limits unless the plant has been operated at high enough flows and the effluent TSS
were recorded during these events. If the effluent TSS increase to unacceptable levels
because of a high sludge blanket, then the stress test results are indicative of solids loading
rate capacity at the SVI conditions tested, rather than overflow rate capacity. Therefore,
measurement of the sludge blanket depth, mixed liquor concentration, and RAS flow in
addition to wastewater flow, and visual observation are necessary during stress testing to
distinguish between an overflow rate failure and a solids loading rate failure. Because
wastewater characteristics can vary from day to day, each stress test represents only a
snapshot; therefore, stress tests on a few separate days are recommended to provide a better
basis for estimating the maximum reliable surface overflow rate.
Based on the “Recommended Standards for Wastewater Facilities,” the recommended
design peak hour surface overflow rate is 1,200 gpd/ft2. Until stress testing is performed,
this maximum allowable overflow rate was assumed. Based on the total surface area, this
corresponds to a maximum secondary clarifier capacity of 28.3 million gallons per day (mgd),
shown in the column titled “Clarifier Surface Overflow Rate Capacity” in Tables 1-1 and 1-2.

Hydraulic Capacity
Hydraulic capacity must also be considered when determining capacity. Simply put, the
wet weather treatment capacity cannot be greater than the hydraulic capacity. Hydraulic

capacity analysis is required to ensure there is sufficient freeboard in tanks to prevent an
overflow onto the ground, and to prevent short circuiting that could result from submerged
flow splitting facilities, weirs, and partitions interior to tank walls.
A hydraulic model of the entire East WWTP was developed. Since the initial model was
developed, surveying has been conducted and field measurements have been collected to
resolve inconsistencies between field observations and model predictions. The modeling
was conducted assuming a second influent screen has been installed. The results of the
updated hydraulic modeling are shown in the column titled “Activated Sludge Hydraulic
Capacity” in Tables 1-1 and 1-2.

Current Plug Flow Operating Mode
Solids Loading Capacity
The results of the process modeling analysis of the activated sludge system with the current
plug flow configuration are shown in the column titled “Clarifier Solids Flux Capacity” in
Table 1-1. As can be seen from this analysis, activated sludge solids flux capacity ranges
from 17 to 27 without nitrification and 9 to 15 mgd with nitrification, depending on sludge
settleability as measured by SVI and whether one or both RAS pumps are used per clarifier.
Treatment capacity will be greater during periods of lower loading, lower SVIs, and higher
wastewater temperature.

Surface Overflow Rate
Based on this analysis, the solids flux capacity is less than the clarifier surface overflow rate
capacity; therefore, for the plug flow operating mode, surface overflow rate is not limiting.
Coincidently, the hydraulic capacity is essentially equal to the clarifier surface overflow rate
capacity at the assumed maximum acceptable surface overflow rate. Therefore, stress
testing would be required to determine if the maximum acceptable secondary clarifier
surface overflow rate is less than hydraulic capacity.

Hydraulic Capacity
Solids loading capacity is less than hydraulic capacity at SVIs of 150 and 100, regardless of
the RAS pumping rate. Therefore, for the plug flow operating mode, hydraulic capacity is
not limiting.

Plug Flow Activated Sludge Capacity
Considering all three capacity limiting criteria when operated in the existing plug
configuration, the activated sludge system’s capacity at peak month loads and an SVI of 150
is limited to 17 to 20 mgd without nitrification, and 9 to 10.5 mgd with nitrification,
depending on whether firm or total RAS pumping capacity is available. If the SVI is 100 or
less, which historically is the case two-thirds of the time, then the activated sludge system’s
capacity at peak month loads is limited to 23 to 27 mgd without nitrification and 13 to
15 mgd with nitrification, depending on whether firm or total RAS pumping capacity is
available. Treatment capacity will be greater during periods of lower loading, lower SVIs,
and higher wastewater temperature. The maximum flow is controlled by solids loading
capacity rather than hydraulic capacity or surface overflow rate.

EAST WWTP STEP FEED AND CONTACT STABILIZATION STUDY

Step Feed and Contact Stabilization Operating Modes
Operating the aeration tanks in step feed or contact stabilization mode reduces the amount
of solids entering the secondary clarifiers, thereby typically increasing their maximum wet
weather flow capacity when solids loading is limiting capacity. Based on this evaluation,
solids loading is limiting when operating in the plug flow configuration with the new
nitrification requirement.
The plant was designed to allow step feed and contact stabilization operating modes. The
current plug flow operating mode consists of feeding all primary effluent to the upstream
end of the first pass of the aeration tanks. The step feed operating mode would split the
primary effluent between the upstream ends of two or three of the three passes of the
aeration tanks. The contact stabilization mode would not send any primary effluent to the
first pass and instead primary effluent would be fed to the upstream end of the second pass
of the aeration tanks. Changing from the current plug flow operating mode to either the
step feed or contact stabilization operating mode would require multiple large diameter
buried valves to be opened or closed.
Additional process modeling was performed to estimate the East WWTP activated sludge
treatment capacity if the mode of operation was changed from plug flow to step feed or
contact stabilization. The process loads, temperatures, SVI, nitrification, and other
assumptions were the same as those described above for the plug flow operating mode
process modeling analysis. However, for the contact stabilization operating mode, a longer
SRT was used for the reason noted above.

Solids Loading Capacity
The results of the process capacity analysis of the activated sludge system with step feed
and contact stabilization operating modes are shown in the column titled “Clarifier Solids
Flux Capacity” in Table 1-2.
With nitrification, the activated sludge solids flux capacity ranges from 18.5 to 32 mgd in
step feed operating mode and 15 to 41 mgd in contact stabilization operating mode,
depending on sludge settleability as measured by SVI and whether one or both RAS pumps
are used per clarifier. As shown in Table 1-2, the solids loading capacity with step feed at an
SVI of 150 would be less than the surface overflow rate and hydraulic capacity and therefore
would be limiting. However, when the SVI is 100 or less, the solids loading capacity with
step feed is greater than or equal to surface overflow rate and hydraulic capacity. Similarly,
for contact stabilization the solids loading capacity controls capacity at an SVI of 150 but at
an SVI of 100 the surface overflow rate and hydraulic capacity control capacity.

Surface Overflow Rate
The surface overflow rate based on capacity is the same as described above for plug flow.
This rate is shown in the column titled “Clarifier Surface Overflow Rate Capacity” in Table 1-2.
When the SVI is 150 in either the step feed or contact stabilization operating mode, the
clarifier surface overflow rate capacity is more than the clarifier solids flux capacity and
therefore is not limiting process capacity. When the SVI is 100 the surface overflow rate and
hydraulic capacity are less than or equal to the solids flux capacity and therefore the
controlling capacity.

EAST WWTP STEP FEED AND CONTACT STABILIZATION STUDY

Hydraulic Modeling
The hydraulic modeling described above under the plug flow operating mode was assumed
to be applicable to the step feed and contact stabilization operating mode. Although the
actual hydraulic profile may change slightly, the differences are expected to be insignificant.
The activated sludge treatment hydraulic capacity is shown in the column titled “Activated
Sludge Hydraulic Capacity” in Table 1-2. This capacity is equal to the surface overflow rate
capacity at the overflow rate criteria used and consistently more than the solids loading
capacity except for the one condition of contact stabilization and an SVI of 100 where
hydraulic capacity and solids loading capacity are equal as well. Because hydraulic capacity
is not less than the process capacity for any condition it is not controlling.

Activated Sludge Capacity
Considering all three capacity limiting criteria, the activated sludge system as operated in
step feed configurations is limited to 18.5 mgd with firm RAS capacity and 21 mgd with no
spare RAS pump at an SVI of 150. During periods when the SVI is 100, flows of 28 mgd
may be treated. Contact stabilization does not increase capacity versus step feed at an SVI
of 150, and would therefore not be recommended as a permanent configuration (see below
regarding a potential advantage of contact stabilization if switching back and forth between
plug flow and either step feed or contact stabilization). This can be explained by the fact
that a higher SRT was required to meet the ammonia limit with contact stabilization. This
negated a reduction in solids loading rate versus plug flow.

Conclusions Regarding Increasing Activated Sludge Secondary
Treatment Capacity with Step Feed or Contact Stabilization
Although 28 mgd was noted in this study as the secondary treatment hydraulic capacity,
total plant hydraulic capacity is currently limited to 22.5 mgd because of the single influent
screen in the headworks facility. Recent operational experience over the last year has
demonstrated the ability to treat up to 22.5 mgd while operating in the plug flow operating
mode, which was possible because SVIs were between 50 and 100 during this period. The
Utility prefers to continue to operate in the plug flow configuration when they can treat up
to the maximum plant hydraulic capacity and clarifier surface overflow rate. Wet weather
treatment capacity can be increased by switching to step feed or contact stabilization when
loads are high, SVIs are high, or wastewater temperatures are low. Switching to step feed
would be required if the combination of plant loads, SVI, and wastewater temperature
results in the solids flux to the secondary clarifiers exceeding the clarifier solids flux
capacity, which would limit plant capacity to less than the maximum plant hydraulic and
clarifier surface overflow rate capacity.
It should be noted that even with the switch to step feed, the solids loading capacity controls
wet weather secondary treatment capacity when the SVI is 150. However, step feed will
increase capacity versus plug flow when the solids flux is controlling capacity.
Secondary effluent quality, particularly with respect to effluent ammonia concentration, is
expected to be better with step feed than with contact stabilization. Therefore, if the
primary effluent valves are to remain manual, switching to step feed is recommended over
contact stabilization.

WBG102611183552MKE

EAST WWTP STEP FEED AND CONTACT STABILIZATION STUDY

If the primary effluent feed valves are to be replaced with motorized actuators and
connected to the plant’s supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system to allow
switching back and forth between plug flow during dry weather and step feed or contact
stabilization during wet weather, then either step feed or contact stabilization are
appropriate. Contact stabilization may be preferred because motorized primary effluent
valve actuators would only be required to the first and second passes. This process would
reduce the capital cost and complexity of the system versus step feed.

Wet Weather Operating Plan Incorporating Step Feed
The step feed operating mode is achieved by partially opening the primary effluent valves
to achieve target primary effluent flows to the second and third pass, and by partially
closing the primary effluent valve to achieve a target primary effluent flow to the first pass.
With the existing valve operator boxes, the only way to know the position of the valve
would be to count the number of turns of the valve nut operator. Although this step may
provide a rough starting point for positioning the valves, the target flow split can be
achieved based on measuring the resulting mixed liquor concentrations if the total primary
effluent flow to the aeration tank, RAS flow from that clarifier, and RAS concentration from
that clarifier are known. Therefore, primary effluent flow measurement to each pass is not
required to achieve the desired flow split. The target mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS)
concentration by pass at a target primary effluent step feed split is as follows:
Pass 1: MLSS = (QRAS × CRAS)/(Pass 1% QPE + QRAS)
Pass 2: MLSS = (QRAS × CRAS)/((Pass 1% + Pass 2%) × QPE + QRAS)
Pass 3: MLSS = (QRAS × CRAS)/((Pass 1% + Pass 2% + Pass 3%) × QPE + QRAS)
Where:
QRAS is the RAS flow
CRAS is the RAS concentration
Pass % is the percent of total primary effluent to that aeration tank fed to that pass
QPE is the total primary effluent to that aeration tank
The modeling was conducted at a primary effluent feed split of 20 percent to the first pass,
45 percent to the second pass, and 35 percent to the third pass. Given that this increased
process capacity up to the limiting hydraulic capacity of the activated sludge secondary
treatment while meeting permit limits, this approximate flow split is recommended.
It is recommended that the flow split be checked at both dry weather and wet weather
conditions. It is important that the primary effluent valves not be throttled so much as to
raise the hydraulic grade line upstream. That is, the headloss through the three partially
open valves to the three-step feed points in each aeration tank should not be greater than the
current headloss through the one fully open valve to the first pass of each aeration tank.
The flow split may also be adjusted based on operating experience if effluent quality
appears to be affected; however, it is important to analyze alternative flow splits using a

solids flux analysis at an SVI of 150 to ensure the solids loading rate will not further limit the
process with peak flows and peak month loads.
The change to step feed in periods when solids flux is limiting plant capacity when
operating in the plug flow configuration is the only change proposed to the standard
operating procedure (SOP) to maximize wet weather treatment capacity. Refer to the SOP
for wet weather operating procedures for the overall wet weather SOP.
