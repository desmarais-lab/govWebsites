    * Published on November 9, 2015

Initiative is partnership between Frankfort firefighters and Clinton County
Boys &amp; Girls Club
Frankfort, Ind. â€“The upcoming holiday season will be much brighter for
several area families thanks to the caring dedication and hard work of the
Clinton County Boys &amp; Girls Club working in partnership with Frankfort
firefighters.
According to Fire Chief John Kirby, out of the approximate 250 requests from
families for Christmas help, the Club leadership will select three families to
have their gifts delivered by Frankfort firefighters. These Holiday Heroes
(three different firefighter crews) will adopt one family per crew and deliver
food and gifts to those families during each of their station shifts December
21 â€“ 23.
     â€œWorking our Fire Department booth at this yearâ€™s Hot Dog
     Festival, our firefighters raised $1,600 for the Boys &amp; Girls
     Clubâ€™s Christmas program. Our team loves helping with this special
     cause and we appreciate the opportunity to partner with Susie Michael
     and her staff at the Club,â€ Kirby said.
     â€œSo often when a fire truck pulls up in front of a home, itâ€™s an
     emergency and no one is smiling. The Holiday Heroes program gives us
     a chance to deliver holiday cheer and smiles to those who deserve it
     most in our community.â€
The Boys &amp; Girls Club staff will be working hard on their Help a
Neighborprogram to purchase gifts and food for as many area families as
possible who have requested assistance during the Christmas season.
Anyone interested in making a financial donation to the Help a Neighbor program
should call 659-3520 or mail a check to the Clinton County Boys &amp; Girls
Club with â€œHelp a Neighbor Programâ€ on the memo line and mail it to the
Club at 1100 West Green Street, Frankfort, IN 46041.

****** MAYOR TO SERVE BREAKFAST AT MADISON PRIMARY CENTER ******

Mayor Pete ButtigiegÂ will serve breakfast to students at Madison Primary
Center, 832 N. Lafayette Blvd., on Tuesday, February 18 at 7:30 am as part of a
â€œLetâ€™s_Move!â€ initiative to promote participation in school breakfast
programs. All children in the South Bend Community School Corporation are
eligible to receive a free breakfast at school.
â€œLetâ€™s Move!,â€ an initiative launched by First Lady Michelle Obama, is
dedicated to solving the challenge of childhood obesity within a generation.
Communities that sign up for â€œLetâ€™s Move!â€ commit to five achievable,
measurable goals that promote sustainable strategies to improve the health of
residents. Letâ€™s Move!Â is committed to providing healthier foods in our
nationâ€™s schools, and encourages all schools to provide breakfast.
In partnership with the St. Joseph County Health Department, the Reducing
Obesity Coalition of St. Joseph County, HealthWorks! Kidsâ€™ Museum (a
designated â€œLetâ€™s Move!â€ museum), the City of South Bend Department of
Parks and Recreation, and the South Bend Community School Corporation, the City
is pursuing five â€œLetâ€™s Move!â€ goals.
Over the next year, South Bend has the opportunity to earn gold, silver, and
bronze medals in each of the areas. South Bendâ€™s status will be updated as it
achieves a benchmark. Residents can follow South Bendâ€™s â€œLetâ€™s Move!â€
progress at www.healthycommunitieshealthyfuture.org.

                                        1. How do I report a problem with a
                                        street light?
                                            If you notice a street light that
                                            is broken or burned out, you can
                                            visit NIPSCO.com and submit a
                                            request to have it fixed. An
                                            interactive map identifies all of
                                            the street lights owned or
                                            maintained by NIPSCO. So if you
                                            don't have the exact pole number,
                                            you'll be able to search for the
                                            street light by address or
                                            location. (www.NIPSCO.com/
                                            StreetLightOut) The online tool
                                            also provides a status of the
                                            light, in case someone else has
                                            already reported the outage.

                                            For those customers who are unable
                                            to access the online tool, you can
                                            still call the 24-hour customer
                                            service center to report the
                                            street light at 1-800-464-7726.
                                            Having the pole number available
                                            aids in expediting the repair
                                            process. The pole number will be
                                            something like 108 \ 240. Request

                                        2. When does the Street Department
                                        spray for mosquitoes in my
                                        neighborhood?
                                            The city is divided into four
                                            sections (north, east, south,
                                            west). The spraying crew rotates
                                            to these sections on a daily
                                            basis, weather permitting.
                                            However, rain, wind, or
                                            temperatures below 60 degrees will
                                            prevent them from spraying and
                                            delay the schedule.
                                        3. When will my trash be picked up?
                                            Trash, yard waste, and recycling
                                            should all be set out by 7:00 a.m.
                                            on your scheduled pickup day. Call
                                            (574) 372-9561 for further
                                            information.
                                        4. What are the guidelines for
                                        properly bagging my trash?
                                            Trash must be bagged and placed in
                                            City-provided bin.
                                        5. What are the guidelines for
                                        preparing yard waste for pickup?
                                            Yard waste must be bagged or
                                            boxed, not to exceed 40 pounds in

                                        6. Can building materials be put with
                                        my household trash for pickup?
                                            No building materials, auto parts,
                                            tires, or whole carpets will be
                                            accepted by city trash pickup. The
