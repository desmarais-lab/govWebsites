Department of Public Safety

Mission Statement
The Department of Public Safety is responsible for providing fire and police protection in the fire and police special service districts, operating an
animal care and control division, providing emergency management planning, and operating a division of weights and measures in support of the
City’s vision of “Assuring Personal Safety, Strengthening Neighborhoods, Developing a 21st Century Economy and Preparing Our Youth” by
protecting the lives, rights, and property of the Citizens of our City, and maintaining the public order.
Highlights of Public Safety
The department’s five divisions, Animal Care and Control, Emergency Management Planning, Weights and Measures, Fire, and Police,
emphasize the safety of the citizenry. During the year 2003, the Department of Public Safety plans to provide Indianapolis citizens with public
safety services that are responsive, reliable, high quality, and cost-effective through excellent customer service and community involvement.
Below are highlights from 2002 initiatives planned for 2003 by the Department of Public Safety:
•

Public Safety has implemented a website for the Animal Care
and Control Division and plans to complete one for the
Citizen’s Police Complaint Office by early 2003. The main
Public Safety Website is available within the INDYGOV Home
Page at http://www.indygov.org/pubsafety.htm,

•

The Indianapolis Fire Department currently educates more than
25,000 children annually in fire safety through the Survive Alive
Program,

•

The Indianapolis Police Department is currently implementing
a new capability for the Automated Fingerprint Identification
System. IPD is using a $1.5 million Federal grant to help fund
implementation of palm print identification capability.
Approximately 40 percent of latent prints found at crime
scenes are palm prints, which must go through a manually
intensive process for identification absent the automated
capability,

•

•

In 2002, the Department of Public Safety and the Indianapolis
Police Department placed an order for a new helicopter to add
to its fleet in 2003. The current primary helicopter is a 1968
Bell-TEXTRON 206 Jet Ranger. A Hughes 269C is currently
used as the backup aircraft. The Tactical Air Patrol is one of
the most important strategic tools available to IPD,

DPS plans to meet the Mayor’s goal of adding 200 CommunityOriented Police (COPS) Officers by the beginning of the
second recruit class in 2003. The City of Indianapolis was
awarded a $10.65 million COPS Grant in 2000 from the U.S.
Department of Justice to add 142 new community police
officers over the next three years. In January 2001, the City of
Indianapolis was awarded an additional $3.3 million in COPS
Grants. These grants along with full funding for 58 new
officers funded beginning in the 2000 budget will result in
meeting the Mayor’s pledge to add a total of 200
Community Police Officers to the Indianapolis Police
Department. The COPS Grants provide a total of $75,000 in
funding towards the salary of each officer over a period of three
years,

INDIANAPOLIS FIRE DEPARTMENT PENSION OFFICE
Mission Statement
The purpose of the Indianapolis Fire Department Pension Office is to keep records on pensioners’ taxes, insurance, and benefits status, and to
ensure accurate disbursement of pension payments. The Division maintains two firefighter pension plans, namely, the 1937 Pension Act, funded
by the City of Indianapolis, and the 1977 Plan funded by the State of Indiana with contributions by the City to the 1977 Firefighters Pension and
Disability Fund.
The office also assists families of both retired and active firefighters at the time of death and is the official representative of the Indianapolis Fire
Department at the funeral. It is dedicated to serving retired firefighters and their dependents and educating active officers in preparation for their
retirement, and is committed to enforcing the laws protecting the Pension Fund.
Highlights of the Indianapolis Fire Department Pension Office
Benefits paid by the Indianapolis Fire Department Pension Fund will increase in 2003 due to the elevation in the pension base, anticipated growth
in plan membership, and a contract-mandated increase in the City’s contribution to the 1977 Pension Fund. Benefits are paid beginning at 50% of
the pension base for a 20-year firefighter increasing to 74% of the pension base for 32 years of service.

Executive Summary
The Carmel Fire Department is committed to providing the highest quality of service to the public as
possible. In an effort to assess this goal, the Carmel Fire Department has employed a comprehensive
approach to analyzing the department and the community it serves. In such a comprehensive approach,
the Carmel Fire Department has assessed the level of risk within the community and weighed that risk with
current response capabilities. The elements studied are the community expectations and performance
goals, a community risk assessment, and performance objectives and measures.

Component A – Description of Community Served
On April 13, 1837 John Felps, Alexander Mills, Seth Green, and Daniel Warren laid out the Town of
Bethlehem, Indiana, which consisted of 14 plots of land, and was inhabited by Delaware Indians and
Quakers. The first general store was constructed in 1837, with the first school house being constructed in
1845. In 1846 a post office was established, however the residents were soon notified that there was
already another town registered with the name of “Bethlehem” in Indiana. Consequently in 1874, by a
referendum vote 33 to 12, the town was officially incorporated and adopted the name “Carmel”.

Department History and Milestones
The Carmel Fire Department was established in 1900 as a volunteer department. In 1913, after a major
fire, the town purchased a two wheeled soda/acid chemical tank and then placed Pyrene® pump fire
extinguishers on several porches around town. In 1921, the town purchased Carmel’s first motorized
Model T fire truck with 3 chemical tanks and hose.

In 1927, the State legislature passed a law empowering the township trustees to purchase and maintain a
fire truck. Under the leadership of R.J. Follett, a meeting of the town board of Carmel, trustees of Clay and
Delaware townships, and representatives from two leading insurance companies met and purchased the
first joint town‐township owned fire truck (without a pump) in the state of Indiana. The volunteer fire
department of Carmel/Clay was formed within the Carmel Garage, it was located on west main street, was
transformed into a firehouse, was open 24 hours a day, and became the first fire house in the area. Rue
Hinshaw was the first volunteer fire chief for the Town.

Carmel Fire Department Standards of Cover – 2013 Edition

In 1945, Donald Swails Jr. was appointed as the volunteer fire chief, at which time the town acquired its
first pumper fire truck. In 1950, Carmel firefighters constructed its first fire station located at 210 1st
Avenue S.W., which was located two blocks south of the downtown district. The construction was
completed with many hours donated by firefighters and a large portion of the building materials were also
donated. Firefighters received $2.00 for responding on each run and to help defray the cost of the
construction, many of them gave the money back to the fire department.

In 1956, the Town Board appointed volunteer Chief Donald Swails Jr. as the first full‐time “paid” member
with its first annual budget of $11,500.00. Chief Donald Swails was promoted to chief after serving eleven
years with the all volunteer department.
In 1963, James Martin Sr.’s Garage (auto repair) at 102nd and U.S. 421 on the far west side became Carmel’s
station# 42. It remained in service for over 7 years, until the town built its own building. In 1965, the
beginning of EMS was formed for the town/township with the conversion of a 1965 Dodge Van for its first
ambulance. Five years later, four firefighters became the first state of Indiana certified Emergency Medical
Technicians (EMT’s) for the department.

In 1971, a new station 42 was constructed to protect the
western portion of the township at 2410 W. 116th Street.
In 1975, station 43 was built and dedicated at 3242 East
106th Street. John Hensel who owned several farming
acres in the area donated the property to the city. 1979
saw the beginning of a more advanced EMS program
under the combined leadership of Chief Swails and Clay
Township Trustee John Hensel.

In 1981, the switch from a volunteer department to a paid career department became a reality and the
department had forty‐two (42) members. Along with this achievement, Station 44 was built and opened
for business at 5032 East Main Street. On June 23, 1982 Chief Donald Swails Jr. died. On August 2, 1982,

Assistant Chief Steven A. Couts was named Carmel’s new fire chief by Mayor Jane Reiman. In 1987, the
new fire headquarters station 41 was constructed on south Rangeline road at 2 Civic Square. This building
was built to replace the antiquated station that was located in downtown district. This station was
constructed by the city of Carmel; it houses the departments’ administrative offices as well as on duty
personnel. This was the first of three buildings to be constructed in the area that is now known as Civic
Square, which also includes Carmel City Hall and the Carmel Police Department. The department’s annual
operating budget for 1987 was $2,055,394.00.

In 1995, the focus of the department changed in providing additional service to the community. With that
(8) FF/Paramedics were hired which allowed the Department to provide Advance Life Support (ALS) to the
citizens of Carmel. The departments’ current paramedic staffing level for 2012 is an astonishing 46
paramedics. September 3, 1995 Fire Chief Steven A. Couts retired from the Carmel Fire Department after
serving for over 30 years. In 1997, the Clay Township Trustee opened and dedicated station 45 located at
10701 North College Avenue. January 1, 1996, Mayor James Brainard appoints Assistant Chief Douglas
Callahan as the new fire chief.

Station 42 was relocated once more in 2002, when the Clay Township Trustee built a new 15,000 square
foot fire station at 106th and Shelborne Road. Additionally, the same year, the Township Trustee also built
the sixth fire station located at 540 West 136th Street. On September 16, 2003, retired Fire Chief Steven A.
Couts passed away.

Subsequently fire headquarters was dedicated as the Steven A. Couts Fire

Headquarters. January 1, 2007, Fire Chief Douglas Callahan retired after serving the city of Carmel for 34
years. Two days later, Mayor James Brainard appointed Keith D. Smith as the new fire chief. In June 2010,
the Carmel Fire Department took delivery of its first “Tiller” tractor drawn aerial unit. This tiller is housed at
station 41. On December 31, 2012, Fire Chief Keith D. Smith officially retired from the Carmel Fire
Department and on January 1, 2013 the Mayor appointed Matthew D. Hoffman as Carmel’s Fire Chief.

As of now, the Carmel Fire Department employs 152 sworn firefighting personnel, 9 civilian personnel and
has six (6) fire stations with a population of approximately 82,000 citizens.

local property taxes, COIT (County Option Income
Tax) and ambulance usage fees.

Amazingly

enough, the Carmel community has weathered the economic downturn exceptionally well and while
budgeted line items have been reduced, employees have received consistent percentage raises annually to
keep pace with the cost of living.

Every year, the department submits an operating budget to the city common council, which is commonly
known and referred to as a “line item budget”. This is the type of budget that allows individual financial
statement items to be grouped by cost centers or departments. It provides a comparison between the
financial data for the past accounting or budgeting periods and estimated figures for the current or future
period and permits the department to itemize and/or separate each expenditure that would be needed for
the following calendar year. Budget managers can use a line‐item budget to make specific decisions, such
11

Carmel Fire Department Standards of Cover – 2013 Edition

as changing funding levels of programs being phased out, to providing money for new programs or making
cuts to budgeted expenses because of changes in organizational policies.

This budget process generally begins during the first quarter of the previous year and permits the division
chiefs adequate time to request operational items for their respective departments. These items will
include monies needed for training, equipment, projects or programs, etc. that may be anticipated.
All salaries and benefits are determined and set by the Carmel city council and once the council has
approved the budgets for all city departments, the entire budget package is forwarded to the Indiana State
Board of Accounts for their review and final approval.
The department is organized and run off a Fiscal operating budget that begins January 1st and ends
December 31st. At the beginning of the fiscal year, each division will know what expenditures have been
approved and can be used.

Topography
Carmel is situated within Hamilton County in central
Indiana. The land in central Indiana is characterized
primarily by low, gently rolling hills and shallow
valleys. Indiana has a humid continental climate,
with cool winters and warm, summers. Carmel is in
USDA Planting Zone 5.

Due to recent annexations, Carmel encompasses
nearly all of Clay Township, which is geographically
located in the southwest corner of Hamilton County.
Its boundaries include Boone County line (Zionsville)
on the west, white river on the east, 96th street
(Marion County/Indianapolis) on the south, and
146th street on the north. The total land area is

12

Carmel Fire Department Standards of Cover – 2013 Edition

approximately 50 square miles and the 2010 population was 79,191 residents, although its day time
population is much larger.

Climate
Carmel is located in the Midwest and is fortunate to experience all four seasons. The last few years, the
weather has affected Carmel in many ways, from the remnants of various hurricanes, ice storms, and
severe drought.

Date

Service Area
The city of Carmel is located in Clay Township of Hamilton County, Indiana, due north of the city of
Indianapolis and southwest of the city of Westfield. Carmel is located in the Eastern Time zone and utilizes
daylight savings time. The current jurisdiction for the Carmel Fire Department follows 96th street to the
south, 146th street to the north, River Road to the east and U.S. 421/Michigan Road to the west, and
encompasses approximately 50 square miles.

13

Carmel Fire Department Standards of Cover – 2013 Edition

Traffic flow through Carmel is
substantial with four major
north/south roadways running
through the city; US‐421 on the
western edge of the city, US‐31
divides the city down the
middle, and Keystone Parkway
(formerly US‐431) further east.
Hazel Dell Parkway on the far
eastside also carries a great
deal of north/south traffic,
relieving congestion on Keystone Parkway. Keystone Parkway, US‐31 and US‐421 all interchange with I‐465,
which runs along Carmel’s southern boundary.

Developments within the Service Area
The city of Carmel is home to many varieties of business, medical facilities, and residential homes. There
are 54 storage, agricultural businesses throughout the city; there are 697 retail business, mercantile stores
and hotel/residential establishments throughout the city. Lastly, there are 246 assembly, educational and
institutional facilities with Carmel.

14

Component B – Review of Services Provided
Existing Deployment
The staffing pattern began strictly as a volunteer department and throughout the years, the Carmel Fire
Department emerged as a paid department only. Currently the City of Carmel/Clay Township is protected
by 6 (six) fully staffed fire stations.

15

Carmel Fire Department Standards of Cover – 2013 Edition

The current deployment is as follows, six (6) front
line engines one (1) being a 75’ Quint, (100’)
tractor drawn aerial with a pre‐piped waterway,
four (4) state certified ambulances, hazardous
materials support truck, two (2) water rescue
boats, and a mobile command unit. Also within
the fleet are twenty‐one (21) administrative staff
vehicles and pool cars.
The department has a compliment of reserve apparatus that can be available for service during routine
maintenance cycles and break downs. Available are two (2) reserve engines, (one which is assigned to the
training division), three (3) reserve ambulances, one (1) 102’ platform aerial, and one (1) grass rig.

Dispatch Impact on Deployment
The Carmel Fire Department’s deployment practices require the move up of
apparatus to vacated stations by using mutual‐aid resources. This is based off
incident type and available resources in the district.
The move up procedure does not only pertain to fires, but is also used during
medical emergencies and multiple incidents (stacking) where the demand on
existing resources reaches a minimum threshold, which is determined by the
battalion chief (shift commander). The existing practice is to cover stations with mutual aid companies as
deemed necessary by the battalion chief, while existing resources are committed to an incident or
otherwise unavailable.
The Hamilton County Communications Center in Noblesville,
Indiana operaters the dispatch system for the Carmel Fire
Department and Carmel police department.

Currently the

communications center that served as Carmels dispatch is a
secondary back‐up center for the Noblesville system.

16

Carmel Fire Department Standards of Cover – 2013 Edition

Hazardous Materials Resources
All members of the Carmel Fire Department are required to have hazardous materials operations training
which allows them to deal with minor incidents. Additionally, the department has many State certified
hazardous

materials

technicians

who

handle

most

hazardous material responses within Carmel/Clay Township.
Major hazardous materials incidents are supplemented by
the response of other member departments within the
Hamilton County Hazardous Materials Task Force.
The Hamilton County Hazardous Materials Task Force
(HCHMTF) is a joint effort between Fishers, Noblesville, Westfield, and Carmel Fire Departments. Members
are required to maintain a training level as set forth in the HCHMTF Guidelines. Quarterly trainings are held
to ensure that the minimum training requirements are maintained.
Both the Hamilton county team and Carmel are involved with the State of Indiana District 5 Hazardous
Materials Training and Advisory Council and the Indiana Alliance of Hazardous Materials Responders for
additional training opportunities.

Emergency Medical Service (EMS)
The Carmel Fire Department provides both Basic Life Support (BLS) and Advance Life Support (ALS) to the
citizens of Carmel. With the department run average above 66% being of the medical nature, the
department saw the importance to maintain the service for the community.

All members of the

department are required to become State of Indiana Emergency Medical Technician (EMT‐B) and shall
maintain the classification throughout their career. Any
members wishing to advance their career have the
opportunity to receive the additional education to
become a State of Indiana licensed paramedic.

Daily minimum staffing requirements are that all six
engines companies are ALS staffed. On any given day it
is possible that all four of the ambulances may also be
17

Carmel Fire Department Standards of Cover – 2013 Edition

ALS. The department’s ambulances have been strategically located at station 41 located in the center of
Carmel, station 44 (to the northeast), station 45 (south central), and Station 46 (to the northwest). Other
support may come from any staff member who may be certified as a paramedic. Each of the assigned
paramedic staff vehicles has been certified by the State of Indiana EMS Commission to carry ALS
equipment.

Mutual Aid Response Agreements
The Carmel Fire Department has dual response and mutual aid agreements with Fishers, Westfield,
Noblesville, Zionsville, and the city of Indianapolis to provide an engine or ambulance on initial responses
when needed. In return, the departments mentioned above will reciprocate as needed. The agreements
also allow for the response of any additionally needed equipment for initial response or stand‐by as
requested.

In addition, the Carmel Fire Department is an active participant in the Hamilton County Mutual Aid system
and with the recent Statewide Mutual Aid system in place; the Carmel Fire Department is ready to respond
as needed to assist any agency throughout the state of Indiana.

Component C – Community Expectations and Performance Goals
Community Expectations
The goal of the Carmel Fire Department is to provide the highest caliber of service possible to the
customers (citizens) and to exceed all expectations associated with that.
This level of service is made possible with highly trained fire service personnel, sufficient apparatus, and the
best equipment available. These components are brought together allowing the Carmel Fire Department
the opportunity to mitigate and diffuse any emergency safely and in a timely fashion to have the best
chance for a positive outcome.

The Carmel Fire Department, through an extensive planning process, has strategically placed its fire
stations, personnel, and equipment to enhance and deliver this service. The department may not have
sought public input for these placements, but the process has managed to achieve the goals set. Through
this Standard of Cover (SOC) Report, the department has set its benchmarks where previous ones have not
been successful. It is a top priority to implement this process to produce and accomplish this in the future.
The service area for the Carmel Fire Department is comprised mostly of a densely populated
conglomeration of single and multi family residences that is host to 80,000 plus customers.

22

Carmel Fire Department Standards of Cover – 2013 Edition

We fully realize the customers have the highest regard for what the Carmel Fire Department offers and
expect the “best of the best” when the need for services are called upon. To accomplish this, we rely
heavily on historical data and focus on the criterion that directly relates to the Carmel Fire Departments
response time, which includes:





Call to dispatch
Dispatch to turn out
Turn out to arrival
Arrival to position

The time benchmark that has been outlined in this report has achieved a performance percentile of 90%.
Throughout this process, the Carmel Fire Department continually monitors and analyzes the data to
concentrate on whatever improvements are needed to serve the customers.

Community Goals
Fire Suppression:
Fire suppression requires the goal for the Carmel Fire Department to be arriving on scene with qualified fire
personnel and other resources deemed necessary to reduce the advancement of the fire. A prompt
response time will allow a better opportunity to rescue any “at‐risk” victims, containment of the fire and
the ability to perform the proper salvage operations to secure the property.
Emergency Medical Services (EMS):
The same qualified fire personnel administer EMS services as fire suppression with the overall goal being to
arrive in a timely fashion, assess the scene, and evaluate the incident as to what is needed. Provide
immediate and appropriate medical treatment and transport the patient to the corresponding medical
facility. This is done with the department’s specific time benchmarks.
Technical Rescue:
Technical rescue incidents require the same response as any other emergency run. The first unit to arrive
assumes the responsibility and will determine if the incident is beyond the scope of the first responder’s
level of expertise. If the incident is beyond the scope of department personnel, a request for mutual aid is
23

Carmel Fire Department Standards of Cover – 2013 Edition

required from the county technical rescue team. Members of the Carmel Fire Department provide any
support services needed during this specialized level of rescue.
Hazardous Materials (HazMat):
The Hazmat Team’s immediate goal is to assess and identify the situation, stabilize and secure the area and
have an action plan to bring the incident under control and return the area to a safe level. Upon arrival, if
the incident appears to pose a threat that is beyond the operations level of training of Carmel Fire
Department personnel, a request will be made for assistance in the form of mutual aid from the Hamilton
county hazmat task force for mitigation. The Carmel Fire Department will provide whatever assistance
needed that falls within the training level to help ensure the safety and protection of fire personnel,
customers (citizens), and the environment.

Component D – Overview of Community Risk Assessment
The Carmel Fire Department conducted and analyzed the risk assessment of the community. This has
encompassed a wide variety of potential incidents that have occurred and may have a potential of
occurring within the response area. The city of Carmel is divided into 46 reporting districts. The reporting
districts were created and are maintained after analyzing: geographical location, risk factors, automatic aid
areas, response recommendations, and historical incident data. Once the data is analyzed reporting
districts are modified as needed with each being assessed so that it receives the appropriate response level
to accommodate the potential hazard risk.

Response levels have been modified over the years due to the increased staffing levels and relocation of
fire stations; this is also to accommodate the addition of another ambulance in the western portion of the
response area.
The response area of the Carmel community highly accounts for mostly residential, this being single family
and multifamily units. On the western portion of the community many of the residences average above the
4,000 sq. ft. range, with a few in the 20,000 sq. ft. range. Along the Meridian corridor, there is a higher

24

Carmel Fire Department Standards of Cover – 2013 Edition

concentration of medical facilities, which include four major hospitals and numerous specialty physicians
and surgery centers.
The response area really has no industrial type of manufacturing or high level of hazardous materials
present. With the overall community being of
modern construction, the agency relies on fire
alarms and sprinklers that are monitored by
private agencies for early detection to lower the
consequence of the incident.
The matrix below is divided into four quadrants;
it is used to analyze the probable risk and the
probable consequences if an incident should
occur. This creates four possible relationships
between risk level and the distribution and
concentration of resources:
 Low Probability, Low Consequence
 Low Probability, High Consequence
 High Probability, Low Consequence
 High Probability, High Consequence
Distribution of resources is an equity issue: concentration is a risk/cost issue, thus:
Increased Risk = Increased Concentration
Fire station locations and staffing patterns must be prepared to respond to worst‐case scenarios. Many
factors make up risk:
 occupant mobility,
 construction features,
 fire protection,
 fire flow,
25

Carmel Fire Department Standards of Cover – 2013 Edition

 nature of the occupancy or its contents,
 age of the building,
 severity of the medical emergency,
While risk factors all have some common thread, the rationale of placing occupancy within any risk
assessment category is to assume the worst case based on historical incidents. The level of service
provided should be based on the factors of a worst case scenario.
The objective of the risk assessment is to reduce the probability of a truly serious loss occurring in a very
unusual event.

This involves keeping routine emergencies from becoming serious loss situations.

Resources must arrive quickly with sufficient strength to stop the escalation of the emergency.
The following chart provides a model relating various elements of the risk to the community as a whole,
including the probable frequency of events, the severity of potential losses, and the distribution of risks.
This matrix demonstrates that the community overall may have a wide range of potential risks. The daily
event is usually in the routine or low‐risk category. As we move up the chart towards the highest risk levels,
events occur less frequently, are more serious, and consume more resources.

Carmel Fire Department Standards of Cover – 2013 Edition

Given that risk is related to how a fire department responds, fire agencies over the years have always tried
to match the expected risk to response levels.

Prior to the accreditation process, there was no

standardized method for identifying risk and appropriate response schedules.
The historic methods of assigning a response level to risk were based on firefighter’s intuition and
knowledge gained from past fires in the community. Therefore, occupancies representing a “normal” or
“typical” fire received enough personnel and equipment to stop and extinguish the fire. From this typical
response expectation, lower levels of personnel were sent to buildings with low risk and higher equipment
levels were sent to buildings known as “target hazards”.
Target hazards were known to the fire service and insurance industry to confront firefighters with extreme
challenges, such as those found in lumberyards, woodworking shops, and businesses using combustible
fuels or solvents. Additionally, the Insurance Service Office (ISO) used a “fire flow” calculation to determine
how much firefighting water such a target hazard would need and from that calculated how many
firefighters would be required, the size of the fire pumps, and the capabilities of the water main systems.
The Carmel Fire Department fire marshal’s office had developed a Building Hazard Risk Analysis Evaluation
(BHRAE) form to assist in putting commercial structures into an identified risk category. If needed
personnel and equipment arrive too late, the fire will grow beyond the ability of the initial assignment to
stop the fire spread.

The incident then grows to multiple alarms, draining down the community’s

resources. Therefore, the balancing act is to have a deployment plan that does not require frequent
greater alarm fires.
For the BHRAE analysis, all personnel were introduced to the methodology and building information was
collected. The information from the evaluation forms was entered into a spreadsheet that performed
building fire risk scoring calculations automatically. The risk score produced for each commercial structure
was placed into reporting districts, which were determined utilizing the Carmel fire reporting districts map
with the help from city of Carmel GIS department.
The BHRAE process calculates the following areas:
 building area,
 height,
27

Carmel Fire Department Standards of Cover – 2013 Edition

 construction type,
 fire flow,
 access,
 exposure separation,
 hazards,
 fire load,
 fire protection systems,
 occupancy type,
 occupant load,
 occupant mobility
 economic impact
The hazard score is utilized to determine the values exposed to loss, the probability of an event occurring,
and the consequence of such an event on the community.

The desired outcome of the BHRAE process is an accurate and current description of the values‐at‐risk
(VAR) in the community. VAR is the inventory of a community’s potential fire problems arrayed from the
most valuable and vulnerable risk to the least valuable and vulnerable risk, which the fire department is
deployed to protect. If used as proposed, BHRAE will enable users to identify and evaluate important
factors of individual buildings, reporting districts and an overall community profile with respect to the need
for fire and emergency service deployment.
The model begins with demographics, an assessment of the overall threat potential to the community. This
includes, but is not limited to most catastrophic events that could occur to a community.

This

determination is based on historical, climatic, geographic, or other conditions.
For an area to be classified as high risk it should be of substantial size and should contain a predominating
concentration of properties presenting a high risk of life loss, loss of economic value to the community, or
large loss damage to property in the event of fire, and a high fire flow area. Normally these structures lack
built‐in fire protection features and/or contain occupants not capable of self‐preservation. The BHRAE
28

Carmel Fire Department Standards of Cover – 2013 Edition

score from such buildings is 46 or greater. The objective in these structures is to stop the escalation of a
major fire. This would involve conducting search and rescue and confining the fire to the floor of origin
with the rapid deployment of resources. Currently, there are no “high risk” commercial occupancies within
the Carmel Fire Department districts.
A moderate risk area contains average build‐up and the risk of life loss or damage to property in the event
of a fire (in a single occupancy) is usually limited to the occupants, although in certain areas, such as small
apartment complexes the risk of death or injury may be relatively high. Concentrations of property may
vary, but generally will be of limited extent. (This risk classification is often the greatest factor in the
distribution of fire stations for assuring fair and equitable access to initial attack capability.) The BHRAE
score for such a building is from 30‐45. The objective is to stop the escalation of a minor fire. Typically, this
means conducting search and rescue and confining the fire to the room of origin, plus limiting heat and
smoke damage to near room of origin. Currently, the Carmel Fire Department response area contains 156
occupancies determined to be a “moderate risk”.
In an area classified as low risk, the likelihood of life loss is remote and property damage limited, with little
or no possibility of the fire spreading beyond the area of origin. Buildings of this type have BHRAE scores of
13‐29. There are 841 “low risk” occupancies within Carmel Fire Department response area.

Building Hazard Risk Analysis Scores
BHRAE scoring was completed on all commercial occupancies in each of the department’s 46 reporting
districts. The BHRAE scores are pertinent to assessing the community risk. For a complete listing of BHRAE
scores for all reporting districts refer to the appendix referencing the BHRAE information.

Community Non‐Fire Risk Assessment
The Carmel Fire Department conducted and analyzed the non‐fire risk assessment of the community. This
has encompassed a wide variety of potential incidents that have occurred and may have a potential of
occurring within the response area. The city of Carmel is divided into reporting districts with each being
assessed so that it receives the appropriate response level to accommodate the potential hazard risk.

Response levels have been modified over the years due to the increased staffing levels and relocation of
fire stations; this is also to accommodate the addition of another ambulance in the western partition of the
response area.

Component E – Historical Perspective and Performance
Fire Detection and Building Construction Impact on Deployment
The Carmel Fire Department uses the 2006 International Fire and Building Code, with Indiana Fire and
Building Code Amendments. The Carmel Fire Department also has several local fire and life safety
ordinances incorporated into the existing ordinances. The fire prevention division is very aggressive in
reviewing plans of new construction and inspections of existing businesses within the response area to
ensure life safety and property conservation.

Insurance Industry Impact on Deployment
Prior to the self‐assessment and the accreditation process, there was only one method of rating a fire
department’s level of readiness and deployment capabilities. The Insurance Service Office (ISO) designed a
rating system known as the fire suppression rating schedule or more commonly called the ISO Grading
37

Carmel Fire Department Standards of Cover – 2013 Edition

Schedule. For over a century, the insurance industry has been
evaluating the fire defenses of cities throughout the United States.
This evaluation process was an important element in establishing
fire insurance rates for individual properties.
The basic objective of the Insurance Service Office was to provide a
tool for the insurance industry to measure quantitatively the major
elements of an entity’s fire suppression system.

Three basic

elements are considered in the grading schedule: receiving and
handling fire alarms (10%), fire department (40%), and, water
supply (50%). These elements placed a fire department/city in a
Public Protection Class on a relative scale from 1 to 10, with 10
representing less than the minimum recognized protection.
Following the ISO Public Protection Classification (PPC) survey of the department in 2007, the city of
Carmel, and Clay Township received a public protection class “3” rating, upgraded from a 4, which was
performed in 2005.

The Carmel Fire Departments current deployment standards were created using all of the above
information.

This standard of cover/risk hazard plan has utilized additional methods of exacting

deployment standards that will evaluate and enhance current practices, some of which are internal criteria,
National Fire Protection Association, and budget performance measures.
The CFAI has defined response time elements as a cascade of events. This cascade is similar to that used by
the medical community to describe the events leading up to the initiation, mitigation, and ultimate
outcome of a cardiac arrest. It is imperative to keep in mind that certain intervals described can be directly
influenced by the fire service (turnout time and travel time). Others can be influenced indirectly such as
the discovery and notification interval through public education and engineering initiatives. The fire service
can also influence the call‐processing interval through its ability to define standards and compel
performance by dispatch centers.

38

Carmel Fire Department Standards of Cover – 2013 Edition

Careful definition of terminology is essential to any conversation about response performance standards. It
becomes even more critical when an organization attempts to benchmark its performance against other
providers. The following definitions are standardized for discussion of response performance parameters.
The response performance continuum is composed of the following time points and time intervals:
Event Initiation Point is where factors occur that may ultimately result in an activation of the emergency
response system. Precipitating factors can occur seconds, minutes, hours, or even days before a point of
awareness is reached. An example is the patient who ignores chest discomfort for days until it reaches a
critical point at which he/she makes the decision to seek assistance (point of awareness). It is rarely
possible to quantify the point at which event initiation occurs.
Emergency Event Awareness is the point at which a human being or technologic "sentinel" (i.e., smoke
detector, infrared heat detector, etc.) becomes aware that conditions exist requiring activation of the
emergency response system. This is considered the point of awareness
Alarm is when awareness triggers an effort to notify the emergency response system. An example of this
time point is the transmittal of a local or central alarm to a public safety answering point (PSAP). Again, it is
difficult to determine the time interval during which this process occurs with any degree of reliability.
An interval exists between the awareness point and the alarm point. This interval can be significant, as the
alarm may be transmitted to a distant commercial alarm monitoring organization, which then re‐transmits
the alarm to the local 9‐1‐1 dispatch facility.
Notification occurs when the Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) receives an alarm. This transmittal may
take the form of electronic or mechanical notification received and answered by the PSAP.

39

Carmel Fire Department Standards of Cover – 2013 Edition

Call Processing Interval describes the
difference between the first ring of the
9‐1‐1 telephone and/or the first alert of
the alarm panel at the dispatch center
and the time the dispatch operator
activates

station

and/or

company

alerting devices.
Dispatch Time is when the dispatcher,
having selected appropriate units for
response, initiates the notification of
response units.

The

Carmel

Fire

Department has a goal of having all calls dispatched within 90 seconds or less 90% of the time.
Turnout Time is the interval between the activation of station and/or company alerting devices and the
time when the responding crew notifies the dispatcher by voice or mobile data computer that the company
is responding. During turnout time, crews cease other activities, don appropriate protective clothing,
determine the location of the call, board, and start the fire apparatus. It is expected that the "responding"
signal will be given when personnel are on‐board the apparatus and the apparatus is beginning to roll
toward the call. The expected performance standard for the Carmel Fire Department and National Fire
Protection Association (NFPA) 1710 is less than 90 seconds.
Travel Time begins at the termination of the turnout time and ends when the responding unit notifies the
dispatcher that it has arrived on the scene. The expected standard for the Carmel Fire Department is six
minutes thirty seconds (6:30) or less.
Arrival Time is the point at which a responding unit arrives on scene.
Initiation of Action occurs when operations to mitigate the event begin. This sometimes varies greatly with
arrival on scene and what arriving companies are faced with. An example would be treating a patient on
the fifth floor of an office building.
40

Carmel Fire Department Standards of Cover – 2013 Edition

Termination of Incident is where response resources have completed the assignment and are available to
respond to another request for service.

Fire Suppression Performance Goal
The primary goal of fire operations is to provide enough firefighters and equipment in a strategic location
so that an acceptable response force can respond to and reach fire scenes to mitigate the problem before
flashover occurs.

Fire Suppression Response Time Objective
The Carmel Fire Department will strive to maintain a
minimum force of firefighters and equipment. These
are strategically located so that the initial fire
department unit arrives within four minutes and sixty
(60) seconds from the time of dispatch and the
balance of the first alarm assignment arriving within
eight (8:00) minutes from dispatch time to arrival time.

41

Carmel Fire Department Standards of Cover – 2013 Edition

Stages of Fire:
All fires, regardless of the speed of growth or length of burn time, go through similar dynamic growth
stages. The most critical is the flashover stage.
Smoldering Stage: First phase of a fire when heat is applied to a combustible material, the heat oxidizes
the material surface into combustible gases. The heat from oxidization raises the temperature of the
surrounding materials.

A fire progresses from the smoldering phase either immediately or slowly,

determined by type of fuel, nearby combustibles and/or surrounding air.
Incipient Stage: When temperatures get high enough, visible flames can be seen, and the stage is changed
from smoldering to “incipient” or “open burning”. Usually the burning is contained in the immediate area
of origin.
Flashover Phase: Not all of the combustible gases are consumed in the incipient stage. They rise and form
a superheated gas layer on the ceiling. As the volume of gasses increase, they begin to spread across the
ceiling and bank down heating other combustibles until they reach ignition temperatures. When the
temperatures are hot enough to ignite all combustibles in the room of origin, a “flashover occurs”. The fire
room is untenable for human occupation at 212⁰ degrees and when flashover occurs, it instantaneously
increases the temperatures to approximately 1500⁰degrees. Flashover is the direct result of time and
temperature.

42

Carmel Fire Department Standards of Cover – 2013 Edition

The "time/temperature curve" standard is based on data from the National Fire Protection Association
(NFPA) and the Insurance Services Organization (ISO), which has established that a typical point source of
ignition in a residential house will "flashover" at some time between 5 and 30 minutes after ignition,
turning a typical "room and contents" fire into a structural fire of some magnitude.

Emergency Medical Service (EMS) Performance Goal
Time requirements for emergency medical service calls are comparable to fire incidents. Brain damage is
normally irreversible after 10 minutes. Interventions include early cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and
electrical defibrillation. Equally important, is expedient intervention in cases of acute myocardial infarction
(AMI), stroke, and traumatic injury.
The Carmel Fire Department has Life Pak® 15’s in all frontline apparatus and 3 administrative paramedic
staff cars, the remaining staff cars carry automatic external defibrillators, (AED’s). The department is
promoting “public access defibrillation” by assisting businesses, schools, and organizations in the education
and procurement of AED’s. In addition, the department has worked closely with the Carmel police
department to promote the inclusion of an AED on each police vehicle assigned to road patrol.
43

Carmel Fire Department Standards of Cover – 2013 Edition

The Carmel Fire Department also maintains its own Community Training Center (CTC) for the American
Heart Association (AHA). The training center provides the Carmel and Clay township residents, along with
doctors, nurses, paramedics, EMT’s, and first responders courses in Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS),
Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS), Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR), Automatic External
Defibrillation (AED), first responder, and basic first aid in schools. The training is provided by Carmel
firefighters who have been trained as instructors for the American Heart Association.
Early recognition and treatment of acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) has been enhanced by
utilizing sophisticated heart monitors (12 lead), on each ALS unit that allows the paramedic to begin early
treatment of heart attack victims to help minimize the damage heart muscle.

44

Carmel Fire Department Standards of Cover – 2013 Edition

EMS Response Time Objective
The Carmel Fire Department will strive to maintain a minimum force of firefighters and equipment, which
are strategically located so that initial fire department unit arrives within four (4:00) minutes and sixty (60)
seconds from dispatch to arrival time and balance of the first alarm assignment arriving within eight (8:00)
minutes.
The first due unit shall be capable of starting rescue or providing “emergency” and/or basic life support for
medical incidents.

Special Operations Performance Goals
Hazardous Materials (Haz‐Mat)/Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD)
All Carmel Fire Department personnel are trained to the Haz‐Mat/WMD operations level per OSHA
1910.120 at a minimum. Additionally, several firefighters are trained to the hazmat technician level and
participate as members of the Hamilton County Hazardous Materials Task Force (HCHMTF). In the event a
hazardous materials incident requires a technician response, the Carmel Fire Department will utilize the
HCHMTF and will provide on‐duty personnel to assist as technicians.

Hazardous Materials (Haz‐Mat)/Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Response Time Objective
The Carmel Fire Department will strive to maintain a minimum force of firefighters and equipment, which
are strategically located so the initial fire department unit, with operations level trained personnel will
arrive within four (4:00) minutes and sixty (60) seconds from dispatch time to arrival with the balance of
the first alarm assignment arriving within eight (8:00) minutes.

Technical Rescue
The Carmel Fire Department is currently working towards participation in the Hamilton County Rescue Task
Force, which consists of units via mutual aid, from Westfield, Fishers, Noblesville, and members from Cicero
fire department who are trained to the technical level to deliver a coordinated response.

45

Carmel Fire Department Standards of Cover – 2013 Edition

Technical Rescue Response Time Objective
The Carmel Fire Department will strive to maintain a minimum force of firefighters and equipment, which
are strategically located so the initial fire department unit, with operations level trained personnel will
arrive within four (4:00) minutes and sixty (60) seconds from dispatch time to arrival with the balance of
the first alarm assignment arriving within eight (8:00) minutes.

On Scene Operations, Critical Tasking and Effective Response Force
On scene operations, critical tasking, and effective response force are the elements of a standard of cover
study that determine staffing levels, number of units needed, and duties to be performed on the
emergency scene. A fire department must be able to
determine what tasks need to be accomplished in order
to have a positive influence on the outcome of the
situation.

The number of personnel and apparatus

required to complete those tasks is based on this
knowledge.

The Carmel Fire Department has

undertaken the task to have all personnel participate in
the Blue Card Incident Command Certification program.
This is an all hands, in‐depth incident command training programs as developed and taught by Alan V.
Brunacini, one of the masters of the theory of command as it relates to emergency services.
The Carmel Fire Department performs aggressive offensive interior fire attacks whenever
possible. Through a structured risk management plan, the department has established the following
guidelines to provide direction to on‐scene personnel in evaluating conditions:


We may risk our lives a lot to protect savable lives.



We may risk our lives a little to protect savable property.



We will not risk our lives at all to save what is already lost.

46

Carmel Fire Department Standards of Cover – 2013 Edition

On Scene Operations
The variables of fire growth dynamics, life safety hazards of the building’s occupants as well as to the
firefighters, and the potential loss of property combine to determine the fireground tasks that must be
accomplished to prevent harm and mitigate loss. These tasks are interrelated, but can be separated into
two basic types: fire flow and life safety. Fire flow tasks are those related to getting water on the fire. Life
safety tasks are those related to locating and removing any trapped victims from the fire structure and the
establishment of a team to perform rapid intervention team (RIT) tasks.
Fire flow tasks can be accomplished with either hand held hoses or master streams. Master streams take
relatively fewer firefighters to operate because they are most often fixed to the apparatus or are operated
outside of the hazard zone.
The decision to use interior hand lines or exterior master streams is dependent upon several factors, such
as: The building and its inherent characteristics such as size, construction type, and degree of interior
compartmentalization; the fire and its size, location, extent, and the length of time it has been burning; the
type of occupancy and its contents; the life hazard associated with the occupancy including the number and
location of occupants and their physical condition; the arrangement of exterior exposures and the
proximity to the involved structure; the number of resources that can be committed to operations as well
as the supporting infrastructure such as water supply and fire protection systems; the Carmel Fire
Departments actions and the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of those actions; and any special
circumstances associated with the incident such as inclement weather.
If the fire has extended beyond the capability of hand held hoses to confine it, or if structural damage is a
threat to firefighters' safety, the priority shifts to prevent the fire from advancing to surrounding exposures.
First arriving firefighters may use a transitional "defensive to offensive" strategy (discussed below) to limit
or remove an Immediate Danger to Life or Health (IDLH) threat while awaiting the arrival of additional
resources.
Life safety tasks are based upon the number of occupants, their location, their status (e.g. awake versus
sleeping), and their ability to take self‐preserving action. For example, ambulatory adults require less
assistance than non‐ambulatory adults. The elderly and small children also require more assistance. The
key to a fire department's success at a fire is adequate staffing and coordinated teamwork. Before on‐
47

Carmel Fire Department Standards of Cover – 2013 Edition

scene procedures can be established, the initial Incident Commander (IC) must select an appropriate initial
strategy – offensive, defensive, or investigative.
An offensive strategy is an aggressive interior fire attack and is used whenever possible. The top priority is
rescue of trapped victims (life safety). The Carmel Fire Department’s goal is to eliminate any and all fire
related deaths or injuries and to contain fires to their room of origin. The first objective is to put a hose line
between the victims and the fire and to rescue those victims by removing them from the hazard area. The
second is to extinguish the fire as quickly as possible.
A defensive strategy is one that does not allow interior fire attack except as needed to rescue trapped
firefighters. When in the defensive strategy, the structure is considered devoid of all savable human life.
There are no tenable spaces within the structure and no attempts are made to retrieve bodies because fire
and structural conditions do not warrant the risk to firefighters.
An investigative strategy is where first arriving unit see nothing out of the ordinary. All other arriving units
will remain in staging to await an assignment from the Incident Commander.

Structure Fire Critical Tasking
Single‐family dwelling fires are considered the moderate
average fire type; therefore, critical tasks are outlined for this
type of response. These tasks must be conducted in a timely
manner by firefighters in order to control the fire and to give
any trapped occupants the greatest chances for survival. The
fire department is responsible for assuring that responding
companies are capable of performing all of the described
tasks in a prompt and proficient manner.
Attack Line: A 1¾‐inch hose that produces a minimum of 120 gallon per minute (GPM) or a 2½‐inch hose
that produces a minimum of 250 GPM. Each engine carries a set of attack lines that are pre‐connected to
the apparatus, folded on the hose bed, or in packed for carrying into standpipe equipped high‐rise
buildings.

48

Carmel Fire Department Standards of Cover – 2013 Edition

The selection of which attack line to use depends upon the speed with which the line must be placed in
service, the type of structure, the potential fuel loading it contains and the presence or lack of dividing walls
or partitions within the structure, and the volume of water that is needed to ensure complete
extinguishment.
Search and Rescue: A minimum of two firefighters along with a line officer assigned to search for living
victims and remove them from danger while the attack crew moves between the victims and the fire to
stop the fire from advancing. A three‐person crew is normally sufficient for most moderate risk structures,
but more crews are required in multi‐story buildings or structures with people who are not capable of self‐
preservation.
Ventilation Crew: A minimum of two firefighters are
required to open a horizontal or vertical ventilation
channel when the attack crew is ready to enter the
building. Vertical ventilation or ventilation of a multi‐
story

building

can

require

more

than

two

firefighters. Ventilation removes superheated gases,
noxious and obscuring smoke, and prevents flashover.
This increases firefighter safety by allowing interior
crews to see and work closer to the seat of the fire. It also gives the toxic products of combustion an exit
route away from endangered occupants or unburned property.
Ventilation must be closely coordinated with the fire attack. If it is performed too soon, the fire will get
additional oxygen and grow. If performed too late, the attack crew will be operating in an extremely hostile
environment where superheated gases and smoke obscure firefighter’s vision and slows down the attack.
Backup Line: A 1¾‐inch or 2½‐inch line is deployed behind the attack crew to protect their means of egress
in the event the fire overwhelms them or a problem develops with the attack line.
A 2½‐inch line may be used for back up instead of a 1¾‐inch line when the type of fire is one that could
grow rapidly if not stopped by the initial attack line.

49

Carmel Fire Department Standards of Cover – 2013 Edition

Rapid Intervention Team: A minimum of four firefighters equipped with flashlights, radios, RIT self‐
contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), flat head axe, halligan tool, RIT search rope, and Thermal Imagining
Camera (TIC) are available near the entry point to enter the structure tasked with performing search and
rescue of injured or lost firefighters. This particular requirement is an Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA) rule.
Exposure Line: A minimum of a 1¾‐inch attack line may be taken above the fire in multi‐story buildings to
prevent fire extension, or used externally to protect nearby structures from igniting from exposure to
radiant heat. In situations where the heat release is great, such as fires involving large quantities of
flammable liquids, a 2½ inch line or apparatus mounted deck gun could be used. If 2½ inch lines are used, it
doubles the staffing requirement.
Pump Operator: A firefighter/engineer must be assigned to operate the fire apparatus and supply the
correct pressure to the attack, back up and exposure lines, and to monitor the pressure changes caused by
changing flows on each line. This firefighter/engineer also completes the hose hookups to the correct
discharges, and completes the water supply hookup to the correct intake. The pump operator can
sometimes make the hydrant hookup alone if the engine is near a hydrant, but the hydrant spacing for
moderate risk fires normally precludes this.
Water Supply: A crew must establish a reliable water supply by either connecting to a fire hydrant or
initiating a tanker shuttle operation. Regardless of which method, timing is a critical factor. An engine has
about four minutes of water if one 1¾‐inch line is flowing.
Incident Commander: An officer is assigned to remain outside the structure to coordinate the attack,
evaluate results, manage the operating strategy, arrange for more resources, and monitor conditions that
might jeopardize crew safety.

50

Carmel Fire Department Standards of Cover – 2013 Edition

Emergency Medical Services Critical Tasking
Requests for Emergency Medical Services (EMS) comprise approximately 66% of all service demands for the
agency. These calls include, but are not limited
to: car accidents, childbirth, heart attack,
stroke, difficulty breathing, and cardiac arrest
(i.e. not breathing, no pulse).

The wide

assortment of EMS calls makes it difficult to
outline the critical tasks for each call type;
however local protocol is followed for all
situations. For most responses, an advanced
life support (ALS) engine and an advanced life
support/basic life support (BLS) ambulance respond which allows for a minimum of six personnel certified
as EMT‐B and one being a certified paramedic to provide medical care.

Based on the call type, a response can be upgraded, or subsequently downgraded, either automatically via
dispatch, or by individual personnel based on information provided.

All EMS alarms are processed and dispatched by the Hamilton County Communications Center utilizing the
Medical Priority Emergency Medical Dispatching (EMD) protocols.

Special Operations Critical Tasking
Hazardous Materials Response Critical Tasking
All Carmel Fire Department personnel are trained
to the HazMat operations level as a minimum, per
OSHA 1910.120. Additionally, several firefighters
are trained to the HazMat technician level and
participate as members of the Hamilton County
Hazardous Materials Task Force (HCHMTF). In the
51

Carmel Fire Department Standards of Cover – 2013 Edition

event a hazardous materials incident requires a technician response, the Carmel Fire Department will utilize
the HCHMTF and provide on‐duty personnel to assist as technicians. The tasking for hazmat incidents is
followed through guidelines established internally and supplemented by the District 5 Hazardous Materials
Training and Advisory Council.

Technical Rescue Critical Tasking
The Carmel Fire Department does not have a tactical rescue but relies on the Hamilton County Rescue Task
Force (HCRTF) for its needs. The HCRTF members are trained to the trench rescue operations level, rope
rescue operations level, confined space operations level, water rescue operations level, and building
collapse awareness level. In addition, the HCRTF has a technical rescue team with personnel trained to the
technician level in all areas, which is simultaneously dispatched to incidents. The team follows county
developed response protocols to handle all situations.

Establishment of an Effective Response Force
Once critical tasks have been identified and defined, an effective response force can be established. This
force is defined as the amount of equipment and personnel that must reach a specific location within the
specified response time. Fire risk cannot
be held to zero. Thus, the objective of
this standard of response coverage study
is

to

identify

distribution,

a

balance

among

concentration,

and

reliability that will keep fire risk at a
reasonable level, while yielding the
maximum savings of life and property.

The fire scene is unpredictable in many
ways. While it is possible to state what
critical tasks must be accomplished in order to extinguish a fire, it is not always possible to predict how
many firefighters it will take to accomplish those tasks. The number of personnel and the amount of
equipment necessary to accomplish the critical tasks listed will vary due to the following factors:
52

Carmel Fire Department Standards of Cover – 2013 Edition



Delayed response;



Building construction;



Number of occupants;



Physical and emotional condition of occupants;



Extent of fire upon arrival (flashover);



Built‐in fire protection;



Area of fire involvement;



Firefighter or civilian injuries;



Water supply



Equipment failure.

The need for more personnel may arise on any fire scene at any time. Fire conditions must dictate the
minimum response needed for any given fire, even if that response exceeds the requirements listed in this
document. The experience and professional judgment of our officers to request additional resources early
in an incident is highly valued. Officers are encouraged to call for help whenever they feel it may be useful.
The Carmel Fire Department utilizes risk assessment, staffing considerations, equipment standards, and
task analysis of the necessary elements needed to mitigate common fire emergencies. These elements are
outlined in the tables listed below.

Distribution
The term "distribution" describes the station and resource locations needed to minimize and terminate
emergencies by assuring a sufficiently rapid first due response deployment. Distribution is measured by the
percent of the jurisdiction covered by first due units within the jurisdiction. The Carmel Fire Department
has established a nine minute and thirty seconds (9:30) response time 90% of the time from alarm time to
arrival.
The officers of the Carmel Fire Department have established an effective response force that places three
engines, one ladder, one ambulance and the on‐duty battalion chief on the initial dispatch to a reported
residential or commercial fire. In addition, in areas of automatic aid a 4th engine will be started for
assistance with RIT or any duty assigned by the battalion chief. This is standard response for reported
residential and commercial fires.

Concentration
Concentration is the spacing of multiple resources arranged within close enough proximity that an initial
effective response force can be assembled on‐scene within sufficient time frames. An initial effective
response force is one that will most likely stop the escalation of an emergency of a specific risk type.
In determining concentration, the Carmel Fire Department again looked at risk assessment, call volume,
population, and critical tasking. When considering concentration of units, it should be noted that the
54

Carmel Fire Department Standards of Cover – 2013 Edition

Department has entered into automatic and/or mutual aid agreements with all surrounding communities.
These agreements benefit the Carmel Fire Department by allowing the use of neighboring fire stations
within close enough proximity to bolster initial effective response forces for the Carmel Fire Department.
Additional resources may be obtained by utilizing mutual aid through the established running orders in the
Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) Center. The running orders have been established to go up to at least 100
stations deep for any call type in the CAD system.
With the current running orders, there has not been a need to write special running orders for a specific
structure in the Carmel Fire Department response area. However, the department will continue to review
new and existing structures to see if there is a need to establish a special running order.

Reliability
Response reliability is defined as the probability that the required amount of staffing and apparatus will be
available when a fire or emergency call is received.
If every piece of fire department's apparatus were available in its desired location every time a fire/EMS call
was received, then the department's response reliability would be 100 percent. If however, a call is
received for a particular company and that company is busy at another call, a substitute company must be
assigned from another station. If the substituting station is too far away, that company cannot respond
within the maximum prescribed travel time.

61

Carmel Fire Department Standards of Cover – 2013 Edition

The department has implemented a video conferencing system that allows apparatus to stay in district and
participate in classroom training, which will help with reliability keeping those units in their primary district
while still participating in training activities. Also, the department has implemented a modified response
during severe storms when there is the probability of several back‐to‐back alarm calls, meaning a single unit
will respond on the alarm call for an investigation. The department is continually looking for ways to make
sure response reliability is considered in all aspects of the department.

As the number of emergency calls per day increases, so does the probability that a needed piece of
apparatus will already be busy when a call is received. Consequently, the department's response reliability
decreases.

Component F ‐ Performance Objectives and Measures
This section reviews the types of emergencies the fire department has historically responded to, as well as
the pattern of incidents, the community risk, and the overall impact this has on the department’s
effectiveness.

Component G ‐ Compliance Methodology
Overview of Compliance Methodology
The preceding sections of this report provide a detailed analysis of the historical performance of the Carmel
Fire Department. In order for this to prove beneficial to department and city policy makers, continued
analysis will be performed on a routine basis. The data provided to the project team for analysis initially
proved to be difficult to analyze from the standpoint of being consistent and complete. The creation and
implementation of a continuous quality assurance program on all Carmel Fire Department incident records
helped to ensure accurate data for this report.
The Carmel Fire Department is committed to a continual process of analyzing and evaluating actual
performance against the adopted standards of cover and will enhance the data collection procedures of
field operations personnel. Periodic review of the department’s records management system reports will
be necessary to ensure compliance and reliability of data.
Compliance Model
Compliance is best achieved through a systematic approach. Carmel Fire Department has identified the
following six‐step compliance model.

Component H ‐ Overall Evaluation
In 1999, the City of Carmel hired a consultant that reported an eventual need for a seventh fire station to
cover the northwest section. Recent data has shown that while the population density has increased in the
northwest area, only a small area routinely falls outside the six minute, thirty second response goal.
Options to mitigate this shortfall will be evaluated and employed over the next several years before seeking
solutions that may intensely impact city resources.

The below maps detail the incidents exceeding the effective response force objective of sixteen minutes in
Station 42 and Station 46 quadrants.

The other area of concern to the agency is the call processing times exceed the national standards. The
agency has been and is actively working with the Hamilton County Communications Center to reduce this
time. On February 3, 2013, the agencies revised the existing dispatch policy. The new policy allows the
dispatcher to determine the call type, rather than the Pro QA. The dispatcher now dispatches the run and
then utilizes the Pro QA for pre‐arrival instructions and additional information gathering, thus reducing the
alarm processing time.

The Standard of Cover document is the basis for policy and procedure changes that will have a positive
impact on the achievenent of performance measures. The Standard of Cover document will be integrated
into the agency budgeting process and the Strategic Plan, The Standard of Cover document will be
reviewed every six months at a mininmum to ensure performance objectives are being met and to identify
areas that may need to be addressed.

Mission Statement:

New Initiatives:

The Department of Public Safety supports the City’s vision of “Safe Streets,
Strong Neighborhoods, and a Thriving Economy” by protecting the lives, rights,
and property of the Citizens of our City and maintaining the public order.

The following will help the Department strengthen the professional capabilities
and perhaps better utilize the resources that are available for public use:

Significant Events:
The department’s five divisions, Animal Control, Emergency Management
Planning, Weights and Measures, Fire, and Police, emphasize the safety of the
citizenry. During the past year, the emphasis has been on improving technology
while continuing with business as usual. This includes shaping all areas of the
department to be responsive and proactive to needs of the community. The
following are some highlights of the past year and some expectations for the
coming year:
•

The Indianapolis Fire Department is introducing a comprehensive five-year
strategic plan, titled Project 2005. This document was developed by over
120 firefighters to prepare IFD for the future. The plan provides a path and
course of action for the department over five years. The plan has 10
sections and addresses future issues from resource location and equipment
status to community relations and public partnerships. It is a systematic
approach to fire protection for the next decade and provides a focus for the
department as a community leader and neighborhood partner.

•

An IndyGov Public Safety Website has been developed within the
INDYGOV Home Page at http://www.indygov.org/pubsafety.html.

•

New performance standards have been implemented for the Police
department and improvements in Community Policing have and will
continue to be implemented.

•

Investment in people, equipment, technology, and physical resources.

•

Administrative integration and coordination with County and Township
public safety organizations to increase regional efficiencies.

•

Continued commitment to community policing and fire safety education.

•

Emergency Management will add six new sirens to the countywide tornado
warning system. Continued support of leadership in Anti-terrorist Nuclear,
Biological, and Chemical (NBC) training and readiness

•

Improve Animal Control image and update equipment. An Internet WEB
Page is planned as a public access site to encourage adoptions and inform
the public about Animal Control Law.

•

IFD will build a new Fire Station 14 at 30th and Kenwood Avenue, which
includes adjacent property. The project is the result of a strong coalition
between government and the corporate community, and includes
neighborhood partners. Special funding has been established for the $1.8
million dollar project, and environmental studies are in progress to
determine land cleanup issues. The new facility will consist of 10,000
square feet, 4 apparatus bays and quarter 4 fire apparatus, and 10
firefighters per shift.

•

There are new initiatives to reduce crime and an emphasis is placed on
community involvement in solutions. We understand the importance of
having the city work with us as a part of the solution.

Department of Public Safety
Administration Division

Mission Statement:
The Division of Administration’s mission is to administer and coordinate
efforts among the five divisions: Police, Fire, Weights & Measures,
Emergency Management Planning, and Animal Control. The Division is
responsible for the management and operation of Public Safety in the
Consolidated City.

New Initiatives:
The Director’s office will provide oversight and direction for the department’s
primary initiatives, which are summarized as follows:
•

Investment in people, equipment, technology, and physical resources.

•

Administrative integration of County and Township public safety
organizations to increase regional efficiencies.

•

Continued commitment to community policing and fire safety education.

The Administration Division consists of the Director, Chief Financial Officer,
Executive Assistant, Office Manager, Receptionist, and the Executive Director
along with two specialists of the Citizen’s Police Complaint Office. Police and
Fire Merit Boards assist the director with hiring, promotion, affirmative action
policies, and major disciplinary problems in the police and fire divisions.

•

Continued support of leadership in Anti-terrorist Nuclear, Biological, and
Chemical (NBC) training and readiness

•

Improve Animal Control image and update equipment

The office provides administrative support for all five divisions as well as
oversight and direction for each of the divisions.

These developments will allow the department to strengthen the professional
capabilities of its workforce, improve services, and redirect limited public
safety resources to front-line activities and prevention efforts which, in
concert, lead to an improved public safety organization.

•

In addition, the division responds to major emergencies; coordinates
resources between public safety agencies, public works, utilities and many
private disaster response organizations; and maintains and operates the
Emergency Operations Center.

•

Emergency Management also serves as the sponsoring/coordinating
agency for the Metropolitan Medical Strike Team, one of 27 in the United
States, which responds to chemical, biological, and nuclear terrorist
incidents.

•

Emergency Management continues its sponsoring role with the Urban
Search and Rescue Task Force.

•

Emergency Management will add six new sirens to the countywide
tornado warning system.

•

Emergency Management is responsible for administering federal grants
for Domestic Preparedness Initiatives.

Organizational Policy:
Emergency Management is responsible for planning for all hazards that
threaten the community, whether natural, or man-made. The division must
comply with mandates from both the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) and the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA). The
division analyzes major incidents so those lessons from actual events may be
incorporated into emergency plans.

New Initiatives:
•

•

Emergency Management participates in mitigation efforts -- operating a
public warning siren system, making information on potential hazards
available, and working with other units of government to reduce those
hazards.

New Initiatives:

Mission Statement:
The Indianapolis Police Department strives to uphold the highest professional
standards while enforcing laws that protect life and property, as well as,
respecting individual rights, human dignity, and community values. Through
community policing, the Department commits to creating and maintaining
police and community partnerships while helping citizens identify and solve
problems to improve the quality of life in their neighborhoods.

Organizational Policy:
Central to the Indianapolis Police Department mission is community policing.
This law enforcement philosophy and organizational strategy places the police
and the community in a problem-solving partnership to address law violations
and to develop strategies for meeting the public safety concerns of neighborhood
residents beyond individual crime incidents. This team approach to law
enforcement makes the officer more accessible to the citizens and empowers
residents to reclaim their neighborhoods from criminals.

In 2000, the Indianapolis Police Department will strive to:
• Improve the quality of life in city neighborhoods through an expansion of
the Federal Weed and Seed program.
• Reduce violent crime by identifying and targeting repeat violent offenders.
• Cut the supply of illicit drugs on the streets through aggressive investigation
and arrest of drug suppliers by a centralized narcotics unit.
• Reduce youth crime and victimization with the establishment of a Youth
Services Section that provides constructive alternatives programs and
education to at-risk youth.
• Improve the Department’s readiness for large and critical incidents through
expanded Mobile Field Force and Incident Command Training.
• Improve problem-solving efforts through better crime analysis and IMAP
strategies.
• Increase traffic safety by reducing alcohol-and drug-related traffic accidents
accomplished in part by the creation of a drunk-driving enforcement unit.
• Expand community partnerships and support neighborhood efforts at crimeprevention.

Outcome and Combined Activities Description:

COMMUNITY POLICING Community policing consists of upholding the
highest professional standards while serving the community in the enforcement
of laws, while also respecting individual rights, human dignity and community
values; to maintain active police and community relationships; and assist
citizens in identifying and solving problems to improve the quality of life in
their neighborhoods.

Patrol/Investigation Services
Patrol is broadly defined as the various activities performed by (typically
uniform) police officers relative to: crime and accident prevention; maintenance
of public order; discovery of hazards and delinquency-causing situations;
response to requested services; investigations of crimes, offenses, incidents, and
conditions, including arresting offenders; traffic control; regulation of certain
businesses or activities (as required by law); provision of emergency services;
development and maintenance of community relations and proactive problem
solving (community policing concepts); and reporting information to the
appropriate organizations.
The fundamental goals of investigation are identifying, detecting, and
apprehending the offender, recovering stolen property, and obtaining a
conviction in court. Basic investigations include incidents that are a violation of

laws and ordinances (crime and traffic); personnel investigations (background
and internal); and, conditions and circumstances which, left unchecked, would
result in an increase in prohibited vices and organized crime.

The department is also heavily involved in such special events as the Brickyard
400, parades, and marathons. Furthermore, such specialty service activities as
SWAT, horse patrol, and bomb disposal provide additional law enforcement
services, including the provision of special training, equipment, methods, and
other resources.
Customer Service Relations and Quality Control
This activity includes services that enhance community and police relations,
promote public safety education, and respond to public inquiries.
Administration
Administrative functions that support the primary activities include the Office of
the Chief, which is responsible for managing and establishing the direction,
programs, and policies of the Department, and which represents the Department
to the public. Setting performance standards, controlling inventory, planning
and researching, managing finances, and providing personnel administration
are the primary tasks of administrative support.

Police

Integrated Policing Services
Integrated policing services include activities undertaken with the Marion
County Sheriff’s Department. Currently these services include
Communications, Citizen’s Services, and the Property Branch. The two law
enforcement agencies continue to work towards bridging service delivery
whenever efficiencies and improved service quality can be obtained.

ADMINISTRATION To facilitate and coordinate the implementation of crossdivisional activities which provide internal services to all operating divisions
within the Department.

Administration/Financial Management/Human Resources
This combined activity performs administrative oversight, support, and direction
to the Indianapolis Police Department. Standards and performance, inventory
control, planning and research, financial management, and personnel
administration are the primary areas of administrative support.

Combined Activity

Staffing The authorized strength of Uniformed Officers in the 2000 Indianapolis Police Department Budget has been increased to 1,090. This new strength represents
an increase of 58 Authorized Positions over the level of 1,032 planned in the 1999 Budget. The Indianapolis Police Department is planning to conduct Recruit Classes in
the Fall of 1999, Spring of 2000, and again during the Fall of 2000, in order to add enough new Uniformed Officers to meet the 1,090 Authorized Position Strength.
The 1,064.03 Uniform Officer FTE’s shown below for the 2000 Budget represents the projected average FTE’s for the entire year. The average FTE’s are calculated to
provide a more accurate estimate of Salary Dollar Requirements in the Budget.

Mission Statement:
Operating Highlights:
The Indianapolis Police Department Pension Fund is dedicated to serving retired
officers and their dependents. We are committed to the enforcement of laws to
protect the proceeds of the Pension Fund while providing efficient service to
those individuals in payment of their pension benefits.

Benefits paid by the Indianapolis Police Department Pension Fund are
increasing due to elevation in the salary base. Benefits are paid beginning at
50% for a 20-year patrolman increasing to 74% for 32 years of service.

Organizational Policy:
Benefits paid by the Indianapolis Police Department Pension Fund are
controlled by Indiana State Law, along with, contractual agreements between the
City of Indianapolis and the Fraternal Order of Police. The Division currently
coordinates two pension plans for officers. The 1953 Plan is funded by the City
of Indianapolis, while the State of Indiana funds the 1977 Plan out of
contributions by the City to the State Public Employees Retirement Fund (PERF)
plan. The Indianapolis Police Department currently has a total of 295 officers
who are eligible to retire under one or the other of these plans. Of this total, 137
are members of the 1953 plan, 126 more were originally 1953 Fund members
who have since converted to the 1977 Fund Plan, and 32 are members initially
joining the 1977 plan. The department is currently retiring an average of 30
officers per year.

2000
Projected

* : As of 06/30/99
**: On 10/01/98, responsibility for payment of benefits was transferred to the
State for 99 converted members of the 1953 Fund

emergencies. The Department is dedicated to minimizing the loss of life and
property through suppression, rescue, education, code enforcement,
investigation, and innovative programs.

•

As a member of the National Wellness/Fitness 10 Cities Task Force, IFD
will concentrate on enhancing the health and fitness of the workforce. The
initiative includes new physical entry standards for recruits and will
continue to address incumbent fitness levels. The example program is a
progressive evolution to meet national health and fitness standards for
firefighters. The Indianapolis Fire Department is currently recognized as
one of the national leaders in health and fitness.

•

The department is currently in a four year, three phase upgrade of its
communications and records management systems. Metropolitan
Emergency Communications Agency (MECA) is in the process of
upgrading the hardware and software for the Computer Aid Dispatch
(CAD). As part of this initial project, MECA is integrating the Fire
Records Management System into the new MECA FRMS and setting up a
county wide Fire/Police Email system. The new system is year 2000
compliant. The Email system will allow all of the Public Safety agencies to
communicate with each other. Phase 1 will be complete by the end of the
fourth quarter of 1999. Phase 2 is the upgrading of the CAD to accept
Graphical User Interface terminals, Mapping and Automated Vehicle
Location (AVL). AVL will allow the department to constantly monitor the
location of all of our fire fighting/emergency vehicles using Global
Positioning Satellites (GPS). This will help insure that we send the closest
appropriate equipment to the emergency.

Organizational Policy:
The Indianapolis Fire Department fulfills its mission by aggressively
suppressing active fires and responding immediately to emergency, medical, and
rescue calls. The Department recognizes that it is an integral part of the
neighborhoods it serves and strives to be sensitive and responsive to
neighborhood needs and priorities.

New Initiatives:
•

In 1999/2000, IFD will build a new Fire Station 14 at 30th and Kenwood
Avenue, which includes adjacent property. The project is the result of a
strong coalition between government and the corporate community, and
includes neighborhood partners. Special funding has been established for
the $1.8 million dollar project, and environmental studies are in progress to
determine land cleanup issues. The new facility will consist of 10,000
square feet, 4 apparatus bays and quarter 4 fire apparatus, and 10
firefighters per shift.

•

In the summer of 1999, the Indianapolis Fire Department will introduce a
comprehensive five-year strategic plan, titled Project 2005. This
sophisticated document was developed by over 120 firefighters to prepare
IFD for the future. The plan provides a path and course of action for the

City of Indianapolis

2000 Annual Budget
Department of Public Safety
Fire

New Initiatives (continued):
The result will be a better allocation of our resources allowing for increased
protection to the community. Included in this phase is the installation of
Mobile DataTerminals (MDT) and Mobile Data Computers (laptop
computers).
These devices will interface with the CAD and give the firefighters dispatch
information as well as hazard information as they respond to emergencies.
Phase 2 is tentatively scheduled for completion in the third quarter of 2000.
The final phase of this project will be the ability to use Mobile Field
Reporting of Fire/Hazmat Inspections as well as EMS/Fire reporting. Fire
Inspectors will have the ability to enter fire inspection and hazard
information as they are making their site inspections. This will allow for
real time query of hazardous information. Firefighters and Emergency
Medical personnel will also enter their EMS reports directly into the
system. This phase will begin in the fourth quarter of 2000.

Outcome and Combined Activities Description:
HAZMAT

FIRE SUPPRESSION & EMERGENCY SERVICES. This Department
provides an appropriate, safe, and professional response to fire, medical, and
environmental emergencies. Through its programs of suppression, rescue,
education, code enforcement, investigation and other programs, the Department
minimizes the loss of life and property.

Fire Suppression
Fire Suppression responds to calls from the community requiring services as the
result of accidents, natural disasters, arson, or other sources. Activities include
rescuing individuals trapped in burning structures and putting out fires.
EMS
EMS responds to calls from the community requesting emergency medical
service. Paramedic teams are dispatched and responsible for administering firstcontact care to patients while transporting them to a nearby medical facility.
Rescue
These services consist of responding to calls from the community requesting
rescues. Sometimes they are performed in conjunction with such other Fire
Department activities as Fire Suppression or EMS. Rescue Services also
improve firefighter safety through education, training, and equipment purchases.

HAZMAT responds to calls from the community requesting the containment
and cleanup of hazardous materials. Fire suppression activities involving
hazardous substances require assistance from this unit. HAZMAT seeks to
comply with NFPA 1500, OSHA mandated training and education standards,
and other regulations.

E-911
E-911 takes emergency calls from the community, provides timely and accurate
information to Fire/EMS companies, and dispatches appropriate emergency
assistance. E-911 also provides educational and professional opportunities for
operators.
Firefighter Training / Education
The Training Division promotes incumbent / recruit training based on nationally
accepted professional standards. The Indianapolis Fire Department is
committed to complying with the National Fire Protection Association’s
standards for fire departments and is near full compliance.
Fire Prevention
Code enforcement and community services promote and enhance the safety and
welfare of the community through family emergency preparedness education,
fire victim assistance, investigations, active support of and participation in
neighborhood programs, and special community events. The Investigation unit,

City of Indianapolis

2000 Annual Budget
Department of Public Safety
Fire

a combination of members of both the police and fire departments, has
consistently cleared arson cases at twice the national average, with equally high
conviction rates. The unit also focuses on juvenile fires, and supervises referrals
to the juvenile justice system and to the juvenile fire stop counseling program.

ADMINISTRATION. To facilitate and coordinate the implementation of
cross-divisional activities which provide internal services to all operating
divisions within the Department.

Administrative, Apparatus, and Fire Station Support
These provide the administrative support, tools, equipment, apparatus, and
facilities necessary to carry out the department’s mission. The division also
strives to provide a safe, comfortable, and functional living environment for fire
fighters when they are not actively engaged in emergency responses.

Administration/Financial Management/Human Resources
This combined activity performs administrative oversight, support, and direction
to the Indianapolis Fire Department. Planning, financial management, and
personnel administration are the primary areas of administrative support.

Mission Statement:
The purpose of the Indianapolis Fire Department Pension Fund is to keep
records on each pensioner’s taxes, insurance, and benefits status and to disperse
the appropriate pension payments. This office also assists the families of both
retired and active firefighters at the time of death and is the official
representative of the Indianapolis Fire Department at the funeral.

Operating Highlights:
Benefits paid by the Indianapolis Fire Department Pension Fund are increasing
due to the elevation in the pension base. Benefits are paid beginning at 50% of
the pension base for a 20-year firefighter increasing to 74% of the pension base
for 32 years of service.

Department of Public Safety

Mission Statement
The Department of Public Safety is responsible for providing fire and police protection in the fire and police special service districts, operating an
animal care and control division, providing civil defense and emergency management planning, and operating a division of weights and measures in
st
support of the City’s vision of “Assuring Personal Safety, Strengthening Neighborhoods, Developing a 21 Century Economy and Preparing Our
Youth” by protecting the lives, rights, and property of the Citizens of our City, and maintaining the public order.
Highlights of Public Safety
The department’s five divisions, Animal Care and Control, Emergency Management Planning, Weights and Measures, Fire, and Police, emphasize the
safety of the citizenry. During the year 2002, the Department of Public Safety plans to provide Indianapolis citizens with public safety services that are
responsive, reliable, high quality, and cost-effective through excellent customer service and community involvement. Below are highlights from 2001 and
initiatives planned for 2002 by the Department of Public Safety:
•

The City of Indianapolis was awarded a $10.65 million COPS
Grant in 2000 from the U.S. Department of Justice to add 142
new community police officers over the next three years. In
January 2001, the City of Indianapolis was awarded an
additional $3.3 million in COPS Grants with 44 community
police officers. These grants along with full funding for 58
new officers funded in the 2000 budget will result in
meeting the Mayor’s pledge to add a total of 200
community police officers to the Indianapolis Police
Department. The COPS Grant will provide a total of $75,000
in funding towards the salary of each officer over a period of
three years.

•

The Department of Public Safety and the Indianapolis Police
Department are planning to add a new helicopter to its fleet in
2002. The current primary helicopter is a 1968 Bell-TEXTRON
206 Jet Ranger. A Hughes 269C is currently used as the
backup aircraft. The Tactical Air Patrol is one of the most
important strategic tools available to IPD.

•

The Indianapolis Police Department plans to implement a new
capability for the Automated Fingerprint Identification System.
The 2002 plan is to utilize a $1.5 million Federal grant to help
fund implementation of palm print identification capability.
Approximately 40 percent of latent prints found at crime
scenes are palm prints, which must go through a manually
intensive process for identification absent the automated
capability.

•

The Animal Care and Control Division has started a project to
improve Air Handling within the Kennel facility to remove
airborne diseases from the shelter's humid kennels and ease
the suffering of employees, volunteers and animals during long
summer months. The City raised more than $124,000 in
private donations from more than 200 individuals, families and
groups, including $50,000 from the Indianapolis Motor
Speedway and its board chairman Mari Hulman George, and
$50,000 from The Kroger Company. Expected completion of
the project is late Summer / early Fall of 2001.

Public Safety is planning to develop Websites during 2002 for the
Animal Care and Control Division and the Citizen’s Police Complaint
Office. The main Public Safety Website is available within the
INDYGOV Home Page at http://www.indygov.org/pubsafety.htm.

•

The Indianapolis Fire Department has built a new Fire Station (14) at
th
30 and Kenwood Avenue near the Indianapolis Children’s Museum.
The projected opening of this station is late Summer / early Fall 2001.
The new facility consists of 10,000 square feet, 4 apparatus bays and
will quarter 4 fire apparatus and 10 firefighters per shift.

•

Improve the safety of the community.

•

Educate more than 18,000 children in fire safety through the Survive
Alive Program.

The purpose of the Indianapolis Police Department Pension Office is to keep records on pensioners’ taxes, insurance, and benefits status, and to
ensure accurate disbursement of pension payments. The Division maintains two police pension plans, namely, the 1953 Pension Act, funded by
the City of Indianapolis, and the 1977 Plan funded by the State of Indiana with contributions by the City to the 1977 Police Pension and Disability
Fund. The office also assists families of both retired and active police officers at the time of death.

Staffing (All staffing levels in the budget book are expressed as Full Time Equivalents, or F.T.E. One F.T.E. is based on a full time employee’s work year of
2,080 hours. To calculate F.T.E.’s for part time or seasonal employees, the total of the hours budgeted is divided by 2,080.

Indianapolis Police Department The authorized strength of Uniformed Officers in the 2002 Indianapolis Police Department Budget has been
increased to 1,232. This new strength represents the award and acceptance of a $3.3 million Department of Justice grant for 44 Community Oriented Police
Officers (COPS) over the level of 1,188 authorized positions in the 2001 budget. The Indianapolis Police Department is planning to conduct Recruit Classes in
the Fall of 2001, Spring of 2002, and again during the Fall of 2002, in order to add enough new Uniformed Officers to meet a Budget Year 2001 target of 1,132
positions filled by the start of the Fall 2001 class. The capacity of the Training Academy, coupled with projected retirements and attrition, will be limiting
factors in adding and netting enough new positions to meet the full authorized strength of 1,188. It is anticipated that IPD may be able to reach the full
authorized strength in 2002 when additional classes are started. The 1,107 Uniform Officer FTE’s shown below for the 2001 Budget represents the monthly
projected average FTE’s for the entire year. The average FTE’s are calculated to provide a more accurate estimate of Salary Dollar Requirements in the Budget.

Mission Statement
The purpose of the Indianapolis Fire Department Pension Office is to keep records on pensioners’ taxes, insurance, and benefits status, and to ensure
accurate disbursement of pension payments. The Division maintains two firefighter pension plans, namely, the 1937 Pension Act, funded by the City of
Indianapolis, and the 1977 Plan funded by the State of Indiana with contributions by the City to the 1977 Firefighters Pension and Disability Fund.
The office also assists families of both retired and active firefighters at the time of death and is the official representative of the Indianapolis Fire Department
at the funeral. It is dedicated to serving retired firefighters and their dependents and educating active officers in preparation for their retirement, and is
committed to enforcing the laws protecting the Pension Fund.
Highlights of the Indianapolis Fire Department Pension Office
Benefits paid by the Indianapolis Fire Department Pension Fund will increase in 2002 due to the elevation in the pension base, anticipated growth in plan
membership, and a contract-mandated increase in the City’s contribution to the 1977 Pension Fund. Benefits are paid beginning at 50% of the pension
base for a 20-year firefighter increasing to 74% of the pension base for 32 years of service.

Fire Department Terminology
A
•

Accelerant: flammable fuel (often liquid) used by some arsonists to increase size
or intensity of fire. May also be accidentally introduced when HAZMAT becomes
involved in fire.

•

Accountability: The process of emergency responders (fire, police, SAR,
emergency medical, etc...) checking into and making themselves announced as
being on-scene during an incident to an incident commander or accountability
officer. Through the accountability system, each person is tracked throughout the
incident until released from the scene by the incident commander or
accountability officer. This is becoming a standard in the emergency services
arena primarily for the safety of emergency personnel. This system may
implement a name tag system or personal locator device (tracking device used by
each individual that is linked to a computer).

•

Alarm: (1) system for detecting and reporting unusual conditions, such as smoke,
fire, flood, loss of air, HAZMAT release, etc; (2) a specific assignment of
multiple fire companies and/or units to a particular incident, usually of fire in
nature; (3) centralized dispatch center for interpreting alarms and dispatching
resources.

•

Apparatus: A term usually used by firefighters describing a department vehicle
(i.e. fire engine).

B
•

•

Backdraft: A fire phenomenon caused when heat and heavy smoke (unburned
fuel particles) accumulate inside a compartment, depleting the available air, and
then oxygen/air is re-introduced, completing the fire triangle and causing rapid
combustion.
Bus: Common term (firefighter slang) usually referring to an Ambulance

C
•

Charge a hose: To make water pressure available on a hose in final preparation
for its use. This is done on the scene after the hose is deployed.

•

Chauffeur: Driver of a particular emergency apparatus. A paid position within
the fire department and a promotable position.

•

Class A fire: A fire involving combustibles such as wood, paper, and other
natural materials.
Class B fire: A fire involving hydrocarbons.
Class C fire: An electrical fire.
Class D fire: A fire involving metals, such as sodium, titanium, magnesium,
potasium, uranium, lithium, plutonium and calcium.

•
•
•

•
•
•

•
•

•

•

Cockloft: structural space above ceiling and below rafters, often connecting
adjacent occupancies and permitting fire to spread laterally, often unseen.
Collapse zone: The area around a structure that would contain debris if the
building were to collapse.
Company: two or more firefighters organized as a team, led by a fire officer, and
equipped to perform certain operational functions. Compare with platoon and
unit.
Company officer - A fire officer, typically a lieutenant or captain, who leads a
team of two or more firefighters in a company.
Compartment Fire: An "Isolated" fire, or a fire which is "boxed in" or "closed
off" from the rest of the structure. An example of this is a fire in a room where all
the windows and doors are closed preventing the fire from spreading to other
rooms.
Confined space: A confined space is any space: 1) that has limited or restricted
means of entry or exit; 2) is large enough for a person to enter to perform tasks; 3)
and is not designed or configured for continuous occupancy
Cross lay: Arrangement of hose on a pumper such that it can be quickly unloaded
from either side of the apparatus; often pre-connected to a pump outlet and
equipped with a suitable nozzle. Also known as Mattydale Lay.

D
•

Defensive Attack: A primarily exterior form of attack often used when fighting
the fire directly or from within a structure is not feasible due to dangers from
direct flame, heat, structural collapse or the presence of hazardous materials.
Often structures which are fully involved are attacked defensively with the main
goal being the protection of nearby exposures. This form of attack is far less
effective than an Offensive or Direct attack.

•

Direct attack: "Putting the wet stuff on the red stuff." A form of fire attack in
which hoses are advanced to the fire inside a structure and hose streams directed
at the burning materials.

•

Dispatch: Refers to person or place designated for handling a call for help by
alerting the specific resources necessary.

•

Electrical fire: A fire in which the primary source of heat is electricity, resulting
in combustion of adjacent insulation and other materials; may be hazardous to
attempt to extinguish using water.
EMS: Emergency medical service(s).
Engine: A fire suppression vehicle that has a water pump and, typically, is
designed to carry firehose and a limited supply of water.
Engineer: A firefighter responsible for driving the engine to the scene of the call
and operation of the pumps on an engine, to provide sufficient water to the
firefighters on the hose. The term may be either a position title or a rank; usage
varies among departments. (Also see Chauffer)
Engine Company: A group of firefighters assigned to an apparatus with a water
pump and equipped with firehose and other tools related to fire extinguishment.
Engine pressure: The pressure in a fire hose measured at the outlet of the pump.
Enhanced 9-1-1: Electronic system for automatic correlation of physical
telephone lines with information about the location of the caller -- a useful tool for
dispatchers when the caller has an emergency but cannot speak.
Evacuation: Removal of personnel from a dangerous area, in particular, a
HAZMAT incident, burning building, or other emergency. Also refers to act of
removing firefighters from a structure in danger of collapsing.

E

•

•
•

Explorer: a young adult, between 14 and 21, who learns the basics of
firefighting.
Exposure: Property near fire that may become involved by transfer of heat or
burning material from main fire, typically by convection or radiation. May range

•

•

from 40 feet (12 m) to several miles, depending on size and type of fire or
explosion.
Exterior attack: A method of extinguishing a fire which does not involve
entering the structure. Often used when so much of the building is involved in fire
that there is little or no benefit to risking firefighter safety by inserting them into
the structure. May be a temporary measure when there are not sufficient personnel
on scene to form an entry team and a rescue team (to rescue the entry team). Also
known as Surround and drown. Compare Interior attack.
Extrication: removal of a trapped victim such as a vehicle extrication, confined
space rescue, or trench rescue; sometimes using hydraulic spreader, Jaws of
Life, or other technical equipment

•

FDC (Fire Department Connection): Location in which pumping apparatus hooks
to a buildings standpipe and or sprinkler system. Usually a 3" female connection.

•

Fire flow: The amount of water being pumped onto a fire, or required to
extinguish a hypothetical fire. A critical calculation in light of the axiom that an
ordinary fire will not be extinguished unless there is sufficient water to remove
the heat of the fire.
Fireground: The operational area at the scene of a fire; area in which incident
commander is in control. Also used as name of radio frequency to be used by
units operating in the fireground, as in “Responding units switch to fireground.”
Fire hazard: Materials, structures or processes that may result in creating a fire,
permitting a fire to grow undetected, or preventing people from escaping a fire.

•

•

•

Fire inspector: A person responsible for issuing permits and enforcing the fire
code, including any necessary premises inspection, as before allowing (or during)
a large indoor gathering.

•

Fire load (Btu/sq ft): An estimate of the amount of heat that will be given off
during ordinary combustion of all the fuel in a given space; e.g., a bedroom or a
lumberyard.
Fire marshal: Administrative and investigative office for fire prevention and
arson investigation. Has legal authority to enforce state and local fire laws.

•

•

Fire wall: Building structure designed to delay horizontal spread of a fire from
one area of a building to another; often regulated by fire code and required to
have self-closing doors, and fireproof construction.

•

Fit test: Periodic test of how well the facepiece of an SCBA fits a particular
firefighter.

•

Flashover: simultaneous ignition of combustible materials in a closed space, as
when materials simultaneously reach their fire point; may also result in rollover.

•

Foam- Extinguishing agent formed by mixing foam concentrate with water and
aerating the solution for expansion.

•

Forcible entry: gaining entry to an area using force to disable or bypass security
devices, typically using force tools, sometimes using tools specialized for entry
(e.g., Halligan, K-tool).
Forward lay: Procedure of stringing water supply hose from a water source
toward a fire scene; compare with reverse lay.

•

•

Friction loss: Reduction of flow in a firehose caused by friction between the
water and the lining of the hose. Depends primarily upon diameter, type and
length of hose, and amount of water (GPM) flowing through.

•

Fully involved: Term of size-up meaning fire, heat and smoke in a structure are
so widespread that internal access must wait until fire streams can be applied.

G
•

GPM: Gallons Per Minute or how many gallons are being pumped out of a piece
of equipment every minute.

•

HAZMAT: Hazardous materials, including solids, liquids, or gases that may
cause injury, death, or damage if released or triggered.

•

local usage, requiring firefighters to climb stairs or aerial ladders for access to
upper floors.
High-rise pack: A shoulder load of hose with a nozzle and other tools necessary
to connect the hose to a standpipe.

H

•

•

Hot zone: contaminated area of HAZMAT incident that must be isolated; requires
suitable protective equipment to enter and decontamination upon exit; minimum
hot zone distance from unknown material with unknown release is 330 feet
(United Nations Emergency Response Guidebook); surrounded by "warm zone"
where decontamination takes place.

I
•
•
•
•

•

IDLH: Any situation deemed Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health

Indirect attack: Method of firefighting in which water is pumped onto materials
above or near the fire so that the splash rains onto the fire, often used where a
structure is unsafe to enter.
Initial attack: First point of attack on a fire where hose lines or fuel separation
are used to prevent further extension of the fire.

•

Interior attack: Inserting a team of firefighters into the burning structure, in an
attempt to extinguish a blaze from inside the structure, minimizing property
damage from fire, smoke, and water. Requires a minimum of four fully-equipped
firefighters: an entry team of at least two to enter the structure and fight the fire,
and two standing by to rescue or relieve the entry team (see two in, two out). If
the entry team(s) cannot extinguish the blaze, may become an Exterior Attack.

•

ISO Rating: (Insurance Services Office Public Protection Classification Rating)
This is a rating published by the Insurance Services Office. Insurance companies,
in many states, use this number to determine homeowner insurance premiums.
Recently some insurance companies, including State Farm, have now adopted a
per-zip-code, actual loss, based system in several states and no longer use the ISO
(PPC) system.
Irons: The flathead axe mated with the halligan bar. Firefighters often refer to
these as the Crossed Irons, or Married Irons, because the Halligan Bar can fit to
the Axe head.

•

J
•

Jaws of Life: Hydraulic spreader used in extrication procedures. Most
commonly used, but not limited to, during motor vehicle accidents.

•

Ladder Company: A group of fire fighters, officers and engineers that staff a
Truck that’s primary duty is to supply ladders to a fire scene. In most Fire
Departments the Ladder Truck Company is responsible for ventillation of a
structure on fire.

L

•

Level I, II, III Incident: A HAZMAT term denoting the severity of the incident
and the type of response that may be necessary, where Level III is the largest or
most dangerous.

M
•

•

•
•

•

•
•

Maltese Cross: The emblem of the fire service is often referred to as a “Maltese
Cross”. But the actual origin of the current or common emblem in the U.S.
remains uncertain. While it is true that the Knights Hospitalers of Jerusalem
(AKA Knights of St. John) did wear a cross emblem and a version of that cross
has been used as a fire service icon, it bears little resemblance to the current form
in use in much of the United States. It is possible to accept that the current design
is just a stylized artistic embellishment of the original form. The current design
may have also been influenced by the design of the cross of Saint Florian.
Mass casualty incident (MCI): Any incident that produces a large number of
injured persons requiring emergency medical treatment and transportation to a
medical facility. The exact number of patients that makes an incident "mass
casualty" is defined by departmental procedures and may vary from area to area.
Master stream: A large nozzle, either portable or fixed to a pumper, capable of
throwing large amounts of water relatively long distances.
Means of egress: The way out of a building during an emergency; may be by
door, window, hallway, or exterior fire escape; local fire codes will often dictate
the size. location and type according to the number of occupants and the type of
occupancy.
Multiple alarms: A request by an incident commander for additional personnel
and apparatus. Each department will vary on the number of apparatus and
personnel on each additional alarm.
Mutual aid: An agreement between nearby fire companies to assist each other
during emergencies by responding with available manpower and apparatus.
MVA: Motor Vehicle Accident.

N
•

•
•

NFPA: The National Fire Protection Association, a research group which sets a
number of standards and best practices for *firefighting, equipment, and fire
protection in the United States, and also adopted in many other countries. Also,
slang for "No Free Publications Available"; used to reference any "must-have"
documents that are prohibitively expensive.
NIOSH: National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. A U.S. agency
responsible for investigation of workplace deaths, including firefighters.
NIMS: The National Incident Management System. A federally mandated
program for the standardizing of command terminology and procedures. This
standardizes communications between fire departments and other agencies. It is

based upon simple terms that will be used nationwide. Currently, U.S. federally
required training programs, from DHS and FEMA, are in the process of
standardizing many terms and procedures under NIMS.

O
•

Occupancy: Zoning and safety code term used to determine how a structure is
permitted to be used and occupied, which in turn dictates the necessary safety
structures and procedures.

•

Offensive attack: Method of firefighting in which water or other extinguisher is
taken directly to the seat of the fire, as opposed to being pumped in that general
direction from a safe distance.

•

OSHA: Occupational Safety and Health Administration, U.S. government
agency concerned with regulating employee safety, particularly in hazardous
occupations such as firefighting.

•

Overhauling: Late stage in fire-suppression process during which the burned area
is carefully examined for remaining sources of heat that may re-kindle the fire.
Often coincides with salvage operations to prevent further loss to structure or its
contents, as well as fire-cause determination and preservation of evidence.
Oxidizer: A hazardous material containing oxygen that can combine with
adjacent fuel to start or feed a fire.

•

P
•

•

Personnel Accountability Report ("PAR"): End-result of personnel
accountability system. Best report is all hands, AOK, worse is squad missing. You
will often hear command ask for a "PAR" when something has changed on the
fireground. Often the reply will be something like, "Engine 4, PAR." or "Engine 4
has PAR."
Personnel accountability system: Tag, 'passport', or other system for
identification and tracking of personnel at an incident, especially those entering
and leaving an IDLH area; intended to permit rapid determination of who may be
at risk or lost during sudden changes at the scene.

•

Plug: Slang term for a fire hydrant. This survives from the days when water
mains actually had holes in the tops that were plugged. Many firefighters would
like to keep this word while many others think it should be replaced with the
accurate term, "hydrant".

•

Pre-arrival instructions: Directions given by a dispatcher to a caller until
emergency units can arrive.

•

•

•
•

Pre-fire, pre-incident planning: Information collected by fire prevention
officers to assist in identifying hazards and the equipment, supplies, personnel,
skills, and procedures needed to deal with a potential incident.
Pre-planning: Fire protection strategy involving visits to potentially hazardous
occupancies for inspection, follow up analysis and recommendations for actions
to be taken in case of specific incidents. Not to be confused with post-planning.
"Probie:" (also rookie) new firefighter on employment probation (a period of
time during which his or her skills are improved, honed, tested, and evaluated).
"Professional Firefighter:" All firefighters are classified as "professionals" by
both the International Association of Fire Chiefs (IAFC) and the International
Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF trade union). All firefighters are required by
most state laws and general practice to meet the same training and equipment
standards, take the same examinations for promotion and perform the same work
under the same hazards. There are two accepted categories of Professional
Firefighters--Volunteer Firefighters who may or may not receive pay for services
and Career Firefighters whose primary employment and source of earned income
is in the fire service.

•

Pumper: A fire truck with a water tank.
Pump operator, technician: (also a chauffeur): person responsible for operating
the pumps on a pumper and typically for driving the pumper to an incident.

•

Rapid Intervention Crew/Group/Team (RIC, RIG, or RIT): This is a standby
crew whose purpose is to go in for the rescue of firefighters in trouble. While all
of these versions of the name for a firefighter rescue crew either have been used
or continue to be used in several areas, the National Incident Management System
(NIMS) has adopted the term Rapid Intervention Crew/Company, ("RIC") to be
the standard in the Incident Command System (ICS). Currently, U.S. federally
required training programs, from DHS and FEMA, are in the process of
standardizing many terms and procedures under NIMS.

•

Reflash, re-kindle: A situation in which a fire, thought to be extinguished,
resumes burning.

mask, keeps you from breathing in smoke or hazardous gases. Part of your
personal protective equipment (PPE).
Sides A, B, C, and D: Terms used by firefighters labeling the multiple sides of a
building starting with side A or Alpha being the front of the structure and working
its way around the outside of the structure in a clockwise direction. This labels the
front side A or Alpha, the left side B or Bravo, the rear side C or Charlie, and the
right side D or Delta.
Size-up: initial evaluation of an incident, in particular a determination of
immediate hazards to responders, other lives and property, and what additional
resources may be needed. Example: "Two-story brick taxpayer with heavy smoke
showing from rear wooden porches and children reported trapped."
Solid stream: fire stream from round orifice of nozzle. Compare straight stream.
Staging: sector of incident command where responding resources arrive for
assignment to another sector. Often an essential element in personnel
accountability program.

SERVICE AREA:

Animal Care & Control

Activities:

The Animal Care and Control Division enforces animal-related laws, investigates and provides control of stray and
aggressive animals, provides care for and seeks placement of animals received at the shelter, and promotes
responsible pet ownership.

Obective:

To work in partnership with the community to address problems associated with pet overpopulation, promote
responsible pet ownership, and enhance the health and safety of the community. The division encourages the adoption
of pets, enforces ordinances and laws regarding animal-related issues, and conducts inspections for the licensing of
facilities that sell, groom, and kennel animals. In 2003, the division implemented new kennel management software
that has enabled better tracking of animals and citizens’ requests for service.
In 2004, Animal Care and Control will find new adoptive homes for more than 2,000 animals—its highest total ever. In
addition, live releases from the shelter are up 15% over last year.

Unfortunately, ACC’s animal intake is also on the rise: up almost 18% over 2003. This is due to many factors—more
requests for service (as the division does a better job of communicating its mission, more requests are generated);
better software (enables more accurate accounting of the animals that come to be at our facility); and more officers on
the street.

INDIANAPOLIS POLICE DEPARTMENT PENSION OFFICE
Mission Statement
The Indianapolis Police Department Pension Fund is dedicated to serving retired officers, widows, and dependent children, and provides efficient
service through a commitment to the enforcement of laws that protect the proceeds of the Pension Fund. The main purpose of the Indianapolis
Police Department Pension Office is to keep records on pensioners’ taxes, insurance, and benefits status, and to ensure accurate, timely
disbursement of pension payments, as well as assist pensioners with their benefit questions and issues. The office also assists families of both
retired and active police officers in the event of death.
The division maintains two police pension plans, namely the 1953 Pension Act, funded by the City of Indianapolis, and the 1977 Plan, funded by
the State of Indiana with contributions by the City to the 1977 Police Pension Disability Fund.
In 2002, Senate Bill 60 enacted Indiana’s Deferred Retirement Option Plan (DROP) into law. This law provides that the plan will run from January
1, 2003 through December 31, 2007. All pension funds are included; the 1925, and1953 Police Pension Funds, as well as the 1937 Firefighters
Pension Fund, and the 1977 Police Officers’ and Firefighters’ Pension and Disability Fund. Generally a DROP is a form of retirement benefit that
allows an eligible employee to continue working while the employee is accumulating an amount equal to the benefits that could have been
received if the employee had retired. This amount is thus, set aside, and then paid as a lump sum to the employee that has elected into the
DROP program, upon their retirement. The Indianapolis Police Department is now required to appropriate funds for the DROP program, in order
to make projected payments to retirees in 2005.
Highlights of the Indianapolis Police Department Pension Office
Benefits paid by the Indianapolis Police Department Pension Fund will increase in 2005 due to the elevation in the pension base, anticipated
growth in plan membership, and a contract-mandated increase in the City’s contribution to the 1977 Pension Fund. Benefits are paid beginning at
50% of the pension base for a 20-year police officer increasing to 74% of the pension base for 32 years of service.

INDIANAPOLIS FIRE DEPARTMENT PENSION OFFICE
Mission Statement
The purpose of the Indianapolis Fire Department Pension Office is to keep records on pensioners’ taxes, insurance, and benefits status, and to
ensure accurate disbursement of pension payments. The Division maintains two firefighter pension plans, namely, the 1937 Pension Act, funded
by the City of Indianapolis, and the 1977 Plan funded by the State of Indiana with contributions by the City to the 1977 Firefighters Pension and
Disability Fund. The office also assists families of both retired and active firefighters at the time of death and is the official representative of the
Indianapolis Fire Department at the funeral. It is dedicated to serving retired firefighters and their dependents and educating active officers in
preparation for their retirement, and is committed to enforcing the laws protecting the Pension Fund.
In 2002, Senate Bill 60 enacted Indiana’s Deferred Retirement Option Plan (DROP) into law. This law provides that the plan will run from January
1, 2003 through December 31, 2007. All pension funds are included; the 1925, and1953 Police Pension Funds, as well as the 1937 Firefighters
Pension Fund, and the 1977 Police Officers’ and Firefighters’ Pension and Disability Fund. Generally a DROP is a form of retirement benefit that
allows an eligible employee to continue working while the employee is accumulating an amount equal to the benefits that could have been
received if the employee had retired. This amount is thus, set aside, and then paid as a lump sum to the employee that has elected into the
DROP program, upon their retirement. The Indianapolis Fire Department is now required to appropriate funds for the DROP program, in order to
make projected payments to retirees.
Highlights of the Indianapolis Fire Department Pension Office
Benefits paid by the Indianapolis Fire Department Pension Fund will increase in 2005 due to the elevation in the pension base, anticipated growth
in plan membership, and a contract-mandated increase in the City’s contribution to the 1977 Pension Fund. Benefits are paid beginning at 50% of
the pension base for a 20-year firefighter increasing to 74% of the pension base for 32 years of service.

EVANSVILLE FIRE DEPARTMENT
INTRODUCTION
On behalf of the men and women of the Evansville Fire Department, I am pleased to
submit the 2016 Executive Summary. We are an organization that is dedicated to our
community. Our Mission Statement includes the following, “Concerned professionals
protecting the community we serve”. We serve our citizens, neighbors, friends and
visitors with passion and professionalism. The Evansville Fire Department is making
great strides improving the resiliency of the firefighter to meet the ever increasing
demands from the community. The most important component of our emergency
response capability is a fit, trained and equipped response force.
The Evansville Fire Department now adheres to industry standard medical evaluations. National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 1582: Standard on Comprehensive Occupational Medical Program for Fire Departments includes cardiac and cancer
screening. Deaths due to heart attacks and cancer related illness are the top two killers
of firefighters nationwide. Compliance with this standard reduces that risk for our
own firefighters here in Evansville, Indiana.
FIRE CHIEF CONNELLY

Indiana Department of Homeland Security awarded the Evansville Fire Department
an Infrastructure Maintenance Grant for use at the EFD Training Facility. The grant
provides funding for ongoing maintenance and improvements to the facility that is also utilized by area departments
within Indiana Department of Homeland Security, District 10. This improves our ability to train not only our firefighters
but also firefighters around the region.
In April of 2016 EFD received delivery of a new Pierce Pumper that was put in service on the city’s east side at
Station #6. In October, 2016 the Evansville Fire Department submitted a purchase order for a new Pierce 75’ Quint
(combination Ladder truck and Pumper truck) to be placed in service at Station #5 in August of 2017. Those purchases
keep us on pace for replacement of one truck in our emergency response fleet every year. That replacement rate of firetrucks in the fleet continues to provide a stable platform for our firefighters to work from when called to the
emergency scene.
With a fit, trained and equipped response force we can achieve our mission’s three primary objectives:
Life Safety
Incident Stabilization
Property Conservation
The members of our fire department and support staff are at your service. We provide the basic components of
emergency response, but we also provide more. Within the pages of the 2016 Executive Summary, you will find
professionals that are eager to serve you.
You and your family’s safety is my goal. Please contact my office if you have ideas to share that will help the
Evansville Fire Department improve our community and its safety.
I am prepared to serve you.
Thank you.

EMS DIVISION
The Evansville Fire Department first responds to all Delta response calls with AMR, and when requested by the
Evansville Police Department and other agencies. The Evansville Fire Department responded to 9314 overall calls
in 2016, with the EMS Division responding to 5793 of those calls for assistance. That shows that EMS runs
accounted for 62% of the overall run volume of the Evansville Fire Department for the year 2016.
The Evansville Fire Department recertified 6 Paramedics, 72 EMTs, and 30 EMRs in 2016. The Evansville Fire
Department currently has 74% of its members certified as EMTs or Paramedics. Everyone is at least certified at the
Emergency Medical Responder level. The Evansville Fire Department tracks the following vital signs: Blood
Pressure, Heart Rate, and Respiratory Rate. We maintain a 99% compliance in obtaining at least partial vital signs
on runs where we arrive prior to AMR.
In 2016, The Deaconess Hospital Foundation, purchased 35 pulse-ox units that were placed on all Evansville Fire
Department apparatus. This is another essential tool for checking oxygenation of our patients, in the field.
In May, the Evansville Fire Department received word from The Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival
program, that they had a 39.8% return of pulse by EMS for their patients, which is 6.1 % higher than the national
average, and their survival to discharge from hospital to home, is 14.4% compared to the national average of 10.6%.
We will continue to keep our firefighters EMS compliant and provide further continuing education training so that
they are up to date on the latest innovations and methods. We have placed pulse-ox units on all apparatus and we
will be deploying our new rehab unit to assist at scenes to
assist with the health and safety of our firefighters.

Programs/Events
Worked with the Southern Indiana Technical
School in certifying 19 of their students as EMRs
Worked with Training Division and provided
crews for the first aid stations at the Fall Festival.
Worked with Administration with scheduling,
compliance, preparedness and supplies for the
WPE.
Worked on with Deaconess on training for the
new pulse-ox units placed on our apparatus.
Currently working with Deaconess on new EMS
protocols in order to stay current with the changes
in pre-hospital healthcare.

EVANSVILLE FIRE DEPARTMENT
Q UA RT E R M A S T E R D I V I S I O N
Since the implementation of the Evansville Fire Department Quartermaster Division in 2014, we have striven to
continue upgrading and replacing the gear on which our firefighter’s lives depend. The Quartermaster Division’s
function is to provide service to firefighters
through proper evaluation, maintenance,
and distribution of Personal Protective
Equipment (PPE). Firefighter safety is the
number one focus of the Quartermaster
Division.
The goal is to maintain two sets of gear for
each firefighter which will allow the
firefighters with a back-up set in the event
their primary set is dirty or needs repairs.
This has the added benefit of helping the
longevity of each set of gear.
Evaluation of firefighter gear will be an
ongoing process for the Quartermaster
Division. Along with the Fire Chief,
Assistant Chief, and the Safety Committee,
the Quartermaster Division will continue to
seek out PPE that best fit the Department’s
needs.
Maintenance of Evansville Firefighter gear
consists of cleaning, inspection and repair.
NFPA recommends that this is done at least
once per year. The Quartermaster Division
documents all of this through tracking
software, with all cleaning and repairs
entered in a PPE tracking software.
The Quartermaster Division does most of its repairs in-house, which includes patching, replacing Velcro, fixing
suspender and liner attachments, pocket replacements, pocket dividers, zipper repairs and helmet liner replacements
among others. It also performs occasional tests on the PPE including the water resistance ability of liners and
boots.
Firefighter turnout gear is recycled in different ways when it comes to the end of its useful life. The Quartermaster
strips the gear of all useful parts and uses those parts to repair other gear and the Training Division will utilize some
of the recycled gear for non-fire training scenarios.
Proper care and maintenance of firefighter PPE will not only help to keep firefighters safe on the job; it will help to
prevent future illness. Exposure to hazardous contamination left on the gear is one of the leading causes of death in
retired firefighters. Firefighters help to protect our city; the Quartermaster Division in turn helps to protect them.

EVANSVILLE FIRE DEPARTMENT
TRAINING DIVISION
The Evansville Fire Department (EFD)
Training Division oversees Fire and
Emergency Medical Services (EMS)

modestly and efficiently decontaminate patients involved in a chemical spill. Our hazardous materials team
represents Southwest Indiana as the IDHS District 10 Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) team, as WMDs are
a hazmat incident with “an attitude”. Should a hazardous materials incident occur in IDHS District 10 we would
be utilized as being the only Municipal “Technical” Hazmat Team.

Firefighters must undergo rigorous training to remain proficient and competent as Hazardous Materials Technicians,
thus training to identify unknown substances with a cadre of instruments on our hazmat trailer, or donning a “Level
A” suit to stop a Chlorine leak. Instructor Steve Jordan & District Zuber attended Hazmat IQ Chemical Assessment
& Pipeline Emergency classes to provide greater education of our EFD hazmat team members upon their return.
The objective of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act (EPCRA) is to: allow State and
Local planning for chemical emergencies, provide for notification of emergency releases of chemicals, and
address communities' right-to-know about toxic and hazardous chemicals. Therefore, as a representative of the
Vanderburgh County LEPC, EFD received and recorded 83 Tier II facility reports, thus reporting chemicals of
reportable quantities within those facilities. Instructor Steve Jordan is EFD’s LEPC representative and he assisted
in writing a tabletop scenario to challenge Evansville’s response plan while practicing unified Incident Command
with public safety partners during a chemical emergency.
In conjunction with the LEPC, a $6,500 Hazardous Materials & Emergency Planning (HMEP) Training Grant was
written to purchase four educational training series including DVDs, PowerPoints, and student manuals & three
reference books for ongoing/in-house hazmat training & reference material. In 2016, 47 Phase 1 Environmental
Site Assessment requests were researched according to EFD’s National Fire Incident Reporting (NFIR) system. In
the United States, an environmental site assessment is a report prepared for a real estate holding that identifies potential or existing environmental contamination liabilities. The analysis, often called an ESA, typically addresses
both the underlying land as well as physical improvements to the property.

DIVE TEAM
The team consists of 26 firefighters who are trained as Public Safety and Dive Rescue Specialist divers. The
divers respond from fire stations within Evansville, but the cadre of equipment is at Station #3, and thus all
firefighters from Station #3 support the team as dive tenders, boat operators, or equipment maintenance. The
dive team utilizes AGA full face dive mask with underwater communications, and Viking dry suits that enable
divers to enter contaminated or cold waters. DUI dry suits have been added to the PPE inventory to diversify
our dry suit capability, and the flexibility of their ZipSeal technology to better fit more divers around their
necks & wrists. Should water rescue operations require the need of a boat, EFD is fortunate to have two
capable boats. First, we have a 22’ Scorpion aluminum hull, jet-drive boat that is also capable of providing
2,500 gallons of water per minute for firefighting operations. Second, a 13’ rubber hull Zodiac boat allows the
capability to hand carry the craft to serve lakes or navigate Pigeon Creek. A Humminbird side scan sonar
allows us to scan the bottom of the Ohio River for submerged objects.

A DAY I N T H E L I F E
On the Evansville Fire Department firefighters are on duty 24-hours a
day, 7-days per week, 365-days per year. There are three different
duty platoons. As a firefighter you are assigned to one of the three
duty platoons. A day in the life of a firefighter on the Evansville Fire
Department starts early in the morning. The tour of duty starts at 7:00
am. But in order to be ready to respond to an emergency at 7:00 am
you must arrive a few minutes early. Usually around 6:45 am or
earlier. Each tour of duty is 24 hours. Each work period (work week)
is three non-consecutive workdays followed by 4 days off. That time
off allows you to recover from the demands of the world’s most
satisfying and trusted profession. At any time during the 24 hour tour
of duty (shift) you may me called to an emergency, so you must be
ready to drop everything at a moment’s notice and respond to an emergency call! There are 4 firefighters assigned
to each truck. You are a firefighter and report for duty to the Company Officer. He or she is in charge of the fire
apparatus that day.
6:45 am. Daily Checks. You start the day by readying your personal protective equipment, (turnout gear) to be
ready for a call that could occur at any moment. Next you will check the fire apparatus (truck) for all equipment in
place and ready for action. That includes fire suppression hose, nozzles, forcible entry tools, and medical response
equipment. Batteries need to be fully charged, tools must be clean and in good repair and Self Contained Breathing
Apparatus (air packs) must be fully pressurized and operate properly.
7:00 am. Administration. The Company Officer who is in charge of the fire apparatus will log the inventory and
note any special maintenance requests of equipment concerns.
7:30 am. Breakfast time. After breakfast it is time to clean up after yourself. Your Mom doesn’t work here! If you
want to eat you need to either bring food in or be ready to chip in on the cost of a meal as a group.
9:00 am - 11:00 am. Exercise/Training. Firefighting is one of the world’s most physically demanding professions.
In order to do the job well each firefighter must maintain a state of physical fitness. At some point throughout the
day time will be made to exercise both for strength and endurance. Updates on the latest medical treatment protocol,
testing out a new style of fire attack nozzle or learning how to use new technology may be the focus for this particular tour of duty. Learning street locations, operating fire apparatus, and studying building construction. There is no
limit to the number of subjects that we may study. Firefighting is more than just “putting the wet stuff on the red
stuff!”
12:00 pm. Lunch. Firefighters are known to have good meals and share them together. At some point during each
tour of duty there is time to take a break. Usually during afternoon hours it is a prime time to nap. Most fire calls
come during overnight hours. Sleep deprivation is a huge factor in quality of life for the firefighter (you). To be sure
you are able to think clearly and perform effectively you need to be sure and rest if you need it when you can.
5:00 pm. Supper. The firefighting family that eats together grows closer together. This bond is unlike any other
work environment with the exception of the military.
7:00 pm. Down Time. Typically this time of day is down time. Most firefighters spend time watching television,
playing cards, reading books, etc. Overnight you may be called to respond to emergency runs, but you are trained,
healthy and equipped to perform to your best ability!

Chief Administration Officer / Health & Safety Officer / PIO
The Chief Administrative Officer oversees the Administration Division. This position also acts as the Health &
Safety Officer and the Department Public Information Officer.
Civilians account for their work hours to the Chief Administration Officer. Calendar scheduling of events falls under
this job description due to the fact that it is an administrative position and is integrally involved in many aspects of
department operation.
The Health and Safety Officer has the responsibility of managing, on a short and long-term schedule, the Safety and
Medical needs of department members/employees on medical, illness, and injury leave.
In 2016, the department conducted health screenings on all
members of the Evansville Fire Department. Those screenings
were in compliance with National Fire Protection Association
(NFPA) 1582, Standard on Comprehensive Occupational
Medical Program for Fire Departments.
In accordance with the International Association of Firefighters (IAFF) and the International Association of Fire
Chiefs (IAFC) Wellness Fitness Initiative, the Evansville Fire
Department implemented a Work Performance Evaluation
program. The program is designed to help firefighters operate
safely on the fire-ground. The program is designed to help all
members reduce the risk of injury/illness and help them to
return to work more quickly after an injury/illness.
In accordance with the IAFF and the IAFC Wellness
Fitness Initiative, 22 EFD Personnel certified as Peer Fitness
Trainers began to make contact with each firefighter one hour
per month for coaching and counseling in the area of physical
fitness and increasing work capacity. The contact is designed
for firefighters to assist their “brothers and sisters” in long
term exercise program development, nutritional counseling,
injury prevention and rehabilitation.
Random members of the department were tested for the
influence of drug and alcohol under the Drug and Alcohol
Testing Policy. The Department sent nearly one hundred
members to the Deaconess Comp Center for random drug
and alcohol testing.
The PIO provides media updates at large fires or other incidents where EFD responds. Additional duties include
seasonal safety messages and reminders about fire safety during extreme weather conditions. Finally the most
enjoyable part of this assignment is showcasing the department and the asset it is to the community at events like
“National Night Out”.

EVANSVILLE FIRE DEPARTMENT
INSPECTION/INVESTIGATION
The Evansville Fire Department Fire Prevention/Investigation Division consists of eight Deputy Fire Marshals. The
Fire Investigation Division consists of one Unit Supervisor and three Investigators. Both of these divisions are under the leadership of the Chief Fire Marshal for the City of Evansville.
Serving others through Fire Prevention and Investigation is the mission of these Divisions. This is accomplished
through the Three E’s of Fire Prevention: Education, Enforcement, and Engineering.

The Fire Prevention Division has the privilege of conducting Fire Safety, Community Risk Reduction, and fire
extinguisher classes to the public. This is a great opportunity to spread the mission of the division by educating the
public on the proactive measures they can take to prevent the loss of life and property from the devastation of fire.
The professional development for the Fire Inspectors in the area of fire prevention and code review required over
1,745 man hours in 2016.
The Evansville Fire Department is responsible for protecting, and inspecting commercial properties with an
assessed value of over $ 2,109,202,300 . The Inspection Division conducted over 11,340 commercial inspections of
properties within the City of Evansville. This resulted in 30 inspections a day, and 218 inspections per week. These
inspections identified 5,167 fire code violations which required 755 fire inspection follow ups within the 2016 fiscal
year.

The Fire Prevention Division received a total of 46 citizen complaints in reference to fire hazards in places of
occupancies.
The 10 most common fire code violations found in commercial properties by the Fire Inspection Division are as
follows:
Obstructions in front of electrical panels.
Use by occupant of extension cords/multi-plug adaptors.
Exit signs /emergency exit Lighting.
Open electrical junction boxes.
Address premise information.
Combustibles in mechanical rooms.
Open knockouts found in electrical panel circuit breaker boxes.
Obstructions found in front of exits.
Obstructions in front of standpipe and sprinkler risers.
No supporting on site documentation of inspection records on site.
The engineering arena of fire prevention refers to the engineered solutions that can prevent incidents from occurring
or mitigating the damage once they do occur. Fire sprinklers, smoke alarms, fire alarm systems and technologies to
prevent the spread of fires are all examples of engineering solutions.
With this in context the Fire Prevention Division has two Fire Inspectors assigned as Plan Review Officers. A Plan
Review Officer is responsible for seeing construction plans submitted by the design professional meet the
requirements of the Fire Code for the type of occupancy that is being constructed.

IN SP ECT ION / IN VE S TI GATION
In 2016 the Division reviewed over 212 plans for new construction and structures undergoing renovation. Some of
the most notable projects are occurring in the downtown area with several new hotels and the new IU Medical
Center.
Investigation
The mission of the Fire Investigation Division is to find the cause and origin of fires so that it benefits all, with the
development of fire codes, educational programs and engineering solutions to prevent the future loss of life and
property from fires.
The Investigation Division conducted 298 fire investigations in 2016. Looking to causes of fire within the City
allows the department to conduct a risk assessment as to where fires are occurring and the leading causes of fire.
Some of the most common fire causes and the number of incidents in 2016 are as follows:
Candle Use fire- 5- resulting in 4 civilian injuries and 0 firefighter injury
Fireworks Use - 8- resulting in 0 civilian injuries and 0 firefighter injury
Cigarette/Smoking material Fires – 21 -resulting in 1 civilian injuries and 1 firefighter injury

FACI LITI E S M AINT ENANC E
The Facilities Management Division, with the assistance of City Maintenance, and local vendors work together to
maintain our 17 locations and the departmental training facility. Throughout the year, the department continued to
perform regularly scheduled maintenance on Station and Administration buildings and equipment. Station crewmembers clean daily and twice a year they thoroughly clean the stations during spring and fall house cleaning. They are
responsible for keeping the station property mowed, weeded and manicured. The landscaping is attended to throughout the year. The Facilities Management Division at the Administration Building makes sure that the property is landscaped, mowed and weeded to present a professional building facade.
Unexpected issues occurred which challenged the equipment’s performance and/or
created maintenance issues. The age of a piece of equipment is a determining factor
when a repair or replacement is warranted. In 2016 some of the repairs or replacements
were due to age or excessive use. Additional cost savings is the ongoing review of
upgrades to all fire stations. Tri-state Painting cleaned and painted outside Fuel Tanks
due to rusting at five locations consisting of nine tanks.

The Evansville Fire Department does not have its own maintenance personnel. Therefore, we rely on the City
Maintenance Department for monthly filter maintenance and repairs on the HVAC units, lights and fixtures, electrical
repairs, plumbing, welding and other general maintenance. In 2016, 475 maintenance requests were submitted for
repairs. Of those, 465 maintenance requests were completed, leaving only 10 maintenance requests outstanding or
ongoing. The department prides itself on taking care of maintenance issues quickly and efficiently.
Physical Fitness is a major issue for Firefighter health and safety. Our fitness area was increased from an area size of
16’ X 49’ to 26’ X 74’ enclosed with Heat and AC. The remodeling of Fitness area was completed. The Facilities
Management Division maintains all fitness equipment and the fitness area.
The Facilities Management Division maintains all fire extinguishers located at the stations and the Admin Bldg. This
is accomplished thru contracts with outside vendors. The suppliers are responsible for checking these pieces of
equipment and ensuring that they are in proper working condition.
The Evansville Fire Department relies on local vendors for maintenance repair service, parts, and supplies. The
Department remains committed to the use of local, WMBE, and other vendors. Some of
the vendors include Pro-Tex-All, KRS, EAB Associates, Altstadt Office City, Nichols
Electric, Kor-X-All, American Sanitary, Tri State Lighting, Graybar, Evansville Garage
Door, Tri State Fire Protection, Nunning Heating, Alpha, Shekell, E.L. Walters and

statement is, "To honor the original American Firefighter, those
who have gone before us and those who have paid the ultimate
price. We will also instill in our current ranks a new sense of
pride and tradition. We will do this by playing at events and
funerals of our fallen firefighters, police officers, veterans and
their families."
The original members are Greg Lehman and Jim Morrow. They
have teamed up with a local piper, Keith Jeffers, to learn the
in-and-outs of the music and setting up a pipe band. Adam Bigge,
Chad Buttry, and Joey Jones followed them a short time later.
These members are currently in the process of teaching the pipes
and drums to five potential new members.
The members work closely with the Evansville Fire Department
Honor Guard, and Evansville Police Department Honor Guard,
providing the sounds of the bagpipes at funerals of our retired and
active firefighters. They also play at funerals, weddings and
events for the public that may require the sounds of pipes and
drums.

The Evansville Firefighters Local 357 Honor Guard was formed in August of 1995 by members of the Local 357
Firefighters who saw the need of helping ease the pain of families after losing a brother, sister, spouse or parent in a
Line of Duty Death. Our profession consists of those who dedicate their lives in service to others. The Honor
Guard’s purpose is to show respect and honor to the family who paid the ultimate price through the years while their
family member was a part of this profession. The families of deceased brothers and sisters should take comfort in
knowing that the Honor Guard does their very best to take care of their own.

After visiting the Fallen Firefighter Memorial in Colorado Springs, Colorado, the Honor Guard researched the Evansville Fire
Department archives to ensure that all local fallen firefighters were honored on the department’s Fallen Firefighter Memorial
plaque. After countless hours of archival research, the names of 15 fallen firefighters were added to the plaque.
On November 5, 2016 a Fallen Firefighter Memorial Observance & Dedication was held at the Victory Theatre. The memorial
was held to add 15 names and show support to the families of our fallen brothers and Honor Guard. The total number of Line
of Duty Deaths is 34.

or save an older person from
the horror of that fate.

operations
The Operations Chief, a member of the general staff, assists the
Fire Chief in managing the daily operations of the department.
Additionally, he directs the Division Chiefs in developing
and managing the City’s fire suppression, training division,
emergency medical services, rescue operations, hazardous
materials operations, disaster preparedness and terrorism
response programs.
Robert P. Hensley
Operations Chief

Challenging Weather Conditions
In January of 2014, the Carmel Community experienced
a severe winter storm that included high winds, 13 inches of
snow, temperatures down to -20 degrees at times which closed
the city for three days. The conditions disrupted transportation
and public safety systems. Roads were closed or severely
compromised, creating a threat to the public health and safety.
As a result, CFD used additional manpower hours and
equipment. Through the FEMA Assistance Program, CFD
submitted eligible costs and was reimbursed $12,927.34.

Emergency Operations Center and Unified Command
The Emergency Operations Center (EOC) and local area command that was created
in 2013 was pressed into service and unified Command was established. During the
storm the EOC and unified Command managed a house-to-house surveillance of areas
that had no power and provided transportation to a designated shelter when needed.
Spring and summer thunderstorms rolled through the area, setting fire to residences
from lightning strikes and tasking the department’s ability to the limits to respond
and cover our area adequately.
Training Initiatives
•

Training standards for Fire and EMS were updated to ensure compliance with
ISO and NFPA standards.

•

During 2014, the Special Operations division continued to review and implement
improvements in each division with emphasis on training. The department’s
Haz-Mat, Water Rescue and Technical Rescue Teams continue to work as part of
a county team that responds to emergencies and trains together, reducing the
impact on all departments.

•

The department participated with Emergency Management Agency (EMA) and
county departments in the planning and staging of a one-day table-top exercise
on contaminated water throughout the county as a preparedness drill.

Planning
and Communications
safety
division
The Planning Section Chief - (PSC), a member of the General
Staff, is responsible for the collection, evaluation, dissemination
and use of information about the development of the incident
and the status of resources. Information is needed to understand the current situation, predict the probable course of
incident events, and prepare alternative strategies for the
incident.
Adam Harrington
Planning Section Chief

Event Action Plans
In addition to unplanned emergency incidents, the Planning
Section also is responsible for coordinating event action plans
for special events within the City of Carmel. There were nearly
100 special events in 2013/2014. Approximately 20 required
oversight by an incident management team. The Incident
Management Team (IMT) is comprised of members from both
the Carmel Police & Fire Departments, and in some cases,
representatives from other City Departments. IMT members
may also be from other cooperating agencies.
Coordinating Weather Related Events
The Planning Section coordinates with Hamilton County Emergency Management and the Hamilton County Public Safety Communications Center to plan
and respond to incidents in and around the City of Carmel. Several weatherrelated events prompted both the Hamilton County Emergency Operations
and the Carmel Local Emergency Operations Center to open and coordinate
emergency services. In response to the January 2014 snowstorm, the Carmel
Emergency Center was opened to oversee and coordinate the emergency
response to widespread power outages during frigid blizzard-like conditions.
This activation lasted several operational periods and entailed door-to-door
searches by Carmel Police and Fire Departments to check on the welfare of
residents and move them to temporary shelter if needed.

5

Communications
Public Safety agencies are working with the Hamilton County Public Safety
Communications Center and InterAct® to design, setup, and implement a
new CAD (Computer Aided Dispatch) and Public Safety software system
that will bring all Hamilton County agencies together on the same CAD and
records system. This software is also in use by adjoining Boone and Marion
Counties as well as the State Police which will allow for better interoperability
among agencies. Project completion is anticipated to be late 2015.
Hamilton County transitioned to a new state-of-the-art radio system
developed by Motorola™. Research on the project began in spring 2013
after approval by the Hamilton County Commissioners. Throughout the
remainder of 2013 and 2014, many hours went into the development and
setup of the system by members of multiple public safety agencies,
including The City of Carmel. The new radio system is an extension of the
Marion County Public Safety Communications system and consists
of eight tower sides dedicated to Hamilton County.
The previous radio system was over twenty years old and had only four
towers. There were many areas that had poor radio communications. Police
officers and firefighters had to rely on carrying more than one type of radio
when needing to communicate with some surrounding agencies that were
on different radio networks.
The new Motorola™ radio system consists of state-of-the-art technology
and end user equipment which allows users to communicate directly with
surrounding agencies. The audio transmissions are now digital which
create a crisp clear sound versus the static that is often heard on older
analog systems.

Carmel Fire Department went live on
the new radio system January 29, 2015.

Safety
2014 was the first full year of new leadership in the Safety
Division. Throughout 2014, the division became more compliant
with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)
and National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and more
importantly, made it safer for Carmel Fire Department (CFD)
firefighters to do their jobs.
Mark Cromlich
Health & Safety Chief

Proper safety techniques allow firefighters to perform their
jobs with the highest degree of skill and efficiency and return
home to their families for their most important jobs as fathers,
mothers, brothers, and sisters.
2014 Safety Training and Compliance Initiatives
The Safety Division held a state-certified Safety Officer Class.
All of our Battalion Chiefs, fill-in Battalion Chiefs, Executive Fire
Officers, Administration Chiefs, Safety Chief, and the Fire Chief
attended the class and now hold the certification. Some CFD
members even attended on their own! The training was opened
to the surrounding fire departments, and two classes were
filled. This benefits our firefighters when they respond to
incidents with surrounding departments. And, through the
Safety Division’s lobbying efforts, the class was paid for by
the state.
The Safety Division compiled a comprehensive Risk Management Plan that complies with the NFPA 1500 standard, going
through line-by-line, and referencing the department’s current
rules, regulations, and guidelines. This document will help
improve current policies and guide future policy making for
all Carmel Fire Department divisions.

Safety is the number one goal
of many organizations, and the
Carmel Fire Department is no exception.
Our firefighters’ lives depend on it!

9

Working with CFD firefighters, the department’s medical director, and
adhering to the NFPA standard, the Safety Division completed a new
rehabilitation policy in 2014. It will be implemented in 2015. This will help
keep CFD firefighters safe while fighting fires or training by following the
proper work/rest cycles, seeking medical evaluation, and taking into account the weather conditions.

Safety Chief’s 2014 Training and Certifications
In an effort to become an expert in safety, the Safety Chief attended numerous training
opportunities in 2014, including becoming a certified OSHA trainer. OSHA training for
the Carmel Fire Department will begin in 2015. This will ensure compliance with all
OSHA standards and provide a safer work environment for all CFD employees.
The Safety Chief became a National Incident Management System (NIMS) all-hazards
Safety Officer, too. In the event the City of Carmel experiences a major incident (natural
disasters, weapons of mass destruction, mechanical failure) that requires state,
regional, or federal resources, the Safety Chief could be a part of the management
team for that event. A recent event that might have required such a response was
the tornado that hit Henryville, Indiana, in March 2012!
The Safety Chief became a nationally recognized Health and Safety Officer, completing
the Fire Department Safety Officers Association (FDSOA) certification. In addition, he
completed the Incident Safety Officer course.
The Safety Chief is the newly appointed Indiana Advocate for the “Everyone Goes
Home Program,” though the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation. This program is
focused on firefighter safety and education based on lessons learned in the fire
service. Daily emails are sent containing newsworthy events about firefighers who
were injured or killed in the line of duty. In 2015, the life safety initiative will be taught
to all officers of the Carmel Fire Department!

Line-of-Duty Injuries
Properly managing and recording injuries helps the Safety Division to better assess
where trends and issues exist. The online reporting system allows firefighters to
officially report an injury without having to seek medical attention. This is a
tremendous cost savings for minor injuries and a convenience for the firefighters.
“It’s not a question of if you’ll get hurt, it’s a question of when.”
It is the Safety Division’s goal to reduce the frequency and severity of line-of-duty
injuries and improve systems that manage the safety of our personnel.
Several line-of-duty injuries in 2014 were related to weather conditions. We have
instituted work practice controls to effectively reduce this hazard. We are looking
forward to a safe 2015!

Training is the most critical element of an effective Safety Division.
The Safety division worked on a new rehabilitation policy in 2014. Working with
firefighters on shift, our medical director, and referencing an NFPA standard, it was
completed. It will be implemented in 2015. This will help keep our firefighters safe
while fighting fires or training. Having proper work/rest cycles, medical evaluation,
and taking the weather into account.

Fire Training

Training Division
The Training Division had some changes and challenges in
2014. Chief Frye stepped down from his position as Training
Chief and into his newly promoted position as the Captain on
Engine 45. Training Captain Buttler stepped into the role as
the new Training Chief.
Jim Buttler
Chief of Fire Training

Captain Al Peterson
Fire Training Captain

Captain Frye gave many years of service to the department’s
Training Division, and he was instrumental in making it what
it is today. His hard work and dedication brought many
improvements to the department and left an indelible mark.
The Training Division wishes him the best of luck in his new
position.
In addition to a new Training Chief, the department held
interviews for the new Training Captains. Firefighter
Al Peterson and Firefighter Kevin Stindle were announced
as the new Training Captains. Al and Kevin bring great
attitudes and work ethics as well as more than 20 years
of firefighting and EMS experience to the division and have
been a great addition to the team.
Training New Recruits

Captain Kevin Stindle
Fire Training Captain

January was challenging with personnel getting acclimated
to their new positions and the hiring of six (6) new recruits.
A joint recruit academy between the Carmel Fire Department
and the Fishers Fire Department was held with a combined
total of 20 new recruits. The Academy started in late January
and ran through the first week of July. It included three days
of administrative training and orientation, five weeks of
EMT-B training, one week at FDIC, 18 weeks of fire school
and two weeks of special operations training. All six Carmel
Fire Department recruits successfully completed all of their
training and were promoted to Probationary Firefighters.
The “Probationary Firefighter Task Book” was introduced to
the department in 2014. The Task Book was assigned to the
six new members on July 6, and they have one year to complete the exercises in the book. The Task Book includes skills
to be performed and evaluated, daily evaluations and training
on administrative policies and procedures. In order for new

11

recruits to be promoted to rank of Firefighter, they must complete the tasks and skills
outlined in the Task Book within one year. To date, all probationary firefighters are
doing well and on-track to complete their Task Books.
New Credentialing Program
2014 was also the first year for the new “Credentialing Program” on Target Solutions.
On January 1, each member of the department was assigned a credential on Target
Solutions that was specific to their respective rank and EMS certification. There were
five (5) total credentials assigned: Firefighter, Engineer, Officer, EMT-B and Paramedic.
Each credential lists topics, skills and training hours that are to be completed and
include a reporting system to track each individual’s progress throughout the year.
The credentials are based on NFPA, ISO and OSHA standards as well as training
parameters set by the department. Fire-related credentials are set to an annual
calendar that begins January 1 and ends December 31. EMS credentials are based on
the 2-year recertification cycle that coincides with the IDHS recertification program.
Through the course of the year, department members logged a total of 50,632 hours
of training. The department also approved 173 education requests to attend outside
courses and conferences at an approximate cost of $74,000.
2015 will again see the Training
Division teaching a Recruit Academy
for another group of new Carmel
Fire Department Recruits. We also
hope to see the start of our new
joint Training/Maintenance facility
located at 106th and Gray Road
by summer 2015.

Chief Tom Small
EMS Division Chief

Captain Jon Alverson
EMS Training Captain

Emergency Medical Services

Because of the great people of the Carmel Fire Department,
the EMS Division had very successful year in several ways.
Chief Hoffman and Assistant Chief Hensley’s leadership,
dedication, and commitment to EMS is the reason for its
success. These men have confidence in the ideas, vision,
and goals that EMS Chief Tom Small has set forth, making
it possible to accomplish his leadership tasks. Some others
that also need to be mentioned are Capt. Jon Alverson,
FFP Gary Fisher, FFP J.C. Mitchell, FFP Tom Payne, FFP Scott
Stroup and FFP Chris Walker. Each played a role this year in
making Carmel Fire Department’s EMS Division the BEST in
the State of Indiana.
Tom Small was appointed EMS Chief in late January 2014
and began interviewing for an EMS Captain in February. He
appointed Jon Alverson to the EMS Captain position in late
February. Together they’ve accomplished several important
goals and continue to work on accomplishing others. Below
are some of the goals accomplished in 2014.
Education/Training
The EMS Division provided five hours of continuing
education every month in 2014 for the EMTs and
Paramedics. All paramedics were re-certified in ACLS and
PALS and all firefighters in CPR Healthcare Provider.
2014 Recruit Class
The EMS Division assisted Fishers Fire Department EMS in
teaching the Emergency Medical Technician Class for the
Training Division. The new recruits did very well. The EMT
class lasted for 4.5 weeks. This class tests their critical
thinking skills along with their practical skills. All recruits
passed the State of Indiana written and practical exam
on their first attempt. EMS Chief Tom Small always enjoys
teaching the new recruits and this division also had several
volunteers who taught the class, too. Thanks to all who
participated.

13

EMS Supplies and Equipment
Carmel EMS has streamlined its supply chain through Carmel St. Vincent. In doing
so it saved the EMS budget approximately $10,000 in 2014. In addition, the division
improved the medication delivery model by keeping trucks in their district and
ensuring medications are to date. Carmel EMS also purchased two ultrasound
devices and awarded a bid for a new ambulance to Braun for 2015 implementation.
Health Issues
The division fit tested all CFD personnel with TB masks using the Porta Count and
N-95 Companion with the assistance of Carmel St. Vincent ER. This measure was
completed to coincide with the development of a CFD Ebola Response Plan. All
recruits were given the hepatitis vaccine.
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) /EMS Division
Carmel EMS Chief Tom Small attended several DHS EMS Commission monthly
meetings throughout the year. Carmel Fire Department continued good communications with DHS. It submitted CFD Provider Certification and passed with no issues.
All EMTs and Paramedics were re-certified or renewed their license through DHS.
CFD holds a seat on the committee set forth by DHS on Community Paramedicine.

CARMEL FIRE
DEPARTMENT

The Carmel Fire Department expanded services in the year
of 2014. It began a Mobile Integrated Healthcare Program
(MIHP) on July 1st. The goal of this program is to meet the
Triple Aim Initiative set forth by the Center for Medicare
Medicaid Services (CMS) through the National Institute of
Health. We hope to continue to improve health, healthcare
and reduce healthcare costs. The MIHP followed up on 85
patients who the EMS Division provided emergency care
for in the last six months of the year. The division assisted
these patients by doing wellness checks and home safety
inspections. One particular customer called Carmel EMS
25 times from January to July, costing $475 each time for
a total of $11,875 in ambulance transporting fees. Once
the program was implemented, with the assistance of the
department’s MIHPs, Carmel EMS was not called again
to assist this customer. This potentially saved $11,875
in ambulance fees, assuming the calls for 911 from this
customer would have continued. Carmel EMS has had an
overwhelming response from the community and local
hospitals concerning this program.
The EMS Division also assisted in developing Incident
Action Plans (IAP's) for the Carmel Marathon, CarmelFest,
and Carmel High School football games.

Technical Rescue Program

Technical Rescue Program

Scott Tierney
Technical Rescue
Coordinator/Captain

The Technical Rescue Program for Carmel Fire Department
(CFD) is still in its infancy. The program was able to expose
new personnel to some of the disciplines of technical rescue,
however, it was not able to complete certifications. Carmel Fire
Department participates with the County as much as possible,
primarily the Fishers Fire Department, during monthly trainings.
Currently the county team is going through changes and
consequently the Carmel Fire Department is attempting to
find direction and redefine the level of participation with
Hamilton County.

Technical Rescue Training with Hamilton County Fire Departments
The monthly trainings have been sporadic with the Fishers Fire Department due to
scheduling conflicts. CFD attended several trainings in 2014 covering ropes, trench,
confined space, breaching and breaking. Station 45 had approximately 168 hours of
training with these monthly exercises. These classes were held in several locations
throughout Fishers and Hamilton County. CFD’s team also received vehicle extrication
training from the Carmel Fire Department training staff.
Carmel Fire Department attended a rope class with Westfield Fire Department in
early March through early May. Again, this class was scheduled for the 24-48 work
schedule, so CFD did the best it could with off-duty attendance. This class was
hampered by many issues from weather to shift schedules; however, the CFD team
spent approximately 600 man-hours and came away with a simple understanding of
ropes and systems.

15

Technical Rescue Certification a Priority
In 2014, the Carmel Fire Department did respond to several vehicles hitting buildings.
Most did not require a Technical Rescue response, but one resulted in a fatality with
substantial damage to a building.
The goal is to get everyone in the fire department in a position to move forward with
a proper level of state certification and continue our training relationships with the
County fire departments.

operations Water Rescue
Water Rescue Division
The entire Operational Division supports and performs
duties in the Water Rescue Division.
In 2014 the Carmel Fire Department (CFD) responded to
12 accidental and intentional ice and water rescues.

Gary Brandt
Water Rescue Coordinator/
Executive Officer

To improve accuracy, the reporting policy for water rescues
was changed to specifically identify each water rescue
incident in a query-able manner to assist the department
with correctly determining the exact number of water
rescue incidents at any given time. The new reporting
guidelines for water rescue incidents were implemented
in 2015.

Water Rescue Training and Equipment
In 2014, firefighters spent 310 hours training for all types of water rescue incidents.
The firefighters are trained in ice rescue, flatwater and swiftwater procedures.
Each of Carmel Fire Department’s six (6) districts have at least two (2) cold weather
rescue suits, personal flotation devices (PFD), throw bags and discs to assist in the
rescues.
Carmel Fire Station 45 responds with a flat bottom Jon boat and inflatable rescue
boat. Both of these boats can be either rowed or paddled and have a 30hp motor if
needed. This station also responds with extra gear (extra cold weather and dry suits),
and the appropriate ropes and hardware to perform swiftwater rescues.

Water Rescue Challenges
Each body of water—retention ponds, lakes, creeks, and the White River—located in
the City of Carmel creates a different challenge. When an incident occurs, the greatest challenge facing all firefighters regarding water rescue is determining the precise
location of the rescue and gaining access to the body of water.
Swift water is the most challenging and dangerous because of strong currents and
unpredictable obstacles that are difficult to see. Flooding can create these conditions
quickly in areas that are normally residential backyards or streets not thought to be
dangerous.
Ice Rescue is the most frequent type of water rescue in Carmel because citizens and
pets fall through thin ice on frozen neighborhood retention ponds. Rescuing animals
is considered an emergency in Carmel to ensure citizens are not endangered
attempting to rescue animals without the proper gear and training.
The Water Rescue Division strives to keep CFD firefighters safe and trained in the
most up-to-date water and ice rescue techniques.

Hazardous Materials

Response Division

Charles Plumer
Hazardous Materials
Coordinator/Engineer

During the calendar year 2014, emphasis was placed on
completing the goals set in 2013. The first goal was to
establish a training system that incorporates the requirements
of NFPA 472, Standard for Competence of Responders to
Hazardous Materials/WMD Incidents. This system was in part,
a requirement to participate in the IDHS Hazardous Materials
Team Qualification Program. The training system was initiated
for Hazardous Material Technicians, and in 2015, the system
will been expanded to include Awareness and Operation level
personnel. Although the Qualification Program has been
terminated by IDHS, we still use the program as a model
to build our Response Team.
The second important goal set in 2013 was the “Threat
Assessment” for the City of Carmel. With the goal complete, in
2014 the team started doing site visitations to TIER II facilities.

The following information is a summary of the Hazardous Materials

The Carmel Fire Department (CFD) Honor Guard was
formed in 2002 by the membership with the vision
to honor our fallen brethren. Since its inception, the
membership has worked tirelessly to create an Honor
Guard that sets high standards for others to follow. In
2012, the Carmel Fire Department expanded the Honor
Guard with the creation of a Pipe and Drum Division.

Dedication to Personal Improvement
Currently the Honor Guard has approximately 18 parade and ceremony personnel
and 11 pipe and drum members. The pipe and drum members include: three (3)
bagpipers, three (3) snare drummers, three (3) tenor drummers, and two (2) bass
drummers. At the beginning of each year, the parade and ceremony division sets
a training schedule, which includes five (5) training dates with each training date
dedicated to a specific skill. The Pipe and Drum Division practices once a week and
many members go to combined practices with Indianapolis Fire Department (IFD)
pipe and drum corps. Currently, the CFD Honor Guard is working together with
all Hamilton County police and fire departments to establish a combined training
effort to standardize all Hamilton County department’s Honor Guard policies and
practices and establish a network of resources.

2014 Ambulance Fund

CFD is currently completing its second joint hiring process
with four other Hamilton County fire departments. The
objective is to reduce the costs of interviewing and testing
candidates, creating a master list all four fire departments
work from to select applicants to hire. The joint hiring
process has reduced the cost of hiring new recruits by
30 percent.

2014 Personal Services and Operations Budget

Throughout 2014, several projects have been completed or are in progress
and working towards finalizing.
• With vacancies to fill due to retirements, six new firefighters were hired in
January of 2014 and participated in a joint recruit class with the Fishers Fire
Department that ended in June.
• Plans were completed for three (3) new building projects. A maintenance and
training facility, replacing Station #44 with a total rebuild and the last being
a renovation of Station #43. These projects are funded in conjunction with
Clay Township and the City of Carmel.
• The upgraded generator project to operate electrical power to Station #41
Headquarters was underway in 2014 and continues towards completion.
The current generator was outdated and insufficient for the needs of the station.
The approved CFD General Fund budget for 2014 was $21,442,310.00, which was an
overall increase of 1.37% from the 2013 budget. The Personal Services portion of this
amount relates to salaries and benefits were $19,741,353.00. The Operational portion,
which relates to supplies, professional services, repairs and maintenance and other
service charges, is $1,700,957.00.
The approved Ambulance Fund for 2014 was $1,521,718.00. The budgeted items
purchased from this fund are supplies and equipment. This fund is non-reverting
where the unspent monies at the end of the year remain in the fund for future use
with the proper approval process.

fire Investigation & prevention
Fire Investigations Origin and Cause
In 2014, the Carmel Fire Department received 276 calls related
to fires, from simple brush fires to residence fires that can
injure and devastate a family.

Bruce Knott
Fire Marshal

The Carmel Fire Department has a team of 14 fire investigators,
in addition to front-line officers who are also trained in
investigating fires. All firefighters are required to have a
working knowledge of fire investigation procedures and skills.
The state of Indiana also requires all reported fires to be
investigated.
When investigations are complicated or lengthy, the fire
investigation team may be called to use its advanced training
and resources to determine the cause of the fire.

Chris Ellison
Deputy Fire Marshal

Information gathered from fire investigations about their origin
and cause is used globally to advance fire safety in products
and everyday living environments to make our communities
safer places to live.

Prevention
Providing an avenue for our front line firefighters to become familiar with all the
buildings in their district, is complimented with a hands-on inspection of each
building and individual business annually.
The need for firefighters to understand the complex commercial structures that
they respond to every day is a vital key to providing the services expected of a
career fire department, as well as maintaining our of goal of “everyone
goes home.”
During the year our members inspected almost every building which encompasses
more than 3,000 businesses. Many business associates are unfamiliar with the
responsibilities that come with maintaining the designed safety features in their
respective commercial structures.

Lucas Ray
Deputy Fire Marshal

Our goal in prevention is to ensure safety is maintained by pointing out potential
dangers and to educate the business associates and to allow for them to become
advocates for their personal safety as well as their customers patronizing their
Carmel-based locations.
Almost 500 buildings had some level of safety concerns that were discovered
during these routine inspections.

21

plan review
Providing the Quality Expected
In a growing community like Carmel, it is imperative that city government stay
abreast of what is going on during fast paced expansion. Carmel has a hands-on
approach to maintain control of quality during construction with several city
departments taking part in the Technical Advisory Committee. (TAC) While no single
department or person can be expected to maintain such control themselves, a team
of city employees and utility representatives meet together to ensure all projects are
providing the quality expected by the customer and the citizens.
Thorough and Complete Plan Reviews
In 2014, the Carmel Fire Department conducted 343 submitted plan reviews—
a 26 percent increase over 2013 and a 51 percent increase over 2012. It is important
to conduct thorough and complete plan reviews for all building projects, beginning
with TAC through the completion of the project to insure the building complies with
the fire and life safety codes adopted by the State of Indiana. Proper code compliance
protects the lives of citizens and firefighters and reduces property losses.

Public Education
Community Activities

Keith Freer
Public Education Officer

In support of the Carmel Fire Department’s Mission, Public
Education provides children and adults of Carmel and
surrounding areas quality educational programming and
information designed to reduce and prevent the loss of life,
injury, and property damage resulting from fires, accidents,
and natural disasters. Fire and Life Safety Education continues to be a very active part of the department’s annual
activities and is increasing each year. CFD’s Public Education conducted over 338 appearances (school presentations, community demonstrations, fire extinguisher training,
fire drills, home safety surveys, smoke detector installation,
special events, etc) which impacted tens of thousands of
people. In short, CFD’s community outreach programs have
reached more than 51,145 people in 2014.
Public Education also schedules and organizes the department’s station tours that are conducted annually at each of
our six fire stations. Carmel Public Safety Day in September
and the Firefighter-For-A Day Camp held in July. Each event
is held on an alternating every-other-year format and both
are a great success.

Budget and Accreditation
Manager

Commission on Fire Accreditation International
The Carmel Fire Department achieved a significant
milestone in August of 2013; we became the third
department in the State of Indiana to become
Internationally Accredited. There are 196 departments worldwide who are
Internationally Accredited by the Commission on Fire Accreditation International
(CFAI). The Center for Public Safety Excellence (CPSE) in conjunction with
CFAI guided the Carmel Fire Department through a complete comprehensive
self-assessment and evaluation of fire and emergency service as compared to
past, current, and future performance standards of the organization.
The Accreditation process led to improved service delivery by helping the
Department:
• Determine community risk and safety needs
• Evaluate the performance of the department
• Provide a detailed evaluation of the services we provide to the community
• Identify areas of strength and weakness within the Department
• Encourage professional growth for both the Department and its personnel
• Create a mechanism for developing strategic and program action plans for
supporting community growth and expansion
The Carmel Fire Department is also maintaining an innovative, progressive fire
department by completing the required Annual Compliance Reports (ACR). This
report contains the twelve (12) strategic and specific recommendations that were
identified when the Department was accredited. As 2014 was the first year for
the ACR, the department completed six (6) strategic and specific recommendations

Attendees (from left to right) Chief Randy R. Bruegman, President, CPSE Board
of Directors, Operations Section Chief Robert Hensley, Finance – Administration
Chief David Haboush, Accreditation Manager Denise Snyder, CFD Fire Chief Matthew
Hoffman, Chief R. Allan Cain, Chairman, CFAI

and the remaining six (6) are in various stages of completion. On October 27, 2014,
the department received notification that the ACR was reviewed and approved for
maintaining the accredited status with the Commission.
In May of 2014, the department purchased and implemented SharePoint to act as
the depository where all accreditation documents reside and trained all divisions
how to use the program. SharePoint has been a tremendous asset to this division as
everything is in one place assessable to all divisions. Each division is responsible for
maintaining, updating and creating all documents needed for accreditation.
The Strategic Plan has been updated and the Standard of Cover is also being updated.
In 2014, the accreditation division had a combined total of 20 hours of continuing
education and attended the annual Excellence Conference.

Department of Public Safety
Mission Statement:

The Mission of the Department of Public Safety is to provide professional, efficient, courteous, and quality service to all citizens, businesses, organizations, and visitors
within the City of Indianapolis. Our commitment to protect the lives, rights, and property of our diverse citizenry is the primary focus of this department. The Department
of Public Safety pledges to work cooperatively with all Federal, State, County, and Municipal Law Enforcement, Public Safety, and Community Organizations for the
benefit of our citizenry, communities, and the maintenance of public order.

Significant Events:
The department’s five operating divisions, Animal Care and Control, Emergency Management Planning, Weights and Measures, Fire, and Police, emphasize the safety of
the citizenry. During the past year, the emphasis has been on improving technology while continuing with business as usual. This includes shaping all areas of the
department to be responsive and proactive to needs of the community. The following are some highlights of the past year and some expectations for the coming year:
•

The City of Indianapolis was awarded a $10.65 million COPS Grant from the U.S. Department of Justice to add 142 new community police officers over the next three
years. This grant along with full funding for 58 new officers already in the 2000 budget will eventually result in a total of 200 officers being added to the
Indianapolis Police Department. As each of the new officers dedicated to community policing are added during recruit classes, the COPS Grant will cover a total of
$75,000 toward the salary of each officer over three years. Federal Funding will cover approximately 44 percent of the total cost for 142 new officers.

•

The Indianapolis Police Department has reorganized the Narcotics Branch to better respond to the threat presented by dangerous illegal drugs.

•

The Animal Care and Control Division added 8 Council approved positions mid-year 2000 (3 Animal Control Officers and 5 Positions to care for animals in the
Kennel). The Animal Care and Control Division has also contracted with the Humane Society to manage the Kennel operations in a continued effort to improve the
service level at the Kennel Facility.

•

An IndyGov Public Safety Website is available within the Indygov Home Page at http://www.indygov.org/pubsafety.html.

•

The Indianapolis Fire Department has introduced a comprehensive five-year strategic plan titled Project 2005. This document was developed by over 120 firefighters to
prepare IFD for the future. The plan provides a path and course of action for the department. The plan has 10 sections and addresses future issues from resource
location and equipment status to community relations and public partnerships. It is a systematic approach to fire protection for the next decade and provides a focus for
the department as a community leader and neighborhood partner.

New Initiatives:

Professional Capabilities: The following will help the Department strengthen the professional capabilities and perhaps better utilize the resources that are available for
public use:
•

Investment in people, equipment, technology, and physical resources.

•

Administrative integration and coordination with County and Township public safety organizations to increase regional efficiencies.

•

Continued commitment to community policing and fire safety education.

Countywide Warning System: Emergency Management Planning Division will add six new sirens to the countywide tornado warning system moving towards a goal of
100% coverage throughout Marion County. Continued support of leadership in Anti-terrorist Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical (NBC) training and readiness.
Animal Care and Control: Improve Animal Care and Control effectiveness and update equipment. An Internet webpage is planned as a public access site to encourage
adoptions and inform the public about Animal Control Law.
New Fire Station: IFD will build a new Fire Station 14 at 30th and Kenwood Avenue, which includes adjacent property. The project is the result of a strong coalition
between government and the corporate community, and includes neighborhood partners. Special funding has been established for the $1.8 million dollar project, and
environmental studies are in progress to determine land cleanup issues. The new facility will consist of 10,000 square feet, 4 apparatus bays and quarter 4 fire apparatus and
10 firefighters per shift.
Education/Fire Safety: The Indianapolis Fire Department has continued its systematic approach to increase public education regarding fire safety issues.
Community Involvement: There are new initiatives to reduce crime and an emphasis is placed on community involvement in solutions. We understand the importance of
having the citizens of Marion County work with us as a part of the solution.

Staffing (All staffing levels in the budget book are expressed as Full Time Equivalents, or F.T.E. One F.T.E. is based on a full time employee’s work year of 2,080
hours. To calculate F.T.E.’s for part time or seasonal employees, the total of the hours budgeted is divided by 2,080.
Indianapolis Police Department The authorized strength of Uniformed Officers in the 2001 Indianapolis Police Department Budget has been increased to
1,188. This new strength represents an increase of 98 Authorized Positions over the level of 1,090 planned in the 2000 Budget. The Indianapolis Police Department is
planning to conduct Recruit Classes in the Fall of 2000, Spring of 2001, and again during the Fall of 2001, in order to add enough new Uniformed Officers to meet a Budget
Year 2001 target of 1,132 positions filled by the start of the Fall 2001 class. The capacity of the Training Academy, coupled with projected retirements and attrition, will be
limiting factors in adding and netting enough new positions to meet the full authorized strength of 1,188. It is anticipated that IPD may be able to reach the full authorized
strength in 2002 when additional classes are started. The 1,107 Uniform Officer FTE’s shown below for the 2001 Budget represents the monthly projected average FTE’s
for the entire year. The average FTE’s are calculated to provide a more accurate estimate of Salary Dollar Requirements in the Budget.

Organizational Policy:
Emergency Management is responsible for planning for all hazards that threaten the community, whether natural or man-made. The division must comply with mandates
from both the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA). The division analyzes major incidents so those
lessons from actual events may be incorporated into emergency plans.

New Initiatives:
Mitigation Efforts: Emergency Management participates in mitigation efforts -- operating a public warning siren system, making information on potential hazards
available, and working with other units of government to reduce those hazards.
Planning: The division is responsible for maintaining the County Emergency Operations Plan, the County Hazardous Materials Plan required by Environmental
Protection Agency, and the Indianapolis portion of the National Disaster Medical System.
Training/Education: Emergency Management also delivers a wide array of training and education to both public safety personnel and the public.
Response/Coordination: In addition, the division responds to major emergencies; coordinates resources between public safety agencies, public works, utilities and
many private disaster response organizations; and maintains and operates the Emergency Operations Center.
Metro Medical Strike Team: Emergency Management also serves as the sponsoring/coordinating agency for the Metropolitan Medical Strike Team, one of 27 in the
United States, which responds to chemical, biological, and nuclear terrorist incidents.
Urban Search & Rescue Task Force: Emergency Management Planning Divison continues in a coordinating role with the Urban Search and Rescue Task Force
(US&R) . Administration duties for the Task Force have been assumed by the Indianapolis Fire Department.

The Indianapolis Police Department strives to uphold the highest professional standards while enforcing laws that protect life and property, as well as respecting individual
rights, human dignity, and community values. Through community policing, the Department commits to creating and maintaining police and community partnerships while
helping citizens identify and solve problems to improve the quality of life in their neighborhoods.

Organizational Policy:
Central to the Indianapolis Police Department mission is community policing. This law enforcement philosophy and organizational strategy places the police and the
community in a problem-solving partnership to address law violations and to develop strategies for meeting the public safety concerns of neighborhood residents beyond

Intergovernmental Cooperation: Continue and expand the relationship with federal law enforcement.
Federal Grants: Continuue COPS grants, the Weed and Seed program and partnerships with federal law enforcement agencies.
Targeting Hot Spots: Enhance public safety by targeting crime hot spots with additional patrols, undercover operations, and increased nuisance abatement.
Impact levels of domestic violence through efforts of the new Domestic Violence Unit.
Criminal Offenders: Reduce crime and violence by targeting the worst criminal offenders in partnership with other law enforcement, probation, and prosecutors.

Outcomes and Activities:

COMMUNITY POLICING: Community policing consists of upholding the highest professional standards while serving the community in the enforcement of laws, while
also respecting individual rights, human dignity and community values; to maintain active police and community relationships; and assist citizens in identifying and solving
problems to improve the quality of life in their neighborhoods.

Patrol/Investigation Services
Patrol is broadly defined as the various activities performed by (typically uniform) police officers relative to: crime and accident prevention; maintenance of public order;
discovery of hazards and delinquency-causing situations; response to requested services; investigations of crimes, offenses, incidents, and conditions, including arresting
offenders; traffic control; regulation of certain businesses or activities (as required by law); provision of emergency services; development and maintenance of community
relations and proactive problem solving (community policing concepts); and reporting information to the appropriate organizations.
The fundamental goals of investigation are identifying, detecting, and apprehending the offender, recovering stolen property, and obtaining a conviction in court. Basic
investigations include incidents that are a violation of laws and ordinances (crime and traffic); personnel investigations (background and internal); and, conditions and
circumstances which, left unchecked, would result in an increase in prohibited vices and organized crime.
The department is also heavily involved in such special events as the Brickyard 400, parades, and marathons. Furthermore, such specialty service activities as SWAT, horse
patrol, and bomb disposal provide additional law enforcement services, including the provision of special training, equipment, methods, and other resources.

Department of Public Safety
Police Pension
Mission Statement:

The Indianapolis Police Department Pension Fund is dedicated to serving retired officers and their dependents. We are committed to the enforcement of laws to protect the
proceeds of the Pension Fund while providing efficient service to those individuals in payment of their pension benefits.

Organizational Policy:
Indiana State Law and contractual agreements between the City of Indianapolis and the Fraternal Order of Police control benefits paid by the Indianapolis Police Department
Pension Fund. The Department is currently under two pension plans for officers. The City of Indianapolis funds the 1953 Plan. The State of Indiana funds the 1977 Plan
with contributions by the City to the PERF plan. The Indianapolis Police Department currently has a total of 271 officers who are eligible to retire. Of this total, 118 are
members of the 1953 Fund, 102 were 1953 Plan members who converted to the 1977 Fund, and 51 are members of the 1977 Fund. The Department is currently retiring an
average of 30 officers per year.

Operating Highlights:
Benefits paid by the Indianapolis Police Department Pension Fund are increasing due to elevation in the salary base. Benefits are paid beginning at 50% for a 20-year
patrolman increasing to 74% for 32 years of service. A significant impact on the pension budget is the additional percent of pension contribution paid by the City of
Indianapolis on behalf of each officer. This increases appropriation for those officers enrolled in the 1977 plan and reduces revenue for 1953 plan members.

Department of Public Safety
Indianapolis Fire Department
Mission Statement:

The Indianapolis Fire Department responds to 65,000 fire, medical, and environmental emergencies. The Department is dedicated to minimizing the loss of life and
property through suppression EMS, rescue, education, code enforcement, investigation, and innovative programs.

Organizational Policy:
The Indianapolis Fire Department fulfills its mission by aggressively suppressing active fires and responding immediately to emergency, medical, rescue, and HAZMAT
calls. The Department recognizes that it is an integral part of the neighborhoods it serves and strives to be sensitive and responsive to neighborhood needs and priorities.

New Initiatives:
New Fire Station: In 2000/2001, IFD is constructing a new Fire Station 14 at 30th and Kenwood Avenue, which includes adjacent property. The project is the result of a
strong coalition between government and the corporate community, and includes neighborhood partners. Special funding has been established for the $1.8 million dollar
project. The new facility will consist of 10,000 square feet, 4 apparatus bays and quarter 4 fire apparatus, and 10 firefighters per shift.
Strategic Plan: The Indianapolis Fire Department has introduced a comprehensive five-year strategic plan, titled Project 2005. This sophisticated document was developed
by over 120 firefighters to prepare IFD for the future. The plan provides a path and course of action for the department through the year 2005 and beyond. The plan has 10
sections and addresses future issues from resource location and equipment status to community relations and public partnerships. It is a systematic approach to fire
protection for the next decade and provides a focus for the department as a community leader and neighborhood partner.
Department Health and Fitness: As a member of the National Wellness/Fitness 10 Cities Task Force, IFD will concentrate on enhancing the health and fitness of the
workforce. The initiative includes new physical entry standards for recruits and will continue to address incumbent fitness levels. The example program is a progressive
evolution to meet national health and fitness standards for firefighters. The Indianapolis Fire Department is currently recognized as one of the national leaders in health and
fitness.

Information Management System: The department is currently in a four year, three-phase upgrade of its communications and records management systems. Metropolitan
Emergency Communications Agency (MECA) is in the process of upgrading the hardware and software for the Computer Aid Dispatch (CAD). As part of this initial
project, MECA is integrating the Fire Records Management System into the new MECA FRMS and setting up a county wide Fire/Police Email system. The new system is
year 2000 compliant. The Email system will allow all of the Public Safety agencies to communicate with each other. Phase 1 was completed in fourth quarter of 1999.
Phase 2 is the upgrading of the CAD to accept Graphical User Interface terminals, Mapping and Automated Vehicle Location (AVL). AVL will allow the department to
constantly monitor the location of all of our fire fighting/emergency vehicles using Global Positioning Satellites (GPS). This will help insure that we send the closest
appropriate equipment to the emergency.
The result will be a better allocation of our resources allowing for an increased level of protection to the community. Included in this phase is the installation of Mobile
DataTerminals (MDT) and Mobile Data Computers (laptop computers).
These devices will interface with the CAD and give the firefighters dispatch information as well as hazard information as they respond to emergencies. Phase 2 is tentatively
scheduled for completion in the third quarter of 2000. The final phase of this project will be the ability to use Mobile Field Reporting of Fire/Hazmat Inspections as well as
EMS/Fire reporting. Fire Inspectors will have the ability to enter fire inspection and hazard information as they are making their site inspections. This will allow for real
time query of hazardous information. Firefighters and Emergency Medical personnel will also enter their EMS reports directly into the system. This phase will begin in the
fourth quarter of 2000.
Urban Search and Rescue Task Force: The Indianapolis Fire Department has been a member of Indiana Task Force–1, and in 2000, has accepted responsibility for
providing administrative support. The Task Force is one of 28 Urban Search and Rescue Task Forces. The National Urban Search and Research (USR) Response System,
established under the authority of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in 1989, is a framework for structuring local emergency services personnel into
integrated disaster response task forces.
These task forces, replete with the necessary tools and equipment, and requisite skills and techniques, can be deployed by FEMA to anywhere in the United States for the
rescue of victims of structural collapse. A FEMA US & R Task Force is comprised of 62 specialists, and is divided into four major functional elements: Search, Rescue,
Technical and Medical.
Task Force members include structural engineers and specialists in the areas of hazardous materials, heavy rigging, search (including highly trained search dogs), logistics,
rescue and medicine. By design, there are two task force members assigned to each position for the rotation and relief of personnel. This allows for round-the-clock task
force operations. Each Task Force includes a comprehensive equipment cache totaling 58,000 pounds. The cache elements sent to the disaster scene include
communications, locating, rope, rigging, hauling, lifting and pulling equipment. Also shoring, structural movement sensing, victims extrication, cutting and drilling devices
are included to perform the difficult assignments often encountered by a FEMA US& R Task Force.

Outcome and Activities:

FIRE SUPPRESSION & EMERGENCY SERVICES. This Department provides an appropriate, safe, and professional response to fire, medical, and environmental
emergencies. Through its programs of suppression, rescue, education, code enforcement, investigation and other programs, the Department minimizes the loss of life and
property.
Fire Suppression
Fire Suppression responds to calls from the community requiring services as the result of accidents, natural disasters, arson, or other sources. Activities include rescuing
individuals trapped in burning structures and putting out fires.
EMS
EMS responds to calls from the community requesting emergency medical service. Paramedic teams are dispatched and responsible for administering first-contact care to
patients while transporting them to a nearby medical facility.
Rescue
These services consist of responding to calls from the community requesting rescues. They are often performed in conjunction with such other Fire Department activities as
Fire Suppression or EMS. Rescue Services also improve firefighter safety through education, training, and equipment purchases.
HAZMAT
HAZMAT responds to calls from the community requesting the containment and cleanup of hazardous materials. Fire suppression activities involving hazardous substances
require assistance from this unit. HAZMAT seeks to comply with NFPA 1500, OSHA mandated training and education standards, as well as other regulations.
E-911
E-911 takes emergency calls from the community, provides timely and accurate information to Fire/EMS companies, and dispatches appropriate emergency assistance.
E-911 also provides educational and professional opportunities for operators.
Firefighter Training / Education
The Training Division promotes incumbent / recruit training based on nationally accepted professional standards. The Indianapolis Fire Department is committed to
complying with the National Fire Protection Association’s standards for fire departments and is near full compliance. IFD will have 114,754 contact hours in 2000.
Administrative, Apparatus, and Fire Station Support
These provide the administrative support, tools, equipment, apparatus, and facilities necessary to carry out the department’s mission. The division also
strives to provide a safe, comfortable, and functional living environment for fire fighters when they are not actively engaged in emergency responses.

Fire Pension
Mission Statement:

The purpose of the Indianapolis Fire Department Pension Fund is to keep records on each pensioner’s taxes, insurance, and benefits status and to disperse the appropriate
pension payments. This office also assists the families of both retired and active firefighters at the time of death and is the official representative of the Indianapolis Fire
Department at the funeral.
The Indianapolis Fire Pension Fund is dedicated to serving the retired officers and their dependents. We are committed to the enforcement of laws protecting the Pension
Fund. We also are committed to educating active officers in preparation for their retirement.

Organizational Policy:
The Division has two pension plans for firefighters. The City of Indianapolis funds the 1937 Pension Act, and the State of Indiana funds the 1977 Plan with contributions by
the City to the 1977 Firefighters Pension and Disability Fund. As of June 30, 2000, there were 325 firefighters eligible to retire. During the last ten years, this department
has retired an average of 20 firefighters per year.

Operating Highlights:
Benefits paid by the Indianapolis Fire Department Pension Fund are increasing due to the elevation in the pension base. Benefits are paid beginning at 50% of the pension
base for a 20-year firefighter increasing to 74% of the pension base for 32 years of service.

participants in the local economy have in buying of goods and services.

Outcome and Activities:

2001 Annual Budget
Department of Public Safety
Animal Care and Control Division
Mission Statement:

This Division promotes the safety of citizens from animals and animal-borne diseases, fosters the humane treatment of unwanted animals, encourages the adoption of pets,
enforces animal laws, conducts licensing operations, has the authority to inspect facilities which deal with or sell animals, and conducts educational programs. The Division
is committed to improving animal shelter conditions to improve the quality of life of animals in its care.

Organizational Policy:
The Animal Care and Control Division (ACCD) provides stray animal control seven days per week, 365 days a year. Services provided by the division in addition to stray
animal control are animal identification using microchips, immunizations, adoption, and quarantine enforcement. This division also investigates reports of violations of
animal control laws, including inspecting animal exhibition permits, kennels, pet shops, rodeos, stables, grooming salons, care and treatment complaints, and animal bites in
Marion County. Until April 2000 the division directed kennel operations at the animal care and control shelter on 2600 South Harding Street. With the adoption of a new
contract, management of kennel operations has been transferred to the Humane Society of Indianapolis.

New Initiatives:
Effectiveness/Responsiveness: Improve Animal Control effectiveness by increasing the level of responsiveness to the public. This will be achieved by transferring ACCD
incoming call-answering responsibilities currently handled in the Mayor’s Action Center back to ACCD.
Education: Develop a public access webpage to encourage adoptions and inform the public about Animal Care and Control Law.
Shelter Conditions: Improve shelter conditions with the completion of the design, purchase and installation of a new air-conditioning system for the kennel area.
Staffing: Increase staffing to accommodate the needs of the community. The division plans the addition of three (3) new employees, including a civilian administrator
(previously, the administrator position was filled by a uniformed IPD police officer), a processor to field calls from the public, and an operations manager for patrol
operations.
Humane Society Management: Continuation of the Council-approved contract with the Humane Society for management of the division’s kennel operations.

Animal Care and Control Division
Outcome and Activities:

ANIMAL CONTROL. The division’s goal is to promote the safety of citizens from animals and animal borne diseases, foster the humane treatment of unwanted
animals, enforce animal laws, conduct licensing operations, inspect facilities which deal with or sell animals, conduct educational programs and operate a kennel.

Field Operations
The field operators consist of eighteen animal control officers, two dispatchers, and two supervisors. Field activities include all field enforcement operations throughout
Marion County, although the division has only support jurisdiction in the excluded cities and towns. Sub-activities include stray animal control, homeless animal rescue,
animal bite investigation, barking dog and other animal nuisance investigations, citations, and court appearances.
Kennel Facilities
A modern kennel managed under contract by the Humane Society of Indianapolis for the Animal Care and Control Division is located at 2600 South Harding Street and
houses stray, lost, and unwanted animals. These animals are made available for adoption, and when necessary, euthanized. License and adoptive services are provided
at this facility as well as a public education program consisting of classes and public lectures.

SERVING THE CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS
Mayor Joe Hogsett
Welcome. I like to
say that every day
is a good day to be
Mayor, and that’s
only possible thanks
to the men and
women that serve
our community. Indianapolis is a safer
and better place to
work and live thanks
to the work of our
dedicated, selfless
firefighters. It is
truly an honor to stand alongside you in
the mission of bettering our neighborhoods,
and you have our sincerest gratitude for living each day with unmatched compassion
and bravery.
The safety and well-being of our citizens
has been and will continue to be at the top
of our priorities list. Without your service,
Indianapolis would not be the city that it
is today, one that is thriving in ways once
unprecedented. But we will be able to continue living and growing knowing our lives
are in the good hands of our firefighters.
You have the full support of my whole administration, and we look forward to continuing to serve our community with you.

raise a family. Hailed as the 13th largest city in
America and home to a diverse population, the
city attracts millions of visitors annually. The
IFD Fire Service district covers 278 square miles
including downtown Indianapolis and surrounding areas. Our duty to protect the community
has not lessened and continues to grow in
complexity, hazard and risk. As firefighters, we
must face challenges head on every shift, every
day, every time. The people we serve are depending on us. We won’t let them down.
The Indianapolis Fire Department is a performance driven, full service, all hazard mitigation,
public safety agency. Our organization’s mission is to save lives, protect property and the
environment. Our primary focus is serving our
community with courage, commitment and compassion while providing courteous, professional
and respectful care to the citizens and visitors of
Indianapolis.

Our department is organized to provide the
resources necessary to meet the needs of the
community at the highest level of proficiency
and attainable quality. Responsive public
safety services provided by committed IFD
personnel build community equity and go a
long way in determining the level of trust our
citizens have in our organization.
Each time you see a man or a woman wearing
our uniform, you are seeing a public servant
who is highly trained and deeply committed
to keeping you and your family safe. We truly
embrace the sentiment that in the IFD, it is
“Our Family Serving Your Family.”
In moving IFD forward, we will continue to
value the traditions of the past, effectively address the issues of the present and embrace
the challenges of the future.
I am honored to be the Chief of an outstanding, progressive fire department such as IFD.
I believe the professional manner in which the
men and women of this department perform
their duties is second to none, and I am proud
to serve with them.
It is with great pleasure that I present the
2016 Indianapolis Fire Department Annual

E R N E S T M A L O N E

The IFD has four bureaus reporting directly to the Chief of Fire.
These include Administration, Logistics, Technical Services and
Operations. Each bureau is led by a deputy chief officer whose
ability to successfully reach goals and produce positive outcomes
is enhanced by the quality of the personnel they get to work with.
Additional direct reports include Finance, Media Relations, Chaplains, Indiana Task Force 1 (IN-TF1) and Planning. The administrative personnel working in each of these areas is made up of
both sworn and civilian employees. Each is dedicated to providing
the best possible service to the citizens and visitors of our community while also attending to the needs of firefighters.
The department has 43 stations divided into seven strategically
placed battalions. An organization made up of men and women
with diverse cultural backgrounds, our department members work
closely with city residents, businesses and stakeholders. Our
successful partnerships come by maintaining strong relationships
through meaningful interaction and by listening to neighborhood
needs well beyond emergency response. No matter where your
interests lie within the fire service, IFD has skilled professionals
ready to serve.

MEDIA RELATIONS
office of the chief

B A T T A L I O N C H I E F
R I T A R E I T H

Media Relations is the vital connection between the media, the public and the fire department. It is the goal of the Public Information
Office to provide a seamless flow of information regarding incident
responses, programs, events and services offered to the 850,000
residents and businesses in the IFD’s 278 square mile coverage
area.
Media Relations is divided into two areas of operation: the Public
Information Officer (PIO) and the Photo Division. The PIO handles
the media on incident responses as well as press conferences and
media releases. The Photo Division documents the department’s
work by producing photos and video for historical use, firefighter
training and arson investigations.
Social Media is a primary tool used by the PIO to communicate
strategic information, good works of firefighters and allow followers
to participate in important safety programs or events sponsored by
IFD. Follow IFD on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.
Coordinating public relations is a function of the Media Relations
office as well. Activities such as Clothe-A-Child, Fill the Bell, Indianapolis Black Firefighters Association (IBFA) Christmas at the Firehouse, St. Patrick’s Day, Fire Department Instructors Conference
(FDIC), Smoke Detector Blitzes and Survive Alive events require a
partnership between the PIO, event coordinators and the media.
Committee leadership for the annual the IFD Awards Banquet and
Fire Police & Deputy Sheriff Awards is required for the PIO in addition to corporate and neighborhood activities. Months of advance
planning are required and allow citizens to engage and form positive relationships with the firefighters that serve them.

TASK FORCE 1
office of the chief

B A T T A L I O N
T O M N E A L

C H I E F

Indiana Task Force One (IN-TF1) is one of 28 highly trained Department of Homeland Security and Federal Emergency Management
Agency sponsored Urban Search and Rescue (US&R) teams in the
United States. The Task Force, in existence since 1992, has grown
into an elite team capable of deploying anywhere in the continental
United States with excellent equipment and highly trained search and
rescue personnel. In its 25-year history, IN-TF1 has seen national
operational deployments in many areas across the United States. It
saw deployment to Oklahoma City in 1995, the World Trade Center in
2001 and the space shuttle Columbia accident in 2003. It was also
deployed to Hurricanes Katrina, Gustav, Ike, Sandy and Hurricane
Matthew in the fall of 2016. Locally the Task Force has responded to
Lafayette, Evansville and Henryville for tornado events.

In early 2016, IN-TF1 was finally operating under a Memorandum
of Understanding (MOU) with the Indiana Department of Homeland
Security (IDHS) for deployments within the state. IN-TF1 is one of few
teams to have this type of agreement in place within their home state.
The Indiana State Legislature passed the agreement in a piece of legislation signed by the Governor. This is important in protecting team
members and allows for a faster response to incidents and better serve
the citizens of Indiana.
In June, IN-TF1 had four members participate in an Indiana National
Guard Exercise United Front V. The exercise took place in Lod, Israel (see photos on right). The exercise was conducted over a 36-hour
period where Task Force members integrated into rescue squads
comprised of personnel from the Indiana National Guard Chemical,
Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and High Yield Explosive (CBRNE)

Enhanced Response Force
Package (CERFP), the
Marine Corps Chemical
Biological Incident Response Force (CBIRF) and
the Israeli Defense Force
Search and Rescue Unit
(IDFSRU). The scenario
based training allowed
IN-TV to learn the search
and rescue training, tactics and procedures of the
IDFSRU. It was a great
learning opportunity experience by the Task Force
members.
The Task Force will
again look forward to
conducting exercising
with our partners in
United Front VI in May
of 2017. The team will
deploy a full 80-person
team to participate
in an active scenario.
Since 2011, IN-TF1
has been building relationships with the Indiana National Guard
and the IDFSRU.
The team continues to excel in meeting all training and deployment
expectations of the FEMA US&R system. In 2016, the Task Force
hosted peers from other teams as well as FEMA US&R Headquarters staff to conduct an Administrative Readiness Evaluation (ARE).
The ARE process is a management review of the state of readiness
and our ability to meet the mission of the National Federal Urban
Search and Rescue System. The review looks at three areas of mission readiness: operations, financial grants management and cache
equipment. The team passed with high scores in all categories and
had several best practices within the national system.

CHAPLAINS
office of the chief

IFD Chaplain services are comprised of three Chaplains who represent various denominations. The primary function of Chaplain
Services is to comfort, support and counsel those who are affected
by a traumatic incident. This may be personnel within the fire
department or may include civilians who suffer the effects of fire
or other tragic events.

ADMINISTRATIVE BUREAU
D E P U T Y C H I E F
T I M B A U G H M A N

The Administration Bureau is responsible for all Human Resource
(HR) functions including the oversight of personnel records, hiring,
training and promotions. Additionally, the Administration Bureau
is responsible for Strategic Planning, Performance and Compliance,
Scheduling, Information Technology and Pension Services.

PERSONNEL
H R D I R E C T O R
K R I S H A R R I S O N

The HR Division meets the needs of nearly 1300 sworn and civilian employees. Human Resources is responsible for recruiting and selecting
sworn and civilian employees, administering promotion processes, receiving requests for and granting internal transfers, managing the random
drug testing program and maintaining the personnel, medical and leave
records of all employees. In a continuing effort to promote and protect the
health and safety of our firefighters, the HR department schedules annual
personal fitness evaluations (PFEs) and work performance evaluations
(WPEs) for all sworn personnel.
HIRING PROCESS
In 2016, HR notified the public of an open application period. Of the 2099
respondents who applied, 1251 candidates took the Written Test and 1091
passed (87.2%). Of the 983 candidates who chose to participate in the
Oral Interviews, the top 355 will participate in the CPAT (Candidate Physical Agility Test) in 2017. As the future needs of the department are projected, a ranked hiring list will be established resulting from the multiple
levels of applicant testing.

14

PROMOTION LIST
Per Fire Merit Law, the current promotion list is valid for three (3) years
from the date the list was certified by the merit board, or until a new list
is certified in its place. The current list was certified in November of 2015
and will be in place until November of 2018 or until a new list is approved by the merit board. 90 firefighters have been promoted to higher
merit rank from the current list (6 Battalion Chiefs, 41 Captains and
43 Lieutenants). The next round of promotions should occur mid-year
2017, with the next promotion process beginning late 2017.

PENSION

C A P T A I N
D E A N J O H N S O N

The department’s pension fund is dedicated to serving retired firefighters
and their dependents. IFD is committed to the enforcement of laws protecting the pension fund and to educating our active members in preparing for retirement. The pension is just one piece of the retirement puzzle.
The City of Indianapolis, along with the IFD and Local #416, have worked
tirelessly to provide our members various investment opportunities to
enhance their retirements. All members are encouraged to educate
themselves on options and participate in the programs that best fit their
individual circumstances. IFD is committed to providing pension fund
members the best customer service possible.

SCHEDULING COORDINATOR
C A P T A I N
D A M O N B R A N S O N

The Scheduling Coordinator works closely with all divisions to identify
department-wide scheduling needs. The Scheduling Coordinator manages the department calendar and Telestaff to schedule programs, trainings and meetings in a manner which minimizes the impact on daily
operations. The schedule is created based on established guidelines,
departmental priorities, operational limits and training request submission dates.
Telestaff is an application used for personnel staffing, special event scheduling and overtime tracking. The Scheduling Coordinator provides support to Telestaff users on data entry and collaborates with the I.T. Division
to identify and resolve issues. Other responsibilities include developing
and running reports, checking schedule conflicts and tracking certification data.

TRAINING
administration bureau

B A T T A L I O N
M A R K R A P P

C H I E F

The IFD Training Academy is responsible for developing and delivering training programs to new firefighters (recruits) and 1,200+ veteran
firefighters (incumbents). Training types include classroom instruction, hands-on training and on-line courses. Topics include basic firefighting, driver operator, safety and survival, leadership development,
incident command and instructor development.
Over the course of 2016, the incumbent members of the department
received over 28,900 hours of continuing education. The Training Division was tasked with several initiatives during 2016. These initiatives
included certifying all company officers and battalion chiefs in Fire
Officer I, Fire Officer II, Incident Safety Officer and National Incident
Management System (NIMS) 300/400. In addition, the Training Division created a Field Training Officer program to provide supplemental
training and mentorship to probationary firefighters. The specific
training includes the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Fire Officer Strategy and Tactics (40 FF’s certified)
Fire Instructor (44 FF’s certified)
Fire Officer I (41 FF’s certified)
Fire Officer II (45 FF’s certified)
Incident Safety Officer (99 FF’s certified)
Health and Safety Officer (99 FF’s certified)
2nd Officer School (181 FF’s trained)
Officer Candidate School (63 FF’s completed)
Executive Officer School (121 FF’s trained)
NIMS 300/400 (130 FF’s certified)
Engineer Recertification (300 FF’s obtained)
EVOC (Emergency Vehicle Operations Course) (535 FF’s completed)
Field Training Officer Program (30 FF’s trained)

The Training Division also conducted a fire academy class during the
course of 2016. Recruit Class 81 (see photo on right) consisted of 38
personnel who trained to be firefighters and emergency medical technicians over a period of 26 weeks. The recruits trained in topics such as
hazardous materials, emergency medicine, firefighting, special operations, firefighter survival and emergency vehicle operations. Each
recruit received a total 624 hours of instruction during the fire portion
of the academy and 304 hours of instruction in emergency medical

16

care. This totaled over 23,700 hours of combined fire training and a
total of 11,500 of combined emergency medical training. In addition,
the recruits conducted training in fire stations and hospitals to gain
real time experience.
After graduation from the fire academy, probationary firefighters continue to receive training through the department’s Field Training Officer
program. This program allows each probationary firefighter to spend
valuable one-on-one time with an experienced firefighter who has been
trained to serve as a field training officer. This additional training will
total approximately 100 hours per probationary firefighter.
Lastly, the Training Division made improvements to some existing areas. The Ninth Brain program that the department relies upon for online training has been updated to reflect completed state certifications
for better record keeping. Two trailers have been added to our compliment of vehicles for use in company level training. One trailer has been
outfitted with forcible entry props and a second trailer is equipped for
firefighter survival training.

administration bureau

PLANNING
B A T T A L I O N C H I E F
M A T T H E N S S

The Planning Office was re-established in 2016. One of its first tasks
was to create a 21st century mission statement. Upon completion,
the new Mission Statement was added alongside the Motto, Values
and Success Indicators summarizing the IFD’s Mission & Value
Statement Page (see pg 5). The Planning Office also helped facilitate
the ongoing execution of the Capital Infrastructure Plan, Station
Replacement Plan, Apparatus Replacement Plan and Redeployment
Plan. Rounding out 2016, the focus shifted to achieving International
Accreditation. Additionally, IFD is pursuing the necessary steps to
improve the department’s Insurance Service Office (ISO) rating (see
below). Through these efforts, the Planning Office will develop a strategic plan and a community risk assessment. These steps will benefit
future departmental planning efficiencies.

Along with improving the ISO Rating, the IFD is dedicated to
achieving International Accreditation, which has only been
achieved by 234 departments in the U.S. Classes were attended
covering quality improvement through Accreditation and data
analysis. The IFD hosted a class with industry expert Paul Rottenberg as its featured speaker. The team began by implementing
a plan to gain accreditation. This process requires the publication of a strategic plan, a thorough community needs-assessment
and the establishment of a Standards of Cover. Also required is a
self-assessment of the department including appraisals of current
performance and plans for future improvement. These efforts will
continue into the foreseeable future.

PERFORMANCE & COMPLIANCE
C A P T A I N
T R E V O R W I L S O N

The Performance and Compliance division started 2016 by spearheading the department’s latest ISO classification study. This investigation involved a comprehensive examination of the city’s emergency
communication system, water supply and fire protection service. The
ISO rating is a scale from 10 - 1, with “1” being the best. Nationwide,
52 departments have an ISO rating of 1. A 2016 department study
resulted in an ISO classification of 2/2Y, placing the IFD in the top
3.5% of all departments in the country. This also represented an
improved score for all coverage areas formerly served by township fire
departments.

H E A D

The Fire Investigation Section (FIS) consists of sworn firefighters
and law enforcement officers that are specially trained to identify
and collect evidence relating to fires. Cross-trained in each other’s
disciplines, IFD/IMPD Fire Investigators make determinations as to
the origin and cause of fires and investigate if any criminal activity is
involved. The following list are statistics of the evidence collected by
the FIS in 2016:
•
•
•
•

358 fires were investigated by the FIS
137 were ruled incendiary
82 were ruled accidental
139 were ruled undetermined
14 civilian fire related injuries
8 civilian fire fatalities
22 arrests for the crime of arson
Thursdays experienced the highest call volume
1300-0300 was the most frequent call time

Events:
The Indianapolis FIS hosted an all-day burn cell training in August
with investigators from all over the country participating in the exercise. The training allowed participants to observe various fire loads
and the impact ventilation has on fire patterns. A vehicle fire training class was held in October where all full-time Certified Fire and
Explosive Investigators (CFEI) received their certifications as Certified Vehicle Fire Investigators (CVFI) through the National Association of Fire Investigators (NAFI).

INVESTIGATIONS

Follow Up from 2012 Case:
The Richmond Hills case concluded in 2016 with 5 convictions. The
convicted individuals’ sentences are as follows: one received 3 years,
one received 30 years, one received 50 years, one received 2 life sentences plus 75 years and one received 2 life sentences plus 70 years.
The hard work and dedication of the FIS was key in successfully
prosecuting this case.

COMMUNICATIONS
technical services

C O M M U N I C A T I O N S
S H E R R Y T A Y L O R

M A N A G E R

The IFD has a consolidated Fire/Emergency Medical Services (EMS) communications center. Through constant evaluation and reassessment, the current
workflow process remains. Best practice indicates it is the most effective use
of resources. The 911 call center utilizes an automated call distributor which
helps allocate the call volume more evenly. Automated dispatching verbalizes
the information once an incident is placed into Computer Automated Dispatch
(CAD). Personnel are trained and certified to handle all job roles including the
EMS Control Position, Call Taker, Dispatcher and Controller.
EMS CONTROL POSITION
One Telecommunicator is responsible for the control of all basic EMS and fire
incidents. This is possible due to apparatus being equipped with status and
message buttons. The only radio traffic associated with these incidents is to
speak to a hospital ER or an occasional incident upgrade.
IFD Dispatch is the regional EMS Center. The EMS Control Position facilitates
radio traffic for the Indianapolis Hospital Emergency Radio Network and any
radio request made by IFD and local agencies.
CALL TAKER/DISPATCHER/CONTROLLER
Remaining personnel receive and process Fire/EMS calls as they come in. All
staff are trained as Emergency Medical Dispatchers (EMD) and provide EMD
services when required. On incidents that require a Controller’s intervention,
such as structure fires and specialized response incidents, the call taker goes
out of the call rotation and becomes the Controller for that incident. When the
individual that processed the call becomes the Controller, it provides for the
continuity of operations.
Per activity based staffing, the number of personnel on duty is adjusted to
increase during the busiest times of day and to decrease as the activity decreases.
In 2016, the division held its first formal and structured promotional process
which yielded 6 positional advancements. The official Ceremony was held at
IFD Headquarters on November 22, 2016 with Chief Malone and Deputy Chief
Pervine presiding.

TERT (Telecommunicator Emergency Response Taskforce)
“In partnership, the National Emergency Number Association and the Association of Public Safety Communications Officials-International are dedicated to the development of a nationally recognized program for telecommunicator mutual aid response in the aftermath of disasters.”
IN-TERT (Indiana TERT) announced that Indiana as a state is now deployable. IFD has 6 Communications personnel who are certified members, of
which one is the Central Region Coordinator.

RECRUITMENT
technical services

The Indianapolis Fire Department is always seeking innovative ways
to expose fire service career opportunities to the community it serves;
we make every effort to mirror the demographic make-up of our city.
The IFD recruitment process is ongoing. Recruitment outreach is attained by attending Job/Career Fairs, Community Day events, Military Personnel events and Public Safety Career Day events hosted by
IUPUI.
The IFD Recruitment Office receives and responds to numerous
emails, telephone calls and walk-in applicants seeking information
about becoming an Indianapolis Firefighter. Potential recruits are
given information regarding the hiring process, the salary scale of
each rank, benefits, pension information, rewards and risks associated with being an IFD firefighter. The IFD Recruiter also serves as a
mentor to many applicants.
The current hiring process drew 2099 applicants. The majority of
each demographic had an increase in the number of applicants from
the last hiring process in 2013, which had 1831 applicants. The IFD
Recruitment office welcomes the interest of those seeking to become
part of one of the “Greatest Careers” on the planet.
Indianapolis Public Schools (IPS), Boy Scouts of America and the IFD
have joined to create a unique opportunity for students to gain insight
into the fire service. The results of this partnership are two programs,
each two years in length, that allow students to train like firefighters: The Fire Rescue Program and the Explorer Program. The idea is
working; eight of the participants in the programs have applied to the
most recent IFD hiring process.

FIRE RESCUE PROGRAM
C A P T A I N
R E N A W H E E L E R

26

In 2012, the IFD and the IPS created the Fire Rescue Program. The
program is available to students that have reached their Junior or Senior year (between the ages of 14 -18) with a minimum GPA of 2.0 and
attend any IPS, Charter, or Parochial school within Marion County.

Students are in class for three periods every day at the Career Technology Center on the Arsenal Technical High School campus. While
in class, the teenagers study ladder operations, hose line advancement, search and rescue, vehicle extrication, hazardous materials
containment, dispatch and radio communications and physical
fitness. Both the physical aspect of the class and the bookwork are
challenging. Lessons are built into the curriculum about teamwork,
leadership, integrity, trust, work ethic, determination and community service. The class is designed to put the participants outside of
their comfort zones. This model allows for cohesion of the group as
well as personal growth.
Firefighters refer to themselves
as a family. Many of the students lack support outside of
school and they find this family
atmosphere to be inviting. As
another layer of support, each
student is assigned an active
Indianapolis firefighter as a
mentor. The mentor is a firefighter who has volunteered to
work with a student outside of
work hours. Their job is to get
to know the student (outside of
school) and help them become
intentional about what they
will do after graduation – college, military, a full time job, or
a combination of the three.
While in the program, students have the opportunity to test for
several state certifications and earn up to 9 college credits. Now in
the fifth year, 100 percent of the program’s students have graduated
from high school. The IFD is very proud of the difference that this
program is making in the lives of young citizens.

Since the inception of this program, several of the students have
furthered their fire science education at Ivy Tech Community College
and Vincennes University. Furthering one’s education falls directly
in line with one of the missions of the program.

EXPLORER PROGRAM
C A P T A I N
K E V I N G I V E N S

The IFD offers an Explorer Program in conjunction with the Boy
Scouts of America. The Explorer program is designed for males and females between the ages of 14-18 to help introduce them to a career in
the fire service. The program is run by off duty Indianapolis Firefighters volunteering their time to help mentor, lead and shape the lives of
the youth involved in the program.
Explorers meet twice a month to learn basic fire operations, basic first
aid and terminology associated with the fire department. Additionally,
we try to emphasize the development of character, integrity, leadership
skills, teamwork and community service. The Explorers volunteer at
many IFD community events provided by the Fire and Life Safety Division throughout the year.

The IFD Explorers participate annually in an event called the HERO
competition (Hoosier Emergency Response Olympics). This event is
held in Lebanon, Indiana, and is open to other explorer programs and
high schools throughout Indiana that offer a fire service curriculum.
The event allows the youth to compete, use skills acquired during the
year and develop lasting relationships with people who participate.

HOMELAND SECURITY LIAISON
C A P T A I N
G R E G G A T E S

The Homeland Security Liaison serves as the representative of the Indianapolis Fire Department to the IMPD Homeland Security Bureau. The
Liaison assists with coordinating operations for large scale events such
as Colts games, Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Mini Marathon, Circle
City Classic, Final Four and Indiana Black Expo Summer Celebration.
Threat communications are assessed to determine credibility and potential implications to public safety personnel. The Liaison coordinates with
federal agencies to provide public safety assets for dignitary protection
details, provides coverage in the Regional Operations Center (ROC) for
large scale events and weather related actions, and is responsible for the
management of the Tactical Emergency Medical Services (TEMS).

TACTICAL EMERGENCY MEDICS
The IFD, in partnership with Indianapolis Emergency Medical Services
(IEMS), teams with the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department
(IMPD) to provide a TEMS team. The TEMS members respond with officers from the IMPD Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT), Explosive
Ordinance Disposal (EOD), Dignitary Protection and Special Events. The
team is dispatched predominantly within Marion County but occasionally responds to District 5 areas outside of the county limits.
The mission of the TEMS team is to save the lives of citizens and law enforcement in a special hazard environment. In continued support of this
mission, the IFD has one firefighter/paramedic assigned fulltime to the
IMPD SWAT team and four additional firefighters/paramedics with home
response capabilities.
In 2016, TEMS personnel provided support for over 400 requests; 299
were High Risk Warrants (HRW). In the ever changing environment, the
number of HRW incidents has been continually increasing. In 2016, the
IMPD SWAT team responded to more Call Outs and HRW than in any
previous year. Team members also logged 576 training hours in 2016.
The joint TEMS effort continues to be a model of cooperation between
local public safety agencies and ensures the highest level of protection is
provided for the residents of Indianapolis.

ACCREDITATION
operations bureau

The most ambitious undertaking the Indianapolis Fire Department
has likely ever pursued is becoming an accredited department.
Through the Center of Public Safety Excellence (CPSE), a comprehensive and systematic review of the organization will take place
through the Commission on Fire Accreditation International (CFAI).
The evaluation process is conducted by peer fire service personnel
who assess all activities and programs of the department. Only 234
fire departments worldwide have reached this impressive status.
Following an internationally recognized benchmark system, the
department will measure the delivery of fire and emergency services.
The 10 areas of service or activity evaluated:
1. Governance and Administration
2. Assessment and Planning
3. Goals and Objectives
4. Financial Resources
5. Programs
6. Physical Resources
7. Human Resources
8. Training and Competency
9. Essential Resources
10. External Systems Relationships

HEALTH AND SAFETY
operations bureau

The mission of the Safety Division is to promote and provide for the
health and safety of department members. Firefighting is inherently
dangerous. In 2016, 762 injuries were reported; 210 firefighters receiving injuries required follow-up treatment. The division is committed
to investigating injuries, identifying causes and working toward injury
prevention. The IFD Safety Division is also responsible for investigating
all accidents involving fire department vehicles, the department Physical Fitness Program and Peer Support of firefighters.

PEER SUPPORT
B A T T A L I O N C H I E F
D O U G A B E R N A T H Y

Firefighters face stresses throughout their career. Fighting fires, injuries
to children and casualties responded to can have a cumulative impact.
The IFD’s Peer Support Group provides support to department employees. Specially trained firefighters and health professionals are available
to assist all members of the IFD in managing stresses faced daily.

It’s not a question of if firefighters get
hurt, it’s a question of when.
LINE OF DUTY INJURIES
The online reporting system allows firefighters to document an injury
without having to seek medical attention immediately. This is a tremendous cost savings for minor injuries and a convenience for the firefighters. Properly managing and recording injuries allows the Health
and Safety Division to better assess where trends occur and when
issues arise. The goal is to lessen the frequency and severity of line of
duty (LOD) injuries by improving procedures and systems that manage
the safety of departmental personnel.

PHYSICAL FITNESS
C A P T A I N
K I M R O B I N S O N

Each firefighter is required to complete a Work Performance Evaluation
(WPE) in addition to their Physical Fitness Evaluation (PFE). The WPE
simulates the basic skills demonstrated on fire scenes. This evaluation
insures each firefighter can perform the basic skills required. Additionally, a core group of firefighters are certified as Physical Fitness Trainers. As needed or requested, a trainer will meet and design a customized fitness program. This program assists firefighters who wish to
increase their level of physical health and fitness.

32

On July 11-15, 2016, in response to the white paper drafted in Indianapolis, “Taking Action Against Cancer in The Fire Service,” the IFD Peer
Support Team joined with the Firefighters Cancer Support Network to
offer a train-the-trainer course on cancer prevention. IFD is one of only
three agencies in the nation to offer this ground-breaking and significant
training. The program was attended by more than 80 firefighters from
12 different jurisdictions, including 15 firefighters from the IFD. Since
the completion of the course, our newly minted instructors have delivered the program to 8 different jurisdictions outside of the IFD.

EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES
operations bureau

B A T T A L I O N C H I E F
D A V I D K E L L E Y

The Indianapolis Fire Department provides Emergency Medical Services
(EMS) to the citizens and visitors of our city. On a daily basis, firefighters assist people whose lives are threatened by cardiac arrest, respiratory
distress, injuries resulting from major trauma and other medical emergencies.
The EMS division maintains the certifications of all department members
by auditing training hours for each two-year certification cycle.
Every year, while striving to be as frugal with tax dollars as possible,
many initiatives are accomplished to assist the Firefighter EMTs (Emergency Medical Technicians) and Firefighter Paramedics in delivering the
highest level of pre-hospital medical care. Through interaction and cooperation with a multitude of other agencies, the IFD’s EMS division strives
to stay on the cutting edge.
EMS continues Operating Room
(O.R.) rotations for Paramedics.
The program began in 2014 to
give Medics more advanced airway technique skills. The first
round of rotations will conclude
in October of 2017 and the second round will begin.
The cadaver lab training program was started in 2014 to give the EMS
Duty Officers (EDO’s) more advanced training in patient care skill techniques. The program was shared with Recruit Class 81 which was the
first EMT class for the department and the state of Indiana to participate
in a cadaver lab. The teaching experience was second to none during the
learning phase and when applying medical devices on human cadavers.
The class members took information learned and applied it on a human
body.

MRX Cardiac Monitor Replacement Plan
The MRX is the IFD’s cardiac monitor of choice. 2016 was the second
year of a three-year plan. This initiative will give the department 55 new
cardiac monitors and replace monitors purchased in 2009. The MRX
cardiac monitor allows paramedics to acquire 12 lead tracings and more
efficiently identify patients having a cardiac issue. When completed,
each station will have at least one 12 lead cardiac monitor.
Mass Casualty Incident (MCI) Exercise and Management
The IFD EMS division modified the MCI policy for Marion County. To
test this product, an active shooter exercise was developed with the IEMS
and the IMPD. The exercise took place at Banker’s Life Fieldhouse and
tested the communications portion of the policy. The policy was presented and taught to all IFD Chiefs and EDO’s. The exercise was a success
and the IFD has been approached by other Marion County Fire Departments interested in receiving this training.

The Special Operations Division is responsible for providing hazardous material and technical rescue response to the City of Indianapolis and surrounding
communities. The Special Operations staff consists of a Battalion Chief and
three Captains. Responsibilities of the staff include the following: purchasing
equipment and maintenance, developing and coordinating training for special
operations companies, record keeping to ensure the department is meeting the
current standards, incident preplanning for target hazards in the community
and emergency response.
There are seven primary areas of focus for the Special Operations Division.
The Special Operations Captains are responsible for managing the following
disciplines: Dive rescue, Top water/Swift water rescue, Rope rescue, Extrication, Collapse rescue (CRT), Hazardous materials (Hazmat) and Urban search.

Collapse Rescue Team
The CRT responds from Stations 1, 5 and 10. Personnel assigned to these
stations are trained to mitigate incidents involving structural collapse, confined space and trench rescue. The CRT is staffed with a minimum of six
technician level trained personnel each shift. Responsibilities of the team include shoring buildings where a collapse has occurred, shoring and providing
rescue in collapsed trenches and performing rescue or recovery operations for
individuals in confined spaces such as tanks or vaults.

Dive and Top Water
The IFD has two dive teams at Stations 7 and 14. Each team is staffed with
10 personnel and maintains a minimum staffing of three divers per shift. The
department currently has 55 active divers. The teams’ primary function is to
provide subsurface search and rescue in bodies of water around Indianapolis. The dive team assists the IMPD and other police agencies with evidence
recovery when requested. The two teams also function as swift water rescue
teams as personnel assigned to these stations are trained to mitigate incidents
involving both static and swift moving water.

Hazardous Materials
The Hazmat response for the IFD is provided by four stations. Stations 13
and 44 are the primary entry teams. Personnel at these stations are Hazmat
Technicians trained to identify hazardous materials and provide safe, efficient
mitigation of the incident. Personnel at Stations 19 and 31 are also Hazmat
Techs who assist with entry operations if needed; however, their primary focus is decontamination of the entry teams and citizens exposed to hazardous
materials. The hazmat teams typically respond to spills or leaks on roadways
throughout Indianapolis or at various businesses in the IFD response district.

The IFD provides top water response to the south portion of Geist Reservoir
from Station 28 where the team responds from the Marina. Through a partnership with Citizens Energy, IFD began construction of a new dock for Boat
28, located on the south end of the reservoir which will facilitate a quicker
response to the area. The projected completion date is the end of April 2017.
Rope Rescue
The IFD provides rope rescue response with two teams located at Stations 7
and 14. Personnel assigned to these stations are trained to mitigate both high
angle and low angle incidents. High angle rope rescue is considered responses
where the terrain is 40 degrees or greater. This would include steep terrain or
incidents involving citizens injured or trapped at height. Low angle rope rescue is considered any response where the terrain is less than 40 degrees.

The five Heavy Extrication Task Forces consist of an engine, ladder and in
some instances a squad. Each Heavy Extrication Task Force operates a separate apparatus which carry specialized equipment. The Heavy Extrication
Task Forces are responsible for more complex incidents involving trapped
occupants in vehicles and machinery.

Extrication
There are thirteen Task Forces providing vehicle and machinery extrication
for the IFD response district. The IFD operates eight Light Extrication Task
Forces. Each Light Extrication Task Force consists of an engine and ladder
trained to mitigate routine vehicle accidents where occupants are trappedby
stabilizing the vehicle and providing safe removal of the occupants.

Urban Search
Station 29 provides urban search capabilities for the IFD response district. The Urban Search Task Force is responsible for searching for missing
individuals. The team utilizes mapping software, GPS and other technology
to coordinate search and rescue efforts with IMPD. In addition, the urban
search team is the primary responding unit for Project Lifesaver. The Project
Lifesaver program provides tracking capabilities of high risk clients, such
as an autistic child who frequently wanders from home. The Urban Search
Task Force utilizes special equipment to identify and locate Project Lifesaver
clients.
Joint Hazards Assessment Team
The special operations division is responsible for managing the Joint Hazards
Assessment Team (JHAT) for the IFD. The JHAT collaborates with the FBI
and the IMPD to provide hazard identification and mitigation at various large
events that occur in the City of Indianapolis.

COLOGNE, GERMANY
S I S T E R C I T Y P R O G R A M
P R I VAT E S U E S H E P H E R D

The Sister City relationship grew out of the “people-to-people” exchanges initiated by President Eisenhower in response to the tragedies of World War II.
Today more than three hundred American cities have one or more Sister City
relationships. Local level citizen’s diplomacy, social service missions and government relationships have become additional strategies of sister city activities.
Since 1988, Indianapolis and Cologne, Germany, have been connected through
an active and lively Sister City relationship. The mission of this partnership
is to foster international understanding at all levels by forging lasting personto-person bonds between the people of Indianapolis and Cologne. The Indianapolis - Cologne partnership is one of the most active of the city’s Sister City
relationships.
In the past twenty-five years the committee has hosted cultural, educational
and economic exchanges between the two cities. Notable among these are the
exchanges between the two fire departments, where a member of one organization would spend three weeks living and working with their counterparts.
In August of 2016, the Sister City
Exchange Committee selected Sue
Shepherd (Private, Engine 24C), to
continue the Sister City relationship with Cologne and experience the
cultural immersion among firefighters
as well as civilians. She was able to
see first-hand the many similarities
and differences there are between fire
departments, and she was also able to
enjoy the German lifestyle.
The IFD interviewed Sue to hear what
she learned and to share in her experiences:

Q: Why would you encourage someone to participate in the Sister City program?
“The goal of the program is to participate in all of the wonderful things that the
Cologne, Germany culture has to offer, whether it be on duty at the firehouse or
off duty when you spend family time with your host firefighters. This cultural
immersion trip encourages open mindedness and the willingness to embrace not
only the similarities between cultures, but more importantly the possible differences. It is a very exciting opportunity.”
Q: Can you name a few things you learned about the firefighting profession in
Cologne, Germany (i.e. similarities/differences in: apparatus, staffing per apparatus, tactics, gear, equipment, safety, incident command system, fitness)?
Their fire engines carry
much of the same equipment that our ladder
trucks carry (i.e.- ladders,
vehicle extrication equipment, etc.). ALL of their
apparatus’ are much
smaller than ours due to
the narrow streets around
the area.
Their apparatus’ were amazingly well organized and extremely clean, including
all equipment carried on the apparatus.
Staffing per apparatus is 4-5 on an engine and 2-3 on a ladder truck. Most of
the firefighters (unless they are very senior) have to accept the fact that they will
be rotating what apparatus they are assigned to on any given day, including
being assigned on an ambulance. My “home” firehouse had 2 ambulances that
were staffed by firefighters and 3 ambulances that were staffed by civilians.
They were extremely disciplined about being very prepared on fire runs. By
this I mean that regardless of whether it was an alarm run or a report of a fire,
they were dressed and ready to go (including face piece on). What I appreciated
about that is that they were so proficient at donning their gear that when the
time came for a working incident, they were ready very quickly.

Their decontamination process is unbelievable. When they have a working fire
(regardless of the time spent in the hot
zone), they are met almost immediately
outside by their TSU operator who takes
the entire SCBA, including their mask
and regulator. They are given a replacement SCBA which looks like it is brand
new even though it is not. Their cleaning
procedures are so thorough that everything looks like it just came from the manufacturer. Nobody has their own
face piece or regulator, but the cleaning process eliminates the need for having
your own regulator.
I realized that part of the cleanliness is due to the fact that they did not seem
to be as in favor of the aggressive style of interior fire attack that Indianapolis
uses.
Their officers do not go into a fire. The officer stays outside and acts as the
Incident Commander (IC). The two firefighters go in and only the officer and
the senior firefighter have handheld radios.
With regard to fitness, many of the firefighters I was stationed with were very
much into exercising. Many stations actually have some type of physical activity planned into their day. They call it “Sport”. It could be a group workout
at the station or even playing football (soccer) nearby. I can count on a few
fingers the number of overweight firefighters I saw. I actually created a group
workout for several of us to go through and they were very surprised at how
challenging it was compared to how it looked on paper. It was fun!
Q: What is their fire station culture like?
“Their fire station culture is very
similar to ours with the joking
and laughing. I did notice, however, from day one, that everyone
was so friendly, smiled a lot, said
“hello” even when they did not
know me yet. It was very noticeable how friendly they were. They
seem to love what they do, despite
the fact that many citizens do not
appreciate or respect firefighters

(or police and EMS, for that matter). Even the top Chief of the Cologne Fire
Department admitted that they are not respected. He said, “You are John
Wayne in America, we are not viewed that way.”
Q: What is the makeup of Cologne’s community and department personnel?
Cologne serves 1159 square miles, 1 million citizens, has approximately 1200
firefighters with 186 on duty around the clock, and staffs 11 fire stations.
Germany (and I believe Europe, in
general) relies heavily on volunteers. Otherwise, there would
be no way to get the job done. I
thought that was very interesting.
They have a successful relationship between paid and volunteer
firefighters and depend on each
other to provide EMS & Fire coverage for their community.
Professional Firefighters 1136
Voluntary Firefighters
1294
Q: Did you bring back anything you are hoping to implement within IFD?
“With regards to anything I am trying to implement here, it would be to carry
on with the positive attitudes I saw there, being even more aware of maintaining clean gear and equipment (for my own and others’ health and well-being),
and just being open and welcoming to differences between myself and others
and between our department and others’ departments. There absolutely
needs to be a realization by firefighters that just because we do things a
certain way does not mean that others’ methods are less than ideal or even
wrong.”
