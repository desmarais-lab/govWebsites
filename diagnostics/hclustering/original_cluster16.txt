**** Question ****
Where can I get help paying my utility bills?
**** Answer ****
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Low Income Home Energy
Assistance Program (LIHEAP) provides funds to State and local Governments to
help low-income households pay utility bills. You can access information on
that program at the LIHEAP web site below. Some electric and gas utilities,
churches, and social services organizations may have emergency financial
assistance programs. You will have to contact those organizations in your area.

***** City of Huntingburg Water Department to Flush Hydrants *****
The City of Huntingburg&rsquo;s Water Department is planning to conduct their
regular &ldquo;Spring&rdquo; hydrant flushing season beginning Monday, March
30, 2015.  The proposed flushing cycle will be south of 6th Street and west of
Main Street beginning Monday, March 30 thru Friday, April 3, north of 6th
Street and east of Main Street from Monday, April 6 to Friday, April 10; south
of 6th Street and east of Main Street from Monday, April 13 to Friday, April 17
and north of 6th Street and west of Main Street from Monday, April 20 to Friday
April 24. Flushing outlying areas west of the City may continue into May.   
Flushing is performed primarily to improve water quality and is a necessary
preventive maintenance activity for proper waterline function. Although it may
appear to waste water, flushing improves pressures and flow rates needed for
fire protection, aids in maintaining proper valve and hydrant operation and
helps to provide better overall water service to our customers.
Water will remain safe to drink; however, special care and attention is
recommended, especially before doing laundry.  Customers are advised to run
&ldquo;cold&rdquo; water through their taps for 5 to 7 minutes to clear any
discoloration in the water that may adversely affect laundry items.  The City
of Huntingburg is not responsible for the cleaning and/or replacement of those
items.
Flushing times will typically be Monday through Friday from 7:30 a.m. to 3:30
p.m. Locations and times may vary from day to day.
For more information, please contact Rachel Steckler, Director of Communication
and Community Development, at 683-2211 or by email at rsteckler@huntingburg-
in.gov.

WAIVER OF DEED

In 2011, the City donated land to the 21st Century Charter School in Gary for the construction of a high

The charter school is completing its financing for the project and has learned that certain lots donated
by the city, lots which had once had been given to the Horace Mann Ambridge Neighborhood
Improvement Organization (HMANIO) and returned, have restrictive covenants on the deeds indicating
that they can be utilized only for residential purposes. The deed restrictions must be waived so that
financing can be finalized and construction can begin for the 2013-2014 school year.
Attached is a waiver that has been prepared to release these restrictions. I am requesting that the Board
approve the waiver and execute it.
WAIVER OF DEED REQUIREMENTS
‚Äú‚Ä¶WHEREAS, the Redevelopment Commission conveyed title to the Property to Grantor pursuant to
that certain Quit Claim Deed dated September 13, 2011 and recorded in the Lake County, Indiana

WHEREAS, the Deed contains certain requirements which Grantor has determined to waive.
NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and other good and valuable consideration, the

INTRODUCTION
The design guidelines contained in this section are
intended to support the recommendations presented
in this Plan, and to serve as an ongoing reference for
the City of Richmond Bicycle and Pedestrian Master
Plan. They are not intended as comprehensive design
standards. Rather, they reference existing design
standards and provide clarification or supplemental
information as necessary. There are six primary
sources of bicycle and pedestrian facility design
information that were used to develop the guidelines
provided in this section:
1. Indiana Department of Transportation 		
(INDOT) 2013 Design Manual Chapter 51
Special Design Elements ‚Äì This document provides
guidance for pedestrian and bicycle facilities that
are included in Department of Transportation
designs. This design manual is used for Wayne
County projects as well.
2. Federal Highway Administration(FHWA) Manual
on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) ‚Äì The
MUTCD is the national standard for signing, markings,
signals, and other traffic control devices. Indiana has
adopted a slightly modified version of the MUTCD,
the Indiana MUTCD. The IMUTCD modifications do not
impact the recommendations in this design guidance
document. It should be noted that the IMUTCD does
provide alternative methods for analyzing the need
for pedestrian signals. Additional school bus warning
signs are also included in the IMUTCD.
3. American Association of State Highway and
Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Guide for the
Development of Bicycle Facilities ‚Äì This document
is intended to present information on how to
accommodate bicycle travel and operations in
most riding environments. It is the design guidance
upon which most state and local design guidelines
are based. In many jurisdictions this document is
considered to set the minimum values for bicycle
facility design.

4. AASHTO Guide for the Planning, Design, and
Operations of Pedestrian Facilities ‚Äì This document
is intended to present information on how to
accommodate pedestrian travel and operations in
(primarily) roadway environments. It is the design
guidance upon which most state and local design
guidelines are based. In many jurisdictions this
document is considered to set the minimum values for
pedestrian design.
5. Institute of Transportation Engineers Designing
Walkable Urban Thoroughfares: A Context
Sensitive Approach ‚Äì This document‚Äôs development
was supported by FHWA. Designing Walkable
Thoroughfares helps designers understand the
flexibility for roadway design that is inherent in the
AASHTO guide A Policy on the Geometric Design of
Highways and Streets with a focus on balancing the
needs of all users.
6. National Association of City Transportation
Officials (NACTO) Urban Bikeway Design Guide
‚Äì FHWA has issued a memo supporting the use
of this document to further develop nonmotorized
transportation networks, particularly in urban areas.
Many of the designs in this document have been used
successfully in urban areas. However, care should be
exercised when applying the treatments described in
this document to suburban or rural areas.
In this guidance section of the City of Richmond
Bicycle and Pedestrian Master Plan the following
facility types are discussed:
‚Ä¢ sidewalks
‚Ä¢ curb ramps
‚Ä¢ midblock crossings
‚Ä¢ bike lanes
‚Ä¢ shared lane markings
‚Ä¢ greenways
‚Ä¢ bike routes
‚Ä¢ cycletracks
‚Ä¢ shared use paths

SIDEWALKS
Chapter 51 of the INDOT Design Manual requires
pedestrian facilities comply with the Americans with
Disabilities Act ‚ÄúAccessibility Guidelines for Buildings
and Facilities‚Äù the most recent of which are the
2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design. FHWA
recommends agencies adopt the guidance found in
the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for Proposed
Accessibility Guidelines for Pedestrian Facilities in
the Public Right-of-Way (July 2011). The below
guidance is consistent with the public right-of-way
guidance.

Sidewalk Width
The preferred minimum sidewalk width is 5 feet.
Under constrained conditions, 4-foot wide sidewalks
are acceptable provided a 5-foot by 5-foot area
with less than 2% cross slope is provided every
200 feet (maximum) to allow for the passing of one
pedestrian using a wheelchair by another. Sidewalks
placed at the back of curb should be at least 6 feet
wide.

Location of Sidewalks
On roadways with curb and gutter, sidewalks
should be located six feet from the back of curb.
This minimizes the encroachment of curb ramps
and driveway cuts into the sidewalk width. On
roadways without curb and gutter, sidewalks should
be separated from the roadway as shown by the
following criteria, which are given in a sequence of
desirability:
‚Ä¢ at or near the right of way line (ideally, 3 feet
of width should be provided behind the sidewalk
for access, construction, and maintenance)
‚Ä¢ outside of the minimum required roadway clear
zone
‚Ä¢ as far from the edge of the driving lane as
practical
Sidewalk alignments, which are set back from the
roadway, should taper for alignment closer to
the roadway at intersections. This will allow for
coordinated placement of crosswalks and stop bars.

Sidewalks may follow the grade of the adjacent
roadway. However, on new structures the grade of
the sidewalk cannot exceed 5%. If a grade of more
than 5% is required on a new structure, an ADA
compliant ramp must be provided.

Curb Ramps and Blended Transitions
A curb ramp is a ramp that cuts through or is built
up to the curb. A blended transition is a relatively
flat area where a sidewalk meets a roadway. Curb
ramps and blended transitions are primarily used
where a sidewalk meets a roadway or driveway at
a pedestrian crossing location. Blended transitions
include raised pedestrian street crossings, depressed
corners, or similar connections between pedestrian
access routes at the level of the sidewalk and the
level of the pedestrian street crossing that have a
grade of 5% or less. Accessibility requirements for
blended transitions serve two primary functions.
First, they must alert pedestrians that have vision
impairments to the fact that they are entering, or
exiting, the vehicular area. Second, they must provide
an accessible route for those using wheelchairs or
other assistive devices. Ideally, a separate ramp
should be provided for each crossing of the roadway.

Curb Ramp Slopes
The slope of a curb ramp shall not exceed 8.33%.
The only exception to this standard is when a
sidewalk is located along a roadway with a
significant slope, in which case the maximum length of
the curb ramp is 15 feet.

Landings
All curb ramps must have a landing at the location
where a wheelchair user would have to turn to
prepare to enter the roadway. For perpendicular
ramps, this means a 4-foot by 4-foot landing at
the top of the ramp (5-foot by 5-foot if there is a
vertical obstruction adjacent to the landing). For
parallel ramps where the sidewalk is depressed, the
4-foot by 4-foot landing is required at the bottom of
the ramp.

Sidewalk Slopes
The maximum cross slope on a sidewalk is 2%. This
maximum cross slope must be maintained across
driveways and crosswalks.

Detectable Warnings

Intersections

Detectable warning surfaces shall extend a minimum
of 2 feet in the direction of pedestrian travel
and shall extend the full width of the curb ramp.
Detectable warning surfaces are not required, nor
desirable, at crossings of residential driveways
since the pedestrian right-of-way continues across
residential driveway aprons. However, where
commercial driveways are provided with yield or
stop control, detectable warnings should be provided
at the junction between the pedestrian and vehicular
routes.

At intersections, bike lanes must be designed to
encourage legal movements at the intersection; this
includes proper positioning of bicyclists and motorists.
Bike lane stripes should be dashed on the approaches to intersections without right turn lanes. Where
there are right-turn lanes, through bike lanes must
be placed to the left of the right turn lane. Section
4.8 of the AASHTO Guide for the Development of
Bicycle Facilities (2012) provides numerous graphics
illustrating bike lane markings at intersections.

BIKE LANES
A bike lane is a portion of the roadway that has
been designated for preferential or exclusive use by
bicyclists by striping, signing and pavement markings
(the MUTCD does not require signs). Bike lanes are
intended for one-way travel, usually in the same
direction as the adjacent travel lane. Bike lanes
should be designed for the operation of bicycles
as vehicles. They should be designed to encourage
bicyclists and motorists to interact in a safe, legal
manner. Bike lanes should be designated with bike
lane markings, arrows, and signs.

Width
The AASHTO Guide for the Development of Bicycle
Facilities provides guidance on the width of bike
lanes. The following points summarize this guidance:
‚Ä¢ under most circumstances the recommended width
for bike lanes is 5 feet
‚Ä¢ for roadways with no curb and gutter and no onstreet parking, the minimum width of a bike lane
is 4 feet
‚Ä¢ along sections of roadway with curb and gutter,
a usable width of 4 feet measured from the
longitudinal joint to the center of the bike lane
line is recommended (this means that 4 feet of
pavement is sufficient when coupled with the
gutter pan; it is also conceivable to interpret
the guidance as meaning that even narrower
pavement can be used as long as a total of 5
feet of rideable surface is maintained)
‚Ä¢ additional width may be desirable on higher
speed roadways.

Bike lanes should be continuous through intersections.
That is, if a bike lane is provided to the intersection,
a receiving bike lane should be provided on departure side of the intersection.

SHARED LANE MARKINGS (SHARROWS)
Traffic lanes are often too narrow to be shared side
by side by bicyclists and passing motorists. Where
parking is present, bicyclists wishing to stay out of
the way of motorists often ride too close to parked
cars and risk being struck by a suddenly opened car
door (being ‚Äúdoored‚Äù). Where no parking is present
bicyclists wishing to stay out of the way of motorists
often ride too close to the roadway edge, where
they run the risks of being run off the road; being
clipped by motorists who do not see them off to the
side or misjudge passing clearance; or encountering
drainage structures, poor pavement, debris, and
other hazards.
Riding further to the left avoids these problems,
and is legally permitted where needed for safety.
However, this practice can run counter to motorist
expectations. A Shared Lane Marking (SLM) is
a pavement symbol that indicates it is legal and
appropriate for bicyclists to ride away from the right
hand edge of the roadway, and cues motorists to
pass with sufficient clearance.
Research suggests that SLMs:
‚Ä¢ alert motorists to the lateral location bicyclists
are likely to occupy within the traveled way
‚Ä¢ encourage safe passing of bicyclists by motorists
‚Ä¢ assist bicyclists with lateral positioning in lanes
that are too narrow for a motor vehicle and a
bicycle to travel side by side within the same
traffic lane

‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢

reduce the incidence of wrong-way bicycling
where on-street parking exists, to align bicyclists
with lateral positioning in a shared lane with onstreet parallel parking to reduce the chances of
a bicyclist impacting the open door of a parked
vehicle

SLMs are not to be used on shoulders or in
designated bike lanes. MUTCD guidance suggests
SLMs not be placed on roadways that have a speed
limit above 35 mph. While this does not preclude the
use of SLMs on higher speed roadways, no research
is available as yet to suggest how effective they may
be on such roadways.
SLMs encourage good lane positioning by bicyclists,
and discourage them from riding too close to the
pavement edge, curb, or parked cars. Riding away
from the road edge allows bicyclists to avoid
road edge hazards like drainage structures, poor
pavement, and debris. It also places the bicyclist
more directly in the motorist‚Äôs field of vision which,
along with proper SLM treatments, encourages the
safe passing of bicyclists by motorists.
Consequently, on roadways with on-street parking,
the MUTCD requires that SLMs be placed with the
centers of the markings at least 11 feet from the
face of curb. On other roadways, the centers of the
markings are required to be placed at least four
feet from the edge of pavement.
SLMs are sometimes used at the ends of bike lanes or
shoulders to inform motorists that bicyclists no longer
have a separate space and will be sharing the main
travel lane.
SLMs should be installed strategically and judiciously
to ensure that their value is not reduced by overuse.
When used, SLMs should be placed after each
intersection and then periodically on spacings not
exceeding 250 feet between markings.

SHARED USE PATHS
Shared use paths are facilities separated from motor
vehicle traffic by an open space or barrier and either
within the highway right-of-way or an independent
right-of-way. They are open to many different user
types and are often used by bicyclists, pedestrians,
skaters, wheelchair users, joggers, and other nonmotorized users. Motor vehicles are not allowed
on shared use paths except for maintenance and
emergency vehicles in specific circumstances. Most
shared use paths are two-way facilities.
Shared use paths have design criteria for many of
the same parameters as roadways. These include
widths, horizontal clearances, design speed,
horizontal alignment, stopping sight distance, cross
slopes, grades, vertical clearance, drainage, and
lighting. The AASHTO Guide for the Development
of Bicycle Facilities should be consulted for design
values.
The MUTCD provides the standards for signing,
striping, and marking shared use paths. In most cases,
the signs and markings use on shared use paths are
smaller versions of those used on roadways.
Many shared use paths are separated from the
roadway network. Consequently, street name signs
should be provided at intersecting roadways to help
users orient themselves to the roadway network.
Wayfinding signs should be used on paths and
to potential destinations along the path such as
locations where users can access water fountains and
restrooms. At trailheads and rest areas, the distance
and direction to the next trail head should be posted.
Most shared use path projects will be paved.
Asphalt and Portland cement concrete are the two
most common surfaces for shared use paths. In
areas where path use is expected to be primarily
recreational, unpaved surfaces may be acceptable
for shared use paths. Materials should be chosen
to ensure the ADA requirements for a firm, stable,
slip resistant surface are met. Even when meeting
ADA criteria, some users such as in-line skaters, kick
scooters, and skateboarders may be unable to use
unpaved shared use paths.

The geometric and operational design of shared use
paths is quite similar to that of roadways. However,
additional considerations such as aesthetics, rest
areas, amenities, and personal security are also
important ensure the maximum number of potential
users is encouraged to use the path for both
utilitarian and recreational purposes.
Sometimes local resistance to implementing shared
use paths and other trail facilities exists because of
perceived potential negative impacts to neighboring
properties, usually in terms of property values and
crime/vandalism. A valuable resource in discussions
of these matters is a summary of national research
conducted for a state department of transportation.
The studies cited collectively suggest that negative
impacts are not an issue in either regard, and in fact
suggests that property values frequently increase
following the construction of shared use paths while
crime rates are sometimes found to decrease.
Shared use paths through floodplains require special
attention to design details. While the cross section
and clearance requirements are the same as other
trails the construction materials should be carefully
chosen and installed to endure inundation by flood
waters. This means special base materials should be
used that are resistant to swelling and erosion. In
Concrete is often selected as a surface material in
flood plains. In addition, adequate cross drains need
to be installed to ensure water does not pond on the
upstream side of the path.
Many shared use paths have been built adjacent to
active rail lines. This requires close coordination with
the railroad. According to America‚Äôs Rails with Trails
(Rails-to-Trails Conservancy 2013), many shared use
path managers require a 25 to 30-foot minimum
setback from the trail to the railroad. However, this
may not be an actual requirement; nearly 60 percent
of shared use paths next to railroads were less than
30 feet from the tracks and more than 40 percent
were less than 20 feet from the tracks. A physical
barrier should be provided between the shared use
paths and the railroad; chain link fences are the most
commonly used type of barrier.

Amenities along Shared Use Paths
Amenities should be provided along shared use paths
to make their use more attractive for transportation
use. Any long shared use paths or path network
needs rest stops. These should be at intermediate
points, scenic lookouts, or near amenities such as
restaurants, convenience stores, picnic areas, or
parking lots. Rest areas should be away from the
path so users can pull off and not block traffic. At
a minimum, they should include benches, shade,
bike parking, and a trash receptacle. Bike parking
racks should support a bike frame in two places and
allow for locking of front and rear wheels. Some
rest stops should include restrooms and potable
water. Additional amenities should included include
interpretive signs and informational kiosks. Bike
repair stations including free air (presta and shrader
valve compatible) and vending machines that
dispense patch kits or tubes can be included at some
trailhead facilities.

Indianapolis Cultural Trail - Cycle Track

CYCLETRACKS

A cycle track is a designated bicycle pathway
separated from pedestrian sidewalks, parking lanes,
and vehicular travel lanes. Cycle tracks can be at
street level or raised and can be designed for one
or two-way traffic. When higher speed streets are
present with few interruptions, raised cycle tracks
are recommended. Raised cycle tracks are also
recommended where multiple travel lanes and high
traffic volumes are present.
Where on-street parking is present, cycle tracks are
located on the sidewalk side of the parking and are
separated from the on-street parking by a buffer a
minimum of three feet wide. Often times, the surface
of the cycle track is visually distinct from surrounding
pavements.

Indianapolis Cultural Trail - Cycle Track

Bicycle symbols and lettering are provided at the
beginning and ends of cycle tracks and at specific
intervals between. In two-way applications ‚ÄúDo
Not Enter‚Äù signs (with EXCEPT BIKES supplemental
plaques) should be posted to minimize confusion and
minimize automobile intrusion onto the cycle track.
Additionally, traffic controls should be installed at
intersections and oriented towards bicyclists traveling
in the contra flow direction.
Where the buffer between cycle tracks and on-street
parking is painted striping, solid white lane markings
should be used with the area of the buffer being
comprised of painted diagonal crosshatch.

INTERN AL MEMORANDUM

To:

Members of the 2012 TIF Study Commission

From:

Brooke Thomas, Senior Planner

CC:

Maury Plambeck, Michael Peoni

Subject:

Tax Increment Financing, Peer Cities Case Study Research

Date:

April 12, 2012

The purpose of this memorandum is to describe initial findings regarding Tax Increment Financing in peer
cities across the Midwest. For the purposes of this research, the following communities are considered to
be peer cities: Columbus, Cincinnati, and Cleveland, Ohio; Kansas City and Saint Louis, Missouri;
Nashville, Tennessee; Charlotte, North Carolina; and Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The following pages review
practices, procedures, and lessons learned in these communities specifically. Additionally, this
memorandum highlights the State of Tax Increment Finance at a national level.
Columbus, Ohio
The City of Columbus, Ohio classifies Tax Increment Financing funds as ‚ÄúDebt Service Funds.‚Äù They are
‚Äúused to account for the accumulation of resources for and payment of general obligation principal,
interest, and related expenditures.‚Äù There are two other Debt Service Funds administered by the city,
they are: Recreation Debt Service Funds, and Capital South Debt Service Funds.
Redevelopment? Economic Development? Both? Both.
Who Approves the TIF? City Council has final approval while the Department of Development initiates
the process.
How they work, generally. There are two types per Ohio Revised Code: 1) Project TIFs, were
established on or before December 14, 2011. They excluded residential uses and all TIF monies had to
directly benefit each parcel. 2) TIF Incentive Districts, which include all property classes, have been in
place since December 13, 2011. TIF Incentive Districts can be used to fund public infrastructure
improvements anywhere within the district, even if the public infrastructure does not directly benefit every
parcel within the district.
All districts, project and incentive, in Columbus are ‚Äúnon-school‚Äù TIFs, meaning that schools get their
money first and then the rest of the increment goes into the applicable TIF fund. All but one of the City‚Äüs
58 TIF Districts have a 30-year lifetime. The city does sell bonds for larger districts and then pay for the
service bonds from the TIF money.
How many do they have? There are 58 districts that have been legislated. There are a few more recent
TIF districts awaiting approval. As a result, there currently isn‚Äüt any money flowing into pending districts.
According to the TIF Manager/Coordinator, Lee Hennick, the vast majority of TIFs in Columbus are
‚Äúwinners.‚Äù There are 5 or 6 of the 58 where development simply never took off. In these instances, the
City will be looking into what to do with the TIF increment that has been collected.
Most recently adopted TIF district? End of 2011.
Any currently pending? Yes. One new one in progress, likely 4 or 5 others later this year (2012).
HoTIFs? This is the same as ‚ÄúTIF Incentive District,‚Äù which does not discriminate between uses.
Overall Benefit? Are these things that would have occurred otherwise? Yes, very beneficial. It is
projected that there will be $3.8B in private investment since 1996 when the first TIF was established:
$2.7B has already been obtained. Because the schools get their money first, this makes nearly everyone
happy, and something gets built/re-built in areas that really need it.

Last Updated: 4/11/2012

Last Updated: 4/11/2012

Lessons learned? According to Mr. Hennick, TIF Districts are not losers: not like Enterprise Zones where
the math doesn‚Äüt always work out as estimated. Because TIF Districts are a function of the assessed
value, there typically is nowhere to go but up. Mr. Hennick explained that the City isn‚Äüt going to lose
money even if they partner on the infrastructure. City of Columbus has had very little opposition to tax
increment financing.

Ohio Revised Code

Cincinnati, Ohio
Tax Increment Financing revenues in Cincinnati are often used to fund public improvements designed to
spur private development. According to city policy, the primary purpose of Tax Increment Financing is to
‚Äúprovide an incentive for commercial and residential developers to construct projects that will provide
economic growth in the City.‚Äù
Redevelopment? Economic Development? Both? TIF is used for economic and community
development. According to the City‚Äüs website, projects must meet one or more of the following
objectives: job creation; public improvements in support of economic and/or community development;
increase in tax base; urban redevelopment; creation of homeownership units; rehabilitated housing units;
create/support neighborhood retail and commercial opportunities; use of green building techniques to
LEED standards; and/or the removal of slum/blight.
Who Approves the TIF? City Council.
How they work, generally. In general, tax increment financing is one financing option that may be used
to facilitate a public purpose and alleviate a defined financial need. It is not viewed as a developer
entitlement. In addition to creating districts, the City Council may specially approve a private development
to use TIF funding of a related public improvement in areas outside of designated TIF districts. In this
case, TIF funds are available only in the amount of future increased tax revenues that can be expected as
a result of the private investment. These are ‚ÄúTIF Economic Development Projects‚Äù (versus TIF Districts).
According to Bill Fischer, Interim Economic Development Director, the Economic Development
Department handles all non-residential or mixed-use TIF, and the Community Development Department
handles all residential TIF.
How many do they have? 20
Most recently adopted TIF district? 2005 (second group). The first group was created in 2003.
Any currently pending? No, according to Mr. Fischer, a change in legislation to the method school
districts are funded when there is a TIF district makes new TIF districts no longer very useful in
[Cincinnati].
HoTIFs? The City of Cincinnati does not distinguish between housing and economic development TIF
districts. State law allows specific uses of the funding for each type of development. Within a district
projects are funded based on priority. Local ordinances direct the administration to use the majority of the
funding (75%) toward economic development.
Overall Benefit? Are these things that would have occurred otherwise? Yes, but of the 20 districts
only about 5 or 6 actually produce enough revenue to allow significant redevelopment. However, in those
5 or 6 districts, major projects have occurred that would not have been able to be financed using
conventional methods.
Lessons learned? None given

TIF Districts Policy

Cleveland, Ohio
While the City of Cleveland, Ohio considers Tax Increment Financing as an ‚Äúeconomic development tool
that allows a municipality to re-direct new incremental real-property taxes on large scale projects,‚Äù and
although they have two TIF districts, according to their Director of Economic Development, Tracey
Nichols, Cleveland ‚Äúdoes not use TIF districts.‚Äù
Ms. Nichols explained that there were two TIF districts/projects completed during a prior administration,
adding that the TIF districts/projects were in support of a downtown project. However, that was over six
years ago. They are currently very short staffed - to the extent that there is no one in their office that
worked on the existing TIF districts/projects. As a result, there is no one with specific knowledge about
TIF Districts in the City of Cleveland.
Redevelopment? Economic Development? Both? Neither, currently.
Who Approves the TIF? City Council. The city‚Äüs Economic Development and Technology Team in the
Department of Economic Development would have been the administrator of this development incentive.
How they work, generally. They do not use them currently, nor does anyone at the Department have
institutional knowledge of how they work.
How many do they have? Two, which were completed by a previous administration for downtown
project support.
Most recently adopted TIF district? There hasn‚Äüt been a TIF created in over six years.
Any currently pending? None.
HoTIFs? Unknown.
Overall Benefit? Are these things that would have occurred otherwise? Unknown.
Lessons learned? Unknown.

Kansas City, Missouri
The City of Kansas City, Missouri considers Tax Increment Financing to be a ‚Äúfinancing and development
tool that allows future real property taxes and other taxes generated by new development to pay for costs
of construction of public infrastructure and other improvements.‚Äù Furthermore, ‚ÄúTIF encourages
development of blighted, substandard and economically underutilized areas that would not be developed
without public assistance.‚Äù ‚ÄúTIF can only be used for redevelopment projects that would not be
reasonably expected to occur without the assistance of TIF (the ‚Äûbut for‚Äü test.)‚Äù
Redevelopment? Economic Development? Both? Both. Area types include: blight, conservation, and
economic development.
Who Approves the TIF? TIF Commission and City Council.
How they work, generally. Property taxes are frozen for up to 23 years. Increases in city and county
taxes due to new construction, rehabilitation and infrastructure improvements from the project are abated
for up to 23 years. Property owners make PILOTS (Payments in Lieu of Taxes) for the amount of the
taxes abated, to a special allocation fund as well as 50% of all local Economic Activity Taxes (EATs)
generated within the project area. EATS include sales, utility, and earnings taxes. These funds are used
to reimburse the developer for approved project costs. Any overages in PILOTS are reallocated to the
appropriate taxing districts.

Saint Louis, Missouri
The City of Saint Louis, Missouri considers Tax Increment Financing as a ‚Äúdevelopment tool designed to
help finance certain eligible improvements to property in designated redevelopment areas (TIF Districts)
by utilizing the new, or incremental, tax revenues generated by the project after completion.‚Äù
Redevelopment? Economic Development? Both? Being that the City of Saint Louis (unlike the
surrounding county) has no virgin land, everything is focused on redevelopment with the hopes that
economic development will result from the redevelopment effort.
Who Approves the TIF? Everything originates with the TIF Commission (7 members: 5 appointed by the
Mayor, 1 by the School District, 1 representing all other taxing districts), which then makes a
1
recommendation to the Board of Aldermen for the ultimate decision.
How they work, generally. Property taxes within a TIF District are frozen for up to 23 years, the property
owners then make Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILOTS) to a special allocation fund. Additionally, 50% of
any new local Economic Activity Taxes (EATS) is captured resulting in local sales taxes, earnings, and
payroll taxes to be paid into the special allocation fund. The proceeds of the special allocation fund are
then used to reimburse the developer for eligible project costs or to retire indebtedness incurred to cover
those costs.
While Kansas City uses TIF primarily for multi-property TIF Districts, St. Louis uses TIF almost exclusively
for single-buildings.
How many do they have? The City of Saint Louis has 135 TIFs; however, only a few of these are of the
multi-property type.
Most recently adopted TIF district? 2011. They do some every year; during the 80s and 90s they
would do as many as 30 each year.
Any currently pending? There are two pending.
HoTIFs? Yes. Unlike non-residential TIFs (which capture all real estate increment, and half of the
earnings, half of sales, half of utility increment) residential TIFs only capture the real estate increment.
Overall Benefit? Are these things that would have occurred otherwise? According to Dale Ruthsatz,
2
Director of Commercial Development, the overall benefit is great. Not a lot of controversy in the City ‚Äì
because there are so few (franchise) retail establishments within the city limits. If a retail establishment
wanted to locate in the city limits, no one would accuse them of stealing from the surrounding suburbs.
Lessons learned? The City has a goal of never contributing more than 15% of the total project costs to
the TIF. They do not want to over commit to any one TIF fund. According to Mr. Ruthsatz, they are really
diligent about applying the ‚Äúbut for‚Äù test. Many of their projects layer incentive upon incentive (e.g. TIF +
historic tax credit + etc.), which they are happy with; they just recognize that some communities might not
be as accepting of this practice. Often this layering of incentives results in a project that doesn‚Äüt have that
much equity in it - a developers dream. From an outsider‚Äüs viewpoint, they understand that it may be

The law making body of the City of St. Louis is the Board of Aldermen. There are twenty-eight aldermen, one from each ward in the City and a President.
There are 92 suburban communities in Saint Louis County, and most of the TIF districts outside of the city limits are stand-alone retail. There is a great deal of concern that
if one suburban municipality approves a TIF for a big box retailer, that the same big box retailer will simply move from one suburb to the next. There is a lot of controversy
related to this: cannibalization. The City of Saint Louis doesn‚Äüt have a lot of stand-alone retail, but they do have some mixed-use which tend to have mom and pop retail
establishments versus large chains.

seen as ‚Äúoverdoing it.‚Äù However, they have found that this is one way to make old buildings/underutilized
properties competitive with undeveloped land. It is also beneficial in overcoming the financial hurdle of
assembling land in an urbanized area.

Nashville, Tennessee
In Nashville, Tennessee, TIF is a ‚Äúfinancing mechanism authorized by state law whereby the increased
tax revenue generated by a development is used to pay the debt service on bonds issued for the
construction of the project, which bonds are typically purchased by private financial institutions.‚Äù
Redevelopment? Economic Development? Both? By law, they are for redevelopment only.
Economic development is considered a by-product. Redevelopment areas must be blighted
areas where ‚Äúblight‚Äù means extreme dilapidation. This is somewhat limiting in terms of moving
forward with TIF.
Who Approves the TIF? Projects originate with the Housing Authority, and then they are
authorized by Metro Council (which has 40 members).
How they work, generally. ‚ÄúThe Metropolitan Government is essentially giving up its right to the
future increased tax revenues generated by the facility for as long as the TIF is outstanding, or up
to 30 years, whichever occurs first.‚Äù Because each project is independent, they can estimate 10%
of the project cost for TIF allocation. They do not issue bonds. Instead, developers have to get
traditional loans through a financial institution. The developer negotiates the loan and is the
insurer. The City‚Äüs only obligation to the loan is to pass on the incremental taxes when paid.
There is no liability on the part of the city otherwise: they act as a fiduciary agent of sorts. Mr.
Cain considers this approach to TIF to be ‚Äúvery conservative.‚Äù He added that the State
Legislature is peculiar, and that they are still tweaking the legislation in response to the Kelo
3
Decision .
How many do they have? The City of Nashville has 10 TIF Districts; the majority of which are in
the Central Business District ‚Äì by design. Of these, only eight have TIF funds remaining. In
Nashville, once the intended public infrastructure projects are complete and all debts have been
paid, the TIF increment is dispersed to the applicable taxing agencies and all that remains under
the control of the Housing Authority is the control of the uses within the TIF, for the duration of the
TIF.
Most recently adopted TIF district? 2008.
Any currently pending? Not at this time. According to Mr. Cain, they currently have their hands
full with what they have.
HoTIFs? According to Mr. Cain, the city has had ‚Äúhuge success‚Äù with respect to housing
redevelopment using tax increment financing. A market study done eight years ago launched a
residential boom in the downtown. Including affordable housing.
Overall Benefit? Are these things that would have occurred otherwise? Again, according to
Mr. Cain, they have been ‚Äúvery successful.‚Äù TIF is not an entitlement. Pro forma‚Äüs are reviewed
and the community benefit is measured for reasonableness. They will also pause and take a look
at what downtown needs at the point in time when a district/project is proposed. For example,
would a proposed hotel benefit the brand new convention center?
Lessons learned? According to Mr. Cain, the most valuable thing is finding a way to take the
citizens‚Äü risk out of it, thereby protecting the public‚Äüs interest. He also feels it is important not to
dilute the incentive by having so many TIF districts that they begin cannibalizing each other. For
comparison purposes, the City of Chicago has over 120 TIF Districts which together account for
3 Kelo v. City of New London was decided by the U.S. Supreme Court involving the use of eminent domain to transfer land from one private owner to another to further
economic development. Privately owned real property can be used as part of a comprehensive redevelopment plan resulting in job creation and increased tax revenues.
The findings stated that the general benefits a community enjoys from economic growth qualified the City‚Äüs redevelopment plan as a permissible public use under the
Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment.

nearly 30% of the city‚Äüs land area. He stresses that a city‚Äüs job should be to figure out where it
really wants redevelopment and economic development to occur: what areas, not what parcels.
He would advise that city leaders look at the big picture and answer the question, ‚Äúwhere is the
biggest problem/opportunity?‚Äù and focus TIF efforts there. He further suggests that a city find
some other way to do ‚Äúone-off‚Äù projects that have no greater public purpose.

Milwaukee, Wisconsin
According to the City‚Äüs website, Tax Increment Finance is an economic development tool to ‚Äúleverage
private development investment.‚Äù It is a tool that has been available to municipalities since 1975 when
the state legislature authorized the use of TIF as a ‚Äúredevelopment vehicle for cash-strapped
municipalities.‚Äù
Redevelopment? Economic Development? Both? TIF districts have been used for both
economic development and redevelopment.
Who Approves the TIF? The creation of a TIF must be approved by both Milwaukee Common
Council and the Joint Review Board, which consists of representatives of the five taxing
jurisdictions that share the property tax (City of Milwaukee, Milwaukee County, Milwaukee Area
Technical College, Milwaukee Public Schools, Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District). First,
the project receives a hearing before the Joint Review Board. After an initial hearing before the
Joint Review Board, the Redevelopment Authority of the City of Milwaukee holds a public hearing
on the TIF project and votes on the project. Next, the Milwaukee Common Council‚Äüs Zoning &
Neighborhood Development Committee holds a hearing on the TIF project. Once adopted by the
Committee, the project is either approved or rejected by the full Common Council. Upon adoption
by the Common Council, the Joint Review Board makes a final recommendation on the project
and it is forwarded to the Mayor for his/her ultimate approval.
How they work, generally. Once the TIF project receives appropriate approvals, local
assessors and the State of Wisconsin Department of Revenue determine a ‚Äúbase value‚Äù for all
the property in the district. Any incremental assessed value is used to pay off the city‚Äüs upfront
investments in the district, with interest. State statute allows 27 years to pay off all TIF costs; the
average payback period in the City of Milwaukee is approximately 15 years.
How many do they have? Milwaukee has created 76 TIF Districts since the State of Wisconsin
adopted TIF-enabling legislation. Forty-six are still active ‚Äì that is, increment from the
development is still being collected and applied to repay bonds issued to pay for TIF-financed
activity. (Summaries of all TIF activities can be found at
http://city.milwaukee.gov/MilwaukeeTIDprojectsummaries.htm)
Most recently adopted TIF district? The last new TIF was created in 2010. The city had
several TIF amendments in 2011.
Any currently pending? No. However, Martha Brown, Deputy Commissioner, expects either
new TIFs or TIF amendments this year (2012).
HoTIFs? The City of Milwaukee has used TIF to provide infrastructure development to create
several central city subdivisions. The first of these, City Homes, provided infrastructure funding
(streets, streetlights, new sewer and water, etc.) as well as funds to write down sales prices for
the initial new homes built in the subdivision and to build a loan fund for low-cost home
improvement financing for nearby existing properties. According to Ms. Brown, this was an
extremely successful project. The second, Lindsay Heights, was a partnership between the City
and the state‚Äüs housing finance authority, and involved building infill homes in a neighborhood
with many City-owned vacant lots. Again according to Ms. Brown, that one also was very
successful. The City subsequently developed two more subdivisions, using TIF for infrastructure.
Unfortunately, the timing was lousy on those two ‚Äì both were implemented during the recession,
and so far only model homes have been developed and sold. While the city served as the

6

Last Updated: 4/11/2012

developer for City Homes, the other two subdivisions were done as partnerships with private
developers, where the city is currently negotiating to take back the property. Ms. Brown
anticipates that these subdivisions will be built out as the new home market strengthens.
Overall Benefit? Are these things that would have occurred otherwise? According to Ms.
Brown, the use of TIF has been a powerful tool for a very wide variety of development activity
within Milwaukee. TIF revenues have supported the creation of industrial parks, central city
subdivisions, retail complexes, corporate headquarters, office buildings, cultural facilities and the
Riverwalk. ‚ÄúThere is no question the development, redevelopment, brownfields reclamation and
job growth have all occurred as a result of TIF. It is the city‚Äüs most significant tool to finance
large-scale development.‚Äù
Lessons learned? According to Ms. Brown, 1) every deal is different. Because of this,
Milwaukee has chosen to administer its TIF under some pretty broad guidelines, rather than
having strict rules about what can be considered for TIF. They‚Äüve done some pretty creative
things; the best have involved public-private partnerships. 2) A municipality needs first-rate
expertise to do the financial analysis and structure TIF deals. Ms. Brown says that, ‚Äúthey have an
outstanding internal staff, and they also have a long-standing relationship with a third-party
consultant who is involved in evaluation and structuring of larger projects involving TIF. They
bring that consultant into conversations with developers, and have found that to be extremely
helpful. In addition, staff in the Office of the Comptroller have developed significant expertise in
TIF, and does its own independent analysis when they bring a deal forward for Common Council
approval.‚Äù

Charlotte, North Carolina
The City of Charlotte (and Mecklenburg County) uses what is called Synthetic Tax Increment Grants as a
public/private partnership tool to advance economic development and land use planning goals. Neither
the City of Charlotte, nor Mecklenburg County issues debt or backs debt through the STIG tool. It is not a
traditional TIF tool as usually thought of and requires no TIF Authority or other additional oversight. It has
no impact on debt ratings. It is simply a reimbursement tool for infrastructure or other public benefits
constructed by the developer, who must secure all financing privately. The source of the reimbursement
is a percentage of actual, incremental taxes paid by the developer. The developer bears all risk in the
application of this tool.
Redevelopment? Economic Development? Both? Both. All STIG‚Äüs are project-based
inclusive of all parcels related to project. The City typically funds infrastructure (mostly roads) for
the projects in meeting public purpose and provides the framework for further development.
Who Approves the STIG? City Council and County Commission approve projects, although
Mecklenburg County does not participate in all STIG projects.
How they work, generally. Synthetic TIG does not require the designation of a district as
required by self-financing bonds and utilizes locally approved funds, which is repaid by 90% or
45% of the incremental property tax growth generated by the development. All are project-based.
The total amount of STIG awards cannot exceed 3% of the annual property tax levy in any given
year. The STIG projects meet and exceed incremental tax projections, but the economy has
slowed progress of related retail, office, and residential components of projects.
How many do they have? 11
Most recently adopted STIG? The last STIG project was approved by City Council in
September 2011 for infrastructure improvements.
Any currently pending? No new projects currently pending. However, three existing STIGs are
being repositioned for Council approval, due to the real estate market.

HoTIFs? The city has no housing STIG‚Äüs; they finance affordable housing with bonds and a
special Innovative Housing Fund.
Overall Benefit? Are these things that would have occurred otherwise? Redevelopment &
job growth opportunities have been very successful with the use of STIG financing. Tax values of
projects, when built out, are typically 10x the baseline in the first five years. However, half of the
city‚Äüs eleven projects have been stalled by the economy.
Lessons learned? A.C. Shull with the City‚Äüs Economic Development Department has found that
the timeframe for most projects, especially infrastructure funding, is extended in a depressed
economy. Developers will not build roads until financing and retail /office/ residential construction
is feasible within the market. For the projects that have stalled, a new development plan will be
presented by the developers, and a new agreement negotiated with the City. Generally speaking,
the project based STIG‚Äüs do create a major catalyst impact outside the project geography with
new investment and jobs.

STIF Guidelines (electronic copy)

Nationally
The Council of Development Finance Agencies (CDFA) has assembled the enabling legislation, as well
as other information, for Tax Increment Financing in 49 states and the District of Columbia. Arizona
currently does not provide for Tax Increment Financing. The Council‚Äüs state statute collection is part of
CDFAs research and resource development for the Tax Increment Finance Coalition (TIFC), a CDFA
program dedicated to sound practices, education and information sharing in tax increment financing.
The table on the following pages details state TIF legislation for the State of Indiana, and the five states
discussed herein.
In CDFAs State-by-State Report, they explain that a lot of states are making, or are considering,
amendments to their existing state enabling legislation to make flexibility and address concerns. The
focus of these changes includes the following:
‚ÄúHow much taxes can be captured, and from whom?‚Äù For example, In Nebraska up to 100%
(rural) and 50% (urban) can be captured currently, and they are preparing legislation to ratchet it
down to be a maximum of 7% everywhere. Some are excluding school taxes.
Relaxing eligibility criteria (e.g. blight, distress, economic development), and expanding upon
uses (e.g. affordable housing), so that TIF may be used in instances other than extreme
dilapidation;
How to better define TIF district boundaries when considering single projects, redevelopment
areas, or mutli-use projects; and
Longer duration limits, most likely the result of a downturn in the economy.

Virtually all academic and other material suggests that tax increment financing started in California; however data used to compile this comparison table suggests otherwise. Klemanski and others have discounted the earliest usage of tax increment
financing, which dates back to the 1940s, and instead defer to the 1950s when tax increment financing first gained widespread usage. It became even more popular during the 1970s and 1980s as federal funding for local projects decreased.
