59.1.01 PURPOSE
The purpose of this Chapter is to establish minimum stormwater management
requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health, safety,
and welfare of the public residing in watersheds within this jurisdiction by:
minimizing increases in stormwater runoff from any development in order to
reduce flooding, siltation, increases in stream temperature, and streambank
erosion; minimizing increases in nonpoint source pollution caused by stormwater
runoff from development which would otherwise degrade local water quality;
minimizing the total annual volume of surface water runoff which flows from any
specific site during and following development to not exceed the predevelopment hydrologic regime to the maximum extent practicable; and reducing
stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution,
wherever possible, through stormwater management controls and to ensure that
these management controls are properly maintained and pose no threat to public
safety. The City of Richmond has produced a Stormwater Development Manual
as a guide to meet the purpose stated above.

59.1.02 AUTHORITY
This Chapter is adopted under the authority granted by Indiana Code 36-1-4-11,

of this Chapter should be considered minimum requirements, and where any
provision of this Chapter imposes restrictions different from those imposed by
any other Chapter, rule or regulation, or other provision of law, whichever
provisions are more restrictive or impose higher protective standards for human
health or the environment shall be considered to take precedence.

measures similar to or the same as those outlined in the “City of Richmond –
Stormwater Development Manual”, “Field Office Technical Guide of the USDA
Natural Resources Conservation Services” and the “Indiana Stormwater Quality
Manual,” published by IDNR, upon availability.
59.1.09
GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
CONSTRUCTION STORMWATER RUNOFF

FOR

CONTROL

OF

POST

(a) All sites shall develop a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan. The
plan must include: a description of potential pollutant sources from the
proposed land use, that may reasonably be expected to add a significant
amount of pollutants to stormwater discharge; location, dimensions,
detailed specifications, and construction details of all post construction
stormwater quality measures; a description of measures that will be
installed to control pollutants in stormwater discharges that will occur after

construction activities have been completed; a sequence describing when
each post construction stormwater quality measure will be installed; and a
narrative description of the maintenance guidelines for all post
construction stormwater quality measures to facilitate their proper long
term function.
(b) All site designs shall establish stormwater management practices to
control the peak flow rates of stormwater discharge associated with
specified design storms and reduce the generation of stormwater. These
practices should seek to utilize swales and natural depressions as site
conditions allow, utilize pervious areas for stormwater treatment and to
infiltrate stormwater runoff generated from driveways, sidewalks, rooftops,
parking lots, and landscaped areas to the maximum extent practical to
provide treatment for both water quality and quantity.
(c) All stormwater runoff generated from new development shall not
discharge untreated stormwater directly into a jurisdictional wetland or
local water body without adequate treatment. Where such discharges are
proposed, the impact of the proposal on wetland functional values shall be
assessed using a method acceptable to the City. In no case shall the
impact on functional values be any less than allowed by the Army Corp of
Engineers (ACE) or the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (IDNR).
(d) All sites shall preserve buffer strips and riparian zones, create filter
strips, minimize land disturbance, minimize surface imperviousness,
minimize directly connected impervious areas, maximize open space,
direct growth away from sensitive areas and toward areas that can
support it without compromising water quality, have storage, have
infiltration, in any combination, where appropriate to reduce the impact of
pollutants in stormwater run-off on receiving waters.
(e) Infiltration practices will not be allowed in wellhead protection areas.
(f) Discharges from an MS4 area will not be allowed directly into sinkholes
or fractured bedrock without treatment that results in the discharge
meeting Indiana ground water quality standards as referenced in 327 IAC
2-11.
(g) Any stormwater practice that is a Class V injection well must ensure
that the discharge from such practices meets Indiana ground water quality
standards as referenced in 327 IAC 2-11.
(h) As site conditions allow, the rate at which water flows through the MS4
conveyances shall be regulated to reduce outfall scouring and stream
bank erosion. Where necessary, channel protection shall be provided to
protect stream channels from degradation.

(i) As site conditions allow, a vegetated filter strip of appropriate width
shall be maintained along unvegetated swales and ditches.
(j) New retail gasoline outlets, new municipal, state, federal, or
institutional refueling areas, or outlets and refueling areas that replace
their existing tank systems shall be required to design and install
appropriate practices to reduce lead, copper, zinc, and polyaromatic
hydrocarbons in stormwater run-off.
(k) Stormwater discharges to critical areas with sensitive resources (i.e.,
wellhead protection areas, cold water fisheries, shellfish beds, swimming
beaches, recreational waters, recharge areas, water supply reservoirs)
may be subject to additional performance criteria, or may need to utilize or
restrict certain stormwater management practices.
(l) Certain industrial sites are required to prepare and implement a
stormwater pollution prevention plan in accordance with 327 IAC 15-6,
and shall file a notice of intent (NOI) under the provisions of the National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) general permit. The
stormwater pollution prevention plan requirement applies to both existing
and new industrial sites.
(l) Stormwater discharges from land uses or activities with higher potential
pollutant loadings, known as “hotspots”, may require the use of specific
structural stormwater treatment practices and pollution prevention
practices.
(m) All stormwater management practices shall have a landscaping plan
detailing both the vegetation to be in the practice and how and who will
manage and maintain this vegetation.
59.1.10 MAINTENANCE OF STORMWATER RUNOFF CONTROL MEASURES
(a) Maintenance Easement
Prior to the issuance of any permit that has a stormwater management
facility as one of the requirements of the permit, the applicant or owner of
the site shall execute a maintenance easement agreement that shall be
binding on all subsequent owners of land served by the stormwater
management facility. The agreement shall provide for access to the facility
at reasonable times for periodic inspection by the City, or their contractor
or agent, and for regular or special assessments of property owners to
ensure that the facility is maintained in proper working condition to meet
design standards and any other provisions established by this Chapter.
The easement agreement shall be recorded by the Applicant in the Wayne

County Recorder’s Office. The applicant shall provide a copy of the
recorded easement to the City Engineer’s office.
(b) Maintenance Covenants
Maintenance of all stormwater management facilities shall be ensured
through the creation of a formal maintenance covenant that shall be
approved by the City and recorded in the Wayne County Recorder’s Office
prior to final plan approval. As part of the covenant, a schedule shall be
developed for when and how often maintenance will occur to ensure
proper function of the stormwater management facility. The covenant shall
also include plans for periodic inspections to ensure proper performance
of the facility between scheduled cleanouts.
(c) Requirements for Maintenance Covenants
All stormwater management facilities shall undergo, at the minimum, an
annual inspection to document maintenance and repair needs and ensure
compliance with the requirements of this Chapter and accomplishment of
its purposes. These needs may include; removal of silt, litter and other
debris from all catch basins, inlets and drainage pipes, grass cutting and
vegetation removal, and necessary replacement of landscape vegetation.
Any maintenance needs found shall be addressed in a timely manner, as
determined by the City, and the inspection and maintenance requirement
may be increased as deemed necessary to ensure proper functioning of
the stormwater management facility.
(d) Failure to Maintain Practices
If a responsible party, after receiving notice from the City in which the
responsible party is given ten (10) days to meet the requirements of the
maintenance covenant, fails or refuses to meet the requirements of the
maintenance covenant, the City may correct a violation of the design
standards or maintenance needs by performing all necessary work to
place the facility in proper working condition.
In the event that the stormwater management facility becomes an
immediate danger to the public health, safety, economic impact or general
welfare of the City, the City has the right to immediately effect
maintenance and repair of the facility for the sole purpose of protecting the
public health, safety, economic impact or general welfare of the City.
The City may assess the owner(s) of the stormwater management facility
for the cost of repair work and any penalties; and the cost of such work
and any penalties shall be a lien on the property or prorated against the

beneficial uses of the property. An appeal may be taken to the Board of
Works for the cost of the lien.

59.1.11 PERMIT APPLICATION, STORMWATER POLLUTION PREVENTION
PLAN, AND PERMIT ISSUANCE
No person shall begin a land-disturbing activity or redevelopment subject to this
Chapter without first receiving a permit. An application should be made after the
initial coordination meeting with the City. By submitting an application, the
applicant is implying that the City has been given permission to enter the site to
obtain information required for review of the stormwater pollution prevention plan.
This permit is in addition to a General Stormwater Permit (Rule 5) required under
327 IAC 15-5, as required.
(a) Content of Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan
At a minimum, the Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan shall include a
project narrative, a vicinity map, construction plans and calculations. A

shall issue a stop work order pursuant to the provisions of IC 36-1-4-11
and IC 36-1-6-2.
(b) Post Construction Inspection
Inspection programs may be established on any reasonable basis,
including but not limited to: routine inspections; random inspections;
inspections based upon complaints or other notice of possible violations;
inspection of drainage basins or areas identified as higher than typical
sources of sediment or other contaminants or pollutants; inspections of
businesses or industries of a type associated with higher than usual
discharges of contaminants or pollutants or with discharges of a type
which are more likely than the typical discharge to cause violations of
state or federal water or sediment quality standards or the NPDES
stormwater permit; and joint inspections with other agencies inspecting
under environmental or safety laws. Inspections may include, but are not
limited to: reviewing maintenance and repair records; sampling
discharges, surface water, groundwater, and material or water in drainage
control facilities; and evaluating the condition of drainage control facilities
and other stormwater treatment practices.
Persons receiving a notice of violation may be required to halt all
operational activities. This “cease and desist order” will be in effect until
the City confirms that the operational activity is in compliance and the
violation has been satisfactorily addressed. Failure to address a notice of
violation in a timely manner can result in civil or monetary penalties in
accordance with the enforcement measures authorized in this Ordinance.
(c) Right-of-Entry for Inspection
When any new stormwater management facility is installed on private
property, or when any new connection is made between private property
and a public stormwater management facility, the property owner shall
grant to the City the right to enter the property at reasonable times and in
a reasonable manner for the purpose of inspection. This also includes the
right to enter a property when it has a reasonable basis to believe that a
violation of this Chapter is occurring or has occurred, and to enter when

necessary for abatement of a public nuisance or correction of a violation of
this Chapter.
59.1.13 PROPER CREDENTIAL OR IDENTIFICATION REQUIRED
The City shall present proper credentials or identification before entering upon
the property of the person.
59.1.14 ENFORCEMENT
Prior to the imposition of a fine, the intent of the City in enforcement of this
ordinance is, wherever possible, to work with and communicate with the person
doing the land disturbing activities.
(a) Stop Work Order
(1) The City shall post a stop work order if:
a) Any non-complying land-disturbing activity regulated under this
Chapter is being undertaken.
b) The post construction stormwater plan is not being implemented
in good faith; or
c) The conditions of the permit are not being met.
(2)

Upon appeal to the City’s Board of Public Works, a stop
work order or the revocation may be retracted or modified.
(3) Ten days after posting a stop work order, the City may issue a
notice of intent to the violator stating that 14 days after issuing the
notice of intent the City will use the surety bond to perform the work
necessary to provide compliance with this Chapter.
(4) If, within five days after the expiration of the 14 day period, in
subsection (3) above, a permit holder does not comply with the
erosion and sediment control plan or permit conditions, the City
shall revoke the permit.
(5) Administrative Fines
(a) When the City finds that a person has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this Chapter, the City may impose an
administrative fine against such person in an amount not to exceed
$2,500.00 on a per violation, per day basis, plus any administrative
or remediation costs.

(b) Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or
a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the person.
(6) Compliance with the provisions of this Chapter also may be
enforced by injunction.
(b)

Cease and Desist Orders

(1) When the City finds that a person has violated, or continues to
violate, or that City determines that there is a danger to the public
health, safety, welfare or economic impact, the City may issue an
order to the person directing it to cease and desist all such
violations and directing the person to:
a)

Immediately comply with all requirements; and

b)

Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may
be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened
violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the
discharge.

c)

Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar
against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against
person.

59.1.15 PROJECT TERMINATION
An orderly and timely termination of a project with land-disturbing activities
should be planned between all persons involved with a site.
(a) Prior to final land grading, seeding, and mulching, the person holding
the permit should petition the City, in writing, to obtain or allow the
installation of any remaining utility lines on the site. Those persons
involved in the installation of utility lines shall perform their work promptly
to minimize the time period during which some of the land may be left in a
relatively unprotected state. After the utility lines have been installed, the
person holding the permit shall promptly complete all stormwater
management activities.
(b) When a project has been completed, the person holding the permit
shall petition, in writing, the City for approval of stormwater management
measures which are to remain on the site to evaluate the adequacy of
these control measures. The person with local approval shall submit “as
built” drawings with their petition. If “as built” drawings are not submitted
with the petition, the petition will not be accepted.

(1) If the stormwater management measures are approved, any
surety bonds and/or letters of credit shall be released forthrightly.
However, maintenance responsibilities as set forth in Section
59.1.10 shall remain with the person owning the land.
(2) If the stormwater management measures are not approved
because they are not in line with either the stormwater pollution
prevention plan or the General Principles of this Chapter, the City
shall notify, in writing, the person holding the permit of
unacceptable features. After a minimum period of two weeks
during which corrective measures are taken, a petition, again in
writing, may be sent asking the City to evaluate the adequacy of the
stormwater management measures. If, in good faith, the City again
decides that the stormwater management measures are
inadequate, the City may delay the release of any surety bonds
and/or letters of credit for up to two months. After an agreed upon
time period of two months or longer has lapsed without corrective
measures being taken, the City may use the surety bonds to
finance changes or additions to the stormwater management
measures needed to complete the project.
59.1.16 VIOLATIONS DEEMED A PUBLIC NUISANCE
In addition to the enforcement process and penalties provided, any condition
caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of the Chapter is
a threat to public health, safety, and welfare, and is declared and deemed a
nuisance, and may be summarily abated or restored at the violator’s expense,
and/or a civil action to abate, enjoin or otherwise compel the cessation of such
nuisance may be taken.
59.1.17 JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES
(a) Injunctive Relief
When the City finds that a person has violated, or continues to violate, any
provision of this Chapter, an NPDES permit, or order issued hereunder, or
any other standard or requirement, the City may petition through any court
of general jurisdiction within Wayne County, for the issuance of a
temporary or permanent injunction. The City may also seek such other
action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a
requirement for the person to conduct environmental remediation. A
petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for,
taking any other action against a person.

(b) Civil Penalties
A person who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this
Chapter, or order issued hereunder, or any other standard or requirement
shall also be liable to the City for a total maximum civil penalty and
administrative fines of $2,500.00 per violation, per day. Penalties and
fines shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation.
(c) The City may recover reasonable attorney’s fees, court costs, and
other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling
and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by
the City.
(d) In determining the amount of civil liability, the Court shall take into
account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent
of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the
violation, any economic benefit gained through the person’s violation,
corrective actions by the person, the compliance history of the person, and
any other factor as justice requires.
(e) Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite, for taking any other action against a person.

59.1.18 REMEDIES NOT EXCLUSIVE
The remedies listed in this Chapter are not exclusive of any other remedies
available under any applicable federal, state or local law and it is within the

105.13 BOND REQUIRED
The Board of Public Works and Safety may require a performance bond to be filed
along with each application for a commercial driveway with an amount to equal the
estimated cost of that part of the project on the public right-of-way. The Board may also
require adequate bond to be filed in any non-commercial application. Such bonds are
required to insure compliance with all terms of the permit and shall, in the case of noncompliance, provide in addition to any damages suffered thereby, all witness and court
costs in collecting the same, together with any attorney’s fees, professional engineer’s
fees or land surveyors’ fees reasonably due, and shall be released only when the work
described on the permit has been completed to the satisfaction of the Board.
105.14 MEDIAN OPENINGS (CROSSOVERS) - LOCATION
Permits for private or commercial crossovers will not be approved unless the distance
to the nearest existing crossover is in excess of four hundred (400) feet, unless the
applicant can prove to the satisfaction of the board that the location of the crossover will
not be detrimental to the safety of the traveling public.
105.15 DRIVEWAY STANDARDS
Included in Standard Details of the City of Richmond are the most common examples of
driveways and approaches. These standards will apply in majority of cases because
many conditions can be derived from each figure. However, there will be exceptional
situations and borderline cases where the standards and guides do not apply. In such
instances, interim standards will be used. The next lowest functional type will serve as
the interim dimensions for each functional type (i.e., the interim dimensions for arterials
are the dimensions for collectors). The use of interim dimensions will be subject to the
approval of the Richmond City Engineer and such approval should precede the actual
filing of permit application. Additional standards which will be required are as follows:
(a)

Entrance and exit only driveways

This type of drive way is not highly recommended for a divided roadway.
However, the entrance and exit driveways do have a purpose and when
warranted use the following dimensions:
Minimum Width = 17 feet
Maximum width = 24 feet
In order to control entrance and exit drives they must be properly signed. This is
the responsibility of the property owner.
(b)

Number of driveways and spacing

Driveway spacing is largely dependent on land zoning, and as a result, it is
difficult to develop definite standards. Although from past experience and a
literature review on this subject, not more than two driveways are generally
needed to serve a tract of land. Additional policies are as follows:
(1)
Arterials - frontage roads are encouraged but where this is not
feasible a minimum spacing of 150 feet is required between adjacent
property owners. Also, as a general section if the frontage is 100 feet or
less, only one driveway will be permitted.
(2)
Collectors - a minimum spacing of 100 feet is required and
generally only one driveway per 100 foot of frontage will be allowed.
(3)
Local - no minimum spacing is required; however, only one
driveway per lot will be allowed.
105.16 LOCATION - VISIBILITY
All entrances and approaches shall be located so as to provide adequate sight distance
in both directions along the alley, thoroughfare or highway for safe access to same
without interfering with traffic.
105.17 LOCATION - TRAFFIC DEVICES
No entrance or approach shall be located or constructed so as to interfere with or
prevent the proper location of necessary highway signs or other traffic control devices.
105.18 LOCATION - PROPERTY LINE
No approach radii shall be so constructed that any part of the same extends in front of
property belonging to persons other than the permittee unless both property owners
sign a joint application for said permit.
105.19 DRAINAGE REQUIREMENTS

must abate the suspected nuisance to avoid any fines being assessed under
this section by evicting those responsible;

4. if it is determined that a civil nuisance is occurring, the
Richmond Police Department will, at the owner’s request, deliver an eviction
notice to the responsible tenant;
5. if its investigation reveals that a civil nuisance is in fact taking
place, the City and the Police Department intend to take further legal action; and
6. if it is determined that a civil nuisance is occurring, the property
owner will be notified and given the opportunity to abate the nuisance before
any fines are assessed.
f. Whenever the Richmond Police Department determines that a civil nuisance as
defined in subsection (a) herein exists, which determination must be made by the Chief of
Police or a designated officer and approved by the City Law Department, the Police shall,
when deemed appropriate under the circumstances, cause written notice to be served on
the owner and occupant that a present occupant or tenant of that property has been using
the property so as to constitute a civil nuisance as defined herein or has been allowing the
property to be so used. Said notice shall contain a copy of this section of Richmond Code

responsible to avoid any fines being assessed under this
section;
7. that, if the owner chooses to abate the civil nuisance by evicting
those responsible, he or she must so inform the Police
Department in writing and commence said eviction within thirty
(30) days of receipt of this notice;
8. that the Richmond Police Department will, at the owner’s
request, deliver an eviction notice to the property; and

9. that if the owner fails to abate the civil nuisance, the City and the
Police Department may take further legal action, including but
not limited to, filing suit pursuant to IC 34-19-3.
g. After receiving an initial warning letter or second notification under this section, if
a property owner so requests, an eviction notice signed by the property owner shall be
delivered to the responsible tenant by the Richmond Police Department. (The Police
Department shall inform the property owner that, if the tenant or occupant refuses to leave,
it will be necessary to file an eviction proceeding through the proper court.)
h.

a. sending a copy of the notice by registered or certified mail
to the residence or place of business or employment of the
person to be notified, with return receipt requested;
b. delivering a copy of the order or statement personally to the
person to be notified; or
c. leaving a copy of the order or statement at the dwelling or
usual place of abode of the person to be notified.

described in subsection (h)(1), service may be made by publishing the
notice in accordance with I.C. 5-3-1.
3. Notice is deemed given to the owner, upon receipt of notice as
indicated above, by the owner of record pursuant to the records and files
of the Wayne County Assessor’s Office.

i. Within thirty days of receipt of notice in accordance with subsection (f), the owner
must initiate such legal action as is necessary to evict all persons responsible for or
permitting the civil nuisance (which shall include, at a minimum, a notice of eviction
delivered by the Richmond Police Department or the property owner by serving notice
pursuant to I.C. 34-19-3-5), and must diligently prosecute such legal action to a conclusion.
j. In the case of a multiple unit dwelling, the only person necessary to name in an
eviction proceeding is the tenant/occupant occupying the actual unit involved with the
nuisance as defined herein.
k. Charging an owner of real estate with a violation of this section shall be adjunct
to, and not a substitution for, any criminal charges filed against occupants or tenants of that
owner’s real estate for any illegal activity.

l. The Chief of Police shall use reasonable efforts to train, educate, and assist
owners of real estate in evicting, and avoiding the placement of, tenants or occupants in
their real estate who are known violators of illegal activities under IC 35-48-4.

begin its own eviction process pursuant to I.C 34-19-3, shall be fined fifty dollars ($50) to
assist with costs associated in utilizing state law. No fines shall be assessed until at least
thirty (30) days after receipt of notice required by subsection (f). Each day such violation
continues shall be deemed a separate violation, beginning with the 31 st day following
receipt of notice as required by subsection (f).
n. Nothing in this section shall be construed to encourage or authorize the
discrimination by lessors against any persons based upon race, creed, religion, sex, age or
national origin. Rather, it is the intent of this section to hold persons accountable for
acquiescing in or participating in the continued use of his/her property as the location of
illegal drug activity.

For hanger rods with spring steel fasteners, use 1/4 in. dia or larger threaded steel. Use spring steel fasteners that are specifically designed for supporting single conduits or tubing.
In vertical runs, arrange support so load produced by weight of raceway and enclosed conductors is carried entirely by conduit supports with no weight load on raceway terminals.
Supports for Cabinets, Consoles, Panels, Enclosures, and Boxes:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NTS: When the project has multiple prime contracts, coordinate paragraph "1", below, with section 01 11 00, Summary of Work, relative to the contract that will provide concrete housekeeping pads.  Typically the general Contractor provides all concrete work under division 03, Concrete.
Freestanding: Unless otherwise specified or shown on the Drawings, provide supports for floor-mounted equipment, cabinets, consoles, panels, enclosures, and boxes.  Such supports shall be 3.5-inch high concrete equipment base with a 45 degree chamfered edge.  Base shall extend two inches beyond outside dimensions of equipment on all sides.
Wall-Mounted:
Provide space not less than 1/4-inch between cabinets, consoles, panels, enclosures, and boxes and the surface on which each is mounted.  Provide non-metallic or stainless steel spacers as required.
Do not mount equipment, enclosures, panels, and boxes directly to beams or columns.  Mount struts to beams or columns using beam clamps, and mount equipment, enclosures, panels, and boxes to the struts.
Floor Stand Rack:
Where equipment, cabinets, consoles, panels, enclosures, and boxes cannot be wall-mounted, provide an independent floor stand rack.
Floor stand rack shall consist of struts, plates, brackets, connection fittings, braces, accessories, and hardware assembled in a rigid framework suitable for mounting of intended materials and equipment.
Equip floor stand racks with brackets and bases for rigidly-mounting the framework to the ceiling or floor, as applicable; or equip floor stand racks with beam clamps, angle plates, washers, and bolts for fastening to beam flanges, as applicable.
When equipment, cabinets, consoles, panels, enclosures, and boxes weigh more than 100 pounds:
Main vertical supports of floor stand rack assemblies shall be back-to-back struts.
Bracing, clamping and anchoring of each floor stand rack shall be sufficient to ensure rigidity of the floor stand rack with the intended equipment, enclosures, conduit, cable tray, busway, cablebus, and wireway installed.  Floor stand racks shall not be deflected more than 1/8-inch by a 100-pound force applied at any point on the floor stand rack in any direction.
Drilling into beams or columns is not allowed unless authorized by Engineer. 
Tighten nuts and bolts to the manufacturer's recommended torque values. 
Field Cutting: 
Cut edges of strut and hanger rod shall have rounded corners, edges beveled, and burrs removed.  If field cutting the strut is required, use clean, sharp, dedicated tools.  Remove oil, shavings, and other residue of cuttings prior to installation.
Coatings: To prevent corrosion:
Coat cut edges with zinc-rich paint.
Bitumatic paint shall be used for aluminum in concrete.
Miscellaneous Supports: Support miscellaneous electrical components as required to produce same structural safety factors as specified for raceway supports. Install metal channel racks for mounting cabinets, panelboards, disconnects, control enclosures, pull boxes, junction boxes, transformers, and other devices.
Fastening: Unless otherwise indicated, fasten electrical items and their supporting hardware securely to building structure, including but not limited to conduits, raceways, cables, cable trays, busways, cabinets, panelboards, transformers, boxes, disconnect switches, and control components in accordance with following:
Fasten by means of wood screws or screw-type nails on wood, toggle bolts on hollow masonry units, concrete inserts or expansion bolts on concrete or solid masonry, and machine screws, welded threaded studs, or spring-tension clamps on steel. Threaded studs driven by powder charge and provided with lock washers and nuts may be used instead of expansion bolts and machine or wood screws. Do not weld conduit, pipe straps, or items other than threaded studs to steel structures. In partitions of light steel construction, use sheet metal screws.
Holes cut in concrete shall not cut main reinforcing bars. Fill holes that are not used.
Load applied to any fastener shall not exceed 25% of proof test load. Use vibration- and shock- resistant fasteners for attachments to concrete slabs.
