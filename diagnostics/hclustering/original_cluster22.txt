Certification

Under penalties of perjury, I certify that:

2. I am not subject to backup withholding because: (a) I am exempt from backup withholding, or (b) I have not been notified by the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) that I am subject to backup withholding as a result of a failure to report all interest or dividends, or (c) the IRS has notified me that I am
no longer subject to backup withholding; and
3. I am a U.S. citizen or other U.S. person (defined below); and

Certification instructions. You must cross out item 2 above if you have been notified by the IRS that you are currently subject to backup withholding
because you have failed to report all interest and dividends on your tax return. For real estate transactions, item 2 does not apply. For mortgage
interest paid, acquisition or abandonment of secured property, cancellation of debt, contributions to an individual retirement arrangement (IRA), and
generally, payments other than interest and dividends, you are not required to sign the certification, but you must provide your correct TIN. See the
instructions on page 3.

Future developments. Information about developments affecting Form W-9 (such
as legislation enacted after we release it) is at www.irs.gov/fw9.

Purpose of Form

• Form 1099-A (acquisition or abandonment of secured property)
Use Form W-9 only if you are a U.S. person (including a resident alien), to
provide your correct TIN.

An individual or entity (Form W-9 requester) who is required to file an information
return with the IRS must obtain your correct taxpayer identification number (TIN)
which may be your social security number (SSN), individual taxpayer identification
number (ITIN), adoption taxpayer identification number (ATIN), or employer
identification number (EIN), to report on an information return the amount paid to
you, or other amount reportable on an information return. Examples of information
returns include, but are not limited to, the following:

If you do not return Form W-9 to the requester with a TIN, you might be subject
to backup withholding. See What is backup withholding? on page 2.

• Form 1099-INT (interest earned or paid)

3. Claim exemption from backup withholding if you are a U.S. exempt payee. If
applicable, you are also certifying that as a U.S. person, your allocable share of
any partnership income from a U.S. trade or business is not subject to the
withholding tax on foreign partners' share of effectively connected income, and

• Form 1099-DIV (dividends, including those from stocks or mutual funds)
• Form 1099-MISC (various types of income, prizes, awards, or gross proceeds)

4. Certify that FATCA code(s) entered on this form (if any) indicating that you are
exempt from the FATCA reporting, is correct. See What is FATCA reporting? on
page 2 for further information.

Form W-9 (Rev. 12-2014)

Page 2

Form W-9 (Rev. 12-2014)
Note. If you are a U.S. person and a requester gives you a form other than Form
W-9 to request your TIN, you must use the requester’s form if it is substantially
similar to this Form W-9.
Definition of a U.S. person. For federal tax purposes, you are considered a U.S.
person if you are:
• An individual who is a U.S. citizen or U.S. resident alien;
• A partnership, corporation, company, or association created or organized in the
United States or under the laws of the United States;
• An estate (other than a foreign estate); or
• A domestic trust (as defined in Regulations section 301.7701-7).
Special rules for partnerships. Partnerships that conduct a trade or business in
the United States are generally required to pay a withholding tax under section
1446 on any foreign partners’ share of effectively connected taxable income from
such business. Further, in certain cases where a Form W-9 has not been received,
the rules under section 1446 require a partnership to presume that a partner is a
foreign person, and pay the section 1446 withholding tax. Therefore, if you are a
U.S. person that is a partner in a partnership conducting a trade or business in the
United States, provide Form W-9 to the partnership to establish your U.S. status
and avoid section 1446 withholding on your share of partnership income.
In the cases below, the following person must give Form W-9 to the partnership
for purposes of establishing its U.S. status and avoiding withholding on its
allocable share of net income from the partnership conducting a trade or business
in the United States:
• In the case of a disregarded entity with a U.S. owner, the U.S. owner of the
disregarded entity and not the entity;
• In the case of a grantor trust with a U.S. grantor or other U.S. owner, generally,
the U.S. grantor or other U.S. owner of the grantor trust and not the trust; and
• In the case of a U.S. trust (other than a grantor trust), the U.S. trust (other than a
grantor trust) and not the beneficiaries of the trust.
Foreign person. If you are a foreign person or the U.S. branch of a foreign bank
that has elected to be treated as a U.S. person, do not use Form W-9. Instead, use
the appropriate Form W-8 or Form 8233 (see Publication 515, Withholding of Tax
on Nonresident Aliens and Foreign Entities).
Nonresident alien who becomes a resident alien. Generally, only a nonresident
alien individual may use the terms of a tax treaty to reduce or eliminate U.S. tax on
certain types of income. However, most tax treaties contain a provision known as
a “saving clause.” Exceptions specified in the saving clause may permit an
exemption from tax to continue for certain types of income even after the payee
has otherwise become a U.S. resident alien for tax purposes.
If you are a U.S. resident alien who is relying on an exception contained in the
saving clause of a tax treaty to claim an exemption from U.S. tax on certain types
of income, you must attach a statement to Form W-9 that specifies the following
five items:
1. The treaty country. Generally, this must be the same treaty under which you
claimed exemption from tax as a nonresident alien.
2. The treaty article addressing the income.
3. The article number (or location) in the tax treaty that contains the saving
clause and its exceptions.
4. The type and amount of income that qualifies for the exemption from tax.
5. Sufficient facts to justify the exemption from tax under the terms of the treaty
article.
Example. Article 20 of the U.S.-China income tax treaty allows an exemption
from tax for scholarship income received by a Chinese student temporarily present
in the United States. Under U.S. law, this student will become a resident alien for
tax purposes if his or her stay in the United States exceeds 5 calendar years.
However, paragraph 2 of the first Protocol to the U.S.-China treaty (dated April 30,
1984) allows the provisions of Article 20 to continue to apply even after the
Chinese student becomes a resident alien of the United States. A Chinese student
who qualifies for this exception (under paragraph 2 of the first protocol) and is
relying on this exception to claim an exemption from tax on his or her scholarship
or fellowship income would attach to Form W-9 a statement that includes the
information described above to support that exemption.
If you are a nonresident alien or a foreign entity, give the requester the
appropriate completed Form W-8 or Form 8233.

Backup Withholding
What is backup withholding? Persons making certain payments to you must
under certain conditions withhold and pay to the IRS 28% of such payments. This
is called “backup withholding.” Payments that may be subject to backup
withholding include interest, tax-exempt interest, dividends, broker and barter
exchange transactions, rents, royalties, nonemployee pay, payments made in
settlement of payment card and third party network transactions, and certain
payments from fishing boat operators. Real estate transactions are not subject to
backup withholding.
You will not be subject to backup withholding on payments you receive if you
give the requester your correct TIN, make the proper certifications, and report all
your taxable interest and dividends on your tax return.
Payments you receive will be subject to backup withholding if:
1. You do not furnish your TIN to the requester,
2. You do not certify your TIN when required (see the Part II instructions on page
3 for details),

3. The IRS tells the requester that you furnished an incorrect TIN,
4. The IRS tells you that you are subject to backup withholding because you did
not report all your interest and dividends on your tax return (for reportable interest
and dividends only), or
5. You do not certify to the requester that you are not subject to backup
withholding under 4 above (for reportable interest and dividend accounts opened
after 1983 only).
Certain payees and payments are exempt from backup withholding. See Exempt
payee code on page 3 and the separate Instructions for the Requester of Form
W-9 for more information.
Also see Special rules for partnerships above.

What is FATCA reporting?
The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) requires a participating foreign
financial institution to report all United States account holders that are specified
United States persons. Certain payees are exempt from FATCA reporting. See
Exemption from FATCA reporting code on page 3 and the Instructions for the
Requester of Form W-9 for more information.

Updating Your Information
You must provide updated information to any person to whom you claimed to be
an exempt payee if you are no longer an exempt payee and anticipate receiving
reportable payments in the future from this person. For example, you may need to
provide updated information if you are a C corporation that elects to be an S
corporation, or if you no longer are tax exempt. In addition, you must furnish a new
Form W-9 if the name or TIN changes for the account; for example, if the grantor
of a grantor trust dies.

Penalties
Failure to furnish TIN. If you fail to furnish your correct TIN to a requester, you are
subject to a penalty of $50 for each such failure unless your failure is due to
reasonable cause and not to willful neglect.
Civil penalty for false information with respect to withholding. If you make a
false statement with no reasonable basis that results in no backup withholding,
you are subject to a $500 penalty.
Criminal penalty for falsifying information. Willfully falsifying certifications or
affirmations may subject you to criminal penalties including fines and/or
imprisonment.
Misuse of TINs. If the requester discloses or uses TINs in violation of federal law,
the requester may be subject to civil and criminal penalties.

Specific Instructions
Line 1
You must enter one of the following on this line; do not leave this line blank. The
name should match the name on your tax return.
If this Form W-9 is for a joint account, list first, and then circle, the name of the
person or entity whose number you entered in Part I of Form W-9.
a. Individual. Generally, enter the name shown on your tax return. If you have
changed your last name without informing the Social Security Administration (SSA)
of the name change, enter your first name, the last name as shown on your social
security card, and your new last name.
Note. ITIN applicant: Enter your individual name as it was entered on your Form
W-7 application, line 1a. This should also be the same as the name you entered on
the Form 1040/1040A/1040EZ you filed with your application.
b. Sole proprietor or single-member LLC. Enter your individual name as
shown on your 1040/1040A/1040EZ on line 1. You may enter your business, trade,
or “doing business as” (DBA) name on line 2.
c. Partnership, LLC that is not a single-member LLC, C Corporation, or S
Corporation. Enter the entity's name as shown on the entity's tax return on line 1
and any business, trade, or DBA name on line 2.
d. Other entities. Enter your name as shown on required U.S. federal tax
documents on line 1. This name should match the name shown on the charter or
other legal document creating the entity. You may enter any business, trade, or
DBA name on line 2.
e. Disregarded entity. For U.S. federal tax purposes, an entity that is
disregarded as an entity separate from its owner is treated as a “disregarded
entity.” See Regulations section 301.7701-2(c)(2)(iii). Enter the owner's name on
line 1. The name of the entity entered on line 1 should never be a disregarded
entity. The name on line 1 should be the name shown on the income tax return on
which the income should be reported. For example, if a foreign LLC that is treated
as a disregarded entity for U.S. federal tax purposes has a single owner that is a
U.S. person, the U.S. owner's name is required to be provided on line 1. If the
direct owner of the entity is also a disregarded entity, enter the first owner that is
not disregarded for federal tax purposes. Enter the disregarded entity's name on
line 2, “Business name/disregarded entity name.” If the owner of the disregarded
entity is a foreign person, the owner must complete an appropriate Form W-8
instead of a Form W-9. This is the case even if the foreign person has a U.S. TIN.

If you have a business name, trade name, DBA name, or disregarded entity name,
you may enter it on line 2.

Line 3
Check the appropriate box in line 3 for the U.S. federal tax classification of the
person whose name is entered on line 1. Check only one box in line 3.
Limited Liability Company (LLC). If the name on line 1 is an LLC treated as a
partnership for U.S. federal tax purposes, check the “Limited Liability Company”
box and enter “P” in the space provided. If the LLC has filed Form 8832 or 2553 to
be taxed as a corporation, check the “Limited Liability Company” box and in the
space provided enter “C” for C corporation or “S” for S corporation. If it is a
single-member LLC that is a disregarded entity, do not check the “Limited Liability
Company” box; instead check the first box in line 3 “Individual/sole proprietor or
single-member LLC.”

However, the following payments made to a corporation and reportable on Form
1099-MISC are not exempt from backup withholding: medical and health care
payments, attorneys' fees, gross proceeds paid to an attorney reportable under
section 6045(f), and payments for services paid by a federal executive agency.
Exemption from FATCA reporting code. The following codes identify payees
that are exempt from reporting under FATCA. These codes apply to persons
submitting this form for accounts maintained outside of the United States by

Consult with the person requesting this form if you are uncertain if the financial

If you are asked to complete Form W-9 but do not have a TIN, apply for a TIN
and write “Applied For” in the space for the TIN, sign and date the form, and give it
to the requester. For interest and dividend payments, and certain payments made
with respect to readily tradable instruments, generally you will have 60 days to get
a TIN and give it to the requester before you are subject to backup withholding on
payments. The 60-day rule does not apply to other types of payments. You will be
subject to backup withholding on all such payments until you provide your TIN to
the requester.
Note. Entering “Applied For” means that you have already applied for a TIN or that
you intend to apply for one soon.
Caution: A disregarded U.S. entity that has a foreign owner must use the
appropriate Form W-8.

Secure Your Tax Records from Identity Theft
Identity theft occurs when someone uses your personal information such as your
name, SSN, or other identifying information, without your permission, to commit
fraud or other crimes. An identity thief may use your SSN to get a job or may file a
tax return using your SSN to receive a refund.
To reduce your risk:
• Protect your SSN,
• Ensure your employer is protecting your SSN, and
• Be careful when choosing a tax preparer.
If your tax records are affected by identity theft and you receive a notice from
the IRS, respond right away to the name and phone number printed on the IRS
notice or letter.
If your tax records are not currently affected by identity theft but you think you
are at risk due to a lost or stolen purse or wallet, questionable credit card activity
or credit report, contact the IRS Identity Theft Hotline at 1-800-908-4490 or submit
Form 14039.
For more information, see Publication 4535, Identity Theft Prevention and Victim
Assistance.
Victims of identity theft who are experiencing economic harm or a system
problem, or are seeking help in resolving tax problems that have not been resolved
through normal channels, may be eligible for Taxpayer Advocate Service (TAS)

Protect yourself from suspicious emails or phishing schemes. Phishing is the
creation and use of email and websites designed to mimic legitimate business
emails and websites. The most common act is sending an email to a user falsely
claiming to be an established legitimate enterprise in an attempt to scam the user
into surrendering private information that will be used for identity theft.
The IRS does not initiate contacts with taxpayers via emails. Also, the IRS does
not request personal detailed information through email or ask taxpayers for the
PIN numbers, passwords, or similar secret access information for their credit card,
bank, or other financial accounts.
If you receive an unsolicited email claiming to be from the IRS, forward this
message to phishing@irs.gov. You may also report misuse of the IRS name, logo,
or other IRS property to the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration
(TIGTA) at 1-800-366-4484. You can forward suspicious emails to the Federal
Trade Commission at: spam@uce.gov or contact them at www.ftc.gov/idtheft or
1-877-IDTHEFT (1-877-438-4338).

Privacy Act Notice
Section 6109 of the Internal Revenue Code requires you to provide your correct
TIN to persons (including federal agencies) who are required to file information
returns with the IRS to report interest, dividends, or certain other income paid to
you; mortgage interest you paid; the acquisition or abandonment of secured
property; the cancellation of debt; or contributions you made to an IRA, Archer
MSA, or HSA. The person collecting this form uses the information on the form to
file information returns with the IRS, reporting the above information. Routine uses
of this information include giving it to the Department of Justice for civil and
criminal litigation and to cities, states, the District of Columbia, and U.S.
commonwealths and possessions for use in administering their laws. The
information also may be disclosed to other countries under a treaty, to federal and
state agencies to enforce civil and criminal laws, or to federal law enforcement and
intelligence agencies to combat terrorism. You must provide your TIN whether or
not you are required to file a tax return. Under section 3406, payers must generally
withhold a percentage of taxable interest, dividend, and certain other payments to
a payee who does not give a TIN to the payer. Certain penalties may also apply for
providing false or fraudulent information.

Future developments. Information about developments affecting Form W-9 (such
as legislation enacted after we release it) is at www.irs.gov/fw9.

Purpose of Form

• Form 1099-A (acquisition or abandonment of secured property)
Use Form W-9 only if you are a U.S. person (including a resident alien), to
provide your correct TIN.

An individual or entity (Form W-9 requester) who is required to file an information
return with the IRS must obtain your correct taxpayer identification number (TIN)
which may be your social security number (SSN), individual taxpayer identification
number (ITIN), adoption taxpayer identification number (ATIN), or employer
identification number (EIN), to report on an information return the amount paid to
you, or other amount reportable on an information return. Examples of information
returns include, but are not limited to, the following:

If you do not return Form W-9 to the requester with a TIN, you might be subject
to backup withholding. See What is backup withholding? on page 2.

• Form 1099-INT (interest earned or paid)

3. Claim exemption from backup withholding if you are a U.S. exempt payee. If
applicable, you are also certifying that as a U.S. person, your allocable share of
any partnership income from a U.S. trade or business is not subject to the
withholding tax on foreign partners' share of effectively connected income, and

• Form 1099-DIV (dividends, including those from stocks or mutual funds)

Form W-9 (Rev. 12-2014)

Page 2

Form W-9 (Rev. 12-2014)
Note. If you are a U.S. person and a requester gives you a form other than Form
W-9 to request your TIN, you must use the requester’s form if it is substantially
similar to this Form W-9.
Definition of a U.S. person. For federal tax purposes, you are considered a U.S.
person if you are:
• An individual who is a U.S. citizen or U.S. resident alien;
• A partnership, corporation, company, or association created or organized in the
United States or under the laws of the United States;
• An estate (other than a foreign estate); or
• A domestic trust (as defined in Regulations section 301.7701-7).
Special rules for partnerships. Partnerships that conduct a trade or business in
the United States are generally required to pay a withholding tax under section
1446 on any foreign partners’ share of effectively connected taxable income from
such business. Further, in certain cases where a Form W-9 has not been received,
the rules under section 1446 require a partnership to presume that a partner is a
foreign person, and pay the section 1446 withholding tax. Therefore, if you are a
U.S. person that is a partner in a partnership conducting a trade or business in the
United States, provide Form W-9 to the partnership to establish your U.S. status
and avoid section 1446 withholding on your share of partnership income.
In the cases below, the following person must give Form W-9 to the partnership
for purposes of establishing its U.S. status and avoiding withholding on its
allocable share of net income from the partnership conducting a trade or business
in the United States:
• In the case of a disregarded entity with a U.S. owner, the U.S. owner of the
disregarded entity and not the entity;
• In the case of a grantor trust with a U.S. grantor or other U.S. owner, generally,
the U.S. grantor or other U.S. owner of the grantor trust and not the trust; and
• In the case of a U.S. trust (other than a grantor trust), the U.S. trust (other than a
grantor trust) and not the beneficiaries of the trust.
Foreign person. If you are a foreign person or the U.S. branch of a foreign bank
that has elected to be treated as a U.S. person, do not use Form W-9. Instead, use
the appropriate Form W-8 or Form 8233 (see Publication 515, Withholding of Tax
on Nonresident Aliens and Foreign Entities).
Nonresident alien who becomes a resident alien. Generally, only a nonresident
alien individual may use the terms of a tax treaty to reduce or eliminate U.S. tax on
certain types of income. However, most tax treaties contain a provision known as
a “saving clause.” Exceptions specified in the saving clause may permit an
exemption from tax to continue for certain types of income even after the payee
has otherwise become a U.S. resident alien for tax purposes.
If you are a U.S. resident alien who is relying on an exception contained in the
saving clause of a tax treaty to claim an exemption from U.S. tax on certain types
of income, you must attach a statement to Form W-9 that specifies the following
five items:
1. The treaty country. Generally, this must be the same treaty under which you
claimed exemption from tax as a nonresident alien.
2. The treaty article addressing the income.
3. The article number (or location) in the tax treaty that contains the saving
clause and its exceptions.
4. The type and amount of income that qualifies for the exemption from tax.
5. Sufficient facts to justify the exemption from tax under the terms of the treaty
article.
Example. Article 20 of the U.S.-China income tax treaty allows an exemption
from tax for scholarship income received by a Chinese student temporarily present
in the United States. Under U.S. law, this student will become a resident alien for
tax purposes if his or her stay in the United States exceeds 5 calendar years.
However, paragraph 2 of the first Protocol to the U.S.-China treaty (dated April 30,
1984) allows the provisions of Article 20 to continue to apply even after the
Chinese student becomes a resident alien of the United States. A Chinese student
who qualifies for this exception (under paragraph 2 of the first protocol) and is
relying on this exception to claim an exemption from tax on his or her scholarship
or fellowship income would attach to Form W-9 a statement that includes the
information described above to support that exemption.
If you are a nonresident alien or a foreign entity, give the requester the
appropriate completed Form W-8 or Form 8233.

Backup Withholding
What is backup withholding? Persons making certain payments to you must
under certain conditions withhold and pay to the IRS 28% of such payments. This
is called “backup withholding.” Payments that may be subject to backup
withholding include interest, tax-exempt interest, dividends, broker and barter
exchange transactions, rents, royalties, nonemployee pay, payments made in
settlement of payment card and third party network transactions, and certain
payments from fishing boat operators. Real estate transactions are not subject to
backup withholding.
You will not be subject to backup withholding on payments you receive if you
give the requester your correct TIN, make the proper certifications, and report all
your taxable interest and dividends on your tax return.
Payments you receive will be subject to backup withholding if:
1. You do not furnish your TIN to the requester,
2. You do not certify your TIN when required (see the Part II instructions on page
3 for details),

3. The IRS tells the requester that you furnished an incorrect TIN,
4. The IRS tells you that you are subject to backup withholding because you did
not report all your interest and dividends on your tax return (for reportable interest
and dividends only), or
5. You do not certify to the requester that you are not subject to backup
withholding under 4 above (for reportable interest and dividend accounts opened
after 1983 only).
Certain payees and payments are exempt from backup withholding. See Exempt
payee code on page 3 and the separate Instructions for the Requester of Form
W-9 for more information.
Also see Special rules for partnerships above.

What is FATCA reporting?
The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) requires a participating foreign
financial institution to report all United States account holders that are specified
United States persons. Certain payees are exempt from FATCA reporting. See
Exemption from FATCA reporting code on page 3 and the Instructions for the
Requester of Form W-9 for more information.

Updating Your Information
You must provide updated information to any person to whom you claimed to be
an exempt payee if you are no longer an exempt payee and anticipate receiving
reportable payments in the future from this person. For example, you may need to
provide updated information if you are a C corporation that elects to be an S
corporation, or if you no longer are tax exempt. In addition, you must furnish a new
Form W-9 if the name or TIN changes for the account; for example, if the grantor
of a grantor trust dies.

Penalties
Failure to furnish TIN. If you fail to furnish your correct TIN to a requester, you are
subject to a penalty of $50 for each such failure unless your failure is due to
reasonable cause and not to willful neglect.
Civil penalty for false information with respect to withholding. If you make a
false statement with no reasonable basis that results in no backup withholding,
you are subject to a $500 penalty.
Criminal penalty for falsifying information. Willfully falsifying certifications or
affirmations may subject you to criminal penalties including fines and/or
imprisonment.
Misuse of TINs. If the requester discloses or uses TINs in violation of federal law,
the requester may be subject to civil and criminal penalties.

Specific Instructions
Line 1
You must enter one of the following on this line; do not leave this line blank. The
name should match the name on your tax return.
If this Form W-9 is for a joint account, list first, and then circle, the name of the
person or entity whose number you entered in Part I of Form W-9.
a. Individual. Generally, enter the name shown on your tax return. If you have
changed your last name without informing the Social Security Administration (SSA)
of the name change, enter your first name, the last name as shown on your social
security card, and your new last name.
Note. ITIN applicant: Enter your individual name as it was entered on your Form
W-7 application, line 1a. This should also be the same as the name you entered on
the Form 1040/1040A/1040EZ you filed with your application.
b. Sole proprietor or single-member LLC. Enter your individual name as
shown on your 1040/1040A/1040EZ on line 1. You may enter your business, trade,
or “doing business as” (DBA) name on line 2.
c. Partnership, LLC that is not a single-member LLC, C Corporation, or S
Corporation. Enter the entity's name as shown on the entity's tax return on line 1
and any business, trade, or DBA name on line 2.
d. Other entities. Enter your name as shown on required U.S. federal tax
documents on line 1. This name should match the name shown on the charter or
other legal document creating the entity. You may enter any business, trade, or
DBA name on line 2.
e. Disregarded entity. For U.S. federal tax purposes, an entity that is
disregarded as an entity separate from its owner is treated as a “disregarded
entity.” See Regulations section 301.7701-2(c)(2)(iii). Enter the owner's name on
line 1. The name of the entity entered on line 1 should never be a disregarded
entity. The name on line 1 should be the name shown on the income tax return on
which the income should be reported. For example, if a foreign LLC that is treated
as a disregarded entity for U.S. federal tax purposes has a single owner that is a
U.S. person, the U.S. owner's name is required to be provided on line 1. If the
direct owner of the entity is also a disregarded entity, enter the first owner that is
not disregarded for federal tax purposes. Enter the disregarded entity's name on
line 2, “Business name/disregarded entity name.” If the owner of the disregarded
entity is a foreign person, the owner must complete an appropriate Form W-8
instead of a Form W-9. This is the case even if the foreign person has a U.S. TIN.

If you have a business name, trade name, DBA name, or disregarded entity name,
you may enter it on line 2.

Line 3
Check the appropriate box in line 3 for the U.S. federal tax classification of the
person whose name is entered on line 1. Check only one box in line 3.
Limited Liability Company (LLC). If the name on line 1 is an LLC treated as a
partnership for U.S. federal tax purposes, check the “Limited Liability Company”
box and enter “P” in the space provided. If the LLC has filed Form 8832 or 2553 to
be taxed as a corporation, check the “Limited Liability Company” box and in the
space provided enter “C” for C corporation or “S” for S corporation. If it is a
single-member LLC that is a disregarded entity, do not check the “Limited Liability
Company” box; instead check the first box in line 3 “Individual/sole proprietor or
single-member LLC.”

However, the following payments made to a corporation and reportable on Form
1099-MISC are not exempt from backup withholding: medical and health care
payments, attorneys' fees, gross proceeds paid to an attorney reportable under
section 6045(f), and payments for services paid by a federal executive agency.
Exemption from FATCA reporting code. The following codes identify payees
that are exempt from reporting under FATCA. These codes apply to persons
submitting this form for accounts maintained outside of the United States by
certain foreign financial institutions. Therefore, if you are only submitting this form
for an account you hold in the United States, you may leave this field blank.
Consult with the person requesting this form if you are uncertain if the financial
institution is subject to these requirements. A requester may indicate that a code is
not required by providing you with a Form W-9 with “Not Applicable” (or any
similar indication) written or printed on the line for a FATCA exemption code.

If you are asked to complete Form W-9 but do not have a TIN, apply for a TIN
and write “Applied For” in the space for the TIN, sign and date the form, and give it
to the requester. For interest and dividend payments, and certain payments made
with respect to readily tradable instruments, generally you will have 60 days to get
a TIN and give it to the requester before you are subject to backup withholding on
payments. The 60-day rule does not apply to other types of payments. You will be
subject to backup withholding on all such payments until you provide your TIN to
the requester.
Note. Entering “Applied For” means that you have already applied for a TIN or that
you intend to apply for one soon.
Caution: A disregarded U.S. entity that has a foreign owner must use the
appropriate Form W-8.

Secure Your Tax Records from Identity Theft
Identity theft occurs when someone uses your personal information such as your
name, SSN, or other identifying information, without your permission, to commit
fraud or other crimes. An identity thief may use your SSN to get a job or may file a
tax return using your SSN to receive a refund.
To reduce your risk:
• Protect your SSN,
• Ensure your employer is protecting your SSN, and
• Be careful when choosing a tax preparer.
If your tax records are affected by identity theft and you receive a notice from
the IRS, respond right away to the name and phone number printed on the IRS
notice or letter.
If your tax records are not currently affected by identity theft but you think you
are at risk due to a lost or stolen purse or wallet, questionable credit card activity
or credit report, contact the IRS Identity Theft Hotline at 1-800-908-4490 or submit
Form 14039.
For more information, see Publication 4535, Identity Theft Prevention and Victim
Assistance.
Victims of identity theft who are experiencing economic harm or a system
problem, or are seeking help in resolving tax problems that have not been resolved
through normal channels, may be eligible for Taxpayer Advocate Service (TAS)
assistance. You can reach TAS by calling the TAS toll-free case intake line at
1-877-777-4778 or TTY/TDD 1-800-829-4059.
Protect yourself from suspicious emails or phishing schemes. Phishing is the
creation and use of email and websites designed to mimic legitimate business
emails and websites. The most common act is sending an email to a user falsely
claiming to be an established legitimate enterprise in an attempt to scam the user
into surrendering private information that will be used for identity theft.
The IRS does not initiate contacts with taxpayers via emails. Also, the IRS does
not request personal detailed information through email or ask taxpayers for the
PIN numbers, passwords, or similar secret access information for their credit card,
bank, or other financial accounts.
If you receive an unsolicited email claiming to be from the IRS, forward this
message to phishing@irs.gov. You may also report misuse of the IRS name, logo,
or other IRS property to the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration
(TIGTA) at 1-800-366-4484. You can forward suspicious emails to the Federal
Trade Commission at: spam@uce.gov or contact them at www.ftc.gov/idtheft or
1-877-IDTHEFT (1-877-438-4338).
Visit IRS.gov to learn more about identity theft and how to reduce your risk.

Privacy Act Notice
Section 6109 of the Internal Revenue Code requires you to provide your correct
TIN to persons (including federal agencies) who are required to file information
returns with the IRS to report interest, dividends, or certain other income paid to
you; mortgage interest you paid; the acquisition or abandonment of secured
property; the cancellation of debt; or contributions you made to an IRA, Archer
MSA, or HSA. The person collecting this form uses the information on the form to
file information returns with the IRS, reporting the above information. Routine uses
of this information include giving it to the Department of Justice for civil and
criminal litigation and to cities, states, the District of Columbia, and U.S.
commonwealths and possessions for use in administering their laws. The
information also may be disclosed to other countries under a treaty, to federal and
state agencies to enforce civil and criminal laws, or to federal law enforcement and
intelligence agencies to combat terrorism. You must provide your TIN whether or
not you are required to file a tax return. Under section 3406, payers must generally
withhold a percentage of taxable interest, dividend, and certain other payments to
a payee who does not give a TIN to the payer. Certain penalties may also apply for
providing false or fraudulent information.

For mortgage interest paid, acquisition or abandonment of secured property, cancellation of debt, contributions to an individual retirement
arrangement (IRA), and generally, payments other than interest and dividends, you are not required to sign the Certification, but you must
provide your correct TIN. (See the instructions on page 4.)

Purpose of Form
A person who is required to file an information return with the
IRS, must obtain your correct taxpayer identification number
(TIN) to report, for example, income paid to you, real estate
transactions, mortgage interest you paid, acquisition or
abandonment of secured property, cancellation of debt, or
contributions you made to an IRA.
U.S. person. Use Form W-9 only if you are a U.S. person
(including a resident alien), to provide your correct TIN to the
person requesting it (the requester) and, when applicable, to:
1. Certify that the TIN you are giving is correct (or you are
waiting for a number to be issued),
2. Certify that you are not subject to backup withholding, or
3. Claim exemption from backup withholding if you are a
U.S. exempt payee.
In 3 above, if applicable, you are also certifying that as a
U.S. person, your allocable share of any partnership income
from a U.S. trade or business is not subject to the
withholding tax on foreign partners’ share of effectively
connected income.
Note. If a requester gives you a form other than Form W-9 to
request your TIN, you must use the requester’s form if it is
substantially similar to this Form W-9.
For federal tax purposes, you are considered a person if you
are:

● An individual who is a citizen or resident of the United
States,
● A partnership, corporation, company, or association
created or organized in the United States or under the laws
of the United States, or
● Any estate (other than a foreign estate) or trust. See
Regulations sections 301.7701-6(a) and 7(a) for additional
information.
Special rules for partnerships. Partnerships that conduct a
trade or business in the United States are generally required
to pay a withholding tax on any foreign partners’ share of
income from such business. Further, in certain cases where a
Form W-9 has not been received, a partnership is required to
presume that a partner is a foreign person, and pay the
withholding tax. Therefore, if you are a U.S. person that is a
partner in a partnership conducting a trade or business in the
United States, provide Form W-9 to the partnership to
establish your U.S. status and avoid withholding on your
share of partnership income.
The person who gives Form W-9 to the partnership for
purposes of establishing its U.S. status and avoiding
withholding on its allocable share of net income from the
partnership conducting a trade or business in the United
States is in the following cases:
● The U.S. owner of a disregarded entity and not the entity,

Cat. No. 10231X

Form

W-9

(Rev. 11-2005)

Form W-9 (Rev. 11-2005)

● The U.S. grantor or other owner of a grantor trust and not
the trust, and
● The U.S. trust (other than a grantor trust) and not the
beneficiaries of the trust.
Foreign person. If you are a foreign person, do not use
Form W-9. Instead, use the appropriate Form W-8 (see
Publication 515, Withholding of Tax on Nonresident Aliens
and Foreign Entities).
Nonresident alien who becomes a resident alien.
Generally, only a nonresident alien individual may use the
terms of a tax treaty to reduce or eliminate U.S. tax on
certain types of income. However, most tax treaties contain a
provision known as a “saving clause.” Exceptions specified
in the saving clause may permit an exemption from tax to
continue for certain types of income even after the recipient
has otherwise become a U.S. resident alien for tax purposes.
If you are a U.S. resident alien who is relying on an
exception contained in the saving clause of a tax treaty to
claim an exemption from U.S. tax on certain types of income,
you must attach a statement to Form W-9 that specifies the
following five items:
1. The treaty country. Generally, this must be the same
treaty under which you claimed exemption from tax as a
nonresident alien.
2. The treaty article addressing the income.
3. The article number (or location) in the tax treaty that
contains the saving clause and its exceptions.
4. The type and amount of income that qualifies for the
exemption from tax.
5. Sufficient facts to justify the exemption from tax under
the terms of the treaty article.
Example. Article 20 of the U.S.-China income tax treaty
allows an exemption from tax for scholarship income
received by a Chinese student temporarily present in the
United States. Under U.S. law, this student will become a
resident alien for tax purposes if his or her stay in the United
States exceeds 5 calendar years. However, paragraph 2 of
the first Protocol to the U.S.-China treaty (dated April 30,
1984) allows the provisions of Article 20 to continue to apply
even after the Chinese student becomes a resident alien of
the United States. A Chinese student who qualifies for this
exception (under paragraph 2 of the first protocol) and is
relying on this exception to claim an exemption from tax on
his or her scholarship or fellowship income would attach to
Form W-9 a statement that includes the information
described above to support that exemption.
If you are a nonresident alien or a foreign entity not subject
to backup withholding, give the requester the appropriate
completed Form W-8.
What is backup withholding? Persons making certain
payments to you must under certain conditions withhold and
pay to the IRS 28% of such payments (after December 31,
2002). This is called “backup withholding.” Payments that
may be subject to backup withholding include interest,
dividends, broker and barter exchange transactions, rents,
royalties, nonemployee pay, and certain payments from
fishing boat operators. Real estate transactions are not
subject to backup withholding.
You will not be subject to backup withholding on payments
you receive if you give the requester your correct TIN, make
the proper certifications, and report all your taxable interest
and dividends on your tax return.
Payments you receive will be subject to backup
withholding if:
1. You do not furnish your TIN to the requester,
2. You do not certify your TIN when required (see the Part
II instructions on page 4 for details),

Page

2

3. The IRS tells the requester that you furnished an
incorrect TIN,
4. The IRS tells you that you are subject to backup
withholding because you did not report all your interest and
dividends on your tax return (for reportable interest and
dividends only), or
5. You do not certify to the requester that you are not
subject to backup withholding under 4 above (for reportable
interest and dividend accounts opened after 1983 only).
Certain payees and payments are exempt from backup
withholding. See the instructions below and the separate
Instructions for the Requester of Form W-9.
Also see Special rules regarding partnerships on page 1.

Penalties
Failure to furnish TIN. If you fail to furnish your correct TIN
to a requester, you are subject to a penalty of $50 for each
such failure unless your failure is due to reasonable cause
and not to willful neglect.
Civil penalty for false information with respect to
withholding. If you make a false statement with no
reasonable basis that results in no backup withholding, you
are subject to a $500 penalty.
Criminal penalty for falsifying information. Willfully
falsifying certifications or affirmations may subject you to
criminal penalties including fines and/or imprisonment.
Misuse of TINs. If the requester discloses or uses TINs in
violation of federal law, the requester may be subject to civil
and criminal penalties.

Specific Instructions
Name
If you are an individual, you must generally enter the name
shown on your income tax return. However, if you have
changed your last name, for instance, due to marriage
without informing the Social Security Administration of the
name change, enter your first name, the last name shown on
your social security card, and your new last name.
If the account is in joint names, list first, and then circle,
the name of the person or entity whose number you entered
in Part I of the form.
Sole proprietor. Enter your individual name as shown on
your income tax return on the “Name” line. You may enter

LLC (including a foreign LLC with a domestic owner) that is
disregarded as an entity separate from its owner under
Treasury regulations section 301.7701-3, enter the owner’s
name on the “Name” line. Enter the LLC’s name on the
“Business name” line. Check the appropriate box for your
filing status (sole proprietor, corporation, etc.), then check

Other entities. Enter your business name as shown on
required federal tax documents on the “Name” line. This
name should match the name shown on the charter or other
legal document creating the entity. You may enter any
business, trade, or DBA name on the “Business name” line.
Note. You are requested to check the appropriate box for
your status (individual/sole proprietor, corporation, etc.).

Exempt From Backup Withholding
If you are exempt, enter your name as described above and
check the appropriate box for your status, then check the
“Exempt from backup withholding” box in the line following
the business name, sign and date the form.

Form W-9 (Rev. 11-2005)

Page

Generally, individuals (including sole proprietors) are not
exempt from backup withholding. Corporations are exempt
from backup withholding for certain payments, such as
interest and dividends.
Note. If you are exempt from backup withholding, you
should still complete this form to avoid possible erroneous
backup withholding.
Exempt payees. Backup withholding is not required on any
payments made to the following payees:
1. An organization exempt from tax under section 501(a),
any IRA, or a custodial account under section 403(b)(7) if the

2. The United States or any of its agencies or
instrumentalities,
3. A state, the District of Columbia, a possession of the
United States, or any of their political subdivisions or
instrumentalities,

Part I. Taxpayer Identification
Number (TIN)
Enter your TIN in the appropriate box. If you are a resident
alien and you do not have and are not eligible to get an SSN,
your TIN is your IRS individual taxpayer identification number
(ITIN). Enter it in the social security number box. If you do
not have an ITIN, see How to get a TIN below.
If you are a sole proprietor and you have an EIN, you may
enter either your SSN or EIN. However, the IRS prefers that
you use your SSN.
If you are a single-owner LLC that is disregarded as an
entity separate from its owner (see Limited liability company
(LLC) on page 2), enter your SSN (or EIN, if you have one). If
the LLC is a corporation, partnership, etc., enter the entity’s
EIN.
Note. See the chart on page 4 for further clarification of
name and TIN combinations.
How to get a TIN. If you do not have a TIN, apply for one
immediately. To apply for an SSN, get Form SS-5,
Application for a Social Security Card, from your local Social
Security Administration office or get this form online at
www.socialsecurity.gov. You may also get this form by
calling 1-800-772-1213. Use Form W-7, Application for IRS
Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, to apply for an
ITIN, or Form SS-4, Application for Employer Identification
Number, to apply for an EIN. You can apply for an EIN online
by accessing the IRS website at www.irs.gov/businesses and
clicking on Employer ID Numbers under Related Topics. You
can get Forms W-7 and SS-4 from the IRS by visiting
www.irs.gov or by calling 1-800-TAX-FORM
(1-800-829-3676).
If you are asked to complete Form W-9 but do not have a
TIN, write “Applied For” in the space for the TIN, sign and
date the form, and give it to the requester. For interest and
dividend payments, and certain payments made with respect
to readily tradable instruments, generally you will have 60
days to get a TIN and give it to the requester before you are
subject to backup withholding on payments. The 60-day rule
does not apply to other types of payments. You will be
subject to backup withholding on all such payments until you
provide your TIN to the requester.
Note. Writing “Applied For” means that you have already
applied for a TIN or that you intend to apply for one soon.
Caution: A disregarded domestic entity that has a foreign
owner must use the appropriate Form W-8.

Form W-9 (Rev. 11-2005)

Part II. Certification
To establish to the withholding agent that you are a U.S.
person, or resident alien, sign Form W-9. You may be
requested to sign by the withholding agent even if items 1, 4,
and 5 below indicate otherwise.
For a joint account, only the person whose TIN is shown in
Part I should sign (when required). Exempt recipients, see
Exempt From Backup Withholding on page 2.
Signature requirements. Complete the certification as
indicated in 1 through 5 below.
1. Interest, dividend, and barter exchange accounts
opened before 1984 and broker accounts considered
active during 1983. You must give your correct TIN, but you
do not have to sign the certification.
2. Interest, dividend, broker, and barter exchange
accounts opened after 1983 and broker accounts
considered inactive during 1983. You must sign the
certification or backup withholding will apply. If you are
subject to backup withholding and you are merely providing
your correct TIN to the requester, you must cross out item 2
in the certification before signing the form.
3. Real estate transactions. You must sign the
certification. You may cross out item 2 of the certification.
4. Other payments. You must give your correct TIN, but
you do not have to sign the certification unless you have
been notified that you have previously given an incorrect TIN.
“Other payments” include payments made in the course of
the requester’s trade or business for rents, royalties, goods
(other than bills for merchandise), medical and health care
services (including payments to corporations), payments to a
nonemployee for services, payments to certain fishing boat
crew members and fishermen, and gross proceeds paid to
attorneys (including payments to corporations).
5. Mortgage interest paid by you, acquisition or
abandonment of secured property, cancellation of debt,
qualified tuition program payments (under section 529),
IRA, Coverdell ESA, Archer MSA or HSA contributions or
distributions, and pension distributions. You must give
your correct TIN, but you do not have to sign the
certification.

Privacy Act Notice
Section 6109 of the Internal Revenue Code requires you to provide your correct TIN to persons who must file information returns
with the IRS to report interest, dividends, and certain other income paid to you, mortgage interest you paid, the acquisition or
abandonment of secured property, cancellation of debt, or contributions you made to an IRA, or Archer MSA or HSA. The IRS
uses the numbers for identification purposes and to help verify the accuracy of your tax return. The IRS may also provide this
information to the Department of Justice for civil and criminal litigation, and to cities, states, the District of Columbia, and U.S.
possessions to carry out their tax laws. We may also disclose this information to other countries under a tax treaty, to federal
and state agencies to enforce federal nontax criminal laws, or to federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies to combat
terrorism.
You must provide your TIN whether or not you are required to file a tax return. Payers must generally withhold 28% of taxable

interest paid, acquisition or abandonment of secured property, cancellation of debt, contributions to an individual retirement arrangement (IRA), and
generally, payments other than interest and dividends, you are not required to sign the certification, but you must provide your correct TIN. See the
instructions on page 3.

Purpose of Form

• Form 1099-A (acquisition or abandonment of secured property)
Use Form W-9 only if you are a U.S. person (including a resident alien), to

An individual or entity (Form W-9 requester) who is required to file an information
return with the IRS must obtain your correct taxpayer identification number (TIN)
which may be your social security number (SSN), individual taxpayer identification
number (ITIN), adoption taxpayer identification number (ATIN), or employer
identification number (EIN), to report on an information return the amount paid to
you, or other amount reportable on an information return. Examples of information
returns include, but are not limited to, the following:

If you do not return Form W-9 to the requester with a TIN, you might be subject
to backup withholding. See What is backup withholding? on page 2.

• Form 1099-INT (interest earned or paid)

3. Claim exemption from backup withholding if you are a U.S. exempt payee. If

Form W-9 (Rev. 12-2014)

Page 2

Form W-9 (Rev. 12-2014)
Note. If you are a U.S. person and a requester gives you a form other than Form
W-9 to request your TIN, you must use the requester’s form if it is substantially
similar to this Form W-9.
Definition of a U.S. person. For federal tax purposes, you are considered a U.S.
person if you are:
• An individual who is a U.S. citizen or U.S. resident alien;
• A partnership, corporation, company, or association created or organized in the
United States or under the laws of the United States;
• An estate (other than a foreign estate); or
• A domestic trust (as defined in Regulations section 301.7701-7).
Special rules for partnerships. Partnerships that conduct a trade or business in
the United States are generally required to pay a withholding tax under section
1446 on any foreign partners’ share of effectively connected taxable income from
such business. Further, in certain cases where a Form W-9 has not been received,
the rules under section 1446 require a partnership to presume that a partner is a
foreign person, and pay the section 1446 withholding tax. Therefore, if you are a
U.S. person that is a partner in a partnership conducting a trade or business in the
United States, provide Form W-9 to the partnership to establish your U.S. status
and avoid section 1446 withholding on your share of partnership income.
In the cases below, the following person must give Form W-9 to the partnership
for purposes of establishing its U.S. status and avoiding withholding on its
allocable share of net income from the partnership conducting a trade or business
in the United States:
• In the case of a disregarded entity with a U.S. owner, the U.S. owner of the
disregarded entity and not the entity;
• In the case of a grantor trust with a U.S. grantor or other U.S. owner, generally,
the U.S. grantor or other U.S. owner of the grantor trust and not the trust; and
• In the case of a U.S. trust (other than a grantor trust), the U.S. trust (other than a
grantor trust) and not the beneficiaries of the trust.
Foreign person. If you are a foreign person or the U.S. branch of a foreign bank
that has elected to be treated as a U.S. person, do not use Form W-9. Instead, use
the appropriate Form W-8 or Form 8233 (see Publication 515, Withholding of Tax
on Nonresident Aliens and Foreign Entities).
Nonresident alien who becomes a resident alien. Generally, only a nonresident
alien individual may use the terms of a tax treaty to reduce or eliminate U.S. tax on
certain types of income. However, most tax treaties contain a provision known as
a “saving clause.” Exceptions specified in the saving clause may permit an
exemption from tax to continue for certain types of income even after the payee
has otherwise become a U.S. resident alien for tax purposes.
If you are a U.S. resident alien who is relying on an exception contained in the
saving clause of a tax treaty to claim an exemption from U.S. tax on certain types
of income, you must attach a statement to Form W-9 that specifies the following
five items:
1. The treaty country. Generally, this must be the same treaty under which you
claimed exemption from tax as a nonresident alien.
2. The treaty article addressing the income.
3. The article number (or location) in the tax treaty that contains the saving
clause and its exceptions.
4. The type and amount of income that qualifies for the exemption from tax.
5. Sufficient facts to justify the exemption from tax under the terms of the treaty
article.
Example. Article 20 of the U.S.-China income tax treaty allows an exemption
from tax for scholarship income received by a Chinese student temporarily present
in the United States. Under U.S. law, this student will become a resident alien for
tax purposes if his or her stay in the United States exceeds 5 calendar years.
However, paragraph 2 of the first Protocol to the U.S.-China treaty (dated April 30,
1984) allows the provisions of Article 20 to continue to apply even after the
Chinese student becomes a resident alien of the United States. A Chinese student
who qualifies for this exception (under paragraph 2 of the first protocol) and is
relying on this exception to claim an exemption from tax on his or her scholarship
or fellowship income would attach to Form W-9 a statement that includes the
information described above to support that exemption.
If you are a nonresident alien or a foreign entity, give the requester the
appropriate completed Form W-8 or Form 8233.

Backup Withholding
What is backup withholding? Persons making certain payments to you must
under certain conditions withhold and pay to the IRS 28% of such payments. This
is called “backup withholding.” Payments that may be subject to backup
withholding include interest, tax-exempt interest, dividends, broker and barter
exchange transactions, rents, royalties, nonemployee pay, payments made in
settlement of payment card and third party network transactions, and certain
payments from fishing boat operators. Real estate transactions are not subject to
backup withholding.
You will not be subject to backup withholding on payments you receive if you
give the requester your correct TIN, make the proper certifications, and report all
your taxable interest and dividends on your tax return.
Payments you receive will be subject to backup withholding if:
1. You do not furnish your TIN to the requester,
2. You do not certify your TIN when required (see the Part II instructions on page
3 for details),

3. The IRS tells the requester that you furnished an incorrect TIN,
4. The IRS tells you that you are subject to backup withholding because you did
not report all your interest and dividends on your tax return (for reportable interest
and dividends only), or
5. You do not certify to the requester that you are not subject to backup
withholding under 4 above (for reportable interest and dividend accounts opened
after 1983 only).
Certain payees and payments are exempt from backup withholding. See Exempt
payee code on page 3 and the separate Instructions for the Requester of Form
W-9 for more information.
Also see Special rules for partnerships above.

What is FATCA reporting?
The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) requires a participating foreign
financial institution to report all United States account holders that are specified
United States persons. Certain payees are exempt from FATCA reporting. See
Exemption from FATCA reporting code on page 3 and the Instructions for the
Requester of Form W-9 for more information.

Updating Your Information
You must provide updated information to any person to whom you claimed to be
an exempt payee if you are no longer an exempt payee and anticipate receiving
reportable payments in the future from this person. For example, you may need to
provide updated information if you are a C corporation that elects to be an S
corporation, or if you no longer are tax exempt. In addition, you must furnish a new
Form W-9 if the name or TIN changes for the account; for example, if the grantor
of a grantor trust dies.

Penalties
Failure to furnish TIN. If you fail to furnish your correct TIN to a requester, you are
subject to a penalty of $50 for each such failure unless your failure is due to
reasonable cause and not to willful neglect.
Civil penalty for false information with respect to withholding. If you make a
false statement with no reasonable basis that results in no backup withholding,
you are subject to a $500 penalty.
Criminal penalty for falsifying information. Willfully falsifying certifications or
affirmations may subject you to criminal penalties including fines and/or
imprisonment.
Misuse of TINs. If the requester discloses or uses TINs in violation of federal law,
the requester may be subject to civil and criminal penalties.

Specific Instructions
Line 1
You must enter one of the following on this line; do not leave this line blank. The
name should match the name on your tax return.
If this Form W-9 is for a joint account, list first, and then circle, the name of the
person or entity whose number you entered in Part I of Form W-9.
a. Individual. Generally, enter the name shown on your tax return. If you have
changed your last name without informing the Social Security Administration (SSA)
of the name change, enter your first name, the last name as shown on your social
security card, and your new last name.
Note. ITIN applicant: Enter your individual name as it was entered on your Form
W-7 application, line 1a. This should also be the same as the name you entered on
the Form 1040/1040A/1040EZ you filed with your application.
b. Sole proprietor or single-member LLC. Enter your individual name as
shown on your 1040/1040A/1040EZ on line 1. You may enter your business, trade,
or “doing business as” (DBA) name on line 2.
c. Partnership, LLC that is not a single-member LLC, C Corporation, or S
Corporation. Enter the entity's name as shown on the entity's tax return on line 1
and any business, trade, or DBA name on line 2.
d. Other entities. Enter your name as shown on required U.S. federal tax
documents on line 1. This name should match the name shown on the charter or
other legal document creating the entity. You may enter any business, trade, or
DBA name on line 2.
e. Disregarded entity. For U.S. federal tax purposes, an entity that is
disregarded as an entity separate from its owner is treated as a “disregarded
entity.” See Regulations section 301.7701-2(c)(2)(iii). Enter the owner's name on
line 1. The name of the entity entered on line 1 should never be a disregarded
entity. The name on line 1 should be the name shown on the income tax return on
which the income should be reported. For example, if a foreign LLC that is treated
as a disregarded entity for U.S. federal tax purposes has a single owner that is a
U.S. person, the U.S. owner's name is required to be provided on line 1. If the
direct owner of the entity is also a disregarded entity, enter the first owner that is
not disregarded for federal tax purposes. Enter the disregarded entity's name on
line 2, “Business name/disregarded entity name.” If the owner of the disregarded
entity is a foreign person, the owner must complete an appropriate Form W-8
instead of a Form W-9. This is the case even if the foreign person has a U.S. TIN.

If you have a business name, trade name, DBA name, or disregarded entity name,
you may enter it on line 2.

Line 3
Check the appropriate box in line 3 for the U.S. federal tax classification of the
person whose name is entered on line 1. Check only one box in line 3.

box and enter “P” in the space provided. If the LLC has filed Form 8832 or 2553 to
be taxed as a corporation, check the “Limited Liability Company” box and in the
space provided enter “C” for C corporation or “S” for S corporation. If it is a
single-member LLC that is a disregarded entity, do not check the “Limited Liability
Company” box; instead check the first box in line 3 “Individual/sole proprietor or
single-member LLC.”

However, the following payments made to a corporation and reportable on Form
1099-MISC are not exempt from backup withholding: medical and health care
payments, attorneys' fees, gross proceeds paid to an attorney reportable under
section 6045(f), and payments for services paid by a federal executive agency.
Exemption from FATCA reporting code. The following codes identify payees
that are exempt from reporting under FATCA. These codes apply to persons
submitting this form for accounts maintained outside of the United States by
certain foreign financial institutions. Therefore, if you are only submitting this form
for an account you hold in the United States, you may leave this field blank.
Consult with the person requesting this form if you are uncertain if the financial

If you are asked to complete Form W-9 but do not have a TIN, apply for a TIN
and write “Applied For” in the space for the TIN, sign and date the form, and give it
to the requester. For interest and dividend payments, and certain payments made
with respect to readily tradable instruments, generally you will have 60 days to get
a TIN and give it to the requester before you are subject to backup withholding on
payments. The 60-day rule does not apply to other types of payments. You will be
subject to backup withholding on all such payments until you provide your TIN to
the requester.
Note. Entering “Applied For” means that you have already applied for a TIN or that
you intend to apply for one soon.
Caution: A disregarded U.S. entity that has a foreign owner must use the
appropriate Form W-8.

Secure Your Tax Records from Identity Theft
Identity theft occurs when someone uses your personal information such as your
name, SSN, or other identifying information, without your permission, to commit
fraud or other crimes. An identity thief may use your SSN to get a job or may file a
tax return using your SSN to receive a refund.
To reduce your risk:
• Protect your SSN,
• Ensure your employer is protecting your SSN, and
• Be careful when choosing a tax preparer.
If your tax records are affected by identity theft and you receive a notice from
the IRS, respond right away to the name and phone number printed on the IRS
notice or letter.
If your tax records are not currently affected by identity theft but you think you
are at risk due to a lost or stolen purse or wallet, questionable credit card activity
or credit report, contact the IRS Identity Theft Hotline at 1-800-908-4490 or submit
Form 14039.
For more information, see Publication 4535, Identity Theft Prevention and Victim
Assistance.
Victims of identity theft who are experiencing economic harm or a system
problem, or are seeking help in resolving tax problems that have not been resolved
through normal channels, may be eligible for Taxpayer Advocate Service (TAS)
assistance. You can reach TAS by calling the TAS toll-free case intake line at
1-877-777-4778 or TTY/TDD 1-800-829-4059.
Protect yourself from suspicious emails or phishing schemes. Phishing is the
creation and use of email and websites designed to mimic legitimate business
emails and websites. The most common act is sending an email to a user falsely
claiming to be an established legitimate enterprise in an attempt to scam the user
into surrendering private information that will be used for identity theft.
The IRS does not initiate contacts with taxpayers via emails. Also, the IRS does
not request personal detailed information through email or ask taxpayers for the
PIN numbers, passwords, or similar secret access information for their credit card,
bank, or other financial accounts.
If you receive an unsolicited email claiming to be from the IRS, forward this
message to phishing@irs.gov. You may also report misuse of the IRS name, logo,
or other IRS property to the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration
(TIGTA) at 1-800-366-4484. You can forward suspicious emails to the Federal
Trade Commission at: spam@uce.gov or contact them at www.ftc.gov/idtheft or
1-877-IDTHEFT (1-877-438-4338).
Visit IRS.gov to learn more about identity theft and how to reduce your risk.

For this type of account:
7. Disregarded entity not owned by an
individual
8. A valid trust, estate, or pension trust

Privacy Act Notice
Section 6109 of the Internal Revenue Code requires you to provide your correct
TIN to persons (including federal agencies) who are required to file information
returns with the IRS to report interest, dividends, or certain other income paid to
you; mortgage interest you paid; the acquisition or abandonment of secured
property; the cancellation of debt; or contributions you made to an IRA, Archer
MSA, or HSA. The person collecting this form uses the information on the form to
file information returns with the IRS, reporting the above information. Routine uses
of this information include giving it to the Department of Justice for civil and
criminal litigation and to cities, states, the District of Columbia, and U.S.
commonwealths and possessions for use in administering their laws. The
information also may be disclosed to other countries under a treaty, to federal and
state agencies to enforce civil and criminal laws, or to federal law enforcement and
intelligence agencies to combat terrorism. You must provide your TIN whether or
