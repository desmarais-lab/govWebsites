signature is validated. Mr. Soliman stated an email is sent to the filer with a unique ID,
which is to be sent back to the administrator for a unique match.
Mr. Ricketts requested the Internet staff research the possibility of filing permits online
for the townships.
Implementation will begin in January 2004.
RFP Evaluation Committee
The structure previously recommended and approved was made up of the following:
IT Board Chairman + 2 Board members
Two County Representatives
Two City Representatives
CIO and Deputy of Contract Compliance
Mr. Ricketts inquired if a member of the Board has an obligation that does not permit
them to attend the meeting, is it possible to send a proxy to gather data.
Mr. Chinn the Division Director in Corporation Counsel appointed by Mayor Peterson
answered Board questions regarding the committee.
In response to Mr. Ricketts question Mr. Chinn stated there are two choices. The Board’s
ultimate goal is to have participation by Board members in the development of the RFP
criteria as well as the review process of responses from vendors.
First, there cannot be a quorum of the Board sit on the committee as a developer and
reviewer of the RFP and keep the information confidential. A quorum of the IT Board is
four members, not including the CIO. In government the majority of business is done
publicly. This is a unique circumstance where the law permits and requires the committee
to keep information confidential because that is what engenders the competitive process.
The theory is it gets you to a better contract in the end than you would have gotten if
every single piece of information were public from the onset.
The two goals of the Board are:
1. To make it competitive and therefore keep all or some of the information for a period
of time confidential and
2. Have some members of the Board participate directly in the process.
These two goals are going to compete at various stages. Mr. Chinn suggested two ideas:
1. The Board could create an official committee that is open and if done in this
manner the options are:
- Gain: 3 members superintending all the processes that need supervised

IT Board Minutes
Page 3
-

Lose: the ability to have deliberative discussion about what the bid details
are
Example: if you would like to have free willing deliberative
discussion with candor about problems have been identified over
the years with the current contract, or ideas about the future and
not open it up to the public for comment, the Board cannot do that
under this arrangement. The only thing that can be kept
confidential and should be confidential is the actual content of the
RFP responses when they are received under the Operating
Agreement statute before a final recommendation is made to the
Board.

Definition: (b) "Governing body" means two (2) or more individuals who are: (3) any
committee appointed directly by the governing body or its presiding officer to which
authority to take official action upon public business has been delegated. An agent or
agents appointed by the governing body to conduct collective bargaining on behalf of the
governing body does not constitute a governing body for purposes of this chapter. IC
5:14-1.5-2 (b) sect. 3
2. If the CIO makes a recommendation and the Board ratifies the recommendation it
would not fall within the word directly in the definition of a governing body. The
competing concern that is engendered is those competitive processes in an
extremely important contract to get the best contract in the end.
Ms. Sadler clarified if the committee was directly appointed by the Board, that committee
would have to comply with the Open Door Law, the committee would have to meet
publicly prior to receiving any RFP responses and any deliberations as to what constitutes
the RFP would be open. Once the responses were opened the meetings would be held in
executive session.
Mr. Chinn confirmed she was correct, the Board may keep the responses confidential
until there is a formal recommendation to present to the Board. At a minimum the Board
has vested an ability to keep the contents of the responses secret until the appropriate
time, which is strongly supported in the general RFP statute. Procedurally what it
contemplates is a best and final offer negotiation. The Board will absolutely want the
secrecy between the proposals.
Mr. Ricketts inquired if there was a recommendation on the structure and if the positions
were filled within the next thirty days, is there anything that keeps that team from
operating until the next Board meeting at which time the Board would ratify the team
chosen. Mr. Borgmann stated there is nothing that would hinder the team from starting
once it is formed.
Mr. Ricketts in reference to his initial question asked about the potential of sending a
proxy. Mr. Chinn stated as long as there is no quorum and, the Board does not directly
appoint the committee, any Board member interested in the meeting can attend.

IT Board Minutes
Page 4
Mr. Chinn in reply to Mr. Ricketts question regarding the scoring procedures stated the
best scenario would be to have the same members scoring every time. If it is not done in
that manner it is not inherently jeopardizing the credibility of the scoring exercise
especially if the scoring is objective.
Ms. Womacks inquired about the Board members who may wish to attend the meetings
as merely audience members. Mr. Chinn replied a member couldn’t attend if the result is
a quorum. Members in attendance are deemed to be there in official capacity as a Board
member. A suggestion would be to have rotating attendance by Board members.
Minutes and work products can be confidential and distributed as stated under the
Records Law.
Ms. Sadler stated Mr. Chinn had outlined the Board’s options very well. Ms. Sadler said
she believes the Board should appoint the committee. She would like input on who is
making the evaluations and she is uncomfortable with the concept of “getting around” the
open door law. She believes there are great advantages to doing everything publicly prior
to the RFP responses. The vendors may be able to glean a lot of information about what
the Board is looking for etc. It is her understanding the Board may want to keep some
deliberations confidential, but she feels the advantages far outweigh the other option. If
all meetings are public, then any Board member can stop by any time because it is
already an open meeting. Finally, the best scenario is to have the same team throughout
the evaluation process. If the Board formally appoints the committee, there is an
expectation that given few exceptions, those team members will be doing the evaluations
and not various staff members throughout the duration.
Mr. Chinn commented if this is the route the Board chooses to go and all meetings are
open, there absolutely cannot be any conversations regarding price or any expectations
the team may have regarding pricing. Nothing is more corrupting than discussions of
price when doing a competitive bid process.
Ms. Sadler motioned to formally appoint the RFP Evaluation Committee with as many
specific members as possible, Ms. Womacks seconded. Ms. Davis stated she believed at
the next meeting the Board would decide whether to appoint the committee or ratify the
recommendation. Ms. Davis stated she was still absorbing the information Mr. Chinn
had stated and would like more time to decide which direction would be best.
Judge Payne asked Mr. Chinn whether the formal appointment, or ratification of a
recommendation was most common. Mr. Chinn answered most of his experience was of
a confidential nature. If there is an official appointment, all meetings will have to meet
the 48-hour open door notice policy.
Mr. Hineline voiced his concern with employee turnover in regards to open meeting
conversations dealing with “what if” topics.

IT Board Minutes
Page 5
Ms. Sadler restated her motion to say the Board acknowledge the formalized process that
would be subject to public access laws and the members affirmed today with further
appointments to made as they become available; herself, Mr. Ricketts, Earl Morgan,
Nadeen Biddinger, Mark Renner, and Mike Hineline, Ms. Womacks seconded and the
motion passed by a 4-2 vote. Mr. Turner and Judge Payne both voted against the motion.
Document Imaging Discussion
Mr. Ricketts stated a meeting was held on September 10th, and at that time several issues
were brought up including the need for document imaging enterprise wide. Locating the
money to fund this initiative will be difficult, Mr. Ricketts believes the IT Board needs to
appoint a governing board to pursue the document imaging project.
Ms. Sadler motioned to allow the president of the IT Board to choose a person outside of
the Board to appoint people to the Document Imaging Board, Ms. Womacks seconded
and the motion passed unanimously.
Mr. Ricketts requested a detailed discussion be held at the next IT Board meeting.
Status Updates
CIO Report
Mr. Hineline stated the report is as submitted.
ACS Report
Mr. Nero stated the ACS Report stood as submitted.
JTAC Court Management System Project Update
Mr. Flynn distributed reports concerning JTAC’s progress. There is no definite timeline
yet. Once the project passes the validation phase a more definite timeline will be
developed.
Marion County is one of the leading counties for this project however, Clay County was
selected for the pilot project because they do not have a current system in place.
September 30, 2004 is the date set for the completion of the design phase. Mr. Flynn
believes it may be difficult to meet that deadline. Mr. Thornsberry from DAI stated he
believed that deadline will be met, but the changes that CA and JTAC will need to
respond to may cause time constraints.
Ms. Sadler stated Justice Sullivan relayed the urgency of this project at a meeting she
attended. Judge Bradford also made it very clear this project needed to be accomplished
and Marion County’s system should not be fit into another County’s design scheme.

IT Board Minutes

Ms. Sadler committed in the meeting she attended to have the IT Board provide their
influence and participation to help move this project along. Mr. Ricketts stated he would
like updates as well as solicitation from the Justice Agency for additional support
whenever necessary.

SUBJECT:

IMAGIS Additional Appropriation Request

For a better understanding of the relationship between ISA and IMAGIS, here is some historical
information. In the mid 80’s, Indianapolis needed new maps to assist with drainage, trash pick
up, and other citizen services. A meeting was held with 100 interested parties, from which 28
expressed interest in sharing the cost of building a system. IMAGIS was formed as a multiparticipant, public-private geographic information system (GIS) consortium for Indianapolis and
Marion County, Indiana, which developed a multipurpose, digital basemap of Marion County,
containing layers of information.
The administration of IMAGIS was transferred from the City of Indianapolis to ISA during the
2002 budget cycle. At that time, it was determined that IMAGIS could operate annually with an
appropriation of approximately $400,000. However, over the recent months there have been
increased requests by the IMAGIS board. The board recently approved the LIDAR and Ortho
projects for the IMAGIS consortium.
This increase in projects by the IMAGIS board has a direct correlation to their funding
requirements. Therefore, an additional appropriation has been deemed necessary for IMAGIS to
successfully complete these projects. During the budget preparation for 2004, ISA planned for
additional activity and increased the appropriation to $536,500.
In addition to the administration of IMAGIS’s being transferred from the City of Indianapolis to
ISA, the revenues from the IMAGIS consortium were transferred to the ISA Internal Service
Fund. These revenues are utilized to cover the expenses associated with the Consortiums
operation. Therefore, ISA is requesting the Information Technology Board authorize ISA to
request an additional appropriation of $183,000 so that IMAGIS can continue their work on the
projects requested by the IMAGIS Board. The current IMAGIS fund balance of $551,104.23
will fund this appropriation.
Please let me know if you have any questions concerning this fiscal ordinance request.

EXHIBIT B RESOLUTION #03-08
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY BOARD
Board Resolution to approve an additional appropriation from the ISA
Internal Services Fund for the IMAGIS Consortium.
WHEREAS, the Information Services Agency deposits the revenue collected for the
IMAGIS Consortium into the Information Services Agency Internal Service Fund and
funds are available in the IMAGIS portion of this fund; and
WHEREAS, an additional appropriation of $183,000 is needed to cover IMAGIS
expenses for the remainder of 2003; and
WHEREAS, the Information Technology Board agrees in principle to the appropriation
request,
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the Information Technology Board
authorizes the Information Services Agency to request an additional appropriation of
$183,000 from the ISA Internal Services Fund to accommodate IMAGIS needs.

CIO Comments
IT Board Members,
This last month has gone past so swiftly. We held a kickoff meeting regarding
Document Management, led by John Nero. The attendance and feedback at this
brainstorming session was very productive. The attendees all seem to sense
that a technology like document management can play a major role in improving
efficiencies in local government. But, we do not know at this time what the true
impact could be and how to fund it in total. The consensus was that more study
is needed to better understand the opportunities for sharing and then we can use
this knowledge to develop strategies for deployment and funding. A series of
action items were developed to help move this forward with the biggest being a
review by ACS Business Consultants of the different forma and who uses them
by department and agency. We will be discussing this in more detail as the
process progresses.
Our important Constituent Relationship Management (CRM) system RFP is on
the street. We had a good number of vendors at the pre-bid meeting held
September 19th. The City will have opened the responses and started the review

CIO Report to IT Board

Exhibit C

Page 3 of 3

process by the time we meet at our next meeting. We are all looking forward to
moving ahead with this very visible project.
As you can see from the number of bullet items under the Project Highlights
section, we have spent a significant amount of effort on the Startup activities of
the RFP Team. We have a good cross section of our customer base
represented and this will be a focused process with fairly tight timeframes. We
published the Request for Information (RFI) seeking ideas and suggestions from
the vendors in this market. We received 23 responses that are being reviewed
now. Please let us know if you would like to review them. We can make them
available to you electronically.
Development of the scopes of work that describe our activities and our
requirements for our next agreement will take a lot of work and focus on all of our
parts. Decisions will be made shortly on how we want to structure our next
agreement, including what services are included or excluded. Additionally, the
ways we want to change the agreement must be defined and documented so
that we can allow effective competition for the services.
Much of the RFP Team’s discussion has been around the process they will use
to communicate with the different areas of affected parties. The biggest area is
our stakeholders and the customers of these IT services. While we will be
working on a pretty tight timeline, we are dedicated to gaining appropriate
feedback and suggestions regarding department and agency IT needs at multiple
points during the process. We are developing a specific communications plan
just to address these different areas and track our activities as we move ahead.
Getting to a final set of IT solutions that are flexible and meet the needs of all our
customers is the primary goal of this process.
I look forward to discussing these items with you at the IT Board meeting.

Monthly Highlights and Statistics
September 2003
From the Account
Manager’s Desk
The month of September was
fairly typical for ACS and the
computing enterprise at the
City/County.
Many important
activities took place in support of
our more than 5,000 customers and the highlights of
some of those efforts are included in this month’s report.
In addition, ACS technical staff was engaged in a critical
database recovery effort for the JUSTIS mainframe
system. No data was lost and downtime was kept to a
minimum thanks to the coordinative efforts of MCJA,
DAI and ACS professionals.
One of the significant activities in which I was
personally involved was the half-day session for
Document Imaging & Management vision-setting.
I
was pleased to host such a great discussion of
City/County leaders’ ideas, issues and visions for
addressing the possibilities associated with the use of this
wonderful technology. ACS Business Consultants are
currently following up with the attendees to gather
further information and to keep the momentum going. It
is hoped that a strategic vision and plan for practical and
affordable use of document imaging/management will be
the next major milestone in this effort.

Coroner Close to Production on
Document Management Application
The County Coroner document management (DM)
project has entered User Acceptance Testing. Chief
Deputy Coroner Frances Kelly plans to continue testing
throughout October and November. The project will
then enter production status December 1st. The contents
of the DM system will be day-forward. The department
plans to input documents and data files for open cases
into the system as they are generated. Then, as the
investigation proceeds, the case can be accessed by any
staff member from their own desk rather than retrieving
it from a central location. In fact, everyone could view
the document simultaneously. This will also eliminate
trying to find a document if it is not in the central
repository. The estimated scanning volume is 65,000
pages/year representing 1300 cases.

JUSTIS System Problems
Database Recovery Procedures

Require

On 9/22/03 the mainframe JUSTIS system required
emergency intervention and database recovery as a result of
complications caused by an IBM system software trace
tool. There was a scheduled CA DATACOM upgrade to
version 10.0, which ultimately caused a mainframe lock up.
When ACS engineers started the IBM DTF trace facility,
the mainframe went into what’s known as a wait state, or in
other words, the mainframe went down. ACS database
administrators discovered that evening that the automated
recovery of the JUSTIS database during restart did not
process the in-flight (active at the time of system failure)
transactions correctly, Steve Miller, Kathy Jarrett and Gary
Johnson spent several hours reviewing the problem with
CA support.
It was eventually decided to wait until the following day to
make a decision on how to recover and notify all users.
During that time, the JUSTIS system was available and
very few cases were negatively affected. DBAs then
worked that night to rebuild all JUSTIS database indexes
(approximately 200 million records), and then ran a
forward recovery of the 8-minute time period that was in
error during the restart. The recovery was completed at
3:30 AM the following morning. The recovery reprocessed
the transactions for the time period in question.

HB1001 Coming to a Finish
The House Bill 1001 remediation project is almost
completed. The Cycle A close and distribution programs
were run with no major problems. The Fall tax bills were
produced and were sent offsite to be printed by a vendor
selected by the Treasurer's Office.
Of the 74 programs in the After Spring Bill processing,
only 5 are in the UAT phase waiting User Acceptance
Testing and final approval by the Clients. The other 69
have been approved by the Clients and moved to
production or required no change.

City/County Leaders Take First Steps
toward Enterprise Document Imaging &
Management Vision

On September 10th, 2003, John Nero hosted an Enterprise
Document Management Meeting for several City/County
leaders. The meeting came as a direct result of the growing
interest and need for document management within the
Page 1

City/County.
The group agreed that document
management should be considered from an enterprise
level. They have identified their goals & objectives,
critical success factors, issues & obstacles, benefits as
well as the next steps in organizing and managing
document management needs with an enterprise
perspective. The synergy and momentum are present.
ACS is looking forward to participating in the
development of the City/County document management
strategy.

DELL wireless client issues have not been remedied;
however, ISA has agreed to let IPD use the DELL
wireless clients already purchased until DELL can
resolve the security issues (pre-stored log-in
credentials).

Major Technical Project Updates
•

Novell NetWare Upgrade
This project involves the upgrade of all servers
currently operating under NetWare 5.1 to 6.0. With
non-stop access, Net-ready security, and high
availability, NetWare 6 delivers file storage,
printing, directory, e-mail, and database resources
that can be accessed as one Net across all type of
networks---corporate and public, wired and wireless,
storage systems and client desktops.

The production version of Access Point Configuration
is being installed on the 3rd floor police wing for final
proof of concept and bug identification. Testing of
connectivity and desired functionality will be
performed by IPD data processing staff before final
deployment to field officers.
•

NetWare 6 provides solutions that simplify the
system administration responsibility while at the
same time increasing the efficiency of the end user.
Several new products help end users access,
synchronize, and print their files from any location.
Novell NetWare 5.1 to 6.0 was deployed to three
servers (IMCIS4, FSPROPMAIL and IMCANW1).
This will utilize the servers multiple processors
more effectively and allow additional web services
for employees to access files.
•

MCSD Training Academy
In an effort to consolidate some of its staff and
provide improved infrastructure, the Marion County
Sheriff’s Department is remodeling the MCSD
Training Academy located at 3229 N Shadeland. In
addition to the new internal wiring that was
installed, four new network switches were
configured and installed. A fiber connection
installed by Time Warner between the MCSD
Academy and the IPD Training Academy was also
installed. Although the fiber link between the two
academies has been tested and is functional, it will
not carry City/County data until the SONET from
the CCB to the IPD TA has been completed.
Now that the temporary connectivity between the
IPD Training Academy and the City/County
building is in place, ACS is waiting for MCSD to
provide a maintenance window to allow migration
of services to the new circuit.

Monthly Highlights and Statistics
September 2003

IPD Wireless Initiative
The final presentation of quotes were presented to
customer
for
review
after
re-bidding
all
communications gear, wiring, and electrical. A bill of
materials has been delivered to IPD for approval.

State Connectivity
ACS met with the State to finalize and agree upon a
strategy for long term connectivity between the
City/County enterprise and the State of Indiana. This
connection is needed for compliance with the federal
mandate of a single source program at the State level
requiring all counties to use the same program for
Child support administration. FSSA (Family Social
Services Administration) is Indiana’s administrator of
this new program.
A 3-node self-healing gigabit Ethernet connection
based on fiber technology was agreed upon as the
solution for this project. ACS coordinated a
presentation with CityNet and the various State
agencies.
At this point neither the City nor the State of Indiana
have ordered the services, and there is no connectivity
for JUSTIS programmers or a permanent link between
the CCB and the IGC. Several projects are now close
to implementation (Jan. 1 timeframe) with no means
for TCP/IP connectivity.

•

Head End Re-Engineering
The purpose of this project is to provide connectivity
and distribution capabilities to allow for the IPD
Training Academy to become an alternate site for City
/County business re-location in the event of a disaster.
Once this project is finished, remote sites will still
have connectivity to network resources even if the
City/County building is disabled.
The headend circuits will be cut over in a phased
approach, one head at a time, with completion
expected by the end of September. ACS is still
waiting for implementation of a 150Mb link between

Page 2

the CCB and the IPD TA to begin moving forward
with the head end migration. Projected installation
date was 9/26. Installation has been escalated to
SBC management.

•

The Systems group successfully installed Datacom
10.0 in the mainframe environment. Advantage CADatacom Database CICS Services Option supports full
multithreading and multitasking functions transparent
to application programs to ensure exceptionally high
throughput. It enables users to control online system
resources and display status information online and
provides online tools for problem debugging. This
facilitates quick resolution of application code logic
problems through debug tools as well as the ability to
easily simulate program login online through test
facilities.

•

Operations moved several updated procedures into
production and successfully completed the execution
of all jobs required to create and print fall tax bills for
the Marion County Treasurer. Additionally, processes
were placed into production to facilitate the electronic
transfer of a portion of the output to a third party
service provider who was contracted by the Treasurer
to print tax bills.

That escalation resulted in an offer from SBC
management to provide, at no cost to the City, a
temporary DS3 circuit and all associated equipment
until the permanent connection can be installed. The

Improved Infrastructure and Processes
•

•

•

In order to better serve the customers at the Indy
Parks Broad Ripple Pool, the Point-of-Sale (POS)
computer in the pool shack was connected to the
network utilizing wireless technology, requiring the
installation of additional cabling, access point,
antenna and wireless NIC card in the PC. This
solution eliminates the need for dial-up access to run
the Point-of-Sale application and eliminates the need
for the modem line to be installed every summer. As
an added benefit, it gives public safety officers that
have wireless laptops in their patrol cars the ability
to pull into the park’s parking lot and access the
City/County network.
The iHEAT application allows the ACS technicians
access to the HEAT database allowing the
monitoring and updating of HEAT tickets from
remote locations via a web browser. The server that
iHEAT was running on could not be patched
because the process would break the application and
is also not supported by the vendor. This presented a
security risk to the City/County network and the IPD
and IFD applications running on the same server as
iHEAT. To resolve the issue, Frank Thomas III
created a web page that links directly to HEAT so
there is no further need for iHEAT. This will result
in a future savings of approximately $500 per year
in maintenance support fees, as well as allowing the
server team to maintain security and patch
management on server IMCANT6 while preventing
future disruptions to IPD and IFD.
The midrange group installed the web component of
the Election System & Software (ES&S) iReport
software. This effort allows for the posting of
election results in near real-time to the indygov.org
site, viewable in an HTML or spreadsheet format.
The screen will automatically refresh itself as the
ballots are being counted electronically.

On the Move
The following customer relocations were
completed or are currently in progress:
Sheriff’s Department Training Academy
The Marion County Sheriff’s Department
has consolidated many of its departments to new locations
throughout the county. A new office expansion has been
concluded at the MCSD Training Academy on Shadeland
Avenue that included a new two-story complex that was
previously warehouse space and the renovation of the
training area. The construction included a new data
network and wiring closet for the new offices and new 100Mb switches for the whole facility. Also included was a
new high-speed data connection to IPD’s Training
Academy located on Post Road. The Post Road facility is

Page 5

the location of a SONET ring connection to the City
County Building.
The move into the newly constructed space was done on
an accelerated basis. ACS was able to respond to the
Sheriff’s Department changing schedule in a timely
manner, and all users were quickly reconnected. By fast
tracking the installation the new network equipment was
in place and operating in time for the first move. Four
groups of users were involved in this move.

From the Tech Bench
Security
Security has become an increasingly important aspect of
the work of ISA/ACS. With recent outbreaks of
computer viruses, the network group continues to work
to ensure that the latest antivirus program is enabled and
working properly to reduce the chance of a virus
invading your PC. To help with this process, please
verify that your PC is protected. If your PC has a small
gold shield in the taskbar at the lower right of the
monitor screen then the antivirus program is installed. If
there is no shield or the shield has an exclamation mark
over it, then your PC may not be protected.
We presently have some of the best security measures
available to you in our network environment. Every
effort is being made to protect your PC and the integrity
of the Indianapolis/Marion County network. There are
measures you can also take to help as well. First, if you
leave your workstation (even for a minute) be sure to
"secure it". Most of the newer PCs (Windows XP and
Windows 2000) can be "locked" to keep others from
utilizing your logon for malicious purposes. To lock one
of these PCs, simply depress the "Ctrl, Alt and delete"
buttons at the same time. A small box will appear on
your screen. One of the buttons on this screen says "lock
workstation". When you press this button, it locks out
any attempts to use your PC while you are away. To
unlock the PC, type in your password and the PC will
immediately be available…just as you left it.
Other ways to assist us with security is to shut down your
PC each evening, and never share your username and
password with anyone else.

2) Highlight “TOOLS” in the taskbar at the top of
the page
3) Highlight “OPTIONS” at the bottom of the
dropdown box.
4) Double Click on “ENVIRONMENT” and click on
the signature tab at the top of the dialog box.
5) Check the “SIGNATURE” Box and type in your
information (e.g. Name, address, telephone
number, etc.)
6) Check either the “Automatically Add” or “Prompt
before adding” button at the left of the signature
information box and click the “OK” button.
Now each time you send an email, you will either
automatically add or be prompted to add the signature
information you just entered.
To edit other environmental options in GroupWise:
1) Open GroupWise by double clicking on the icon
on the desktop
2) Highlight “TOOLS” in the taskbar at the top of
the page
3) Highlight “OPTIONS” at the bottom of the
dropdown box.
4) Double Click on “ENVIRONMENT” and click on
the signature tab at the top of the dialog box.
From this screen you can use the GENERAL tab to enable
spell checking, set GroupWise notification to launch at
start up (NOTE: this option can allow others to view your
mail from your workstation if you leave your desk so be
careful), and you can enable spell checking before you send
an email.
Using the Quick Launch Bar
Want an Office Shortcut Bar, but don't want the system
resources used by such an application? Then use the
Windows Quick Launch Bar. In order to enable this
function, Right click on the Start Button and click on the
Taskbar tab. In order for the Quick Launch to show up,
check the Show Quick Launch option and also uncheck the
Lock the taskbar option. This will allow you to resize the
Quick Launch and add shortcuts to it. You will now see
the Quick Launch sow up next to the Start Button. You
can now drag and drop shortcuts to it and recreate the
Office Shortcut bar without taking up the system resources.

GroupWise
Tired of typing your “signature” at the end of your
email? You can automatically add signature information
to each email you send by editing the environmental
settings within the GroupWise application. Here’s how:
1) Open GroupWise by double clicking on the icon
on the desktop

JUSTIS Replacement Project Report to
Marion County IT Board
As of October 8th, 2003
Project Progress
• Design Validation
o Design Document Review – We are in the final stages of review of the CMS
design documents. Marion County Project leaders have conducted meetings
with various Agencies to get there input into additional changes to the
system. Where we have not been able to meet with Agencies, they have
received a copy of the design documents for review. A description of the
Design documents will be added to the end of this report. Marion County
Project managers are working with CA to have them facilitate a review of
the Financial Design Document for Marion County personnel. On
Wednesday and Thursday (10/8 – 10/9), CA Project Managers, JTAC
Chairman (Justice Sullivan, JTAC Director (Kurt Snyder), Melinda Haag
and other Marion County representatives will be meeting to review all of the
Change Requests (CR’s) for approval. They must decide and prioritize on
those changes requests the State is willing to fund.
o Looking for the Homeless – better known to those on the project as Data
Mapping of JUSTIS Data Elements to the CMS Data Model. This effort was
conducted will allow us to be more confident in the functionality of the new
system along with making great strides in analysis for Data Conversion,
Reports and Local Interfaces.
Data Mapping has been completed – the result is a list of homeless
data categorized as follows:
• 835 data elements that did not successfully map to the CMS.
• 149 Have been determined to be needed. These will require a
CR for them to be added to the CMS system. This number
may go down depending on decisions regarding how prejustice criminal history (already on JUSTIS) will get
converted to the CMS.
• 5 Would be nice to have (so will probably be eliminated)
• 473 Have been determined to not be needed
• 132 Will be handled in Conversion
• 61 Were determined to be required and would have a home
when the CMS design was completed
• 15 were tied to issues that have been resolved and have now
been sent back to the Data Mapping team for completion.
•

ISA/ACS involvement –
o Bruce Turner from the ISA office has now been invited to the
JTAC/CA/Marion County Status project status meetings. He will be the eyes
and ears for Mike Hineline.
o Mike Hineline, Jim Flynn, Bruce Turner and Nadeen Biddinger have begun
regular meetings to discuss the CMS project along with how ISA/ACS can
help with the project.
Page 1 of 1

JUSTIS Replacement Project Report to
Marion County IT Board
As of October 8th, 2003
o Marty Barnes and Jill Snodgrass from ACS are continuing to attend the
status meetings as well.
o Marv Thornsberry, Rich Harris, Jim Flynn, Joe Lex, Bruce Turner, Jill
Snodgrass, Ed Vargo and Kevin Ortell continue to meet on a regular basis to
discuss the CMS project. Our main topic thus far has been connectivity.
•

Connectivity – Mike Hineline has decided not to wait for the State to make a
decision regarding long term connectivity and the possibility of consolidating
several connections into one. ISA/ACS is researching other solutions. Mike can fill
you in on the alternatives. We have had a request in to the State DoIT agency for
nearly 3 months to establish temporary connectivity to allow the DAI staff and
others to connect to the Servers where portions of the CMS system are located.
Mike has helped escalate this issue with the State CIO office as well. Marion County
Project leaders have asked for Justice Sullivan (via Kurt Snyder) to help with
escalating the connectivity issues with the State.

•

Your help will be required –
o Reports and Forms – although temporarily on hold, there is a project team
consisting of Marion County and JTAC personnel to define and create
reports that will come from the new CMS. This team will be visiting with
each Agency and department currently receiving reports from JUSTIS to get
their input on needed reports.
o Local Interfaces – some work regarding interfaces with the MCSD Jail
Inmate Management System (JIMS) and IPD’s AFIS system has been done.
This team is hampered somewhat due to the CMS Data Model not being
complete.
o Quality Assurance – Rol Parsons (DAI), Mike McConaha and Jim Flynn
are participating on a project team to define and implement test cases to test
the functionality of the system. There is a kick off meeting being planned
for Monday 10/20/03 to complete the analysis for QV (Business Scenario
Testing). Several Agencies will be contacted for help in this area.

•

Hardware and Software Requirements – Communication regarding this topic has
been sent to all Internal and External Agencies that currently use the JUSTIS
system. Many internal customers and external customers have Desktop equipment
not capable of running the new CMS. Statistics regarding the shortfall as of
October 1st, 2003 will be provided at the IT board meeting.

•

Implementation Strategy – Although this may change, as we look further into what
it will take for data conversion, we are still planning to start with Civil Courts and
then bring up the Criminal Courts.
Page 2 of 2

JUSTIS Replacement Project Report to
Marion County IT Board
As of October 8th, 2003
•

Project Schedule – Due to the intense effort to make sure the system design fits our
needs the project schedule has slipped. We do not yet have a firm target date. Once
the design is signed off and we get a little further down the road on Data
Conversion, Reports and Local Interfaces we will be able to start predicting a target
date. Although, there are quite a large number of tasks to be done, there is an
expectation that we may be able to start some user acceptance testing sometime
early in 2004.

Status Updates
ACS Monthly Report
Mr. Mockert offered that Mr. Pascucci was present should the board have questions
regarding the ACS Report. Some changes have been made and are reflected in the
report.

Mr. Ricketts asked if Mr. Mockert as CIO was satisfied ISA is moving forward with the
transition and it is what is best for the enterprise. Mr. Mockert responded affirmatively.
JTAC Report
JTAC report stands as submitted.
Enhanced Access Review Committee Report
(Bail Agent Pricing Request Discussion Delayed One Month)
Greg Jordan stated the Enhanced Access Report stands as submitted in the board
packet.
CIO Report (Exhibit E)
Mr. Mockert offered Tom Tierney and George Vrtiak of Northrop Grumman were
available for questions. Mr. Mockert presented the status on the contingency plan. He
commented the transition has been smooth so far. He would like to see ISA transform to
a more strategic partner, and develop a communication and disaster recovery plan. An
assessment is ongoing of the facilities data center to determine what ISA’s assets are
and making sure things are secure.
There is a 98% acceptance on job offers made by NG.
Mr. Mockert took the opportunity to discuss the CIO position. He recommended the IT
Board shore up the CIO position by conducting a formal CIO search and conduct
interviews.
Mr. Mockert discussed the recommendations presented to the job class board including
eleven new positions. Thirty-eight interviews were held and several offers were made
on management positions. There are nine open positions remaining for special projects
that require certain skill sets. Mr. Mockert does not intend to delay moving employees
into their new roles. He would like to begin interactions with NG, between ISA and
customers, and provide clear communication and direction to the IT Steering Committee.
Ms. Womacks offered as a board member to assure Mr. Mockert he is in charge as if he
were the full CIO. Staff needs to understand that. Staff needs to stand by him The
board expects him to move forward.
Mr. Ricketts added as long as Mr. Mockert understands policy for due process and
follows those guidelines, the board stands behind him. He continued stating the board
appreciates his honesty in a saying we need to do search for a CIO. In the meantime,
he is in charge.
Ms. Enders added Mr. Mockert is setting the path for ISA to follow. Whoever the CIO is,
they will follow this path that has been set. She commented she looks forward to moving
ISA to a level the board wants it to be.
Mr. Mockert expressed his appreciation for the support he has received from the board.
He hoped they will continue on this path. With hard work, the organization will be
successful. He would like the vision to continue regardless of who the CIO is.

Action Items
Nframe Contract (Resolution 04-24)
Dave Mockert briefly updated the board on the Nframe contract. This resolution for
internet bandwidth was presented to the board two months ago. ISA was asked to go out
and consider other firms and compare pricing. Dr. Inui moved to approve Resolution 0424, Ms. Sadler seconded the motion. Motion passed unanimously.
Premis Consulting Group (Resolution 04-25)
As discussion, Mr. Mockert explained Premis Consulting Group has been working with
ISA through the transition stage. Currently, they are assisting with the ISA
reorganization and communicating on-going activities to the user communities, the
agencies, and board members. Premis Consulting is able to fill in some gaps in the ISA
skill sets.
Mr. Ricketts asked about the contract’s specific time frame. In response to Mr. Ricketts
question, Mr. Mockert stated the contract extends into January of 2005.
Mr. Clifford wanted to know if the contract before the board is the final in terms of the
restructuring contract. Additionally, he wanted to know what involvement they would
have in terms of ISA employees and NG.
In response, Mr. Mockert stated in terms of restructuring, yes this is the final contract. In
looking at strategic planning, no. He has found people are more willing at times to open
up to an outside consultant than a staff member. A third party vendor would provide an
outside perspective.
Ms. Womacks asked about the structure of payment and reminded ISA to encumber
funds before 2005. Ms. Womacks asked if a local vendor could provide the services
currently provided by Premis Consulting and added she preferred to keep Indiana dollars
in Indiana.
Mr. Mockert replied there may be a firm locally that could provide similar services but he
is confident in Premis Consulting.
Mr. Clifford requested ISA prepare a proposal for consulting services.
Ms. Enders moved to approve Resolution 04-25. Motion was seconded by Ms. Sadler
and passed unanimously.
Lewis & Kappes (Resolution 04-26)
Mr. Mockert explained the additional $13,555.94 is a result of the nature of negotiations.
Lewis & Kappes put in some extra work. Additional services were required.
Mr. Clifford pointed out the resolution may be poorly worded and the board may want to
amend the language.
Mr. Ricketts moved to strike the word ‘do’ on the second line and add ‘amount not to
exceed’. Motion seconded and passed unanimously to correct the wording.

Ms. Enders complimented Lewis & Kappes along with Paul Belch for the excellent legal
work provided during the RFP process.
Ms. Enders moved to pass Resolution 04-26. Ms. Womacks seconded the motion.
Motion passed unanimously.
Marv Thornsberry of Daniels and Associates was asked to speak to the board on the
JTAC project. He reported a kick off meeting is scheduled for today. A 2-3 week
assessment of the software status will be conducted. In the past, the County has
received conflicting messages. Marion County wasn’t really ‘in the know’. Marion
County has now been elevated to a full partner.
Mr. Ricketts asked for input on the future board meetings being televised. Mr. Belch
offered to speak with Channel 16 regarding the IT Board Schedule.
Mr. Ricketts asked Mr. Rutherford to come to the microphone to discuss the property
system and replacing the current system installed in the 1980’s. The current system is
patched together. The new system will tie into market values and make participation
from three counties offices as well as DMD available.
Mr. Clifford asked if there is appropriation in reassessment from the board for a new
system. He inquired if this is something local government is actually making the
decision of what they want. He reminded the board a new governor is coming in and
could this perhaps be a situation where the board is putting the cart before the horse.
Mr. Clifford asked what if the state wants a statewide system.
Mr. Ricketts concern was Marion County may get to the point where we cannot provide
fair assessed values in an equitable manner if the current system is not replaced.
There is a proposal before the general assembly to reconstruct how reassessments are
done in Marion County. Mr. Clifford believes before a new property system is designed
we may want to see what the outcome of the general assembly is. The consensus may
not be for a township-based system.
For clarification, Mr. Ricketts stated we’re on a township-based system now.
Mr. Clifford made a motion to table discussion of the property system. Motion to table
was seconded by Sheriff Frank Anderson and passed 5-3.
The discussion regarding SA staff developing an RFP was tabled also.
Mr. Clifford moved to hold an election (for a new chairperson). The motion was
seconded and passed 5-4 to hold elections.
Motion was made by Major Ball to nominate Mr. Clifford. Motion was seconded by
Sheriff Anderson. Motion passed 5-4.
Mr. Clifford asked about holding an election to elect a new secretary. No motion was
made.

With no further business discussed, Sheriff Anderson moved to adjourn. The meeting
adjourned at 11:00 A.M.

IndyGIS Team 2004 Accomplishments
2004 may very well be the most successful period thus far for the GIS Team. While
much effort was expended during 2003 in response to natural disasters such as
floods and tornados and to dealing with the challenges of an expanded staff and a
new GIS services vendor, 2004 brought the realization of goals carefully drafted in
our 3-year strategic plan. Much of this work was really “behind the scenes” and not
immediately discernable to the enterprise, but these projects have prepared a solid
foundation for some very exciting improvements to the capabilities that we provide
our customers.
The past 12 months have also seen tremendous professional growth for our staff.
Stronger project planning and tracking procedures have been put in place as well
as a strengthening of project and application documentation procedures. A
concerted effort was made to acquire needed technical training that has already
proven invaluable. The GIS team also provided formal classroom instruction to
over 300 City / County employees and presented nearly 20 papers to various
conferences.
The following are highlights of accomplishments during 2004:
Intranet Data Viewer (IDV) - The IDV is a fully functional web based map viewer
to be utilized by the majority of enterprise user who require GIS access. This is a
replacement for an existing client-server application and will eliminate a significant
support burden.
Metadata Repository - This new metadata repository will serve as a single source
of GIS related metadata for both the enterprise and our Internet application users.
Pictometry – In late March the GIS group took delivery of an exciting new product.
The easy to use Pictometry application and it’s specialized oblique angle
photography have proven to be much more useful to our customers then we ever
imagined.
Data Maintenance & Enhancement – Although not nearly as flashy or exciting as
the previous item, the on-going data maintenance and enhancement that are
performed throughout each year ensure that our customers have the most current
and reliable data available in the Indianapolis area.
Master Address – Perhaps the most far-reaching project this year has been the
implementation of the Master Address Database, (MAD). The MAD is comprised of
two main components, an Oracle database containing a comprehensive set of
street, parcel, building, and unit addresses and corresponding map layers which
provide the spatial component. At this time, the MAD includes 2-way integration

with DPW’s Hansen IMS work management system, 1-way integration with DMD’s
Tidemark permitting system, and 1-way integration with the new CRM system.
ArcGIS Server – The ArcGIS Server product is an exciting new offering from our
software vendor, ESRI. At it’s simplest, the server allows us to build customized
web-services that include a very robust spatial capability. We consider this product
to be a foundation for much of our work in the next few years. In fact, as the very
first non-military enterprise to actually implement this technology, IndyGIS has
seen a great deal of interest from others within the GIS community as well as from
ESRI itself. We now have three ArcGIS Server based applications in service and
three more are in early development.
DPW Snow Map Automation- During late 2004 the GIS staff developed an
application that allows DPW staff to print snow route map books for use during this
snow season. This tool greatly simplifies the creation of these books, which are an
important reference for the snowplow drivers.
CRM Integration – As the Mayor’s Action Center began in 2003 the discussions
regarding the purchase of a new CRM system, the GIS group recognized that
much of the eventual success of the project would hinge on the ability of any new
application to have access to an address validation mechanism. With this in mind,
we accelerated implementation of the MAD database and began the development
of an address validation web-service utilizing the as of then unreleased ArcGIS
server technology. Although this early adoption did present some risk, it was
necessary to ensure success of the CRM system.
TAGG & SAGA Applications – These 2 applications are examples of “behind the
scenes” work undertaken during 2004 which will provide tremendous opportunities
for our customers next year. The Tidemark Automated Geography Generator,
(TAGG), and the Siebel Automated Geography Application, (SAGA), are fully
automated processes which will maintain map layers as entries are made in other
Oracle databases. For example, when a Mayor’s Action Center phone
representative enters call information from a citizen, the address is verified against
the MAD data and stored in the Siebel system. The SAGA process the
automatically creates a point within the map layer which represents calls for
service, effectively adding a spatial component which is easily accessible to all
levels of the enterprise. In the case of TAGG, the same process is followed
whenever a permit is issued by DMD, allowing easy mapping for analysis
purposes.
Apartment Address Compilation – Although the City/County GIS layers
represent street and parcel addresses, the identification of apartment unit
addresses has long been a desire. During 2004 IndyGIS tasked our GIS services
vendor, Woolpert, with a field survey of all apartment complexes within the County.
At this point the fieldwork has been completed and data entry of the unit data
within the MAD database is underway.

CrimeView Project – The GIS group is providing technical resources and project
guidance for the implementation within IPD & MCSD of a new set of applications
which will be used for crime analysis and to make the resulting data much more
accessible within the departments and to the public. This project is funded by a
$760,000 grant for which the GIS group provided $173,000 in matching funds.
DPW Solid Waste Billing Project – The GIS group has recently developed a
method that allows DPW to identify residential properties that are receiving trash
collection services but are not being billed accordingly. During the first 2 months of
this project, we have identified approximately $210,000 in annual missing revenue
and anticipate additional significant amounts prior to project completion in
December.
Software Environment Upgrades – Beginning mid-year, the GIS has worked
through a series of software upgrades published by our vendor. Because of the
complexity of our current enterprise environment, this required careful planning to
ensure that our customers received uninterrupted service.
As 2004 comes to a close the GIS Team has begun application development for
next year and is in the process of creating a formal work plan. Initiatives planned or
under consideration include:

•

•

An ArcGIS Server based application that will appear as a map window
within the existing CRM interface used by MAC telephone representatives.
This window will automatically show the location for the service request
being taken as well as other service requests within the same area. This will
allow the reps to proactively spot problem areas and notify pertinent
operations personnel as well as give the citizens better information. The
data source for this display is actually provided by the SAGA application that
was completed in 2004 in preparation for this type of use.
Two more ArcGIS Server based applications that make use of the SAGA
data. The first is an intranet viewer that lets all types of City personnel view
real time customer request data in a map-centric format. The second will be
a subscription-based service that will allow operations, management, and
elected officials to receive daily, weekly, or monthly maps and tabular
reports of customer requests within their area of interest. For instance, a
Councilor could decide that they would like a small map and report emailed
to them on the first of each month which lists all calls received by the MAC
during the previous month that fall within their district. A DPW manager may
wish to see the same data each morning and then receive a report only on a
monthly basis. Both of these applications are being architected to allow
easy transition to other data sets and purposes.

•

•

•

Development of a street closures web application to allow the public easier
access to this information. The data flows required by this application would
also be of value to public safety and the EOC.
Establishment of formal workflows and agreements with our customers to
take ownership of pertinent data sets.
Development of standards for field data collection and inventories. This
would allow more timely responses to our customers’ requests for guidance.
Continue fieldwork to gather additional addresses for inclusion within MAD,
beginning with strip mall type properties.
Many other cities of our size utilize GIS based video displays during public
meetings such as Council, Committee, and Board hearings. It seems to be a
valuable tool to ensure that everyone involved is looking at the same picture
and helps to visualize issues quicker. We would like to explore this
approach with City / County agencies.
As in previous years, we will continue to maintain and enhance our existing
datasets and to develop new data sets in response to customer and project
needs.
The GIS Team will continue to strengthen our current effort to develop
sound documentation products for both applications and analysis projects.
We currently have a research effort underway to assess the feasibility of
utilizing a searchable GIS metadata storage mechanism to archive these
documents and to make them accessible to the enterprise.

The GIS Team will continue to provide support to existing projects such as the
DPW AVL initiative, the DMD Neighborhood Information System, and the DPW
Digital as-builts & standards. We will continue to look forward at new GIS
technologies and to assess their applicability to the enterprise. Lastly, we will
continue to support the professional growth of our team and actively participate in
the new ISA organization.

2004 Annual Progress Report
Information Services Agency
Internet Division
The main focus of the Web development team in 2004 was the
implementation of the Web Content Management System (WCMS). The
WCMS is a Web update and publishing system designed to allow
business users to compose and publish Web pages without the need for
technical resources. The system enforces a standard template to maintain
a consistent look and feel throughout the website. Also, it provides an
approval workflow process to allow managers to review and
approve/decline Web content submitted by authors.
The team implemented a pilot project in 2003 to launch the system and
host the IndyGov home page and upper level. Pages. In 2004 the Web
team was able to migrate a number of departmental websites to the
WCMS including the Mayor’s Office, DPW, County Auditor, Assessor,
Prosecutor, Treasurer and IPD. This effort involved assisting City-County
users in the restructuring and redesign of thousands of Web pages. The
Web team completed training for 115 users who are now able to update
their Web content onsite or remotely without the need for technical
assistant. Users can login to the system with their network login ID and
password, and they can post content using a Web browser. The Web
team will continue this effort to complete the migration of all departments
and agencies to the new system by May 2005 as scheduled.
The Web team worked with ACS on a project to replace the outdated
email notification system (List Server). The joint team did a thorough
evaluation and testing of leading list servers available on the market. Upon
the evaluation the team selected “Lyris” as the preferred list management
software, and then the system was purchased and installed on the CityCounty network. The new system offers the same capabilities that were
available in the old system such as self-subscription and self-maintained
email lists. In addition, the system provides additional functionalities such
as maintaining user profiles and composing HTML-based newsletters. The
user profile function allows internal list managers to target specific citizens
groups by zip code, voting precinct or any other criteria specified in the
profile. The team will continue work on this system in December and
throughout the first quarter of 2004 to customize the system according to
customer needs and extend its functionality.
After receiving numerous requests from internal City-County users for
more online calendars, the Internet Division purchased additional 100
licenses of the Webevent online calendar product at bulk rate. The Web
team configured the system to display new online calendars and trained
new users on using the system. The system currently hosts public

meetings for all boards and commission in addition to other governmentrelated activities. The system allows citizens to access public meeting
calendars and meeting agendas and minutes online.
In addition to directing Web projects and monitoring progress, the Internet
Manager was involved in the City-County IT Sourcing process. He
participated in the development of the RFP, reviewing proposals attending
presentations, checking vendors’ references and making the final
selection and presenting recommendations to the IT Board.

Reminder: Financial data is reported on a one-month delay. This means that
financials for November 2004 will be detailed in the report distributed in
January 2005.

The CivicNet team continues to make strides with online
services for Indianapolis and Marion County agencies.

November at a Glance

Transactions ...............................30,821

The Division of Compliance online general contractor license
renewal service was deployed in time for the December 31
license expiration. January 31, 2005 is the last day to renew
without incurring a late penalty. Reminder postcards were
developed by the CivicNet marketing team and mailed to all
general contractors the last week of October. In November, 60
general contractor corporation licenses were renewed, which
accounted for 165 individual general contractor licenses.

Subscribers...................................2,469

Division of Compliance online inspection requests and
completion compliance cards for right-of-way permits were
deployed in November. Notices were sent to all current
CivicNet permitting customers and links are available on
CivicNet with information on the new service enhancements.

Inspection Requests: Right-of-Way

An enhancement to the Marion County Sheriff’s Department
Real Estate Listing service has been completed. The updates will
provide the purchaser’s name and the sold amount on properties
that were purchased at the monthly auction. This application
will offer enhanced convenience to companies and individuals
who make repeated requests to MCSD and the Clerk’s Office.
CivicNet is working with the Juvenile Courts to expand the
Juvenile Justice Information Sharing System (JJISS) service to
the township schools. The school districts of Franklin, Decatur,
and Wayne have agreed to connect to the JJISS service. The
participating schools will provide student information for the
juvenile court system, Family and Social Services
Administration (FSSA), and police reports. In return, each
school district will receive reciprocal access to other entities’
information relating to their students.
An enhancement was deployed to the Indianapolis Police
Department Limited Criminal History in November. Due to
privacy and security issues, the CivicNet Limited Criminal
History service has been changed to display only the last four
digits of the social security number on the search results.

CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS/MARION COUNTY
IT Team Presentation Form - Executive Study Charter

Dept/Agency: Department of Public Safety
Division: Emergency Management Planning Division
Service Request #(If Applicable): P00532193

Prepared By: Bruce E. Turner
Date: 12/09/04

Executive Sponsor Steve Robertson

Project Title: Enhanced Access for the Emergency Operations Center
Project Purpose: After the events of 9/11/01, Under the State Homeland Security Grant Program (SHSGP) (CFDA),
grant funds are provided by the Department of Justice/Office of Domestic Preparedness (ODP) to better prepare local
jurisdictions and municipalities within the State of Indiana to react to potential terrorism events. This project enhances
the access capabilities of the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) when managing any critical event, be it a disaster,
terrorist event, or large public gathering. This improved access will benefit the people of Indianapolis/Marion County
through the Department of Homeland Security regional preparedness initiative.
Business Need Addressed:
This project is for the implementation of fiber optic cable from the CCB building to the MECA building routing
through the APC building. This will provide high speed data access and live video broadcasts from the IPD helicopter
into the EOC center at 47 S State Ave. This installation will utilize existing traffic signal conduit, and hand-holes where
possible, as well as existing pathways in the CCB, APC and MECA. The improved access will provide quicker
response and communication during an emergency event by the Marion County EOC. Currently the helicopter
broadcasts are poor quality at times and signal is lost due to the high buildings blocking the signal to the MECA
antennae. A better, more powerful antennae will be installed at the CCB building on the 27th floor. The new antennae
will be accessible from a wide area of the county to allow transmission of video signals to MECA through the high
speed fiber optic cable.
The installation of the fiber optic cable will enhance the necessary infrastructure to support the activities of the EOC in
their primary location, enhance surveillance for Law Enforcement, and provide continuity of Government in case of a
disaster.
Alternative Approaches Reviewed/Considered:
Benefits:
Enhanced communication for the key decision makers at
the EOC center.

Cost Savings:
Improved efficiency of emergency response providers
Improved video broadcasts from the IPD helicopter
involved in emergency coverage.

Key Users & Other Beneficiaries:
Public Safety Personnel. All City/County agencies with any involvement in disaster/emergency response.
The citizens of our community will be better served and their safety better protected through the use of these
facilities.
High Level Project Plan:
ACS has developed a Bill of Materials that includes all materials and labor needed to support the implementation of
this project.
This project fits within our strategic initiatives in that it greatly improves service delivery not only to numerous
departments, but to the public in general.

The chairman called the meeting to order at 9:41 AM.
Dr. Thomas Inui was introduced as a new member to the IT Board.
Minutes
A motion was made to approve the April 20, 2004 minutes. Motion was seconded and
unanimously approved.
Status Updates
ACS Monthly Report
There was no representative from ACS in attendance to present the details of their
report.
JTAC Report

Mr. Flynn reported the Washington Township Small Claims Court volunteered to be
part of the initial JTAC implementation as the first Small Claims Court online. The new
system is nearing completion. The connectivity to the state is in place, although still
unstable.
Mr. Ricketts asked for an update on the implementation schedule. Mr. Flynn responded
the user acceptance training was pushed back one month resulting in the schedule
being pushed back also, but should occur yet this year.
Mr. Clifford asked about funding the implementation costs, and Mr. Flynn stated funding
resources have been identified for the project.
In reference to the 700 machines to be replaced, it was asked if the financing is the
City’s responsibility. Mr. Flynn explained the State would not pay for equipment and
software replacement, and approximately one-half of the 700 machines to be replaced
are within IPD.
Ms. Enders asked if replacement of the 700 machines was planned, and Mr. Flynn
explained the board and each of the departments have received reports regarding the
need for the past 18 months, but with tight budgets they couldn’t always locate funds for
equipment replacement.
Enhanced Access Review Committee Report
Mr. Jordan discussed the evaluation in progress of funding impacts from changing the
CivicNet pricing model, and the fact a survey is being done of the Courts and Clerk’s
Office to see how their work would be impacted by a different pricing structure. He
added that he would keep the board informed on the results.
Discussion/Action Items
RFP Discussion
Mr. Mockert reported the RFP was successfully published on March 16, 2004, and
proposals were received on May 3rd. The evaluation committee’s activities have
centered around evaluation of the responses. ISA is very satisfied with the progress and
Mr. Mockert took the opportunity to thank those who put in extra time on evenings and
weekends. He continued the participants are under a non-disclosure situation thereby
preventing further discussion of details. An e-mail was sent to the responders to
prevenet any contact with staff, board members or those folks on the evaluation
committee through 5May 24th. That date may be extended through the presentation
period. Mr. Mockert believed a good RFP was written and good responses were
received. He pointed out it will be difficult to make decisions due to competitiveness of
the bids. A well-qualified sourcing provider will be selected. He continued with the
details of the schedule and indicated the Board would be keep informed of meeting
dates and times in the event the board members care to attend the presentation
sessions.
Mr. Clifford asked if oral presentations would be brought before this board. Mr. Mockert
responded the RFP committee will hear the presentations, work on reviews, and conduct
reference checks along with outside assistance. Then they score the proposals and give
the board their recommendations along with rankings. A recommendation will be made

with sound documentation to justify the recommendation. The goal is to present the
recommendation at the July meeting.
A suggestion had previously been made to change the July meeting date. As a result,
the Board meeting will be moved to July 15th, and details will be sent out to the board
members along with the time and meeting room.
Mr. Inui commented he already has a copy of the RFP and will be reviewing it. He
asked if the proposed site visits are to users currently in same situation or if multiple
sites would be visited. He suggested choosing from a selection of sites.
ISA Financial Review
Mr. Ricketts explained the existing fund balance was built up as a result of revenue
collection (sometimes from delinquent accounts). Mr. Mockert has offered to return two
million dollars to the County and City(General Fund). On a quarterly basis, ISA will
come before the IT board with an updated financial statement. Mr. Ricketts suggested a
resolution be prepared to earmark the Internal Service fund, then submit a letter to
council for the same. The fund was established as non-reverting, by ordinance. It was
not set up by Indiana statute.
Major Ball asked if the funds would be distributed proportionately in accordance with the
agencies where the revenue was collected. Mr. Ricketts explained the money would
go into the County and City General.
Mr. Ball said he understands the current chargeback system is more favorable to some
(agencies), than others. He asked if there were a way a portion of the money could be
designated for the replacement of the 700 personal computers before it is paid out.
Ms. Sadler requested that the draft (resolution) be presented to the board.
Discussion Items
Human Resources Charter for Benefits Enrollment (Resolution 04-05)
Ms. Biddinger noted previously this type of request and accompanying Charter would not
come before the board; however with the IT Team meetings suspended, the board may
be asked to review more of these type of requests.
Ms. Ruby explained the Human Resources Charter and indicated the current service for
Benefit Enrollment is no longer available. The alternative to this solution would be a
manual paper process.
Ms. Womacks asked if the Auditor’s Office had been involved in the initial discussions
and if they were to be included in this Charter would the cost double. She was advised
her Chief Deputy had declined participation by the County.
Mr. Clifford asked if the cost would be on a per customer basis, per employee, or based
on participants.

It was explained the initial expense is per interface and per provider. M-Plan is paying
for the full cost of the interface, Advantage will pay a portion, Delta will pay half, and
Spectara will not be paying anything.
Mr. Clifford asked if an analysis of on-line enrollment versus paper process had been
done and wouldn’t an on-line process be more efficient. Ms. Hoofer established
employees do not have to re-enroll every year. Enrollment is only required if the
employee changes benefits or the benefit provider has changed their options. She
continued there is a substantial expense involved in printing all the forms and mailing
information to employees. Last year approximately $20,000 was spent on mailing and
printing. A portion of the initial expense is for the time involved in building the process.
Ms. Womacks asked for specific cost savings from payroll staff due to the interface.
Mr. Ricketts asked the cost split would be if the County participated.
Ms. Sadler voiced her concern that the Board is being presented with a project that
requires an additional 80 hours. This 80 hours will take away from the current hours
earmarked for application development projects. She requested the board be given an
overall list of projects that have been identified and where the applications development
hours are to be spent.
Ms. Ruby clarified this development hours are GEAC resources, and GEAC projects are
a specific development resource.
Mr. Clifford moved to approve the Human Resource Charter for Benefits Enrollment and
Ms. Enders seconded the motion.
It was requested for the next board meeting a prioritized list of the remaining applications
development hours be given to the board.
A vote was called and the project was approved on a 5-2 vote. Ms. Sadler and Ms.
Womacks dissented.
Mr. Clifford commented we ‘buy’ program hours and this board needs to be more
involved in deciding use of those hours
Oracle Processor License
Ms. Biddinger presented the request to purchase one additional Oracle processor
license for a Windows server. She explained once a year Marion County reviews the
number of Oracle licenses needed to be in compliance. At this time, the agency is one
processor short. The advantage of renewing licenses at this time of year it to take
advantage of Oracles’ fiscal year end and will allow us to obtain a 45% discount. This
yearly audit has been standard procedure each year.
Mr. Ricketts asked if it was standard operating procedure to come up short of needed
licenses. Mr. Meadows commented it is customary to review the number of license on an
annual basis, the same time each year. It is not atypical to come up short. Licensing
implementation is a reactionary rather than planned process. Agencies are constantly
upgrading computers, cascading older models and licensing sometimes is not done
simultaneously.

As a reminder, Mr. Mockert added in the past this type of request would not have come
before the board.
Ms. Enders moved to approve the purchase Ms. Sadler second the motion and it was
unanimously approved.
Revised Charter for GIS Crime Analysis Application
Mr. Petrecca brought the request for the of Crime Analysis Application to the Board
again, explaining negotiations had been finalized.
Major Ball commented this application has been in the works for the past two years.
Many of the individuals who viewed the presentations are no longer here. The benefit of
the application is to keep IPD officers ‘Active’ and to provide him/her with more
information.
Mr. Ricketts asked if there is currently a contract. Ms. Sadler reiterated she would like to
see presentations with more specific financial information with a clear indication of where
it fits in with the overall projects. Her concerned is about the process.
Mr. Ricketts commented he would like to see the board move ahead with worthwhile
projects.
Mr. Clifford moved to approve the Revised Charter for the GIS Crime Analysis
Application. The motion was seconded by Linda Enders and passed unanimously.
PRI Renewal Rates with Time Warner
Ms. Kuhn presented the renewal rates explaining the agency is at the end of a three
year contract with Time Warner. She explained the renewal rate at this time is a cost
savings.
Mr. Mockert reminded the board this is something that in the past would not have even
come before them. ISA has a number of long term rates with SBC/Time Warner. If it is
the Board’s preference to have resolutions for these kinds of activities, they will be
provided.
Mr. Ricketts requested a resolution but added if delaying signing off on the renewal rate
would prohibit cost savings, he preferred to move forward at this time.
Ms. Kuhn stated this is a time sensitive issue but if the Board preferred to act at the next
IT meeting the deadline probably could still be met.
Mr. Clifford moved to authorize the CIO to execute the PRI Renewal Rates with Time
Warner. Ms. Womacks seconded the motion, and the motion passed unanimously.
Gartner Proposal for Vendor Presentation Evaluation and Contract Negotiation
Mr. Mockert noted Gartner was not under contract for the presentation portion of the
evaluation of the RFP. What he proposes to bring before the board for the next meeting
is to use Gartner resources for the best and final offer (BAFO) portion . The information
at today’s meeting is just for reference as the proposal still needs refinement.

Discussion of IMAGIS Consortium and Innovative Mapping Solution, LLC Agreement
Mr. Stout presented the IMAGIS Consortium proposal, and Mr. Ball affirmed that no
public safety information would be jeopardized. He had worked on this and agreed to
changes.
Mr. Ball moved to recommend approval of the IMAGIS Consortium and Innovative
Mapping Solution Agreement. Mr. Clifford seconded and the motion was unanimously
approved.
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 10:58 A.M.
Respectfully submitted,

Carol Hoberty

Monthly Highlights and Statistics
May 2004
From the Account
Manager’s Desk
The month of May was relatively
quiet, but saw some significant
and exciting activities and project
progress.
First, the Mayor’s
Action Center (MAC) is getting
very close to initializing the first components of the
Constituent Relationship Management (CRM) system.
The base system will go live on June 9 with the fully
integrated operation scheduled to be in place during the
summer months.
ACS application developers are getting very close to
delivery of the electronic Personnel Action Request (ePAR) system. Modules are being delivered for testing
every other week and the system will be ready for total
testing in August.
With the slowdown in application development requests,
ACS application services personnel are directing more of
their attention to maintenance requests. Statistical data
on that effort is presented in this month’s status report.

e-PAR Project Moving Right Along
User acceptance testing is under way for the City Human
Resources E-PAR (Personnel Action Request)
application. User testing is being conducted in a phased
approach, whereby HR receives components to test on a
schedule of every two weeks. The first two components
were delivered in April. Two additional components
were delivered during the month of May. These
components consisted of creating New Hire, Name
Change, Separation and Rehire e-PARs. The next
release is scheduled for June 14, 2004. The completed
system is on schedule to be delivered for full UAT on
August 24, 2004.

CIP/GIS Web Application Implemented
In May 2004, the Department of Public Works Division
of Engineering (DPW) implemented a new CIP/GIS Web
Application. This new application, developed by AMEC
Earth & Environmental, web-enabled DPW’s Capital
Improvement Project (CIP) tracking system as well as
integrated GIS mapping with CIP data for the first time.
DPW Engineers can now manage CIP projects and data
geographically via the web. This paves the way for
improvements in both efficiency and accuracy in the CIP
Monthly Highlights and Statistics
May 2004

project management process.
The CIP/GIS Web
Application Project concluded with great success due in
large part to the outstanding cooperation, willing
assistance, teamwork and positive attitude of all parties
involved – DPW, AMEC, ISA, GIS and ACS. This
project made great use of collaboration and it has
definitely paid off for DPW.

CRM System to Begin Shakedown
The Mayor’s Action Center has declared the CRM "golive" date as June 9. This means that the MAC Customer
Service Representatives will begin using the Siebel CRM
application on this date to enter work orders. This is
without any of the integrations in place, so the complete
system will not be available at this time. In order to let
the MAC start using the Siebel system prior to full
integration with Hansen and Tidemark systems, Tier1
Innovations, the contractor for the project, has come up
with a temporary solution to duplicate one direction of
the current interface into Hansen. They will copy the
current code (now established from Expert Advisor to
Hansen) that once entered into Siebel will open the work
orders in Hansen for those calls that need to go to DPW.
The go-live date for the Hansen/Siebel integration is
currently set for July 7. Go-live dates for Tidemark and
Chameleon have not yet been established. However,
ACS has committed to have the Tidemark/Siebel
integration completed by July 2.

City Benefits Enrollment System to
Change
Currently, the City’s Human Resources administers
benefits through an IVR open enrollment system that is
supported and maintained by Ernst & Young. Ernst &
Young is discontinuing this provision of service.
Therefore, City Human Resources needs to replace this
system prior to open enrollment, October 2004.
City Human Resources reviewed four different benefit
enrollment systems before choosing the LoCascio
Hadden & Dennis, LLC product, BenefitsConnect. This
is a web-based system that will provide open enrollment
services as well as expand to ongoing enrollment and
accept updates/changes to benefit information. The open
enrollment portion of the system will replace the current
IVR solution. The expansion to ongoing enrollment and
updated benefit information will replace paper
documents.
Page 1

This system will be configured, maintained and
supported by the vendor, LoCascio Hadden & Dennis,
LLC. A statement of work has been prepared in order to
provide the estimate of ACS development hours required
to create a data file that will accept information for
upload from the BenefitsConnect system to the Geac Eseries Payroll/Personnel System. The purchase of this
software was brought before the IT Board on May 18,
2004 and was approved.

Focusing on Maintenance
The Application Services group continued to focus
heavily on Maintenance and Support requests during the
month of May.
A total of 55 Application Services
HEAT tickets were closed during the month, while 53
new tickets were opened.

the network equipment from the old Drug Interdiction
site has been implemented at the new site.
ACS provided assistance to the Marion County Sheriff’s
Department in the establishment of a new Law
Enforcement division site at the Intec Warehouse to
replace its dialup configuration. In addition to the
implementation of a new high-speed DS1 circuit, a new
router and switch were also installed along with internal
network wiring. This project provides much faster and
reliable connectivity to the City/County enterprise.
In addition, ACS provided the technical support for
MCSD in establishing a new Law Enforcement office at
700 High School Rd. New internal data cabling was
installed and network switch and router were also
installed. A high-speed DS1 circuit was implemented to
provide connectivity for the MCSD officers to the
City/County enterprise.
Mainframe Support Efforts
In May, the Production Control staff successfully
converted the County Payroll and Property microfiche
tape processing batch jobs to facilitate electronic data
transfer to a CD vendor. The conversion eliminates the
need to physically send tapes to a microfiche vendor and
reduces the quantity of older 3480-type tapes to be
created. The effort provides a significant increase in
efficiency and time savings.
The mainframe Systems Group created a new IODF
(Input Output Definition File) with the addresses for the
OSA (Open Service Access) adapters. The IODF is in
use on the test LPAR (Logical Partition). This effort
allows the mainframe Systems personnel to telnet
directly into the test LPAR in the event that the
production LPAR is unavailable.
Mid-Range Support Efforts

Major Technical
Project Updates
The following projects were
addressed during the month and
their current status is presented.
Improved Infrastructure and Processes
In response to a request from IPD, ACS successfully
implemented moving the IPD Drug Interdiction Section
from the airport site to another nearby site that is shared
with Federal Customs and Homeland Security personnel.
A DS1 high-speed data connection has been installed and

Monthly Highlights and Statistics
May 2004

The Midrange Group implemented a centralized event
log repository for the networking infrastructure's
approximate 150 routers. This will enhance the
Communication Group's ability to manage and
administer the network. A new centralized service was
set up that allows the Communications Group to more
easily download software into network devices, again,
enhancing their ability to administer the network and
keep it current. Another new service was implemented
called a DHCP server (Dynamic Host Configuration
Protocol). This new service was initiated for Law
Enforcement's remote access initiative. This new service
was needed to be able to administer IP addresses in this
new environment.

Page 2

The Midrange Group created a new method of file
transfer on behalf of DPW to allow them to more quickly
and efficiently upload Air Quality Permitting
information to the Indygov website for viewing by the
public.

Mr. Smith has been contacted about being named
"Customer of the Month" for May and will be receiving
lunch for two for his valuable feedback.

Customer Service Cards Results
Monthly Statistics from
the Help Desk
During the month of May, 4,615
calls were presented to the Help
Desk of which 3,585 were handled
by the daytime Help Desk and 1,030
were received by our after-hours operation. 283 calls
were terminated before the Help Desk had a chance to
answer the call. The average time to answer a customer’s
call was 23 seconds, and 90.9% of prime time calls were
answered in less than 60 seconds
Of those calls, 699 turned out to be technical problems.
ACS closed 692 problem calls during the month and
achieved a first call resolution of 85.4%. This means that
85.4% of those who called with a problem had their issue
resolved by the time they hung up the phone.
ACS processed 361 security requests during the month.
107 involved changes to security profiles, there were 79
deletions of various access rights and 173 new access
rights were granted. ACS also closed 452 service
requests during the month.
ACS technicians completed 751 desktop moves, adds,
changes, or installations during May. This volume is
41% above the contractual maximum for daily activity.
For the month of May, 152 new laptop and 43 new
desktop computers were setup and delivered to various
customers bringing the total hardware installs for this
month to 195. This includes 36 additional desktop
computers and 150 laptops also ordered by IPD.

ACS technicians distributed 692 customer satisfaction
feedback cards during the month of May. 72 or 10.4% of
them were actually completed and returned. This is a
decrease in participation from April. The returned results
continue to indicate a high level of customer satisfaction
for the assistance received a 2.89 on a scale of 1 to 3.
Timely service rated a 2.90 and our technicians were
deemed friendly and helpful judging from our 2.93 score.

Monthly Highlights and Statistics
May 2004

ACS has begun the installation of the 200 desktop
computers for the Indianapolis Police Department
and have 147 completed to date. ACS is currently
installing computers at the IPD Academy and we are
waiting for a new schedule from IPD to begin the
next phase.

•

•

Conversion of network connections to the new OC3
will continue in June once a routing problem we
discovered has been corrected. The union strike at
SBC has turned out to not be a factor for us,
thankfully.
IPD has approved the installation of a frame relay
circuit at the new Mounted Patrol location at 55 N.
Tibbs. Walkthroughs with the wiring vendor have
been completed so the vendor can provide a quote
for necessary data cabling. We have also obtained
quotes for network hardware required to make the
above referenced circuit operational.
There are two identified security weaknesses in
Cisco IOS software which require updating of the
IOS versions in use on the routers on the Enterprise
network. The Communications Group will be
surveying and updating firmware on a scheduled
basis across the network during May and June.
The ACS Communications Group has new WAN
links and/or new remote sites currently underway at
several sites. This includes a second DS1 being
added at the Marion County Probation site on
Shadeland Avenue. There are new sites at Parks’

Page 3

Municipal Gardens, and the Drug Treatment Court
being added to the IMC network. Both of these
require new high-speed DS1 circuits from SBC
along with local building wiring installation and
planning, along with new network equipment
planning and installation. The Drug Court may be
able to use existing fiber communications
infrastructure if they choose to move into the 251 E.
Ohio St. building.
Eagle Creek Rangers are being moved from their
existing site to the old MCSD Sheriff building at
Eagle Creek Park. The frame relay connection data
connection has been installed and we are awaiting
remodeling work completion before installing
building data and voice cabling and moving their
existing network equipment to the new site.
In a combined effort, the ACS Systems Group and
Communications Group are starting a project to
improve the handling of IP address and mainframe
LU assignment and reclamation.
IFD Fire Prevention is moving from their existing
location to The Julia Carson government center at
300 E. Fall Creek Blvd. Network communications
will have SBC install a new frame relay circuit, and
is coordinating with vendors for data and voice
cabling installation, and required network hardware.
IFD has also requested installation of a point to
point wireless link that will run from this site to the
City/County building, a distance of nearly three
miles. Network communications has determined
there is an excellent sight line from the roof of the
remote location back to the CCB. We have
specified and provided quotes for required network
equipment, antennas, and data cabling to complete
this project.

•

MCSD has opened a Service Request to have
network communications assist in the deployment of
sixteen (16) wireless access points (AP’s).
Discussions are just getting underway to determine
where these AP’s will be deployed, desired coverage
areas, availability of land-based network
connectivity, and so forth. We envision this to be a
long-term project.

•

We continue to assist IPS Police in consolidating
their connection to the CCB network over their
frame relay link. We are awaiting their purchase of
a network capable printer to complete this
conversion which will eliminate one of their
computer systems that connects to the CCB now via
a 9600 baud line.

Server Group
•

A new cluster server will be installed in June that
will handle the service resources of two servers.
This will reduce the number of servers needed to
support the SAN cluster environment. The newer
server technology and additional processor
enhancements will allow ACS to reduce the Novell
server cluster environment from five to four servers
and enhance performance, reliability and reduce
support costs for the City/County enterprise.
Coordinate efforts for the establishment of
standards, and subsequent implementation to do file
transfers with outside agencies.
Work to resolve issue with Entercept that causes
Apache to have run away processes.

REPORT TO THE IT BOARD
Review Committee
June 2004
Greg Jordan (Treasurer) chaired the Review Committee, with additional voting
members in attendance: Kathy Price (Perry Township Assessor) and Terry Nelson
(Chief Deputy Marion County Auditor), representing Marty Womacks.
Also in attendance were Arleen Acton from CivicNet, Paul Belch from the Office of
Corporation Counsel, Diane Powers from the Legislative Services Agency, and Cindy
Land from the Marion County Treasurer’s Office.
New Business:
There was no new business for the Committee’s consideration.
Old Business:
1. Legislative Services Agency (LSA) had previously requested a waiver of the
Enhanced Access subscription and transaction fees for the Marion County Property
Tax System. Ms. Price, the Assessor Representative on the Review Committee,
had asked that LSA send a representative to our Review Committee meeting so she
could ask questions about what LSA plans to do with the data they are requesting.
Diane Powers of LSA attended our meeting to address Ms. Price’s concerns. LSA
obtains property tax information annually from assessors in all 92 Indiana counties.
There are several hundred records in Marion County for which LSA needs to verify
some of the data provided by the assessors. Access to our property system via
CivicNet will make this task much easier for LSA and will eliminate countless
inquiries to the various township assessors. Ms. Powers was able to satisfactorily
answer all of Ms. Price’s questions.
Ms. Price moved we approve the request; Mr. Nelson seconded the motion. The
motion was unanimously approved.
2. There was follow-up discussion to our May meeting where it was proposed by the
Division of Compliance that the online permit fee to utility companies for Right-OfWay (ROW) Permits be increased from $1 to $3. A letter was mailed in mid-May to
the only 5 utility companies that are still paying the $1 fee. These companies were
informed that a Service Request had been submitted to the Review Committee to
increase the fee and that the increase would be effective August 1, 2004. The 5
companies were informed about the Review Committee’s June meeting, and they
were given an opportunity to attend the meeting if they had any questions,
comments, or concerns about the increase. None of the 5 utility companies
attended the Review Committee meeting.

Report to the IT Board
Review Committee
June 2004
Page 2

Mr. Nelson moved that we increase the fee from $1 to $3; Ms. Price seconded the
motion. The motion was unanimously approved.
3. Ms. Acton reported on the survey that was sent to all of the clerks in the Civil and
Criminal Courts to determine ways to encourage the public to use online services.
The survey responses have started coming in, but not very many of the respondents
included the requested contact information so that CivicNet could do some additional
market studies. CivicNet will run the results of the surveys they have received back
so far and then they will determine where to go from there.
There was no further business to come before the committee.
CivicNet submitted their monthly report prior to the meeting.
The next meeting is scheduled for July 14th.

CIVICNET HIGHLI GHTS
Reminder:
Financial data is now being reported on a one-month delay. This means that
financials for May 2004 will be detailed in the report distributed in July.

May was another great month, with over 31,000 transactions –
an increase of nearly 63% over May 2003. Well over $1 million
in city/county funds have been collected via CivicNet so far this
year – an increase of 79% over 2003.
CivicNet’s marriage license record search – which had carried a
$2 enhanced access fee – is now free to all users. Usage was
minimal (30-40 searches per month) but demand for the
information by non-subscribers was very high – these records are
highly coveted by those doing genealogy research.
CivicNet is currently surveying Marion County Court staff to
determine potential new customers for online services. The
court survey results will enable CivicNet to conduct market
research and develop strategies to increase usage.
Wayne Township Emergency Servic es Education Center
deployed the CivicNet payment portal service in May. The
center offers a wide variety of classes, and is now able to offer
firefighters and emergency medical technicians a more
convenient method for registration and payment.
The Division of Compliance online completion compliance card
service is being tested. The new service will provide contractors
with verification that the card was accepted. Development is
continuing for the online inspection request service. A letter will
be sent to all CivicNet permitting customers informing them of
the service enhancements.
CivicNet staff is also working with the Division of Compliance
to offer online craftsmen and general contractor license
renewals. This project is expected to save thousands of staff
hours each year, eliminate the manual data-entry process for
license renewals, and get licenses into contractors’ hands up to
six weeks quicker.
The CivicNet site update is nearly ready for city/county review.
The new design greatly improves navigation to services, and is a
significant first step toward the co-branding CivicNet and
IndyGov. The updated site will also offer Live Chat, which will
provide customers with the option to get immediate help with
questions through instant messaging with live operators.

IT Team Presentation Form - Executive Study Charter

Dept/Agency: Department of Public Safety
Division: Emergency Management Planning Division
Service Request #(If Applicable): Poo338196

Prepared By: Bruce E. Turner
Date: 6/15/04

Executive Sponsor Steve Robertson

Project Title: Virtual Emergency Operations Center
Project Purpose: After the events of 9/11/01, Under the State Homeland Security Grant Program (SHSGP) (CFDA),
grant funds are provided by the Department of Justice/Office of Domestic Preparedness (ODP) to better prepare local
jurisdictions and municipalities within the State of Indiana to react to potential terrorism events. This project enhances
the technical and logistics capabilities of the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) when managing any critical event,
be it a disaster, terrorist event, or large public gathering. These improved facilities will benefit the people of
Indianapolis/Marion County, and surrounding counties through the Department of Homeland Security regional
preparedness initiative.
Business Need Addressed:
This project includes the purchase and implementation of WebEOC, an Internet based application developed by ESI,
Inc. WebEOC will be activated during an emergency event by the Marion County EOC. EMD staff and other
emergency responders will utilize the tool according to their assigned roles or emergency support functions.
Responders may access the application from any location (home, vehicle, the field) so long as an Internet connection is
available. In the EOC, status boards from the application may be projected summarizing an event and detailing each
incident. With a wireless connection in the field, critical information may be entered or accessed and displayed without
the need for shuffling through papers.
It also includes the necessary infrastructure to support the activities of the EOC in their primary location, a backup
location, and in a portable environment if necessary. This includes, desktop and laptop computers, primary and backup
servers, associated software, and other miscellaneous devices to maximize the use of these facilities to manage
incidents.
Alternative Approaches Reviewed/Considered:
An extensive evaluation was conducted over the past 2 years. A dozen or more or software /hardware systems were
demonstrated and tested to identify the best combination for our needs. The solution being presented represents a
reasonably low cost/high functionality compromise.
Benefits:
Key decision makers from any involved agency within the
City/County can actively participate in an emergency
response from virtually any location that has internet
connectivity.

Cost Savings:
Improved efficiency of emergency response providers
Improved ability to document services provided so that
better reimbursement can be gained from FEMA and
other government agencies.
Litigation avoidance due to improved documentation of
response measures

Key Users & Other Beneficiaries:
Public Safety Personnel. All City/County agencies with any involvement in disaster/emergency response.
The citizens of our community will be better served and their safety better protected through the use of these
facilities
High Level Project Plan:
ACS has developed a Statement of Work that includes the acquisition of the hardware, software, and site preparation
necessary to support this implementation.
This project fits within our strategic initiatives in that it greatly improves service delivery not only to numerous
departments , but to the public in general.

per year. This is typical of an enterprise of our size and complexity. Our goals in
planning a storage strategy are:
(1) Lowest Cost – Total Cost of Ownership
(2) Keep Pace With Growth
(3) Respond to Demand for Additional Capabilities.
The intent is to provide for continual growth in a building block fashion by provisioning
Storage Area Network (SAN) devices across the enterprise.
Current Situation
Our Compaq/HP SAN, which is the storage array for our clustered servers, is getting
dangerously near capacity with significant demand continuing. This equipment is at its
end of life and has been discontinued by the manufacturer. As a result, maintenance
costs are rising and reliability is declining. We need to replace this 4TB (TB = Terra Byte
= 1 Trillion characters of information) very soon. In addition, IPD has an immediate
need for 4 TB for their document imaging and replacement of current storage that is also
at end of life.
Proposed Solution
Purchase a new 7th Generation EMC CLARiiON CX 500 SAN that will meet current
needs with expansion capability for the future. This purchase will include the necessary
hardware and software to allow provisioning of storage across our major networked
servers. The initial configuration includes 11.3 TB’s of raw storage allocated as follows:
IPD 4.8TB’s ATA Drives, Compaq/HP Storage Array replacement 4.35 TB’s Fibre
Channel drives, and 2.15 TB’s of Fibre Channel Drives for growth. In addition, this
framework can be expanded incrementally up to 20 TB’s of data.
Cost
The cost for this acquisition is $144,850 and was included as a planned item in the 2004
budget.

VISITORS:

Mr. Ricketts called the meeting to order at 10:11 AM.
Mr. Hineline introduced John Stickler from Ben Davis High School. He serves as a
member of the Mayor’s Youth Council and was appointed by the Mayor to participate
with the IT Board. John indicated he appreciates the opportunity and would be able to
participate until he leaves for college. Ryan Neal, a student at Park Tudor High School,
is also participating but was unable to attend this meeting. These positions have no
voting authority with the IT Board.
Minutes
Ms. Womacks motioned to approve the January 29, 2002 and the February 11, 2002
meeting minutes, Dr. Tunstall seconded and the motion passed unanimously.
Status Reports
Technology Sourcing Discussion
Mr. Hineline continued discussions regarding the ACS contract. Information was
distributed to the Board members concerning new options for the costs of extending the
contract. Based on IT Board comments, new figures were developed. Attempts have
been made to level out the increases across the extension periods. Also, another set of
options were developed removing four application development FTE’s from the new pool
of hours, as discussed at the last meeting.

IT Board Minutes
Page 2
Dr. Tunstall asked the Board what the next steps were to arrive at a resolution for moving
forward. Ms. Womacks voiced her concern with the cost increases shown in the
extensions compared to the 2% increase in the 2001 County budgets. Dr. Tunstall stated
that cuts could be made in the amendment to adhere to the tight constraints of the budget
but that the City/County leadership needs to define what needs to be cut. He also
cautioned it would be important that the City/County administrations be notified of the
cuts being made in technology due to the curtailing of the budget.
Mr. Ricketts
suggested addressing the two caucuses to determine if the costs presented for the
extensions are feasible. Cuts in services will occur only if the Council believes a seven
percent increase over a period of three years is not possible.
Mr. Ricketts asked Mr. Hineline to summarize the discussions from the last meeting.
A sheet reflecting new cost options was distributed and 2 people addressed the Board,
Steve Buckley, the Gartner Group VP that has been assisting us in this process and Lee
Curtis, the ACS Account Executive for Indianapolis.
Mr. Buckley shared with the Board Gartner's perspective on the renewal process. Based
on his staff’s quick review, the projected costs are believed to be within the expected
range of other competitive vendors and perhaps slightly below market. He stated the
only way to get a true test regarding cost would be to go out to market. He shared with
the Board that the overall essence of the current contract is a facilities management type
of agreement. He believes that based on the uncertainty of the City/County future IT
needs, the best solution is the recommended extension of the contract to allow time to
better identify and prioritize the City/County's IT direction. Clearly defining these needs
will allow for a better position to get the leverage needed when going out to market and
providing an opportunity to take this sourcing arrangement to a higher level. Without a
clearly defined plan for future IT direction, Mr. Buckley believed local government was
not in the position to gain the benefits from the cost and efforts of a full RFP process.
Although he feels the City/County has a good beginning to its visions, he stated it would
take at least 12 months to establish an RFP that would result in more than a facilities
management agreement. Lee Curtis stressed the key points of the amendment he felt
were critical to the continuing improvement of services. He also commented on the
quality of his staff and that ACS is very interested in continuing to do business with the
City/County.
In response to Dr. Tunstall’s original question, Mr. Ricketts stated his goal is to complete
the discussions and take action at the next IT Board meeting scheduled for March 19th.
CIO Report
Mr. Hineline reported ISA staff is actively working with local staff and the state Supreme
Court staff reviewing the responses to the state Public Notice of Contracting Opportunity
(PNCO) for a new statewide Courts application.

IT Board Minutes
Page 3
At it’s recent meeting, the IT Team approved a new standard of Norton as the anti-virus
software for local government, replacing Inoculan. Windows XP was also approved as
the new desktop standard. Full implementation will begin July 1st, with some initial
departments who will be using it on a limited basis until then. This delayed
implementation allows for appropriate technician and help desk staff training as well as
procedure development.
ACS Report
Mr. Curtis reported on the progress of the court PC installation. On February 15, ACS
was prepared to install the computers, but a shipping issue occurred resulting in a delay in
receiving the machines. ACS has reconfigured their plans to accommodate the delay and
plan to start installation the week of February 19th.
The GroupWise 6.0 rollout continues with 50 departments remaining. Initial issues have
been worked through and ACS anticipates completing the rollout by mid April as
scheduled.
Mr. Curtis commented on the most recent month’s customer service card responses.
Return rates continue to be lower than we would like but in general the ratings continue
to come in at a very good level. Dr. Tunstall voiced his concern with the apparent
difference between the negative statements he heard from users and the positive reports
from the cards. He stated the conflict between the two data points needs to be reconciled
and suggested that a different method may need to be considered to insure accurate
service responses. Mr. Curtis replied ACS is calling the individuals who send a negative
response for further information.
New Business
The next scheduled meeting is March 19, 2002 in room 260.
Adjourn
Mr. Ricketts adjourned the meeting at 10:50 AM.
Respectfully submitted,
Carolyn Schausten

ORACLE PROPOSAL
The city/county and Oracle Corporation have a long-standing relationship
covering Oracle database licenses. Oracle is currently the enterprise
standard for our database services. Our current Oracle contract structure is
based on processor power. The current software license and services
agreement with Oracle was approved by the IT Board on May 9, 2000.
We have been reviewing our options with regards to the existing licenses
and our growing need for Oracle capacity. Our servers that utilize these
database licenses are getting older and will be upgraded in the near term.
We also will soon need to deploy some additional capacity. Both of these
issues have economic impact to ISA. Oracle has changed its license model
and is offering incentives to move to the new model. ISA has worked with
Oracle Corporation to develop an updated software and services agreement
that allows us to grow in processing power while at the same time keep
control of our costs.
ISA is proposing a new 4-year agreement with Oracle that converts our
existing licenses to processor licenses, adds 30 named user licenses, and
increases our number of processors to 16. This agreement also protects us
from maintenance cost increases for the duration of the agreement. Below is
in summary of the transaction being proposed.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Since 1986, the City/County of Indianapolis/Marion County has recognized the benefits of and
invested in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology. The GIS effort has grown from
the creation of the IMAGIS consortium to the development of GIS staff in individual
departments to pooling GIS resources into a common area to contracting with a GIS consultant
to provide direction and resources for GIS efforts to most recently, bringing GIS staff into a
division of the Information Services Agency (ISA).
During this time, GIS has become widely recognized as a valuable information technology (IT)
tool for local government. The GIS Division has matured along with the profession. While
initially GIS required expensive equipment and intensive training, current GIS applications run
on standard desktop computers with minimal training. Over time, the role of the GIS staff has
changed from analysis to providing the tools and support that allows department staff and the
public to do GIS analysis.
The GIS Division proposes a new structure and methodology, shifting strategic planning and
management from the outside consultant to internal management. Under the proposed plan,
responsibility for directing and managing GIS services will rest with the GIS Division. With the
current contract for GIS consulting services expiring this year, the GIS Division has the
opportunity to take the lead role in providing GIS services to City/County staff and the public,
while supplementing its resources with outside vendors.
The GIS Division will consist of three operational units: Business Consulting, Applications
Development, and Data and Systems. Business Consulting will be the 'user interface' of the GIS
Division. This group will provide the direct user contact in the area of needs analysis, business
process re-engineering, training and support. Applications Development will be responsible for
the design, development, testing and maintenance of GIS applications and tools. Data and
Systems will provide and maintain the data and underlying system architecture upon which all of
the GIS depends. All three groups will work closely together to ensure that the needs of the users
are met efficiently and promptly.
The GIS Division recognizes that the volume of GIS work exceeds what internal staff can
accomplish. Contracting for specialized skill sets and additional resources will allow the GIS
Division to concentrate on strategic direction, knowledge of City/County business operations and
project management.

INTRODUCTION: "One picture is worth more than ten thousand words."
- Chinese proverb

"GIS" stands for Geographic Information Systems. Basically, GIS allows users to combine:
(1) information, or data, collected in a database with (2) address, or spatial, information, to
visually represent the data on a map. The layering of information in the form of a map creates a
picture of the area of interest. The picture changes depending on what information is layered
together. Examples:
· Environmental Data: Layering permitting data and environmental data together may
show what pollutants are affecting which areas and who is generating them.
· Crime Data: Layering permitting data and crime data together may show what kinds of
crimes occur in an area, and if there is a particularly high crime area, where it is.
· City/County Structures Data: Layering City/County Infrastructure Data together shows
where roads, streets, rivers, bridges and a multitude of other utility pathways are located.
· ZipCode Data: Layering political boundary information with a zipcode information
shows the public who their political representatives are and where they can exercise their
democratic right to vote.
GIS allows the City/County to combine data with maps to quickly create a picture of the
situation in a particular area that would take longer (or may never become evident) with
traditional reports or queries. From these pictures,
·
·
·

City/County Managers can make decisions based on the information and the patterns that
emerge;
The public can make better decisions for their family and community; and
Businesses can make more effective decisions for their businesses.

BACKGROUND

The start-up costs for GIS were significant because the equipment and systems were highly
specialized. Indianapolis/Marion County's GIS project began in the individual departments
because of the need to more effectively manage property development, streets and sewers, and
available funding.
A.

Birth of IMAGIS

In 1986, recognizing the benefits for other City/County entities and the continuing
maintenance costs, the City/County put together a public-private Consortium called
IMAGIS (Indianapolis Mapping and Geographic Infrastructure System). An ordinance
solidified the consortium of local government, utilities and IUPUI to collect and provide
Marion County land based data and aerial photography.
The consortium's initial $9 Million investment represents one of the first attempts for any
local government - nation wide - to implement an integrated GIS. IMAGIS continues to
develop and maintain the 'base map' as the foundation for all of Indianapolis/Marion
County's data layers.
B.

Consolidation of GIS Resources

In 1996, GIS staff from various City departments and County agencies were pulled
together to pool their resources. The GIS Division also contracted with a GIS consulting
company (UGC now SchlumbergerSema) to provide planning, project management and
coordination for GIS services through 2002. This combination of government and
contract staff works together to provide GIS applications, data maintenance and user
support for the enterprise. In 2000, the GIS Division of the Information Services Agency
(ISA) was created.
C.
·

Accomplishments to Date
GIS has become an enterprise tool accessible to all users with over 500 installations
across local government.
Address information has been standardized and reformatted to become the foundation
for linking information to a map.
"Data Viewer" allows novice and veteran GIS users to access the most common data
layers and to create maps with minimal training.
"ArcIMS General Viewer" allows anyone to access City/County GIS information
over the Internet without training.

CHANGING TIMES

The last decade has seen remarkable changes in technology. Costs have continued to decrease.
Technologies have improved. As a result, better tools are emerging for management and
decision-making. GIS is no exception.
A.

Lower Costs

In the past, a special, more powerful computer was needed to run GIS; ArcInfo, ArcView
or other GIS software had to be installed on the user's computer; and special training was
needed to use the GIS software.
Now, the City/County's standard computer is sufficient to run ArcView, while the ArcIMS
application allows users to view geographic information over the Internet. These
advancements have decreased costs in hardware, software and training for every City
Department and County Agency. They have also allowed the GIS Division to provide GIS
services to an increasing number of users. The net effect of these improvements has
decreased the per user cost of GIS (see Figure 1).

The technology itself decreases the cost of storage as it is being used increasingly as a data
integration tool. When data is integrated, redundant data no longer needs to be stored in
multiple locations.
Data maintenance costs are also decreasing. For example, the cost of aerial photography
has decreased from $263,000 in 1992 to $112,000 in 2001. The aerial photography is used
for planimetric updates and allows the data to be updated more frequently at a lower cost.
B.

Technology Improvements

Over the years GIS Tools have improved for all levels of users. In the beginning users
plotted lines with AutoCAD. Then, user's work was split between ArcInfo and ArcView.
Now, one application merges the tools available in ArcInfo and ArcView for heavy GIS
users. However, many users can use ArcIMS over the web to get the information that
they need.
Another technology improvement for GIS has been the perpetual increases in processing
speed, which improves the computer resolution of aerial photographs to match the actual
resolution of the photograph. Recently, the aerial photography resolution has improved
from 1-foot pixels to 6-inch pixels, and users will be able to see this difference in
resolution with existing computers. Also, color aerial photography is becoming more
affordable; color aerial photographs greatly assist the planimetric update work.
The technology improvements that are helping with other applications also assist GIS
users. The hardware needed to run GIS is smaller in size and faster to respond.
C.

The GIS Division has developed the foundation for future use of spatially enabled
technologies. It continues to provide services to an expanded audience through
development of intranet and Internet applications that make data and analysis tools
available to all City/County staff and the public. Its challenge will be enhancing the
quality of information delivered to users in a fast, reliable, and easy-to-use fashion.
Expectations of the public will drive future GIS enhancements. The GIS Division strives
to stay on the leading edge of technology to deliver high quality spatial systems to the
users.
Indianapolis/Marion County's GIS Program has come a long way since 1986. The GIS database
has more than 170 layers of data that assist City/County staff in doing their job and managers in
making decisions.
Although these data layers will be maintained and increased, GIS is continuing to evolve.
80% of the data collected by local governments is related to addresses or parcel numbers.
Adding and using those data layers will increase the possibilities for creating applications that
can answer questions, provide analysis and educate the public on issues relevant to their
communities. The future of GIS is moving beyond mere data collection and compilation to
applying that data to our business processes.

FUTURE VISION

MISSION: To provide City/County employees and the public with spatial information and the
tools to make informed decisions. GIS will:
·
·
·
·
·
·
·

Define and control the strategic direction of geospatial information and technology for
Indianapolis - Marion County;
Be the “hub” of spatial information throughout City/County government;
Develop tools for improving customer service - the ability to expedite responses to inquiries
and complaints;
Identify common organizational objectives and opportunities;
Establish a computing environment where executives, management, and staff can easily
access and manipulate data, allowing for more informed decision-making;
Improve departmental and inter-agency coordination through integration of new and existing
systems; and
Reduce the cost of doing business.

The GIS Division spent some time reviewing the progress of the last six years and looking at the
future opportunities in GIS. Figure 2 depicts the resource allocation changes over the years and
what is envisioned for the future. Since the knowledge base has expanded, the decision was
made to reorganize the Division and to recommend changes in the vendor relationship to align
with the future vision and to strengthen the GIS Division's resources. This will continue to give
the GIS Division the ability to leverage itself for the enterprise while maintaining direct control
over appropriate resources.

Resources Per Operational Area

The GIS Division will now consist of three operational units: Business Consulting, Applications
Development and Data and Systems. These operational units were chosen to strengthen strategic
direction and to provide a holistic view of GIS throughout the enterprise. Working hand in hand

DRAFT

with each other will allow all three units to maintain an appropriate awareness of the progress
and opportunities created by each project. This shift will allow the GIS Division to develop a
long-term sustainable model for providing GIS services.
A.

Business Consulting

Business Consulting is the ‘user interface’ with the GIS Division - where relationships
with current users are strengthened and new relationships are cultivated. Business
consultants will work closely with ISA's Senior Planners and ACS staff to understand the
user's business unit and to explain the flexibility and possibilities with GIS to increase the
unit's productivity. Currently, many of these skills are provided by outside consultants.
However, to retain the ‘knowledge’ gained through projects the GIS Division will be
working more closely with its users. Business Consulting will be focusing on:
GIS Projects: Business Consultants will provide ‘review and analysis’ of business units
processes to determine which GIS alternatives are best. When GIS applications are
necessary, the Business Consultants will work with the applications development staff to
develop a detailed requirements document for the project.
Training and Support: Training and support are functions that keep the GIS Division intouch with the current GIS users. The Business Consultants will concentrate on
enhancing the user's skills (such as map making, data scrubbing or geocoding),
implementing productivity tools and assisting users with their technical GIS concerns.
The vendor will handle routine services, such as: standard GIS software installation and
trouble calls.
Communication: The GIS Division will deliver user services through an enhanced
‘enterprise approach’. GIS resources will be leveraged for all enterprise users. The
foundation of the 'enterprise approach' is the enhanced GIS web site - an ‘enterprise GIS’
communication tool that provides information about project status, training, GIS web
tools and a method to get feedback from users.
Research and Development: The Business Consultants will take the lead in researching
existing and future GIS technologies. Integrating wireless, document management and
Global Positioning System (GPS) technologies may tremendously benefit the enterprise.
B.

Applications Development

Application Development will be responsible for the design, development, testing,
documentation and maintenance of desktop and web-based GIS applications and tools.
The Applications Development staff will establish the software architecture in
conjunction with data and systems staff. The Applications Development analysts will
work with the Business consultants to identify application needs and priorities and
determine application requirements.

DRAFT

DRAFT

DRAFT

The Applications Development staff will complete smaller projects. However, for most
new applications, contract personnel will provide the technical resources to design and
code applications as well as develop the applications' help documentation and training
materials. The Applications Development analysts will work closely with contract
personnel and clients to ensure that client needs are clearly understood and met.
Additionally, the analysts will test applications to validate requirements.
Applications Development will run the GIS Change Control Board. The Change Control
Board will review all applications on an annual basis. The reviews will help determine if
an application should be enhanced or modified to meet the clients continuing needs or if
the application is obsolete. The Change Control Board will prioritize any changes and
work with contract personnel to implement them.
C.

Data and Systems

Data and Systems will primarily be responsible for providing the City/County with fast,
reliable, and state of the art access to the most current and accurate GIS data. This will be
accomplished through several areas of focus:
·
·
·
·
·
·

Data Layer Management and Delivery
Key Data Layer Maintenance
Data Creation and Enhancement
Metadata & Data Standards Enforcement
Data Update Process Documentation
Hardware and Software Architecture Planning

Data and Systems will work with the rest of the GIS Division to ensure that data
requirements are met in general and for applications in development. The Data Advisory
Board will establish data standards, enhancement priorities, and distribution guidelines.
The GIS Division is currently seeking representatives from the user community to
comprise the Board and begin work.
Data and Systems staff will continue to maintain key data layers, such as street
centerlines, parcels, and addresses. These key layers form the basis for many City and
County business processes. Examples include: work order processing and permit
issuance. Time sensitive workflows require the updating of these key data layers on a
daily basis. In addition, Data & Systems will continue to perform updates and migration
to new data models of certain departmental data sets such as the sanitary and storm
sewers. Major enhancements to key data layers will be performed by vendors with lesser
enhancements performed by temporary staff. Data and System will take the lead in
coordinating with the IMAGIS Consortium to provide access to annual aerial
photography and planimetric layer updates. Data and Systems will also advise the
departments in their development and maintenance of their required, non-key data layers.
Data and Systems will deliver GIS data layers and associated metadata to desktop
applications and web based internet/intranet viewers. Data and Systems will establish a

data architectural plan, including data standards and a documented data update process,
and properly administer hardware and software environment to create a reliable data
store.
Each of these operational units will be responsible for program management, documentation,
staff training, and support. Where these skills do not exist they will be developed. Part of
project management is contract management, managing the vendors who will supplement the
work of the various operational units. Project managers from the GIS staff will oversee the
project schedules and deliverables.

Project Highlights
Enterprise Document Management Pilot Project - The Auditor’s Office
application is developed and awaiting user testing. Due to office workload
constraints, the goal for completion of this testing has been reestablished to
June 15th. A final report to the EDM Working Group and Steering Committee
will be developed without the Auditor’s results.
The Court’s rollout of 450+ PC’s was completed ahead of schedule. The
remaining tasks regarding the cascade placement of the old equipment is
underway.
We received numerous compliments from the Courts for ACS
and ISA coordination.
An RFP was published and results have been received for a Master Lease
Agreement to be used by any City or County entity to lease equipment
ranging from PC’s, laptops, scanners, printers, multi-function devices or
servers. Analysis and recommendation for award of regarding this RFP have
taken longer than anticipated. This will be brought to the Board next month
for action. We are receiving more questions indicating interest from many
areas to leasing their technology.
The IT Team approved a project for the Parks Department to add several
modules to the Hansen IMS System that has been used for several years by
DPW. This focus of adding functionality to an existing system is positive
because it supports our goals of simplified technology and integration of
needs, whenever possible. This will provide new functionality for Parks while
allowing for improved coordination and interaction with DPW.
The IT Team was also briefed on the upcoming upgrades to the enterprise for
the new Novell 32 Client and Internet Explorer 6.

Planning Division Highlights
Dan Pavey attended the Association of Information and Imaging Management
(AIIM) Conference March. This is the national meeting regarding effective
deployment of document management technology.

Bruce Turner attended a Business Continuity Conference in March aimed
towards improving our capabilities to respond to a disaster and to assist our
customers plan for business resumption.
The Planning Staff started working with customers as the first steps of
prioritizing development work and initial discussions for the 2003 budget
forecast. The Planners and ACS Consultants are meeting with every
department in March and April to score any pending projects. Those projects
will be prioritized by the different function teams and finalized at the IT Team.

Telecommunications Division Highlights
Giesla Schepers has joined our Telecommunications Division as a Lead
Telecommunications Analyst with over 10 years experience in the
telecommunications industry, most recently with Bank One.
ISA continued working with Expanets and Avaya staff to correct ongoing
problems occurring across the remote telephone environment. We have a
special ‘swat team’ working directly with engineers to identify, isolate, and
correct these issues. We have seen significant improvement this month in
resolving several lingering problems. This process of review and correction
will continue until we are satisfied that service is as it should be.
Two new remote sites are coming online in early April so significant focus has
been on completing installation activities. These sites are for the Family
Advocacy Center at 4150 Lafayette Rd and for the Probation satellite office at
3500 Lafayette Rd.

Administrative Division Highlights
•

A follow up audit has been conducted involving certain areas of the HelpDesk
to determine if the recommended changes have been implemented and to
verify the changes/improvements since the last audit. The results will be
published in March.

•

ISA and ACS started a process to clean up our technology asset inventory in
September 2001 with the goal of having the updated information available for
this budget cycle. There are still approximately 12 groups that have not
completed their review to assist us in updating the inventory. This will force
us to have incomplete information as we move into the budget process.

•

ISA has been notifying our customers of any past due charges. This effort
has been very successful in working with the customers on any past due
issues as well as collecting outstanding revenue for the agency.

•

The 2003 ISA budget questionnaire was developed on line and is ready for
customers to input their information on the Intranet. A memo will be
distributed in April to explain who should complete the questionnaire as well
as information explaining to the customer that an ISA Planner/ACS Business
Consultant will be contacting them to set up a meeting time to discuss their
2003 ISA Budget needs as well as their future strategic IT requests.

Internet Division Highlights
Capability to create customer enrolled email lists for specific departments was
completed this month. This allows citizens and internal users to subscribe to
email lists through a web interface and via email. This service was first
deployed for our Emergency Management area and has received national
recognition for the citizen-centric service. A complete announcement will be
sent out soon for all customers to be able to add such lists for their use.
The redesign of the Township Assessors website is nearing completion.
The ISA Budget Questionnaire application was completed and delivered to
ISA Administration.
Deployed new web site for the Animal Care and Control Department.

GIS Division Highlights
An updated version of our Polling Place Locator was put into production in
March. It adds functionality to indicate if a party is registered and where they
should vote. This brings the web interface up to the same functionality as our
IVR application developed for the last election.
New color aerial photography has been flown. The resulting digital
Orthophotography is due to be received in September 2003.

CIO Comments
IT Board Members,
March was a month that seemed to be more focused on ‘working the plans’.
Significant efforts are underway on many projects but we did not see as many
completions of activities this month. We have continued our activities within ISA
preparing for the 2003 budget process.

The main rollout of the Courts PC installation was completed with excellent
results and ahead of schedule. The cascade of the used equipment will keep
ACS staff occupied into April. I want to commend the ACS and ISA staff,
especially Jill Stagner who led the project, for their dedication in making this
project a success.
Once again, we look forward to the opportunity to bring the discussion regarding
the sourcing contract to a close. I look forward to speaking with you at the next
meeting.
Sincerely,
Mike Hineline

MONTHLY STATUS REPORT
March 2002

ADMINISTRATION
One of the more visible and important activities by ACS during the month of March was
the initiation of the Annual Work Plan process. ACS Consultants and ISA Planners
began the process of identifying potential IT projects for the year 2003. This activity was
initiated to coincide with the 2003 budget preparation process. In addition, all functional
committees and the IT Team have received training relative to the project prioritization
process that must take place prior to adoption of the Annual Work Plan. After a
quantification and validation review of all current development service requests, the
sequencing of current projects and those to be addressed during 2003, can be
accomplished.
ACS management also spent considerable time focused on the major desktop deployment
project for the Marion County Courts. As of the end of March, the project was a week
ahead of schedule and would soon be completed. The ACS and Courts teams worked
well together and the high level of cooperation and advanced planning paid off as over
400 desktop computers were installed without significant interruption in services or
degradation of Courts business activities.

Barrett Law Enhancements
Indiana law allows local government to fund public improvement projects by
assessing the property owners affected by the project. The Controller’s Office of the
City of Indianapolis manages the program with a Microsoft Access database. The
database records data about the projects, property owners, parcels, billings and
payments. This revised application has been put into production.

•

Enterprise Document Management Pilot
Project has completed all initial activities for the County Assessor. ACS, ISA and the
County Assessor’s Office have implemented all three applications initially designated
for the pilot. As part of that pilot project the Auditor was also identified as a
participant. Their forms have been set up and have been given to them for testing.

RCA Building (604 N. Sherman) Upgrade Project
The Gigaman circuit has been installed and activated and phase 1 of the remodeling
has been completed. This circuit is for handling the additional bandwidth
requirements due to relocation of users from the City/County building to the RCA
building. The server was upgraded to a gig connection and moved into the new
computer room. The new Gigabit (1000 Megabit per second) data circuit to RCA
provides 700-fold speed increases to the clients at this facility. Those who use the
Geographical Information Systems (GIS) resources are very pleased, as they now
have the same application response time as those who are stationed within the CCB
network. This link has also reduced the time needed to backup and restore the Novell
Server at RCA from 50 hours to a few minutes.

•

SNMP Vulnerability Issues
SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) is a language used by network
equipment to allow them to monitor each other and produce data for performance and
error reports. This language (protocol) is used by every piece of network equipment
in the world. Recently, a security breach was discovered in this protocol. All
vendors quickly responded to this by providing “patches” for the software in the
equipment. All equipment on the City/County network has been patched and tested.

•

Remote Access Server
The Remote Access Server that allows employees to dialup to access the network,
was replaced. The old server only allowed up to 28.8kbps connection speeds for those
dialing in to the network. The new RAS (remote access server) operates at nearly
twice the speed of the previous server, providing much-needed improvement in
response time to our dial-up clients. It also provides for access authentication so that
we may monitor the use of dialup services and the use of the regular Novell login
names and passwords thereby eliminating the need for separate accounts and
maintaining two sets of configurations. The new server is also better supported by the
vendor at a less expensive maintenance cost.

SAN Implementation
An additional 720GB of disk storage was installed into the SAN (Storage Area
Network) cluster, as well as an increase to cache memory and an update made to the
SAN controllers. The result is improvement in performance of the SAN as well as a
significant increase in storage capacity. This will allow for the additional departments
to be integrated to the Novell File Service Cluster to improve redundancy and
availability.

MAJOR PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS
Business Support Services
•

CAMA
All online sub-projects are completed as defined and are being tested by the Client.
The State revisions of the Cost Tables for commercial and residential properties still
have not been received. Most of the batch processing programs have been modified
and tested. There are some requirements still being defined by the State and the
applications will be modified and implements as they are defined. The CAMA
conversion program has been rerun several times with modifications from the
Township Assessors to tailor the process to their specific requirements as identified in
the system testing. The schedule to move the CAMA system into production has been
delayed by the Township Assessors until late April due to the uncertainty of the State
implementation schedule or possible delays. The Township Assessors at the next
ARTS meeting will decide this. The yearly rollover for property and CAMA and the
Tax Bill calculation and printing processes have been completed for this year.

•

Focus Alternative Analysis
The purpose of this project is to research other products that can be implemented that
will replace the Focus Application with the same functionality. The product needs to
be user friendly and not cost prohibitive. Alberta Frees has been researching
alternative software products on the Internet as well as checking out WebFocus,
which is the web version of Focus. Alberta met with Rex Porter from Information
Builders for WebFocus on March 22, 2002 to discuss the functions of WebFocus.
Alberta continues to coordinate with our clients to see if there are alternative
reporting capabilities if the data was readily available in an Access database or
similar format.

•

Upgrade Treasurer’s Cashiering System
The Treasurer’s Office needs to upgrade their current Cashiering System as it is no
longer supported by the vendor and uses outdated technology. The new system will
require an application server and space on the Oracle server as well as new
workstations that are connected to the network. The vendor will install the application
software. ACS needs to coordinate server resources, Oracle requirements, configure
application server, and setup new workstations.
Alberta Frees is waiting for the Treasurer’s Office to provide the proposal from the
vendor (SII) to define the scope of this project and what role ACS will have. Alberta
has written the SOW for this project with the information that has been discussed to

Information Technology
March 2002

date. The SOW will be submitted to the Financial Functional Group for prioritization
and approval to proceed. After approval to proceed, a Project Definition will be
written.
•

DPW ERMD Water Quality Database
This project provides a new relational database, front-end application and reports for
the tracking and monitoring of water quality data. In addition, sharing of data via
indygov.org web page(s), with GIS mapping views, is required. Initial meeting was
held on 3/6/2002 to gain a clearer understanding of the scope of this request. This is
anticipated to be a large project. We are seeking approval and direction from Mike
Williams on whether DPW wants to proceed with this project. A prioritization review
meeting is scheduled with Mr. Williams on 4/15/2002.

•

Streaming Video
This project is for the Cable Agency for a solution to integrate streaming video
services within the Cable Agency. Michael Nadeau completed the project definition
and presentation materials. He then, in turn, presented the project to the clients on
4/1/02. Michael met with clients and Mike Hineline on 4/2/02 to review specific
needs and to answer questions. From this meeting, the client will review funding
alternatives to move this project forward for approval.

•

Online Time Information System
Phase I User Acceptance Testing began March 18. The client has been very pleased
with testing. ACS met with the Auditor’s office to discuss how to identify “changes”
on the vouchers. ACS will continue with Phase II development and will test using
different color print and highlighting for voucher changes and will present examples
to the Auditor’s for review.

•

Records Management Database
Client has been testing the application and Jill Stagner and Chun Jin have met with
client personnel to answer questions and discuss possible changes. Chun made minor
changes and testing will continue through April 12th . Chun also provided a user
manual to the client.

•

Enhancements to Online Election Results
Client continues to perform acceptance testing. Chun Jin completed some minor
changes. Other changes identified will require a change form, including the date for
testing to be completed.

•

Campaign Finance
The Clerk of the Circuit Court would like to have the ability to collect and maintain
accurate information via the Internet concerning Campaign Finances. The current
process for public access is for them to go to the Clerk’s Office and ask for a paper
copy of the information they require. The goal of this project is to provide this
information via the Internet, enable the public use of all state forms, and provide
instructions for electronically extracting the information requested. Neal Ginsberg has
been reviewing the requirement document to determine if the current requirements
document meets our needs or if a change form will need to be completed.

Request for Qualification (RFQ) - Department of Public Works
User testing has been proceeding with minor issues identified. We are still on
schedule to complete testing on 4/15/02. Report testing will begin on 4/8.
Application is scheduled to be put in production on 4/15/02.

•

Community Development Financial Services (CDFS) application
The Dept. of Metropolitan Development (DMD) needs to monitor and track funds,
projects, units, contractors, and activities for all neighborhood redevelopment in
Marion County using Federal HUD (Housing and Urban Development) funding.
Development and testing of this supporting application continues to proceed as
scheduled. Reports were generated this past week for client review. With minor
changes identified the reports were well received by the client. The clients reviewed
the application and they were pleased with what was presented. The project is still on
schedule to move into the testing phase on 4/8/02. The week of 4/15/02 will be used
to make any necessary fixes.

•

Modify List Server Configuration
Jerry Brown worked on creating the list server interface HTML pages and two CGI
scripts to handle mail from the Internet and Intranet users. 28 HTML forms were
created and the mailing list opportunity to the customer is now setup to allow
configuration, approval of submissions, submissions, subscribe and unsubscribe from
web forms that are dedicated to single tasks and user friendly. Demos were given to
Mike Hineline, and Emergency Management. Scripts were also created for
Indianapolis Water Company Mailing list.

•

FAMIS
Mary Lou Eads completed the first phase of this project for the Controller’s office to
automate the mainframe download of 16 City FAMIS FOCUS files to the
Controller’s network. Mary Lou completed and paced into production, a new batch
job to automate the download of 13 FAMIS table files. There are 3 more files to
automate downloading. The Controller’s office requested that the 13 table file
download be completed first and then follow up with the remaining three. (SR
#282806).

•

GIS SDE Support
GIS has requested that the Alpha5 server be upgraded from Unix 5.0a to 5.1 and the
SDE database from Oracle version 8.0.6 to 8.1.7. In order to avoid downtime on their
Web systems that use this database, Gary Johnson installed Oracle 8i release 8.1.7 on
an NT 4.0 workstation provided by GIS and created a temporary SDE database.

Major Desktop Projects
•

Terminal Emulation Replacement Project.
ACS is now installing the Nexus terminal emulation software on new PC
workstations. Randy Williams developed a program that helps guide the tech through
the install and places the necessary icons on the users desktop.

DMD(Planning) Windows XP Testing
Phillip Pettit purchased an additional 5 Windows XP licenses to upgrade existing HP
Vectra workstations. Over 75 applications need to be tested by this department for
Windows XP compatibility before the workstations can be installed. We have
requested two workstations be delivered to the CCB for testing purposes. Dave
Swain has loaded and configured the workstation for this department to use in order
to test departmental applications. Presently DMD (Planning) is testing departmental
applications for Windows XP.

Technical Services
•

GroupWise 6 Upgrade
Rollout of the GroupWise 6.0 upgrade to the Enterprise continued through the month
of March. MCSD and IFD are the only departments remaining to receive the software
upgrade. The project is on schedule for completion by the middle of April. The
upgrade provides enhanced calendar functions, wireless capabilities such as cellphones and PDAs. There are enhanced functions through Web access such as SpellCheck ability, proxy access and the ability to perform functions en masse as opposed
to one item at a time.

•

Norton Anti-Virus
The Norton Anti-Virus software rollout to the Enterprise is on schedule and expected
to be completed by the end of April. Associated with the rollout is the deletion of the
current anti-virus product (Inoculan 4.0). The desktop team has included Norton AntiVirus on the new XP workstation images for the Courts and the Controller’s offices.

•

Courts
Additional wiring to approximately 30 courtrooms is near completion. The remaining
courtrooms are located in the east wing, 6th floor of the City/County building. These
are held up pending the removal of old coax cabling. Removal of old wiring is
required, as the ducts are too full to accommodate any additional wiring.

PLANNED ACTIVITIES FOR APRIL
Business Support Services
Applications development projects and support activities will continue in April as
planned and described above. Other planned activities are listed below:

• Continue work on new project for the Controller’s office to set up Positive Pay for

The meeting was called to order at 9:55 AM by the Chairman.
Minutes:
It was agreed to table the approval of the March 16, 2004 Meeting Minutes until the
board members in attendance from that meeting were present. The Minutes of the
March 24, 2004 Meeting were approved on motion made by Major Ball, seconded by
Judge Payne and the motion unanimously approved.
Status Updates
Enhanced Access Review Committee Report & CivicNet Directors Report
Mr. Jordan, the Marion County Treasurer and Chairman of the Review Committee, stated
the CivicNet and financial reports stood as submitted in the packet.
JTAC Report
Mr. Flynn updated the Board on the progress of JTAC.

CIO Report
Dave Mockert discussed the CIO report and briefed the board on the RFP status. The
bidders conference generated approximately 350 questions, which were answered.
Those responses have been posted to the website and are available for vendors.
Preliminary activities with the business units are in progress to develop the 2005
budgets. Kyle Cox was introduced as a new business consultant for ISA.
ACS Report
In the absence of John Nero, the ACS report stands as submitted.
Judge Payne commended the ACS/ISA staff on the smooth transfer and conversion of
the Juvenile Courts to the support contract.
Action/Discussion Items
CivicNet Charges for Limited Criminal Histories
Ms. Sadler described the current situation that CivicNet business users pay a per use
fee for obtaining criminal court records. The Bail Agents have proposed a subscription
charge be implemented. This would increase the usage of the service and alleviate the
workload on Clerk’s Office staff.
Greg Jordan commented this would be an additional option and would not supercede the
current per use fee. The matter was recently presented to the Enhanced Access Review
Committee and it is under review pending additional information. The committee is
planning to bring a recommendation to the next IT Board meeting.
Election of Officers - Chairman
Mr. Ricketts opened the floor to discussion of selecting a chairman. Major Ball
suggested, barring any urgency, the matter should be tabled until it could be presented
to the full board membership, including the Council appointee. Mr. Ricketts then
suggested if this was the feeling of the board than the matter could be removed from the
agenda. Mr. Clifford moved to table the Election of Chairman, Major Ball seconded, and
the motion carried unanimously.
Resolution #04-04
In order for proper review throughout the evaluation and on through the selection
process it is anticipated consulting assistance will be required. Premis Consulting has
assisted in the development of the RFP and the questions that were asked by
prospective bidders. ISA has been extremely pleased with the performance of Premis to
this point and wishes to retain them to the culmination of the RFP process.
The motion to approve the resolution carried unanimously.
Revised Charter for GIS Crime Analysis Application
Rick Petrecca presented an update to the charter for approval of a joint IPD/MCSD
Crime Analysis project. The project will deliver a set of GIS based Crime Analysis tools.
The outcome willl provide real-time crime analysis information to officers in the field.
The application will be web-based and will be available to the general public after
implementation.

ISA Internal Service Funds Discussion
Discussions between the Auditor, Controller and ISA have occurred regarding fund
balances accumulated over time and how best to manage these. It was determined the
CIO needed a certain balance in this fund to cover financial obligations on a monthly
basis. The chairman suggested the board discuss possible reduction of this fund
balance, but urged recognition of the possibility of unknown transition costs at the
culmination of the RFP.
Bart Brown, Budget Manager from the Controller’s Office voiced his concerns over the
lack of regular financial status reports from ISA to the IT Board and suggested the
agency follow the example of other city agencies by making monthly financial reports to
the board.
Discussion of IMAGIS Consortium and Innovative Mapping Solutions, LLC Agreement
The agreement would allow for the sale of GIS data CDs to interested parties. Jim Stout
asked that ISA represent IMAGIS on a proposed contract.
Major Ball stated he and the Sheriff would like to review the data on the CDs for security
reasons. The item was tabled.
New Business
Mr. Clifford requested the CIO explore other means of generating revenue via IT
services.
Mr. Ricketts requested the ISA reorganization plan be brought before the board at the
next meeting.
Adjourn
The IT Board meeting adjourned at 11:20 AM.
Respectfully submitted,
Bob Geis

Monthly Highlights and Statistics
April 2004
From the Account
Manager’s Desk
I am pleased to report that after
many years of waiting, the ACS
applications development and
support staff have been relocated
from various leased facilities in the downtown area to the
city/county building tower. The new location on the 3rd
floor will make the staff more accessible and responsive
to the departments and agencies they serve.

Assessors Getting Tidemark Reports
In April 2004, the new Tidemark Web-Enabled Assessor
Reports were completed and implemented in production.
In fact, testing proved that the online versions of the web
reports actually ran faster than the client server options
through Tidemark. Paul Ricketts and his staff at the
Lawrence Township Assessor’s Office are breaking in
the new web option. The reports will soon be opened to
all Township Assessors’ Offices.
With the availability of these reports on the web, the use
of the online building plans (released in February 2004)
and the DMD Permit Research site, Assessor staff will
be able to find all the Tidemark information they require
online. They will no longer require a full Tidemark
application install, saving them valuable space on their
individual PCs. At the same time, DMD will ‘save’ the
application licenses used by the Assessors, allowing
DMD to delay the need to purchase additional Tidemark
licenses. Another ‘win-win’ for all parties involved.

City HR Testing New e-PAR System
User acceptance testing is under way for the City Human
Resources E-PAR application. User testing is being
conducted in a phased approach, whereby HR receives
components to test on a schedule of every two weeks.
The first two components have already been delivered
and consisted of Administration roles to include
Department, Job Code, Job Category, Division, Roles,
User, PAR type, PAR Separation Type, Salary Grade,
Job Title, Holiday Calendar, Password, Census Code,
Index Code, Timekeeper, Signature Path, Level 2 Code
and Change Designee. The next release is scheduled for
May 11, 2004. The completed system is on schedule to
be delivered for full UAT on August 24, 2004.

Monthly Highlights and Statistics
April 2004

Parks CLASS System Upgraded
The DPR CLASS application was successfully upgraded
from v.4.1 to v.5.0 over Easter weekend, April 10 and
11. Special recognition should be given to Sravan
Patharla, Gary Johnson and Tracy Miller of ACS who
spent much of the Holiday weekend ensuring the success
of the upgrade. Special recognition also goes to the
Parks’ staff for their testing efforts that weekend and
prior, as well as their hard work in training the Parks
staff on the upgraded application.
The upgrade ensures that the CLASS application will
continue to be supported by the vendor. DPR has
identified new features in v.5.0 that will enhance their
CLASS capabilities. These features include:
•
•
•
•

•
•
•
•

Enhanced capabilities related to program registration
The ability to produce income tax receipts for Day
camps/Child Care
The ability for registrant rollover which will save
time on day camp registrations
The ability to transfer from one course to another,
right now if client is registered in one course and
wants to attend a different one, the client will have
to withdraw and register. Additional reporting is
available with this feature.
Attendance sheets by date range instead of course
date
The ability to view accounting transactions by date
range, currently it is all accounting transactions for
the history of the account
Receipt for program registration/facility booking
enhancements
This release will also gives DPR the capability to
add additional modules such as the Membership
Module and Point-of-Sale touch screens if
purchased.

GEAC Upgrade Requested for 2004
GEAC is the payroll system used by the City and the
County. The statement of work for the GEAC upgrade
was prioritized and received a priority of #10 on the list
of projects prioritized for 2004. The GEAC upgrade is a
major project that will require a large amount of
dedicated resource activity.
The current version of GEAC will no longer be
supported after 06/01/2005. After this date GEAC will

All JCL will have to be reviewed for possible
changes. (Approximately 160 jobs, 110 procs, 300
parm members)
All programs will need to be reviewed for possible
changes and have to be recompiled. (Approximately
30 in-house developed programs, 23 documented
site modifications)
Review screen access security for possible changes.
Convert Data and Historical files.
The Wage Control system for the City will be
included to research impact and make any
modifications as needed.

Due to the calendar year issues for the payroll system the
Clients would like this implemented by 01/01/05.

Improved Infrastructure and Processes
ACS offices at 129 E. Market were relocated to the third
floor of the tower in the City/County Building. These
offices had previously been located at 148 E. Market and
were forced to relocate temporarily due to plumbing
problems in the facility. All of the on-site ACS personnel
are now located in the City/County Building. Network
equipment at the 129 E Market location has been
disconnected and will be available as spare equipment in
the event of any future hardware problems.

DHCP Use Expanding
A new Cisco DHCP server was installed and is now
operational. DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration
Protocol) automatically assigns TCP/IP network
addresses to workstations when they make a connection
to the network. Automatic assignments allow laptop
users unlimited mobility from one City/County facility to
another and eliminates the need to manage most of the
assignments manually. There will still be a need for
some manual assignments, most notably printers and the
few workstations that require a static assignment to
fulfill security needs. At this time, three locations have
DHCP running under test mode and a procedure is being
drafted to provide a structured method for the conversion
of the rest of the network. The effort significantly
reduces the amount of work necessary to administer a
large IP network.

ACS Supports Primary Election
In preparation for the Primary Election processing in
May, ACS provided assistance to the Marion County
Clerk’s Office and Election Board. These efforts
included configuration of a new election process in
iReport (a web-based multimedia content management
system), configuration of an FTP script to send election
results to the news media, as well as configuration of
iReport for the special election process in Cumberland.
Assistance was provided to the technical representatives
of the local TV stations to ensure proper coverage of the
election, as well as to the Election Board to ensure realtime election results being posted to the Indygov website.

Major Technical
Project Updates
The following projects were
addressed during the month and
their current status is presented.
IPD Drug Interdiction
IPD has requested assistance in moving the Drug
Interdiction Section from the airport site to another
nearby site. The new site will be shared with the same
Federal Customs and Homeland Security personnel. A
DS1 high-speed data connection has been requested from
SBC.
The new office build-out is complete and both Federal
and IPD workers have moved into the premises. IPD
officers have moved into the new location and the DS-1
data service ordered for them has been installed by SBC.
ACS is working out site wiring details with the
Department of Homeland Security.
ACS also
decommissioned the old IPD Drug Interdiction site by
turning off the SBC circuit they had at that site and
removing network equipment that was in use there. Deinstalled network equipment will be reused at the new
site.
State Connectivity
A strategy for long term connectivity between the
City/County enterprise and the State of Indiana has been
developed and efforts toward goals are in progress. This
connection is needed for compliance with the Federal
mandate of a single source program at the State level
requiring all Indiana counties to use the same program
for Child support administration. FSSA (Family Social
Services Administration) is Indiana’s administrator of
this new program.

JTAC (Judicial Technology and Automation Committee)
test servers have been defined and a JTAC translation
pool is now in service. The JTAC working group for
Indianapolis/Marion County is now using the DS3 link
for application and server testing to the State of Indiana
network.

project is on hold at the moment as funding of the project
is the next step in the process.

Additionally, a translation pool has been added, and put
into production use for Quest users on the State of
Indiana network. This is a new application usage that
was not foreseen when the DS3 connection was first
planned. This service is in daily use.

During the month of April, 5,023
calls were presented to the Help
Desk of which 3,992 were handled
by the daytime Help Desk and 777
were received by our after-hours operation. 254 calls
were terminated before the Help Desk had a chance to
answer the call. The average time to answer a customer’s
call was 19 seconds, and 91.5% of prime time calls were
answered in less than 60 seconds

Head End Re-Engineering
The purpose of this project is to provide connectivity and
distribution capabilities to allow the IPD Training
Academy to become an alternate site for City /County
employee workers in the event of a disaster. Once this
project is finished, remote sites will still have
connectivity to network resources even if the
City/County building is destroyed. Planning meetings
have occurred and weekly status updates are being
provided by SBC.
The new OC3 SONET link into the City/County building
has been brought up, and the initial cutover phase is in
progress. The backup data and voice circuits for 8 remote
sites have swung from the old DS3 headend connections
over to the SONET OC3. Eight more will be moved the
week of May 2. The priority in the remote routers has
been shifted at these sites to use the new SONET
connection by preference, in order to force traffic
through the new OC3 link and actually stress-test more
effectively. If no problems occur at the sixteen test sites,
then starting the week of May 9, we will start moving 10
sites per day, 5 days per week. All backup connections
should be moved before the end of May.
Juvenile Detention Center
Marion County Juvenile Court has requested that ACS
help in planning and testing for a new Videoconferencing system. ACS has instituted a program of
monitoring on the T1 connections from the MCSJD
central facility at 2451 N. Keystone to the 5 remote
MCSJD sites. This monitoring will determine available
bandwidth resources on these T1’s for possible
videoconference applications. ACS will also assist
MCSJD in technical evaluation of various vendor
solutions.
Small Claims Courts
Walkthroughs for 8 locations have been performed.
Proposals are being prepared for presentation to
customer. We are in the process of researching lower
cost alternatives than DS-1 connectivity to help with
monetary impact on smaller budgeted entities. This

activities:
•

•

ACS has begun the installation of the 200 desktop
computers for the Indianapolis Police Department
and have 111 completed to date. Another 150
laptops for the Indianapolis Police Department have
been purchased and are being imaged and will be
delivered to IPD on May 14th
DPW will be upgrading approximately 48 computers
to IMS version 7.7 which will need to be done
manually. ACS will work on this project during the
first 3 weeks in May. In addition to the IMS
upgrade, 8 of the computer will have to be upgraded
to Windows XP for IMS to work properly

The Technical Services area identifies the following
planned activities:
Network Communications
• The initial step of moving selected Parks’ site
backup connections to the new SONET ring has
started. 16 sites will be moved the first two weeks as
a test. If no problems surface, then starting May 10
we will move 10 sites per day 5 days per week. This
is scheduled to take till May 24. Then there will be a
one-week period while we configure the 6500 at 901
N. Post Road to ready it for the second phase of the
OC3 cutover program. This presumes no problems
and no strike at SBC.
• There are two identified security weaknesses in
Cisco IOS software which require updating of the
IOS versions in use on the routers on the Enterprise
network. The Communications Group will be
surveying and updating firmware on a scheduled
basis across the network during May.

Monthly Highlights and Statistics
April 2004

The ACS Communications Group has new WAN

April saw the continuation of CivicNet’s growth trend, with over
32,000 transactions – representing a 66% increase over April
2003 totals. The addition of new services, along with steady
increases in property and civil court record requests have
contributed to the significant growth the site has experienced in
2004.
Development efforts continued in April for the online inspection
requests and completion compliance card servic es for the
Division of Compliance. Testing is scheduled to begin in May.
Online submission of completion compliance cards online will
provide contractors with verific ation that the card was accepted
and the permit was closed in the Tidemark database.
Also, CivicNet has begun work with the Division of Compliance
to address the need for online craftsmen and general contractor
license renewals. Division of Compliance staff is overwhelmed
with license renewals at the end of each year when renewals are
processed. This project is expected to save thousands of staff
hours each year and eliminate the manual data-entry process.
The last of CivicNet’s seven permitting services was migrated to
the new server in April. This included a complete code review,
along with conversion to the updated permit template for Master
Permits.
.

Wayne Township Emergency Services Education Center is
scheduled to deploy the CivicNet payment portal service in May.
The center offers a wide variety of classes for fire fighters,
EMT’s, etc. within a three-state area (Indiana, Ohio and Illinois).
Being able to register and pay for classes online is expected to
increase participation in the classes.
Over the past few years, CivicNet has added new services and
enhanced existing services by adding the credit card payment
option. As a result, the CivicNet site is being reorganized and its
design updated to improve navigation for CivicNet services.
Also, a new customer service tool called Live Chat will be
incorporated into the updated site, giving customers the option to
get immediate help with questions through instant messaging
with live operators.

Dear IT Board Members:
After several months deliberation, the IMAGIS Board voted (April 14) to extend a
contract for distribution of GIS data. At the IT Board (April 20), a vote was
tabled pending review by public safety. As you requested, I provided copies (on
April 27) of the contract to IPD and the Sheriff for review. Based on their
feedback, I agree to remove the layers they requested.
Specifically the contract is between ISA (on behalf of the IMAGIS Consortium)
and Innovative Mapping. The product is a self-contained GIS viewing software
& GIS data on a CD-ROM. This is very similar to a previous product, ids, which
was met with favor by the public.
For the most part, the product will contain the same layers available on the
IndyGov webmap. The product includes IMAGIS aerial photos (but not
Pictometry). It does not include energy utility information (electric or gas
facilities). There is no data from the Assessors.
The contract provides that I can add or remove layers at any time; and I
promise to communicate regularly with the IT Board and public safety regarding
the layers we will be releasing.
There is no contract fee; in fact IMAGIS receives royalties from sales. The
product assists IMAGIS with our data distribution duties, provides a product
that the community is been asking for, and has the potential to provide
revenue.
I ask for your support to permit ISA to enter into this contract on behalf of the
IMAGIS Board.
Thank you.
Sincerely,

Jim Stout

Mr. Ricketts called the meeting to order at 9:35 AM.
Minutes:
Ms. Womacks motioned to approve the January 15, 2003 minutes, Mr. Clifford
seconded, and the motion passed unanimously.
Status Updates
Enhanced Access Review Committee Report & CivicNet Directors Report
Mr. Jordan, the Marion County Treasurer and Chairman of the Review Committee stated
the CivicNet and financial reports stood as submitted in the packet.
JTAC Report
Mr. Flynn updated the Board on the progress of JTAC

Mr. Matthews noted regarding replacement or upgrading hardware, it is his experience
that by upgrading older machines it is not efficient when you consider total cost of
ownership.
Mr. Ricketts stressed importance of knowing specific user needs for replacement PC’s
before the system goes online so that any necessary purchases could be figured into
2005 budgets.
ACS Report
Mr. Nero stated the report stood as submitted.
Mr. Nero complimented his staff on the nearly flawless deployment of the new
mainframe OS upgrades over the past weekend.
The effort was the result of many
months of testing.
Mr. Ricketts recognized Kathy Fluke for her role in implementing a blueprint imaging
plan for the assessors.
Discussion Items
RFP Discussion
Mr. Mockert thanked the board for the opportunity to engage in the RFP procedure. He
also extended his appreciation to all who have participated thus far in the RFP process.
The team put tremendous time and effort into developing the RFP. Input from the
business side was given and combined with input from the technical side to determine
the scope of the vendor solution being sought. City legal is currently working on the
terms and conditions that will supplement the final version of the RFP document.
Goals: First and foremost is to improve technology overall. Evaluate deployment of
resources and realign ISA into a strategic role… one that focuses on deployment of
strategic initiatives.
Unification of goals between business units and ISA in pursuit of common shared vision
is critical; for instance, a new property system, a wireless environment, and better use of
current tools along the lines of e-government and GIS integration.
Mr. Soliman provided his comments about the RFP.
He stated the team has identified 3 major objectives:
• Retaining intellectual capital so that ISA will be in a position to assume ownership
of its IT initiatives
• Shift of focus from day-to-day operations to working in concert with customers to
develop innovative solutions.
• Reengineering of internal business processes with a focus on prioritization
process and chargeback to increase performance of our IT operation.
The RFP team has been working very hard. Efforts have continued on the statements of
work that are scopes of services that comprise the RFP. In relation to the infrastructure,

there is consideration of a bidding model based on capacity and consumption rather
than unit cost. This, it is hoped, will create a more efficient operation and enable a shift
in budget for infrastructure into new IT initiatives. Application development has been
evaluated to create one that is more flexible, possibly based on time and materials,
rather than FTEs. The Legal Team has been working on terms and conditions of an
agreement to ensure maximum return on investment.
Mr. Matthews inquired whether it was mandatory a capacity and consumption model be
adopted. Mr. Soliman replied it was not. Vendors would be encouraged to use
whatever would allow for the most efficient operation.
Mr. Matthews stressed with a time and materials model, great discipline would be
needed to ensure best performance. Ms. Enders echoed these sentiments.
Mr. Mockert and Mr. Soliman agreed this method would be challenging, but stated that it
had great potential.
Mr. Matthews inquired as to the possibility of the need for additional training in order to
meet these challenges. Mr. Mockert replied with the current foundation of skills a
degree of honing would be necessary. Mr. Clifford inquired as to whether the needed
skilled individuals would be employees or contractors. Mr. Mockert replied that both
methods would be used, as the situation demanded.
Ms. Enders asked whether vendors would be asked to include a skills transfer aspects in
their responses. Mr. Mockert stated he has experience with this sort of situation and he
anticipates that something of this nature would be included. Mr. Soliman added this
would be pursued, though not in every instance. Ms. Enders agreed that it would not be
applicable in every circumstance.
Judge Payne advised against using the terms “reduce costs,” stating this might raise
expectations inappropriately. Mr. Mockert agreed with Judge Payne. More appropriate
terminology will be adopted, reflecting an emphasis on increased value, rather than
dollar savings.
Mr. Matthews asked for an update regarding the timeline. Mr. Belch replied it is
anticipated the RFP will likely be released following the March 16th board meeting.
Responses would be due around April 30. By June 1st there should be a select number
of presentations. It is hoped that negotiations could be concluded by July. The target
date for signing a contract is August 15, 2004.
The special meeting for the IT Board scheduled for February 25th will be cancelled.
Adjourn
The IT Board meeting adjourned at 10:39 AM.
Respectfully submitted,
Bob Geis

CIVICNET HIGHLIGHTS
Reminder:
Financial data is now being reported on a one-month delay.
This means that financials for February 2004 will be detailed in
the report distributed in April.
CivicNet growth continues to exceed expectations. January
transactions were 36% above the prior year, while city-county
revenue collections grew by 126% over 2003.

February at a Glance

Transactions ...............................21,660
Page Accesses ..........................307,186
Statutory Funds Collected......$203,517

Civicnet permitting services also continue to increase in usage.
Adoption rates for the online permits versus in-agency permits
reached 43% in 2003. Overall, the number of Web-issued
permits showed an increase of 11.75% in 2003 over 2002.
Similarly, 45% of all IPD and MCSD accidents reports were
obtained online via CivicNet versus in-office in 2003.
In February, the upgraded IPD Limited Criminal History service
was successfully deployed, along with the upgrade for the
Electrical Permit service.

Project Highlights

Electrical Permit Migration Completed
Limited Criminal History ... Completed
Traffic Ticket Upgrade ....... Completed

Development also began in February for the Division of
Compliance Inspection Request and Completion Card services.
This will provide a ‘One-Stop-Shop’ for contractors who apply
for permits online. Once the new services are available ,
contractors will be able to apply and receive permits online;
request an inspection as needed online; and at the end of the
project, file the completion card online. Currently, contractors
depend on Division of Compliance personnel for inspection
requests and for submitting the completion cards. The agency
recognized the need for a simplified, manageable process to
ensure compliance with inspections and completion cards. The
service will allow online submission of the completion cards,
and will directly interface with the Division of Compliance
Tidemark database. This will eliminate the need for manual data
entry by agency staff when the cards arrive by mail or in person.
One significant benefit of the service will be an e-mail
notification to the contractor confirming the acceptance of the
completion card.

Check-Out Wayne Township .. Testing

Another major project for is underway for CivicNet: the Child
Support Online Payment Service. Marion County processes
between 1,500 and 1,800 child support payments each day for
citizens who pay by mail or in person. This application will
interface with the State-mandated ISETS (Indiana Support
Enforcement Tracking System), while processing revenue
directly into the Marion County account.

JUSTIS Data Conversion
Background Information
z There have been significant changes to the overall
conversion plan since the last meeting. The conversion
team will be creating “Reports” from the JUSTIS system
which will be converted to XML documents, and made
available on the new CMS as a document that can be
viewed or printed by system users. 3 Reports have been
identified for this purpose:
– Case Information Report (CIR)– Consists of 13 sections
with 174 data elements
– Case Activity Report (CAR) – Contains CCS information
for each case.
– Case Financial Report (CFR) – Contains summary and
detail level financial information for each case.
3/11/2004

Progress - Continued
Conversion continued Progress on new conversion plan

Monthly Highlights and Statistics
February 2004
From the Account
Manager’s Desk
February was a banner month for
the
implementation
and
expansion of new technologies
throughout the City/County. Our
report this month highlights a few of the most notable.
DMD has expanded the use of their document imaging
capabilities. Plan documents are now available on the
Web to the Township Assessors. Assessors will benefit
significantly from reductions in storage and increased
efficiency with easy access to plans.
IPD has implemented Phase 1 of their Wireless Access
Project. This grant-funded project was designed to
enable IPD Patrol Officers the ability to securely login to
our network via laptop computer while in their vehicles.
th

On February 9 , the Juvenile Facility began a 30-day
transition period to fully move the Facility to the
City/County enterprise network. On the March 12th / 13th
approximately 30 ACS staff will be on site at the facility
to accomplish the change over.
And finally, ACS successfully converted the mainframe
computer’s operating system from MVS OS/390 to z/OS.
z/OS provides more reliable data transfer rates between
the processor and storage,
and provides easier
connectivity in support of client server applications.

Technology Facilitates Data Sharing
Between City and County
DMD’s Division of Compliance has grown with the use
of their new FileNet Web Interface to the point they were
ready to try sharing electronic plan documents with the
Township Assessors’ Offices. These plan documents
had traditionally been accepted in hard copy by DMD
and picked up on a monthly basis by the Township
Assessors’ Offices. Assessors then worked with and
stored the hard copy documents. ACS assisted DMD
with setting up a test period for the Lawrence Township
Assessor’s Office to utilize the DMD FileNet Web
Interface to access electronic building plans.

functionality of the application and clarity of the plan
documents.
Assessors will benefit significantly from the reduction in
storage and the increase in efficiency due to easy access
with which they can refer to plans and return to specific
plans for repeated review. Mr. Ricketts discussed the
opportunity to use electronic plan documents with all the
Township Assessors at their February Assessor’s
Meeting. The response was overwhelming and all the
townships were set up with access to DMD’s FileNet
Web Interface by Friday, February 13th.
Given that DMD already owned the FileNet Web
Interface, there was no cost to allow access to the
Assessors. This information-sharing success story is
truly a win/win situation for both DMD & the Assessors!

Hansen User Group Formed
February also brought the ‘birth’ of the Hansen User
Group (HUG).
DPW, Parks, ISA and ACS are
coordinating together to organize this group in order to
more effectively manage the growth and future of the
Hansen product within DPW and Parks as well as to
keep key user groups informed of the direction and
priorities that exist with the system. ACS Consultants
Kathy Fluke and Jill Weirick are leading the group
through their organizational setup and initiation.

County Jail Installing Paperless Law
Library
The Marion County Sheriff’s Department submitted a
request for assistance in implementing a “Paperless Law
Library”, a server-based system, at the MCSD jail. The
facility is to be used by the inmates of the MCSD jail and
possibly by inmates at other annex facilities.
To accomplish this project, several new state-of-the-art
Dell computers were purchased as well as a couple of
printers. A new server will be installed as well. Security
measures were taken to separate the computers from the
rest of the enterprise by establishing a private Virtual
Local Area Network (VLAN) and installing security
software on each PC to lock down the device, limiting
access to only designated applications.

The test was quite successful. Paul Ricketts summed up
their testing with a quote from Jerry Mcquire, “You had
us at hello.” They were pleasantly surprised with the

New Mainframe Operating System Now
In Production
ACS successfully converted the mainframe computer’s
operating system from MVS OS/390 to z/OS. z/OS is a
highly secure, scalable, high-performance enterprise
operating system on which to build and develop a
comprehensive and diverse application execution
environment. Additionally, the City/County is now in a
position to take advantage of the IBM mainframe’s
internal hardware architecture, including more reliable
data transfer rates between the processor and storage and
a means to provide easier connectivity in support of
client server applications.

Juvenile Court Becomes
Newest ACS Customer
After months of research, planning,
and the collaborative efforts of ACS,
ISA and representatives of the Marion
Superior Court Juvenile Facility, the Juvenile Facility
came into scope with the City/County Enterprise
effective February 9, 2004. At that time, the team began
a 30-day transition period to fully move the Facility to
the City/County enterprise network.
There are two separate networks located at the Juvenile
Facility. The first network is for the facility alone and
the second network is connected to the City/County
Enterprise and is supported by ACS. The second
network supports the Courts, IPD, Public Defender,
Prosecutor, Probation and Clerk staff located at the
Facility.
To move Juvenile Facility staff to our
City/County network, the two networks will need to be
connected within the Facility. The scheduled days of
implementation to complete this task are Mach 12th and
13th.
On the March 12th and 13th implementation days, there
will be approximately 30 ACS staff on site at the facility
to accomplish the change over.

New CRM System Project Underway
The Mayor’s Action Center CRM Application
implementation is well underway. The vendor has
begun implementation of the new Siebel CRM
Application that will eventually replace the Mayor’s
Action Center (MAC) Expert Advisor application. Steve
Miller from ACS has created the Oracle development
database instance in support of this project and is in the
process of creating a separate Test database instance that
will be used for training. Van Hemmerlein of ACS is
working closely with the vendor to provide linkages to

the Hansen Infrastructure Management System and the
Master Address application. ACS will continue to
support our customer on this very important project.

Major Technical
Project Updates
Improved Infrastructure and Processes
Last year, IPD requested the implementation of a
wireless access system. This grant-funded project was
designed to enable IPD Patrol Officers and new recruits
at the Training Academy the ability to securely login to
our network via laptop computer while in their vehicles.
This means of network connection saves the Officer the
trouble of hauling inside all of his materials from his car,
finding a suitable computer in the District office to use,
and then potentially getting “stuck” in the office.
Benefits of this project are that the Officer is back out on
the streets more quickly, data is entered in a more timely
fashion, and the Officer receives updates from his
superiors more quickly.
The necessary hardware
including antennas and access points have been installed
at the City/County building, the IPD Training Academy,
as well as the North, South, East and West District sites
operated by IPD. This represents the first phase of
implementing a wireless access system for IPD and is to
be followed by other locations in the near future.
Improved Server Environment
Three Novell servers were upgraded with more memory,
hard disk space and faster processor speeds. This
implementation will provide cost savings by using
existing server hardware that will be used to enhance
authentication services and application deployment
through Novell.
Improved Security Measures
Web Security was enhanced with the installation of a
new switch in the Secure Web DMZ zone. This zone is
designated for web applications that require Novell
authentication using iChain or require additional
protection from public access. This zone will also
prevent any malicious public activity because services
will be limited by the Firewall, which will be segregated
by this switch.
Since the start of February we have seen seven major
virus outbreaks that had very high distribution rates. This
activity has caused the security team to be very busy
controlling viruses from entering the City County’s

Page 2

network. We have the latest virus protection and have
been on top of the situation with protecting our
environment. The virus works by “spoofing” the address
in the FROM field. The City’s Symantec email virus
gateway protects us by removing the viruses from all
attachments but will send the email message through
after it removes the virus. The security team does block
all known subject lines that are known to carry the virus
but some of the viruses will randomly create other
subject lines which makes it hard to block the message
itself. We have not seen any internal outbreaks or know
of any infected machines, which we continue to monitor.

Monthly Statistics from
the Help Desk
During the month of February,
4,697 calls were presented to the
Help Desk of which 3,683 were
handled by the daytime Help Desk
and 1,014 were received by our after-hours operation.
195 calls were terminated before the Help Desk had a
chance to answer the call. The average time to answer a
customer’s call was 18 seconds, and 93.9% of prime time
calls were answered in less than 60 seconds.
Of those calls, 699 turned out to be technical problems.
ACS closed 729 problem calls during the month and
achieved a first call resolution of 86.2%. This means that
86.2% of those who called with a problem had their issue
resolved by the time they hung up the phone.
ACS processed 312 security requests during the month.
122 involved changes to security profiles, there were 97
deletions of various access rights and 93 new access
rights were granted. ACS also closed 397 service
requests during the month.
ACS technicians completed 1,087 desktop moves, adds,
changes, or installations during February. This volume is
112% above the contractual maximum for daily activity.
For the month of February, 172 newly purchased
desktops/laptops were installed. Six courtrooms received
new furniture this month and a total of 30 computers plus
several printers were removed and reinstalled.

From the Tech Bench
Microsoft Word
Print Multiple Documents from the
folder list:
Printing a number of Word
documents can easily become cumbersome. Rather than
opening each file and printing individually, use the folder
list to print them all at once.
Follow these steps:
1. Open the folder that contains the Word documents you
want to print.
2. Press [Ctrl], and select the files you want to print. (If
the files are adjacent, select the first file in the list, press
[Shift], and select the last file in the list.)
3. Right-click the selection and select Print from the
shortcut menu.
4. Select the desired print options, and click OK. (The
selected options will apply to all of the documents.)
Word will print the files in the order they appear in the
folder.
Microsoft Excel
Simplify entering and formatting dates:
Working with dates in Excel can sometimes be tricky.
Use these two tips to make entering and formatting dates
easier.
Excel automatically formats a formula cell as a date cell
when the formula refers to another cell containing a date
or a time. For example, if you enter 1/1/2003 in A1,
1/1/2004 in B1, and =B1-A1 in cell C1, Excel displays
the result in C1 as 12/30/1900.
While Excel doesn't let you turn off this automatic date
formatting, it does provide a shortcut key combination to
quickly change the cell to General format. Select the
formula cell, and press [Ctrl][Shift][~] to display the true
value, which in this case is 365.
In addition, Excel's Autofill feature lets you quickly enter
a series of dates into a worksheet. For example, say you
want to track weekly attendance by entering a series of
dates in Column B, and you want to start with 3/1/04.
Follow these steps:
1. Enter 3/1/04 in B1.
2. In B2, enter =B1+7.
Click and drag B2's fill handle down the column to
generate the additional dates.

Mr. Ricketts called the meeting to order at 9:39 AM. He apologized for Mr. Hineline
who had a personal emergency and could not attend the meeting.
Minutes
Ms. Womacks motioned to approve the April 16, 2002 meeting minutes, Ms Davis
seconded and the motion passed unanimously.
IT Projects
Resolution 02-04- PC Master Lease Agreement
Ms. Biddinger reported there were two leasing vendor proposals that were the most
responsive to the RFP sent out in March by Purchasing. The resolution submitted to the
Board to approve, requests ISA award the master lease agreements to IBM and Dell.
A discussion ensued in the need to drive the lease rate lower than proposed by gathering
volume discounts, even though no department could commit to any certain volume at this
point. The Board asked legal counsel to change the resolution to reflect the need for
volume discounts based on attaining a certain plateau.
Mr. Borgmann suggested adding to the “Therefore clause” of the PC Master Lease
Agreement Resolution to say the following: before executing the final lease agreement
the Chief Information Officer shall negotiate a lease rate savings based upon either the
aggregate number of devices leased or the total lease funds allocated. Ms. Womacks
motioned to amend Resolution 02-04 as stated above, Ms. Davis seconded and the

IT Board Minutes

motion to amend the resolution was unanimous. Mr. Turner motioned to pass Resolution
02-04 as amended, Ms. Womacks seconded and the motion passed unanimously.
Internet Services/Range of Coverage Discussion
Ms. Biddinger reported during the past month there had been discussions at the Enhanced
Access Board regarding the appropriateness of using the IndyGov web site for not-forprofit organizations. The specific one in question was the PAL Club, which is associated
with Public Safety and actually has police officers assigned to work there.
Historically, ISA’s policy was to support organizations directly affiliated with a
department or agency currently hosted on the Indy Gov web site. The PAL Club met this
criteria due to the close relationship with IPD. With the recent discussions, ISA believes
it would be best to gather Board input at this time.
The Enhanced Access Board issue came about when the PAL club wanted to solicit
donations on the site, and CivicNet was engaged to handle the financial transaction as
they have done with all other web-based financial transactions for the City and County.
Many of the Board members then questioned the appropriateness of any not-for-profit
organization using these resources as if they were part of City/County government.
Mr. Ricketts questioned the use of charge cards on our site and the liability issues that
may arise if an individual were to obtain access to the information. Ms. Biddinger stated
CivicNet has secure encryption software that enables the user to safely enter their
information. Ms. Davis asked to delay a motion to allow for future review and
development of policies regarding this issue. Mr. Ricketts inquired about add on fees.
Ms. Lindenbusch, the CivicNet Director, stated an add on fee would be incorporated into
the donation options. The IT Board acted to delay a motion for thirty days to allow for
further review of this topic.
Status Reports
CIO Report
Ms. Biddinger stated ISA is looking at updating the infrastructure and connectivity at 10th
and Post Road to provide a facility for business continuity in the event of a disaster.
Prior to the next meeting, a Privacy Statement and Web Accessibility Statement will be
sent to the Board for approval. Both documents are currently in draft form and are being
reviewed by Corporation Counsel and the Public Access Counselor. Once those
documents are returned with comments they will be e-mailed to everyone.
Ms. Turner gave the IT Board an update on the 2003 Budget process. She thanked the
Auditor and Controller for their assistance. As of May 21st a few agencies have not
completed their budget form. Those agencies are being reminded to fill out the form by
the close of business on May 21st.

IT Board Minutes
Page 3
Mr. Ricketts advised the Lawrence Township Assessor’s internet site contained incorrect
directions to his office and asked that it be corrected.
ACS Report
Mr. Curtis stated the applications area completed three key projects. The RFQ, CDFS,
and RMD were completed in April. The RFQ project allows DPW to manage the RFQ
process for Public Works projects. Company’s can respond to the RFQ directly by
inputting their information into DPW’s application. CDFS stands for Community
Development Financial Services; this application allows DMD to gather necessary
information and create their quarterly reports for the Federal Government through a web
application. The RMD project is for the Clerks Office to document any information that
is checked in and out for court needs.
Mr. Ricketts thanked Mr. Curtis for the success with the CAMA System (Computer
Assisted Mass Appraisal System) upgrade.
Mr. Curtis stated the many customer moves in the month of April went well.
Modifications in next months report will reflect the changes negotiated in Amendment
59.
Within the next couple of months ACS will be working with ISA on a Technology
Migration Plan as well as many new application projects. Progress on all of the activities
underway will be reported in the coming months.
Ms. Womacks commented on the low response rates from the orange customer response
cards. Mr. Curtis stated ACS is implementing a web version of the response card on June
1st. Effective June 1st also is a customer of the month incentive program providing lunch
for two at the City Market for those who submit their card. Once per year, a brand new
PC will be donated to the chosen customer’s charitable organization of choice.
Ms. Taylor thanked all those individuals who helped with the election.
New Business
Mr. Ricketts asked the Board to think about the possibility of televising the Board
meetings. Any comments or opinions are to be emailed to Mr. Ricketts.
Next scheduled IT Board meeting is June 18, 2002 in Room 260.
Adjourned
Mr. Ricketts adjourned the meeting at 10:53 AM.
Respectfully submitted,

TO:

FROM:

Mike Hineline

DATE:

June 12, 2002

SUBJECT:

Master Lease Agreements Structure

Last month, you approved Resolution 02-04 after amending it to have me include improved lease
rates based on volume of purchases. I apologize for the fact that both Bruce Turner and I had
personal emergencies and were unable to attend since we had been the two people chiefly
involved in these bids.
I am bringing this action back to you at the June meeting because I was not able to accomplish
what you asked me to do. As I understand the issue presented, the IT Board felt we should be
able to gain some benefit by buying more units of technology, i.e. purchase more and we get
bigger discounts. We have addressed this in the negotiations for our standard PC hardware with
Dell and HP. Our quoted numbers are based on the vendor expecting we will purchase in the
neighborhood of 900 – 1200 PCs a year. This is not guaranteed but is where they have priced
our items. We can (and do) look for possible improvement if we make a large purchase such as
the recent Courts rollout of 400+ PCs in one step.
This resolution is to award a contract with two leasing companies to be able to, in essence, buy a
service where the leasing vendor purchases this technology and furnishes it to local government.
As such, the pricing of this transaction is primarily a factor of the City/County’s credit rating and
the current cost of funds at the time of the lease schedule being made. Our lease schedules will
not likely be large enough to see any major rate influence. Please note that our reason for
structuring this RFP to award to two companies was to keep the element of market competition
in the mix. We will be able to see that we receive current market rates because if one vendor is
not competitive, they will not get the business at the time of the lease schedule. This gives us the
built in support of current market forces to keep lease rates as low as possible.
I hope this explains why I was not able to honor the direction given in the last resolution. I will
ask for your approval to move forward as originally presented at the June Board meeting.
If you have questions prior to the meeting, please give me a call.

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY BOARD
Board Resolution to Approve a Contract between the Information
Service Agency and Clawson Communications Inc. for
Communication Systems Cabling and Telephone Station Equipment Maintenance
WHEREAS, the Information Services Agency recognizes the continued need for
communication systems cabling and telephone station equipment maintenance; and
WHEREAS, Clawson Communications, Inc. has proven it can provide the necessary
services for communication systems cabling and telephone equipment maintenance;
NOW, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the Information Technology Board
authorize the Chief Information Officer to finalize and approve a contract between the
Information Services Agency and Clawson Communications for communication systems
cabling and telephone station equipment maintenance for a three (3) year period with a
cost not to exceed $174,280 per year, based on usage.

Renewal Contract with Clawson Communications

At the June IT Board meeting, I am asking your approval to extend an existing service
agreement with Clawson Communications for data and telephone wiring and station
equipment maintenance.
This contract is based on hourly charges with a not to exceed value of $174,280.00. The
previous contract value has been reduced from $267,000.00 as our utilization of these
resources has moderated.
These services are equivalent to approximately two FTEs and provide two primary
functions for ISA. These technicians perform data and voice cabling functions and
support within the City County Building (CCB) and in remote facilities, as needed.
Cable within the CCB is pulled by the Building Authority but all termination and testing
is done by these techs. They also provide basic telephone support to the workstation as
required.
Everyone who interacts with these two technicians praises their work. The comments
I’ve received about their efforts have been excellent. Comments from ACS staff,
Telephone Ops staff, and Building Authority staff all indicate they do an excellent job for
us. One comment seemed to summarize it all. They stated that these techs know more
about how our wiring plant is built than any other individuals in any of our organizations.
I ask for your approval for me to execute a renewal of this service agreement for an
additional 3 years.

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY BOARD
Resolution to Adopt a Privacy Statement and Website Accessibility Statement for
the City of Indianapolis and Marion County Indiana
WHEREAS, the Information Technology Board supports the open flow of information
over the Internet and wants to promote trust within the community that uses the City of
Indianapolis/Marion County websites; and
WHEREAS, a common practice is to publish a Privacy Statement for how information is
used by a website and to be clear about the open nature of our public access rules; and
WHEREAS, the Information Technology Board also recognizes the need to make local
government websites meet common accessibility standards to improve the availability of
information to everyone via the Internet.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Information Technology Board
adopts the Privacy Statement and Website Accessibility Statement developed by the
Information Services Agency as policy documents and directs that they be published on

SUBJECT:

Draft Privacy Statement and Website Accessibility Statement

Given the time we live in and the open flow of information over the Internet, we want to promote
trust within the community that uses the City of Indianapolis/Marion County website. A
common practice these days is to publish a Privacy Statement for how information is used by a
website. After careful review of the information collected over our website and how it is used,
my staff developed a privacy statement. The attached draft Privacy Statement for the City of
Indianapolis and Marion County has been reviewed by both the Public Access Counselor,
Gordon Hendry and by the Office of Corporation Council. We have tried our best to ensure that
it is accurate and supportable for legal purposes and is frank about the open nature of our public
access rules. The IT Team has endorsed the policy. At the next IT Board meetings, we will be
requesting your endorsement of the attached Privacy Statement.
Additionally, we have attached a draft Website Accessibility Statement for your review.
Although federal websites needed to be in compliance with Section 508 by June of 2001, all
local government programs and services must be accessible pursuant to Title II of the Americans
with Disabilities Act. My staff has been working with Juli Paini, the Mayor's Office Disability
Affairs Coordinator, since last summer to develop an Internet Accessibility Plan and a Website
Accessibility Statement. We have decided to use the more stringent standards set out by WorldWide Web Consortium (W3C) to make our website more accessible. The accessibility standards
have been built into our current web redesign process, which will continue through 2003. The
attached Web Accessibility Statement has also been reviewed by the Public Access Counselor
and the Office of Corporation Counsel. We are requesting your endorsement of the attached
Accessibility Statement.
If you have questions or feedback prior to the meeting, please give Jennifer Ruby or me a call.
Thank you for your assistance.

CIO Comments
IT Board Members,
As you can see from the previous highlights, May has been another busy month
for ISA. From my perspective, there have been three main areas of focus:
budget preparation, completion of the contract language for Amendment 59, and
our planning for the upgrade/replacement of our mainframe, storage and
midrange servers.
The budget activities have been moving along well, although never as fast as we
would like. We have received all of the questionnaires and have been in
conversations with customers where we need to flush out more details. The
information is being analyzed and placed into our chargeback models to look at
impacts. In parallel with these customer activities, our different divisions
including ACS have built their budgets to support ongoing operations. My
management team is concentrating on the committed goal made to the Board
earlier of holding our internal budgets flat for 2003 except for any increase for
salaries and fringe benefits. We are still committed to this goal and will be able
to clearly identify any increases beyond this that are generated by specific
customer requests. We will be meeting with the Controller and Auditor’s staffs in
the next week to make our first pass review of the results. Once we get feedback
from the two fiscal offices, we will make any requested adjustments, place the
figures into the chargeback model and lock down the budget request for
presentation to you next month.

The contract language representing Amendment 59 is being reviewed by ACS
legal and senior management. We have spent significant time attempting to
detail the changes made when we decreased the scope of the amendment. We
continued to refine the SLA language as much as possible. We are on schedule
to have the contract signed and to start implementation July 1st.
Finally, I will be presenting to you at this Board meeting an update on a
significant effort that has been underway for many months regarding our
hardware platforms. On several occasions I have mentioned my concerns about
the age and structure of our mid-range servers. These are the servers that
support our web sites and our Oracle databases. In addition, the mainframe and
mainframe storage lease are ending at the end of this year. We have used this
end of lease as an opportunity to restructure the environment, strengthen our
ability to deploy and maintain our applications, and free up funds to reapply to
other needed areas such as storage management and business continuity. I am
excited by the options the ACS team have developed for addressing these areas.
I believe we will be able to meet our needs for stability, for planned additional
capacity, and do this while still honoring our focus of holding the line on costs.
The quality of the vendors being considered (market leaders such as IBM, Sun,
Fujitsu, Hitachi, and EMC) and the strength of the technologies under review will
provide solid, cost effective solutions for local government. The briefing on
Tuesday will discuss our progress and look for your endorsement for the
direction. As these orders will flow through the ACS agreement, we do not
anticipate needing the detailed resolutions of a direct purchase.
Lastly, attached to this report is a document titled “What is the IndyGov List
Server”. This is a marketing document being sent to all elected officials,
department and agency heads regarding our new list service. This has already
proven to be a strong service for providing specific, directed information to
constituents. We believe this will continue to grow in utilization across local
government. Our first deployment for Emergency Management, garnered us
national press.
I look forward to our discussions on Tuesday.
Sincerely,
Mike Hineline

WHAT IS THE INDYGOV LIST SERVER
AND
HOW CAN YOU EFFICIENTLY IMPROVE COMMUNICATIONS WITH YOUR
CONSTITUENTS?

List servers are a powerful Internet tool that "push" messages to a target audience, promote
traffic to the web site, and improve communications with minimal effort from the email list, or
eList, sponsor.
Improving Communication. The primary purpose of a list server is to improve
communication. It's a convenient way to share information with eList members. Indianapolis
and Marion County organizations can use the List Server to:
•

Receive office-wide communications. Staff can receive newsletters, announcements and
notifications of meetings and events. New staff can subscribe to the Department or
Office List. This could eliminate the need to maintain personal distribution lists for
employees. Instead staff can receive office-wide communications via the Office eLists.

•

Receive e-mails for specific interests. Other agencies and/or the public can subscribe to
eLists to receive email for specific topics. eList members can receive newsletters,
announcements and notifications of meetings and events. For example, the City has used
this tool to set up an eList for flood warnings. Interested members of the public sign up
and then receive automatic notices whenever warnings are issued.

•

Exchange ideas and discuss issues. The List Server also provides a forum for the
exchange of ideas and to discuss issues. Information can be submitted to the list to be
read and/or responded to by other subscribers. This is an informal mechanism to gather
more candid comments and opinions than what may be received through more formal
communication methods. eLists can generate electronic "conversations" much like a
public meeting might.

Minimal Effort. List servers provide dynamic, self-maintained email distribution lists. eLists
can be restricted to internal use by department and agencies or open to the public. Once a list
server is setup, subscribers can enroll and remove themselves from the eList(s) using the web
browser or email commands without manual intervention or assistance from the system
administrator. This allows the subscriber to self-enroll with no effort on the part of the
government staff. eLists can be classified as:
•

One-way: One-way eLists can be “closed” so users cannot reply to the sender. The list
moderator can send a message to all members, but the user interacts only with the moderator,
or the list server, and not other users. A common use of one-way eLists is announcement and
newsletters.

•

Two-way: Two-way eLists are "open". The members can interact with each other and
respond to messages posted to the list. A discussion forum is an example of a two-way list.

This service is now available for use. Every office is encouraged to create eLists to
communicate with the public and its staff. To establish a new eList, the Elected Official,
Agency or Department head should use the List Server Request Form page at:
http://www.indygov.org/listserv/list_req.htm. An internal eList address for a Department or an
office should be published as part of the training materials for new staff once existing staff have
been advised of its features and use.
eLists currently available can be viewed at: http://www.indygov.org/listserv/ (The Indygov List
Server).
Questions about the use of the List Server can be answered by contacting
webmaster@indygov.org or by using the List Server Feedback page at:
http://www.indygov.org/listserv/feedback.htm.

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
MONTHLY STATUS REPORT
May 2002

ADMINISTRATION
ACS management and staff have been busy preparing for the July 1, 2002 effective date
of Amendment 59, the ACS contract extension. Much work has been done in the area of
reporting against the new and revised service levels that are the focal point of the
extension. Many of these changes will result in modifications to this monthly status
report. There will be new dashboard indicators for various service levels not currently
represented. In addition, there are several one-time ACS deliverables that will be
completed in the first several months and the activities involved with these deliverables
will also be reported. Look for these changes in the July 2002 ACS status report.
In an attempt to increase the response rate to the ACS customer feedback cards (orange
postcards), ACS has web-enabled the feedback mechanism effective June 1, 2002. An
enterprise GroupWise broadcast announcing this new feature was issued on May 30th and
at least one reminder will be broadcast soon. In addition to the convenience of the webenabled feedback, ACS has also started a customer of the month and customer of the year
program. Customers who respond to the survey will be entered into a monthly drawing
and the winner will receive a lunch for 2, compliments of ACS. At the end of the year,
all of the monthly winners will be entered into a drawing where ACS will recognize the
winner through the donation of a new desktop computer to the charity of the winner’s
choice.
The IT Team conducted it’s first request prioritization session on May 1st . There were a
total of six application development projects requiring IT Team sequencing. While this
process is still maturing and being streamlined, ACS views the first session as a success
since we were given a specific sequence for addressing the six projects. ACS will
continue to work closely with ISA and the Functional Committees to build a manageable
and fair method of allocating ACS application development resources.

Building Authority has ordered all hardware and software needed to add them to the
enterprise backbone. Their personnel located at the Post Road Training Academy are
connected to the enterprise Citrix/Metaframe server. This gives them much faster
response time to access their information located at the City County Building.

•

Mayor’s Action Center was successfully moved from the first floor of the City
County Building to the 21st floor over the weekend of May 17th. ACS had staff work
over the weekend to ensure the MAC experienced no interruption of service. Monday
morning the staff was ready to once again support the needs of the constituents.

Technical Services
•

Courts Wiring
The remaining courtrooms located in the east wing, 6th floor of the City/County
building are scheduled for wiring completion in mid-June. These were held up
pending the removal of old coax cabling. Removal of old wiring is required, as the
ducts are too full to accommodate any additional wiring.

•

Server Maintenance/Upgrades Performed
This project started in May and was completed on June 2nd. ACS upgraded all Novell
Servers to Support Pack 4, upgraded all Microsoft Servers to the latest service pack
and patches, and upgraded all Compaq Servers with latest drivers and agents. The
end user benefit is the elimination of a cluster issue where one corrupt cluster volume
would be able to bring down the entire cluster.

•

HP Direct Firmware Upgrade
Over 600 HP printers were upgraded with the latest firmware. This was completed on
5/2/2002. The purpose of the upgrade is to eliminate some known issues with the HP
printers.

MAJOR PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS
Business Support Services
•

Streaming Video
This project is for the Cable Agency for a solution to integrate streaming video
services within the Cable Agency. Michael Nadeau reviewed pricing with the client
and, upon approval of business proposal, assisted in the presentation of the solution to
the Cable Franchise Board on 5/20/02. This project is now awaiting decision from
the client on how to proceed.

•

Mayor’s Action Center Customer Service Business Processes
This project is a request to define the customer service workflow and offer
recommendations for improvement prior to considering systems research. Michael
Nadeau completed the draft recommendation for management review during the week
of May 20, 2002. Michael plans to deliver the recommendation to MAC during the
week of 6/3/02.

•

Document Imaging Pilot Project
ACS worked with ISA to develop budget recommendations for those agencies
interested in document management for 2003. Due to the current budget focus, ISA
continues to work on the cost benefit analysis portion of the document, where the
completion date remains unknown. Contacted the Auditor’s Office and encouraged
user acceptance testing activities. The County Assessor’s Office has requested
assistance with new documents, one of which has been prioritized for the application
development team. ACS will continue to support the efforts of the County Assessor
to expand their document management system.

•

Campaign Finance
The County Clerk’s Office would like ACS to develop an Internet-based campaign
finance system. This would includes the ability to submit state campaign forms
electronically or manually enter data, which is then available on-line to the public.
ACS is now creating an updated requirements document to review with the Clerk’s
office.

•

Tidemark/M-Track V2.6.1 Upgrade
The Division of Permits has elected to upgrade to V2.6.1 and, therefore, upgrade MTrack InspecTrack to V2.6.1 as well, which is required by Tidemark Advantage
V2.6.1. User Acceptance Testing began on 5/14 and was scheduled through 5/28.
However, because testing was not completed by 5/28, a Change Request was
approved to extend project completion to 6/30/2002. Completion of user acceptance
testing and implementation is expected in June 2002.

•

DMD Compliance -Tidemark Abandon Vehicle Case
EMERGENCY REQUEST: A new case type created in Tidemark for the abandon
vehicle program to be shared between the City and H&H. Development has begun

CAMA Upgrade
The major focus the past month has been on defining the PRC process. The Property
Record Card (PRC) layout has had major changes. Mike Darland has identified most
of the modifications needed and has done a sample layout of the PRC form for
presentation to the Township Assessors. Several new fields have to been added to the
CAMA master file that is needed to provide additional information for the PRCs.
Roger Smith and Mike Darland have been changing the PRC programs to implement
the modifications that have been identified by Mike. Roger has also changed the
conversion program to include the new fields that have added to the master file. After
approval of the PRC layout from the ARTs committee, the State also has to approve
the layout and content. Mike has almost completed the rework of the Shelter
Allowance module due to changes needed for the PRC processing. Debbie Gasbarro
has been entering subdivision data from Washington Township and will enter the
other Townships’ subdivision data, as it is available. Mike continues to be busy
supporting the Township Assessors with answering questions about their data,
conversion criteria used as defined and voted on at the ARTS meetings, and
procedures for going forward at this time.

•

Upgrade Treasurer’s Cashiering System
This project was approved at the IT Team Meeting held May 1, 2002 and was rated as
number 2 on the priority list. The Project Definition has been completed and
delivered to the Client. The server was received May 8, 2002 and has been installed
and configured. Gary Johnson, DBA has done the initial configuration of the database
requirements on the Oracle farm. The new features of the software will not be
implemented until the programming tasks are completed. The application will provide
the Client with the same features as the current release and will be supported by the
vendor. The vendor no longer supports the release they are on now. The vendor will
be at Marion County during the first week of June to setup the test system for the
Treasurer’s Office. Alberta Frees will finalize the Project Definition document and
get approval to proceed. The Functional Specifications then will be written.

•

Courts Online Time Information System
User acceptance testing began on May 20th. Three courtrooms are in the pilot project
and are entering “real” data. The client has requested that we change the
implementation date to July 13th because that is the beginning of the pay period. Once
“real data” has been entered for a pay period, ACS will be able to create samples of
“color coded” voucher changes to the Auditor for review.

•

DPW RFQ Rewrite & Enhancement
This project was officially signed-off and closed on Friday, May 17, 2002. The
application has been running in production for approximately one month. It was used
to create the RFQ that is currently open for bids. There were no problems and/or
errors reported by those individuals and companies using the application to define and
set-up the projects that make up the current RFQ.
There is an enhancement request for two Excel based reports underway. Development
of these reports has started. The estimated development effort was 45 hours. These
reports should be completed within the next couple of weeks.

Election Results
This project has been halted while we await information from the customer and
vendor. The original request dealt with adding ward results and improving the user
interface. The data received from ES&S did not include ward breakdowns. All of the
ward logic must be removed from the application. We are waiting for final approval
to deploy to production.

•

Home Detention Tracking System
The application was delivered to the client for UAT on Monday, June 3rd. Training is
scheduled for Friday, June 7th . We will hold two brief demo/training sessions, each
for 5 users. They will then “field test” the application for one or two weeks.

City Pools
DPR outdoor pools opened on Saturday, May 25th (Memorial Day weekend). Tracy
Miller, CTR visited all of these sites prior to opening to setup POS systems and insure
they were in proper working order.

•

Courts PC Rollout
Once the court reporters started to use the new machines there were minor
adjustments that needed to be made to the machines a far as audio. The needed
adjustments were completed on Tuesday, May 21, 2002. However, there are still a
few problems with old microphones in some of the courtrooms, Word Systems will
be returning to replace them. There was a meeting on June 5th with Word Systems,
Courts Administration, and ACS. The group discussed how the next install should be
handled in an effort to avoid the problems associated with the last installation of the
digital recording machines. They also discussed the on-going training for the court
reporters using the digital recording equipment.

•

MCSD/IFD 9-1-1 Digital Recording System
In a project now headed by Jack Spriggs (MECA), the new PYXIS/AudioLog digital
recording system is currently being tested. Kathy Green, CTR is working with Jack,
Joe Crone and the system vendor through the configuration and testing process. All
MCSD users have been setup with the AudioLog software successfully; they are
presently testing the application on a daily basis. Additional bugs have been resolved
on the second AudioLog server (designated for IFD), and the software has been
installed on the three assigned IFD workstations. MECA is considering the user
training options presented by the vendor and has requested Kathy attend the System
Installation and Maintenance portion of the training, to better familiarize ACS with
the overall operation. No firm dates have been chosen yet.

•

MCPO Courts installs
Building Authority has been given the go ahead to add the needed wiring in the East
Wing. Building Authority will go into the courtroom after hours and complete the
wiring, Clawson will terminate connections the next morning and ACS will follow

Cluster services are to be installed on server Imcfnw7. Cluster services provides fault
tolerance to the server in which, if the server fails will automatically switch over to
one of 4 other servers that are available and will be transparent to the user. This will
benefit the departments by giving them almost 100 percent up time to their shared and
personal data on the Novell server. The following departments are scheduled.
6/4 - Migrate Jury Pool & FAC
6/11 - Migrate Prosecutor, Prosecutor Child Support & Grand Jury
6/13 - Migrate Public Defender

•

The installation of Steel Belted Radius software on a Novell Server will be used for
authentication of dial-up users by using their Novell login ID and password. This will
increase the security of remote access by monitoring who logs in and better
manageability of the dial-up accounts through Novell. New Cisco hardware was also
installed to give faster connects from 28K to 56k connections. The switch over to the
Radius authentication will occur on June 10th . An email to all current remote access
users will be sent prior to the switch over.

•

The Parks Department has requested network connectivity for two additional sites.
One will be located at the Old Broad Ripple Library with the circuit due to be

Mr. Hineline commented on hosting visitors from Germany interested in the
City/County’s E-Government portal.
Mr. Hineline reported that the management of our telecommunications’ infrastructure and
rights of way across local government appears to be a dysfunctional environment. The
different components of the infrastructure under various departments have not been
combined into one integrated plan. Many other City and County governments have
utilized an integrated telecommunications plan and have experienced advantages from an
economic development and efficiency standpoint. Discussions have begun to decide if an
integrated plan would be beneficial for our environment. Additional follow up will be
discussed in future meetings.
ACS Report
Mr. Curtis reported on four major areas ACS is currently involved with. Recognition was
given to the ACS team that was assigned to the Court PC rollout. The project was
completed a week ahead of schedule and the implementation was successful.
The GroupWise 6.0 rollout and the Norton Anti-Virus rollout are scheduled for
completion at the end of April.
Major concentration has been given to the applications area. Functional groups have
been prioritizing projects and working closely with ACS and the ISA planners in the
effort.
There has significant ongoing focus on the processes and procedures within the
applications area. The departments are noticing an improvement as a result of this effort,
and feedback continues to be encouraging.
Mr. Curtis reviewed the SLA Dashboard with the Board members.
Dr. Tunstall inquired if a more thorough review was done on the reporting discrepancies
between the comment cards and the customer’s verbal satisfaction levels. Mr. Ricketts
stated Council members have inquired about this issue as well. Mr. Hineline stated he
and Ms. Biddinger have been speaking with the customers and researching these issues
further.
IT Projects
GIS Transition Planning and Request for Qualifications
Mr. Mockert presented the GIS vision to the Board. Since 1986, Indianapolis and Marion
County recognized the benefits of and invested in Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
technology. The GIS effort has grown from the creation of the IMAGIS consortium, to

IT Board Minutes
Page 3
the development of GIS staff in individual departments, to pooling GIS resources into a
common area, to contracting with a GIS consultant to provide direction and resources for
GIS efforts, to most recently, bringing the GIS staff into the Information Services Agency
(ISA).
During this time, GIS became widely recognized as a valuable information technology
tool for local government. The GIS Division has matured along with the profession.
While initially GIS required expensive equipment and intensive training, current GIS
applications run on standard desktop computers with minimal training. Over time, the
role of the GIS staff changed from primarily data handling and analysis to providing the
tools and support that allows department staff and the public to utilize GIS.
The GIS Division is implementing a new structure and methodology, shifting strategic
planning and oversight from the outside consultant to internal management. Under the
new structure, responsibility for directing and managing GIS services will rest with the
GIS Division. With the current contract for GIS consulting services expiring this year, the
GIS Division has the opportunity to take the lead in providing GIS services to
City/County staff and the public, while continuing to supplement its resources with
outside vendors.
The GIS Division has been reorganized into three operational units: Business Consulting,
Applications Development, and Data and Systems. Business Consulting is the 'user
interface' of the GIS Division. This group provides the direct user contact in the area of
needs analysis, business process re-engineering, training and support. Applications
Development is responsible for the design, development, testing and maintenance of GIS
applications and tools. Data and Systems maintains the data and underlying system
architecture upon which all of the GIS depends. All three groups work closely together to
ensure the needs of the users are met efficiently and promptly.
The GIS Division recognizes the volume of GIS work exceeds what internal staff can
accomplish. Contracting for specialized skill sets and additional resources will allow the
GIS Division to concentrate on strategic direction, knowledge of City/County business
operations and project management. The Division will publish a Request for
Qualifications document to identify vendors qualified to support these three areas of
responsibility. This document will be published in the next month or so with the goal of
having vendors selected and under contract by the end of 2002.
Ms. Taylor commended the GIS Division on their mapping system and its many uses that
prove to be extremely helpful for local government as well as the public. Her office
relies heavily on GIS’ services.
Judge Payne suggested coordinating mapping system information between various
departments and agencies to provide a single geographic information site. Mr. Mockert
concurred and mentioned several initiatives underway.

IT Board Minutes

Resolution 02-03 Oracle Proposal
Mr. Hineline stated for the past four to six months, ISA has been reviewing the entire
midrange server area. Oracle has been the database standard for many years, but the
company’s licensing structure was recently changed. The new licensing structure works
to the City/County’s advantage with the licenses equated by processors instead of power
units. Oracle has translated the number of power units into processors, which is
equivalent to eight processor licenses the City/County owns. To gain discounts on cost,
ISA proposes buying an additional eight processor licenses, plus 30 named user licenses.
These named users would have access from their workstation to any Oracle database,
which is more cost effective than buying licenses for all users for smaller application
services such as test servers. ISA is seeing growth in this area as more applications
utilize Oracle. In the new agreement, maintenance costs are reduced significantly. The
funding from ongoing cost savings can then be used to update hardware within the
current budget.
Ms. Womacks motioned to approve Resolution 02-03 Oracle Proposal, Dr. Tunstall
seconded and the motion passed unanimously.
Resolution 02-02 ACS Contract Renewal
Mr. Hineline updated the Board on the activities of the previous two months. After many
discussions, the two-year term appeared to be the best approach to accomplish changes
that are necessary as well as sufficient time to see results. This option will allow local
government the most options in the decision process for the future.
The budget numbers for a two-year term were ranging in the 10-11% range. The belief
was local government did not have it within their budgets to support those percentages.
A 7% range seemed to be more palatable for local government to afford. With this in
mind, ACS had to cut out certain components within Amendment 59 to bring the costs
down.
Mr. Curtis summarized to the Board those areas that were cut or revamped. He believes
the outcome is a workable combination of the “lights on approach” and the activities
needed to improve technology.
Mr. Curtis reviewed the following components:
Key delivery focus
ACS does not want to discontinue the improvements being made within the Applications
area. The number of people available for the City/County to utilize is a pool of resources
that can be used to determine IT priorities for both development and maintenance. This
can change on an annual basis based on the work plan and projects. If these resources are
not used, a credit is issued or the hours can be banked into the next year. Also included
in this pool is the break/fix activity, which is the programming efforts for those
applications purchased or developed that are not working properly. The final point
concerning the applications pool is the option to always purchase more resources needed
for projects. This Amendment has been reduced by 4 FTE’s to reduce costs.

IT Board Minutes
Page 5
Mr. Curtis point out to the Board that ACS cannot commit to being able to finish the
services removed from the contract at the same rate in the future. They would be subject
to negotiation at that time.
Dr. Tunstall specifically inquired if the City/County needs more than 21 FTE’s included
in the pool, is the City/County going to pay the same rate currently negotiated or will
there be renegotiations of this rate? Mr. Curtis answered the rate for additional FTE’s has
already been negotiated into the Amendment.
A great deal of time has been spent on the applications area, but additional time is needed
to improve processes, evaluate staff and ensure the right skill sets are in place to address
the City/County’s programming maintenance, development and business needs. ACS has
developed several programs to address the applications area.
Business Consulting Pool
The Business Consultant is the liaison between the technical staff and the user
departments. They are the advocate for computing within the department and become the
department’s link back to technology. They help to identify systems, projects,
equipment, solutions to business needs, and become the advocate for the departments IT
solutions. Stronger relationships between ISA and the ACS consultants have been
formed because of the addition of these Business Consultants within the last year. This
component is formalized within Amendment 59. If all of the resources within the
Business Consulting Pool have not been used, they also can be credited or banked.
Helpdesk Improvements
Giant strides have been made within the desktop support area, helpdesk area and overall
customer service area. ACS wants to continue to improve this area. The Amendment
continues to include significant focus on improvements in this area.
Financial Components
The new Amendment fixes costs for this year and the two years following. A credit was
identified for an FTE shortfall in 2000; this amount has been decreased from the original
proposal to $230K.
The SLA penalties and incentives portion of the contract was also renegotiated. The total
amount of penalties was reduced to $55,000/month and the incentives were reduced to
$22,500/month. The individual penalties and assessments for specific SLA requirements
did not get reduced.
Another portion previously discussed is the shared savings between ACS and the
City/County. If ACS or ISA identify savings to provide technology for less, ACS will
share in that savings 50/50 with the City/County.
The item suggesting research into a remote data center was also retained should the
City/County find moving the mainframe operations to an ACS regional data center an

IT Board Minutes
Page 6
attractive cost option. An analysis is being done currently regarding the possibility of
moving some of the processing into a remote facility thereby saving significant costs to
the City/County. A proposal for consideration will be presented if the analysis indicates
advantages.
Performance Measurement
This component is key to be able to report against the SLA’s and ACS’ performance.
The reporting criteria were developed with the help of Gartner’s recommendations.
Modifications and/or Eliminations
The assessment of all legacy applications has been removed along with a remote security
assessment process and a detailed assessment of the security environment. ACS has
removed them as far as outside support costs are concerned, but ACS will make an effort
to accomplish some of the assessments with internal staff instead of bringing in outside
ACS staff.
The specific requirements for additional training in the helpdesk and applications areas
were eliminated. ACS has agreed to provide all of the development and training plans for
the ACS staff to the CIO for review.
The Gap Analysis for the Courts software was eliminated. This was a study proposed to
research the way the Courts environment currently runs and match it to the ACS Courts
software. The waiver of the Courts licensing fee was also eliminated from the proposal.
The Technical Architect position was removed. This position would have really helped
to define strategies and visions for technology in the future. ACS is going to try to be
creative in finding an alternative to provide this resource using their onsite staff.
The Business Process Reengineering topic was modified. ACS has removed the outside
ACS consultant to supplement the current Business Consultant Team on a quarterly basis.
ACS will continue to work and improve this process as a part of their efforts. ACS will
continue to bring the resources and invest in moving the IT organization forward.
Questions/Comments
Dr. Tunstall highlighted five areas that appear to bring additional cost possibilities.
1. Elimination of the applications portfolio analysis
2. Training plan reduced
3. Security policy review-recommend solutions to mitigate risk and implement
selected solutions is assumed will be at additional cost
4. Helpdesk services-skill set analysis and structured training
5. Elimination of Gap Analysis for the Courts and license fees
Dr. Tunstall asked Mr. Curtis if his analysis is accurate. Mr. Curtis replied in the area of
training, ACS’ training plans are comprehensive and provide an industry standard
training programs for the technical staff. The original Amendment 59 provided specific
levels of annual training in applications and helpdesk. These staff will still be trained,

IT Board Minutes
Page 7
but ACS will identify additional training they feel is needed. After the plan is reviewed,
resources can be shuffled to accommodate training in one area over another. The amount
of training dollars ACS has can be managed. Mr. Curtis feels this is the common theme
in the other areas as well. ACS is going to try and do the best with what they have, but if
an outside penetration test in security is needed, additional dollars will be needed.
Dr. Tunstall stated the list of possibilities for additional costs is only a caution to the IT
Board and ISA staff to remain aware of the risks and to exercise more control over these
areas.
Judge Payne stated his disappointment in losing the Technical Architect position. Judge
Payne requested a timeline be published to clarify the implementation periods of the
various projects.
Mr. Hineline stated to the Board that the RFP process to replace this contract will need to
begin in July 2003 in order to be written, published, awarded, and contracted by
December 2004.
Ms. Womacks motioned to approve Resolution 02-02, Dr. Tunstall seconded and the
motion passed unanimously.

April 2002
Project Highlights
ISA has published an RFP for a Master Lease Agreement which has been
evaluated and presented to the IT Team. As IT budgets are being planned,
many departments are interested in having an option to lease their equipment
rather than outright purchase it. A recommendation for standardizing on two
leasing vendors will be presented to the IT Board for your action at this
meeting.
The IT Team approved a City-County Council contract for technical services
to facilitate public input in redrawing Council districts. This involves a web
application that will be used through a third-party vendor.
The IT Team approved a project for Health and Hospital Corporation to allow
their staff to generate new cases through a link with the Tidemark application
into the Civil portion JUSTIS. H&H is covering all costs for the DAI
programmers and ACS staff.
The IT Team prioritized the first 5 projects presented by the IT Function
Groups. Another round will occur at the June Team meeting. This process is
raising awareness of the need for project planning, as well as allocation of
resources.

Planning Division Highlights
Jennifer Ruby and Nadeen Biddinger attended the Public Technology, Inc.
conference, spent three days networking with other Cities and Counties, and
learning new government best practices across the U.S. Some of the
information we obtained included materials on CRM for the Mayor’s Action
Center.
The Planning Staff have been very busy working with the various
departments on scoring pending projects, holding Function Group meetings
for prioritization and budget discussions, and one-on-one meetings with
departments on budget questions.

Jennifer Ruby and Jill Weirick, along with Ahmed Soliman, researched and
developed a privacy policy for the IndyGov web site. This document was
reviewed by the CIO and is now in the hands of Corporation Counsel and the
Mayor’s Public Access Counselor. The final version will be presented to the
IT Team and IT Board at their June meetings.
Jennifer Ruby and Ahmed Soliman have been working with the City
Accessibility Officer to write an Accessibility policy for the IndyGov web site
that will also be presented to the IT Team and IT Board in June.

Telecommunications Division Highlights
Two new locations were installed during the month – 3500 Lafayette Road
for the Probation office and 4150 North Keystone for the Family Advocacy
Center. The 604 North Sherman move for DMD/DPW continued with 75
phones being relocated with the relocation of most of the 21st floor to that
facility.
Video conferencing was installed between 604 N Sherman and the 20th floor
of the CCB.
The aging voice recording system for the MAC was replaced with new
technology, vastly improving their capabilities.

Administrative Division Highlights
•

The results of a follow up audit for the HelpDesk was presented to ACS and is
awaiting response to the items noted.

•

ISA and ACS have received most of the department’s inventories. This
information may be used to help construct the 2003 budget. Departments are
now needing reminders to notify ACS when they dispose of IT equipment in
order to keep these lists accurate.

•

The web version of the 2003 budget questionnaire was very successful, but
many departments are still struggling to complete their information and input
the details online.

CIO Comments
IT Board Members,
April has just sped by and we have been busy. We received your endorsement
of a two-year extension to the ACS agreement with some changes in the scope
as had been negotiated. The rework of the language is almost completed and
legal folk have been reviewing the work. I anticipate executing the final
amendment in early June, if not before. I will forward a copy of the final
document to you for your review.
As the previous items mentioned above can attest, we have been busy with 3
major site moves this month requiring coordination of voice and data.
Additionally, ACS will be reporting on the completion of several major
applications projects for customers.
ISA staff has been very active in the budget development process, both from
supporting the customers as they develop their requirements, as well as
developing our internal budget. We have several new twists to account for such
as the new way we will be supporting GIS, as well as the new ACS contract.
One item I have added to the agenda for discussion this month is the reach of
our support with regards to web sites and funding. ISA has always looked at any
request for services and having to have a direct link to an authorized customer.
Direct sites are easy, but things start getting a little gray when the site is in
support of something that is a joint project or not clearly labeled as a city or
county function. We have followed the logic if one of our customers sponsors the
site and will accept financial responsibility for whatever charges might be
incurred, it is a viable site for us to work with. We have now come across a new
scenario brought to our attention by members of the Enhanced Access Board.
We have developed a site for the Police Athletic League (PAL Club) as a division
under the IPD site. This clearly fit our definition in that it is supported by IPD and
has IPD officers as staff assigned to the program. The twist came in when they
requested the online capability to accept charitable donations for the PAL Club.
We have the capability under our agreement with CivicNet to do this and have
coded to be able to support the request. However, when the subcommittee of
the Enhanced Access Board looked to approve the new offering, they had
several questions as to if they needed to approve this. I would like to spend a
few minutes discussing this and gather your thoughts on future direction.
I look forward to speaking with you at the meeting on Tuesday.
Sincerely,
Mike Hineline

MONTHLY STATUS REPORT
April 2002

ADMINISTRATION
A major event for ACS administration during the month of April was the IT Board’s
approval of the two-year extension of the ACS agreement with the City/County. ACS
management and staff have worked very hard to improve services and add value to our
partnership with the City/County and are honored by the confidence exhibited by the IT
Board in our ability to continue this trend over the next several years.
ACS management also focused on continued improvements within the Applications
group through the implementation of several key processes and procedures. Among
these are:
•
•

•

•

•

A Quality Assurance Guide - will be used to help those creating plans for individual
projects. This includes documents for creating a testing plan, testing strategy, Test
Error Report, Usability Testing Report, and Test Error Log.
A New Requirements Document has been placed in the document repository along
with a “How To” document. This is a combination document that walks people
through the process of defining unambiguous requirements and then taking them into
the next steps of Functional and Technical specifications.
Specifications – we have created a “How To” on how to develop and document
functional and technical specifications. It is imperative that once the requirements
have been defined we build the appropriate models to help the client “visualize” what
is necessary. This document speaks to what is required in such a document and how it
will be documented for approval.
PETTS (project entry and time tracking system) – We have updated the PETTS
database to be the central repository for project information at this time. It will allow
for the capturing of weekly and monthly status information and we will be able to
track issues and risks that will show whether a project is on schedule, within budget
or has a scope issue. By using PETTS in this way we will be able to create the
monthly IT Team report for all projects by Functional Committee and Department
showing where a project has any open issues that could affect budget, schedule or
scope.
Configuration Management Plan – We have created a Standard Configuration
Management Plan that documents the way we expect each project to be documented
and stored. From a very small project to the largest. It states which artifacts need to be
captured, what they need to be named and where they need to be stored. This ensures
that all information is maintained at the proper level for each size project and reduces
the prejudice against process by not requiring the same level of complexity for each
project type.

The new CAMA system was converted and placed into production on the weekend of
April 19-21. There were only a few minor problems and those were resolved quickly.
There may be additional conversions if the Township Assessor chooses that option. If
they choose to reconvert they will lose any changes they made in the new system. The
Property Record Card (PRC) layout has had major changes and after approval from
the ARTs committee, the State also has to approve the layout and content.

DMD Permits Division Move
This agency moved from the 21st floor of the CCB to 604 N. Sherman. This is the
first phase of a renovation project for the entire facility located at 604 N. Sherman.
The move began on April 19 with the de-installation of equipment and was completed

with the re-installation on April 22 and 23 at Sherman. The next phase will affect
DPW. Completion of the entire project will be late July.
•

Crime Lab Expansion
The Crime Lab expanded their offices to include space at the new Marion County
Coroner’s facility, 521 W. McCarty, and also the Coroner’s former space at 40 S.
Alabama. Kathy Green, CTR worked with Larry Schultz on the equipment transfer
and installation. The Jail Upgrade project called for the replacement of the Crime
Lab’s existing hubs/patch panels with new switches/panels. The wiring for the new
drops has been completed and verified. Seven new PCs have been installed, as well
as several printers/copiers. This project is complete.

Technical Services
•

Norton Anti-Virus Project
The project went as scheduled and was completed on time. Unlike most deployments
it required the user to first remove software and then reboot to receive the new
software. In any other circumstance this may have occurred over the course of two
days. However, since our clients our vulnerable to thousands of viruses it was
imperative not to leave the workstations without virus protection. It was necessary to
remove and install the new software as a single install. Considering the amount of
user intervention required to install NAV, the deployment was a success and
relatively uneventful.

•

GroupWise 6 Project
The project was completed on time with little or no intervention with the install
process from the user. The project started on 2/4/02 and was completed on 4/18/02.
The speed of the process was achieved due to the 2-½ years of re-engineering the
entire GroupWise system from the previous upgrade from 4.1 to 5.2. This was done
by reducing the number of post-offices and placing them on their own individual
servers.

•

GroupWise Calendar Update
Message was sent out on 3/13/02 to all GroupWise users to update their personal
information. This included over 350 individual responses with 19 department group
updates. This was completed in April. The message also stated for the user to contact
the GroupWise Administrator when you have changes in the future. This will again
be sent out to all users later this year.

•

Carmel-Clay and Fisher Police Departments
Both Departments have been connected to the City/County Network via a frame-relay
DS1 circuit. This provides these departments with connection to the IDAX system for
which Indianapolis Police Department is the Regional Center. IDAX is a service
ultimately provided by Indiana State Police. Both departments also gain access to the
RMS system provided by MECA through this new connection to the City/County
Network. These systems give Carmel-Clay and Fishers access to national and
international data concerning crime, criminal records, and other data vital to a modern
police department’s operations.

MCSD Jail Upgrade
All functional areas of the Jail (Administrative, Central Records, Crime Lab, and the
Lockup areas) have been upgraded to 10/100 speed switches and now have Gigabit
fiber-optic feeds to each of the distribution closets. At the same time, the older,
unreliable hubs have been removed. The customer benefits from the upgrade in that it
offers increased speed and better reliability for the computers in the Jail network. It
also offers better monitoring of network traffic and statistics reporting for the ACS
technical services staff. Additionally, the upgrade allows the newer computers in
service at that location to take advantage of their speed.

MAJOR PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS
Business Support Services
•

Web- Courts Online Time Info System
The user acceptance testing of the Access administration application was not
progressing as quickly as anticipated. At the client's request, the delivery of the Web
Time Entry application was delayed until 5/6. On 5/6 it was once again delayed until
a date to be determined. The clients have not been able to dedicate the time and/or
resource(s) necessary to build the employee database. The web application is
available on the staging library so user testing can begin as soon as the client is ready.

•

Web- Home Detention Tracking System
Yang Jiao attended a meeting with the client, Jason Shoffner (the original developer)
and ACS personnel to gather information regarding the requirements, specifications
and design of the application. The application has been downloaded to one of the
NEC MobilePro 880 handheld units. The application is running and appears to be
functioning properly. At this point, performance is the only concern. A meeting will
be scheduled for the customer to review progress and determine the next step(s).

•

Web- Campaign Finance Application
Neal Ginsberg has reviewed the requirements documents created approximately one
year ago by SCT corporate personnel. He feels that there is adequate information
there to begin the technical design phase. There may be a few issues and questions
that will need to be discussed in a little more detail with the client before the technical
design phase can be estimated. Once we get the "go ahead" we will begin the next
phase.

•

Microsoft Web Content Management System (CMS)
ACS management, technical resources and the ACS Webmaster are working closely
with the ISA Internet Group to plan for the enterprise deployment of the CMS
product to all web stewards. This project will entail a phased rollout approach, which
is intended to augment the redesign of the IndyGov web site. The current tasks
underway are focused on the technical infrastructure and how the web servers can be
configured to adequately house the CMS product and the thousands of active web
pages associated with indygov.org. In addition, the process through which web pages
are published will also be reviewed for streamlining and enhanced flexibility.

Web-based list server alternatives
ACS recently installed a public-domain product to handle basic list server
capabilities. The most recent use of the Majordomo product was the implementation
of the Emergency Management Notification System (EMNS) list server function for
the Department of Public Safety. During the course of this implementation, it was
determined that the Majordomo product was severely limited in its’ flexibility and
required source code modifications to accommodate fairly remedial changes. The
ISA Internet Group requested the ACS Webmaster to evaluate alternative products
and make a recommendation to replace Majordomo. This effort known as “Listserv
Phase 2” is now underway with a recommendation expected in May.

Streaming Video
This project is for the Cable Agency for a solution to integrate streaming video

April. The Cable Franchise Board is now scheduled to undertake this issue at their
May meeting.

DMD Compliance -Tidemark Abandon Vehicle Case
EMERGENCY REQUEST: A new case type created in Tidemark for the abandon
vehicle program to be shared between the City and H&H. A statement of work has
been prepared, approved and assigned a prioritization score by the customer. It is an
estimated eighty hours of effort. Due to the emergency nature of the request, it passed
the functional team stage and has been submitted to the IT Team for consideration on
5/1/2002. IT Team approval was granted and prioritization assigned.

Focus Alternative Analysis
The purpose of this project is to research other products that can be implemented that
will replace the Focus Application with the same functionality. Alberta Frees has
been researching alternative software products on the Internet as well as checking out
WebFocus, which is the web version of Focus. Alberta has been coordinating with
Rex Porter from Information Builders to set up a meeting to discuss the functions of
WebFocus with the Clients to see if it will meet their needs. Due to the reporting

needs of the Clients any software option must also contain a robust reporting
capability. Conversion of the current applications is also an issue and considerable
expense if another product is selected.
•

Upgrade Treasurer’s Cashiering System
The Treasurer’s Office will upgrade their current Cashiering System as it is no longer
supported by the vendor and uses outdated technology. The new system will require
an application server and space on the Oracle server as well as new workstations that
are connected to the network. The vendor will install the application software. ACS
will coordinate server resources, Oracle requirements, configure application server,
and setup new workstations. The statement of work was completed for prioritization
by the Financial Functional Group, which met on April 24 and approved the scoring.
The IT Team at the meeting on May 1, gave approval to proceed. A project definition
will now be written.

•

Online License Application (City Controller)
This project will allow the public to submit license application forms via the Internet
for the most used license forms. This project was started in August of 2001. It was
decided that since the ISA Internet Group was implementing Adobe Acrobat to use
for interactive forms on the Web, that tool should be considered for this application.
Acrobat was thought to be faster and easier to develop online forms for access on the
Internet. After it was determined to be more time-consuming than originally thought
and would perhaps require too much maintenance by the customer to use, it was
decided that the application would be addressed through some other means. Alberta
Frees gave Kathy Waterbury a draft copy of the functional specification document to
review for completeness. Kathy is also checking into using Tidemark to implement
this project as well Civic Net for the fee collections. Kathy will coordinate with
Maureen Stapleton to get approval and a timeframe that this can be implemented if
she uses Tidemark.

•

Online Deductions on the Web for the MC Assessor
This project will give public access to the Assessor's Property Deduction forms and
allow them to enter the information and submit the forms directly to the MC
Assessor. This project was started in August of 2001. It was decided that since the
ISA Internet Group was implementing Adobe Acrobat to use for interactive forms on
the Web, that tool should be considered for this application. Acrobat was thought to
be faster and easier to develop online forms for access on the Internet. After it was
determined to be more time-consuming than originally thought and would perhaps
require too much maintenance by the customer to use, it was decided that the
application would be addressed through some other means. Alberta Frees met with
Joan Romeril on April 25 to discuss this project and get it going again by completing
the project definition.

seconded and the motion passed unanimously.
IT Projects
Resolution 02-14 Justice DAI Contract Renewal
This contract was tabled at the August 20, 2002 IT Board meeting to await the final
Council approval of the City/County budget. With the Council approving the 2003
budget, Ms. Davis motioned to approve resolution 02-14, Ms. Taylor seconded and the
motion passed unanimously.
Resolution 02-15 Ameritech Frame Relay Renewal

IT Board Minutes
Page 2
Mr. Hineline stated in July, the Board approved to move forward with a new type of
connection to replace the headends for our frame network and to provide significantly
improved disaster recoverability for the WAN by including the IPD training Academy in
that fiber loop. This had additional cost to ISA. At about the same time, ISA became
aware of a possible opportunity to partner with the state Intelenet Commission to improve
costs for our extensive WAN. ISA entered into discussions with AT&T and with SBC
about potential approaches to delivering these services under different pricing points.
AT&T and SBC are the only two vendors able to deliver this type of service to the
City/County.
ISA and ACS staff have been actively reviewing options, discussing impacts and
negotiating details of these potential service offerings. As a result of these efforts,
resolution 02-15 if approved will execute a new 60 month master agreement that will
replace the current agreement with improved pricing, improved service offerings and will
also include the new Sonet fiber services previously approved. All of this results in the
delivery of the existing services and adds the new services for about the same cost being
paid today without the new Sonet ring. In this agreement ISA has negotiated the ability
to remove 10% of the lines per year for no penalty should we wish to do so. While we do
not know of specific items that would take us off of the WAN, we have options, if
required by changing conditions. Additionally, the pricing structure is more favorable to
the City/County from the original for base line costs and for increased CIR (guaranteed
line speed).
Ms. Womacks motioned to approve resolution 02-15, Ms. Davis seconded and the motion
passed unanimously.
IT Status Reports
Telephone Update
Ms. Kuhn recapped the last year’s events following the telephone conversion. Over Labor
Day weekend of last year about 6,000 active stations and 2,000 inactive stations were
brought online. The installation went well for the City/County building and is stable.
The same does not apply however to the remote sites. These sites have experienced
hardware failures as well as various networking issues. To date, all the hard drives have
been replaced and the network has been reengineered. After these changes were
completed in March, the remote sites have been operating on a stable environment.
The telephone counselors continue to be very active in attending meetings and relaying
any comments and issues to the telephone operation staff. With the new system and the
communication between the counselors and staff, Telephone Operations has seen a
significant decrease in helpdesk calls. Due to this decrease, the open position within the
Telephone Operations division does not need to be filled at this time.

IT Board Minutes
Page 3
A network outage occurred the week of September 9th. This particular outage left the
remote sites without dial tone for two hours, and the City/County building for about 10
minutes. The underlying reason for this outage is being investigated at this time.
Remaining issues with the cutover deal with the R300 switches inability to use fax
machines and modems over the IP. Avaya has proposed replacing the R300 switches
with G700 switches while upgrading the switch at each location. This will be at no
additional cost to the City/County.
A national agreement signed between Expanets and Avaya stated that Expanets would
begin to sell Avaya maintanence only. This did affect the City/County’s contract, and is
working well.
The actual cost of the conversion resulted in a 5% savings from the original contracted
amount. As time goes on, additional savings will continue to be seen.
Judge Payne inquired if Telephone Operations has implemented any type of customer
service polling. Mr. Ricketts suggested sending a note to the remote department heads
etc. for customer comments.
Ms. Davis commended Ms. Kuhn and her team on an outstanding conversion and a job
well done.
CIO Report
Mr. Hineline updated the Board on the Internet Divisions 3rd place award in the Best of
the Web contest. Congratulations were given to Mr. Soliman and his team.
Mr. Hineline also stated the Dell PC standard has brought local government a savings of
$675,000. The Employee Purchase Program offered by Dell has resulted in Indianapolis
being the largest local government customer involved in the EPP.
A new capability to notify recipients of the IT Board packet is available through the new
Web Events calendar. Next month, the method of notification will take advantage of the
calendar, giving recipients a link to subscribe to calendar announcements and links to
packet information.
Ms. Davis stated her excitement over the opportunity to implement a new financial and
CRM system.
ACS Report
Mr. Curtis highlighted the installation of the new mainframe computer. The performance
of this equipment has been good, issues with transactions and response times continue to
be improved.

IT Board Minutes
Page 4
The HAT system is now being implemented according to Amendment 59. The system
uses the current HEAT system to track assets for all IT hardware and software. This will
allow for more detailed records of assets for the whole City/County.
Mr. Curtis reviewed the dashboard report for the Board.
CAMA continues to move forward, all but two townships have been converted. HB 1001
was approved as a high priority by the IT Team; ACS will begin to move forward on
fulfilling the new mandate.
Mr. Ricketts thanked Mr. Darland and ACS for their hard work on the CAMA
enhancements.
Mr. Hineline explained the Otis system implemented by the Courts. This system allows
the Court staff to record their time online, thus ridding the department of the paper time
cards. This system has been configured to allow other departments to implement this
system as well at little cost. Interested parties are encouraged to speak with their ISA
planner for more details.
New Business
The next IT Board meeting has been scheduled for October 22, 2002 in room 260.
Adjourn
Mr. Ricketts adjourned the meeting at 10:40 AM.

CIO Comments
IT Board Members,
As usual, we have had significant activities over the last month. As you are
aware, Lee Curtis has been offered an Account Executive position in California.
Lee has been instrumental in our improvements in service delivery here in
Indianapolis and I thank him for his efforts. Mr. John Nero has been nominated
by ACS to replace Lee as our AE. John has a strong background in IT and
comes well recommended to us.
I have executed a new services contract for pay phone services. We had been
operating under a month to month extension of an old contract with SBC for
almost 2 years. SBC came to us in early August with a letter stating we had to
pick one of two new programs no later than the end of August. We felt neither
option was to the benefit of local government. Each would have reduced our
revenue and actually caused several areas to have to pay significant costs for
pay phones. Telephone Operations quickly talked to the remaining vendors in
this space. We then met with the several areas that we support for this contract
(Wishard, Building Authority, Libraries, and Parks) to present alternatives. The
group unanimously determined that going with a small local company, TelTec,
was our best option. This market has taken significant hits over the last several
years because of the significant influx of cell phones. The decrease in vendors

CIO Report to IT Board

Exhibit E

Page 3 of 3

actually in this market from 18 months ago was noticeable. However, access to
payphones is still critical to certain locations and support a need for our
constituents. We will be implementing this new contract over the next 60 days.
The tornado that caused extensive damage across Indiana and Marion County
affected us in several areas. GIS was the most affected area and we will be
providing a quick update at this meeting for more details. The Internet group
worked with the disaster teams to provide quick publishing of information. We
had several outages of voice and data circuits due to the storm but these were
quickly corrected. I feel we responded well to the emergency and thank our staff
for their efforts. We learned many things we need to make easier or plan better
for the next time we are called upon in this type effort.
Dave Mockert will be presenting the results of our RFQ process to select a new
GIS support contractor for 2003. I am sure you will be pleased with the
information provided in the recommendation. Dave and his team have done an
extensive amount of work in selecting the best vendor to support us as we move
in to the future. The rigor with which they went through this process has been
outstanding.
I look forward to our discussions on Tuesday.
Sincerely,
Mike Hineline

Monthly Highlights and Statistics
September 2002
From the Account
Manager’s Desk
During
the
month
of
September, ACS management
spent much of its time focusing
on the coordination and
initiation of the initiative to
replace the City/County’s core
financial applications. ACS and ISA have assembled a
panel of experts to conduct a half-day session where the
City/County will be able to hear about the relevant
experiences of several diverse entities. This “lessons
learned” session is scheduled for October 15th. Needs
analysis and requirements definitions will begin in
October as ACS will provide subject matter and project
management experts to assist.
Another specific Amendment 59 deliverable was
completed during September. The Desktop Technology
Refresh Proposal was presented to ISA on October 1st.
This document explores the various alternatives,
advantages and disadvantages associated with a
formalized program to ensure current technology is
applied in a standard fashion for desktops and laptops
throughout the City/County enterprise.
ACS personnel continue to strive toward achieving and
exceeding the contractual service levels established or
enhanced by Amendment 59. We are happy to report
this effort is proving worthwhile as we have achieved all
service levels for the month of September.

New Mainframe Performance
Since the installation of the IBM Z/800 processor on
August 11, 2002, the Technical Services team as well as
our vendor, Mainline, have addressed several
performance issues. Specifically we have addressed the
following:
•
•
•
•

Single Engine architecture
Run-Away-Transactions
High Datacom Input/Output rates
Split Cache - Inability of some IBM and Third Party
Software to properly utilize Cache Memory

We have taken a variety of steps over the past few weeks
to effectively address these issues. With input from our
vendor we have changed operating system parameters,
which determine the amount of resources any one
Monthly Highlights and Statistics
September 2002

application within the system may have. We have added
additional buffers to the Datacom environment to help
facilitate data throughput and we have made application
changes where applicable.
While we have seen an improvement based on averages
and sampling of response time internally, telling us that the
system is technically performing as well as the Amdahl
CPU, some customers continue to experience periods of
unacceptable response time.
As a result of these continuing problems, ISA, ACS,
Mainline and IBM agreed to attempt one last tuning effort,
which took place on October 6, 2002. It was also agreed
that if this tuning step did not work, the IBM Z/800 would
be powered off and all MVS computing services would be
placed back onto the Amdahl CPU on Sunday October 20,
2002.
The early results of these most recent tuning efforts appear
to be resolving the slow response time issues, but further
analysis is still needed. ISA, ACS, Mainline and IBM will
continue to monitor the system, visit with the clients, and
in the event that the decision is made to go back to the
Amdahl machine, make those preparations.

Remote
Returns

Absentee

Voting

ACS consultants and technicians will
assist the Clerk’s Office in support of the
remote absentee voter program at two
locations. The sites are Lawrence and
Wayne townships. Lawrence will have one new data
connection added. The wiring work order and floor plan
have been submitted and approval has been received to
proceed. Laptops and desktops will be used at the remote
sites and the machines have been configured with the
software necessary

DMD Inspectors Go Wireless
DMD’s Division of Compliance is currently implementing
their new Selectron InspecTrack Wireless technology
through September and October 2002. Implementation is
moving ahead of schedule and is expected to complete one
to two weeks early. This new wireless technology allows
inspectors to process inspections in the field, input results
to their laptop which is mounted in their car and wirelessly
transmit results back to the Tidemark database where office
Page 1

staff can see those results within seconds. Inspectors are
able to create, process and print violations in the field as
well.
The project has been successful due to the
teamwork, patience and cooperation of DMD staff, ACS
staff, Selectron, Verizon and Waymire’s.
DMD
inspectors can now increase their productivity by
minimizing time required in the office.

Building Authority Completes
Transition
The Building Authority has completed its technology
transition by converting the Fundware application to the
new application server in the enterprise. They are now
fully supported by the enterprise network and all of their
older local servers are disconnected and no longer used.
This completes a months-long project where Building
Authority requested to be brought into the ACS scope of
services.

Monthly Statistics from
the Help Desk
During the month, 5,034 calls
were presented to the Help Desk
of which 4,080 were handled by
the daytime Help Desk and 695 were received by our
after-hours operation. 259 calls were terminated before
the Help Desk had a chance to answer the call.
Of those calls, 924 turned out to be technical problems.
ACS closed 816 problem calls during the month and
achieved a first call resolution of 81.8%. This means that
nearly 82% of those who called with a problem had their
issue resolved by the time they hung up the phone.
ACS processed 463 security requests during the month.
112 involved changes to security profiles, there were 234
deletions of various access rights and 117 new access
rights were granted. ACS also closed 268 service
requests during the month.
Desktop support activities for the month of August
totaled 540 work elements. These included 40 required
PC re-images, 143 cascaded desktop installations, 124
hardware installations, 55 move/changes, 6 printer
installations, 167 software installations and 5
miscellaneous requests. The daily average for these
IMACS was 27.

Monthly Highlights and Statistics
September 2002

New Asset Tracking System In The
Works
The software product HEAT, utilized for the tracking of
problems and service requests, was upgraded to allow
implementation of the upgraded version of HEAT Asset
Tracking (HAT). HAT will allow ACS to provide ISA and
customer departments with a hardware/software inventory
based on regular desktop scans. Some of the features
include listing assets for a user, sorted by hardware,
software, and changes; information pertaining to software
license status and alerts; as well as the capability of
management reporting using Crystal Reports. So far, 7 out
of 54 containers to be scanned have been completed with
the remainder to be completed by the end of October.

CAMA Updates Continue
The last three townships (Franklin, Perry, and Warren)
were converted to the CAMA B region the weekend of
September 28, 2002. All townships have now been
converted and are on the CAMA B region. The ACS
Property Team has been assisting the townships by creating
special reports and programs to verify and correct their
data.
As the townships work through the process of
testing and verifying results, the ACS team is making
changes and assisting where necessary.

Printer Maintenance Program Begins
The printer preventive maintenance project began on
Friday, October 4th and will be completed by year’s end.
This program will provide cleaning and diagnostic service
on all printers in order to ensure proper operation and
continued efficiency. The customer departments will be
notified when their printers are scheduled for maintenance
using a procedure that was approved by ISA.

On the Move
The following customer relocations
were completed or are currently in
progress:
DMD Moves - Relocate Historic
Preservation,

Tracking to the City/County enterprise.

ACS Customer of the Month
Our congratulations for September go to Ms. Kristie
Coleman with the Marion County Sheriffs Department.
On the 12th of September it was determined that Ms.
Coleman’s PC was infected with the Klez virus. ACS
Technician Greg Mott was able to clean the virus and
load Norton Antivirus to ensure that the problem does
not reoccur. Ms. Coleman gave Greg and ACS the
following ratings: (Scale of 1 to 3 with 3 being the
highest)
Did you get the assistance you needed? 3
Was it delivered in a timely manner? 3
Was the service friendly and helpful? 3
Ms. Coleman has been contacted about being named
"Customer of the Month" for September and will be
receiving lunch for two for her valuable feedback.

Customer Service Cards Results
ACS technicians distributed 816 customer satisfaction
feedback cards during the month. 234 or 28.7% of them
were actually completed and returned. This is an
increase in participation from the previous month. The
returned results indicate a high level of customer for the
assistance received 2.94 on a scale of 1 to 3. Timely
service rated a 2.87 and our technicians were deemed
friendly and helpful judging from the 2.95 score.

Looking Ahead to October
Some of the things ACS technical staff
is planning next month include:
•

•
•
•

IFD headquarters connection
upgrade
Continue to reduce the number of redundant
telecommunication lines to remote locations
Deploying ZENworks 3.2 to every file and print
server. This will be deployed throughout October to
every desktop in the enterprise.

ACS Spotlight
This section of the monthly report
introduces several of our local ACS
employees. These individuals are part
of the ACS team responsible for
delivering services to the City/County
and we thought it would be beneficial to
our customers to know a little bit more about them.
Douglas Patten, Business Manager
Doug started with ACS on April 28, 1998. He oversees the
procurement, accounting and administration functions for
the Indianapolis site. When new services are requested,
Doug accumulates the documents, which support the
contracts that are presented to ISA for approval.
Prior to ACS, Doug worked for Kimball International, Inc.
located in Jasper, IN. Doug is a true “Hoosier” as he was
born and raised in Tell City, IN. Doug and Denise have
been married for 25 years. They have two sons, Dane (18)
and Alex (15) who attend Greenwood High School. They
attend Calvary Baptist Church in Greenwood where Doug
is a deacon. Doug’s interest includes golf, fishing and
playing cards.
Kathy Green, Senior Asset Manager
Kathy joined ACS in April 2000, and is responsible for the
coordination and completion of service requests in the
Asset Management group. Kathy enjoys the challenges
and variety of tasks associated with her position, as well as
the many opportunities to work with the City/County
customers. “There’s more to providing excellent service
than simply resolving the technical issue at hand.
Customers want to know we’re actually listening to them.”
Kathy has a son, Brian (7) and a daughter, Kim (5), and
will be re-married in November 2002. Her background
ranges from restaurant management to public/investor
relations. However, her focus for the past six years has
been computer support and she looks to continue her career
in the IT field.

seconded and the motion passed unanimously.
IT Projects
Resolution 01-14 to Approve and Authorize the Execution of the Centrex IIN Agreement
with Business Communications Services
The contract with Business Communications Services is a base agreement that provides
Centrex services into the remote sites not using our new PBX systems. The base
agreement is for 306 lines with a minimum of 60 months service amounting to $150,000.
Dr. Miller asked to strike the word ‘preferred’ from the resolution.
Dr. Tunstall motioned to approve resolution 01-14 as amended, Mr. Nelson seconded and
the motion passed unanimously.

IT Board Minutes

Status Reports
Technology Sourcing Discussion Update
Mr. Hineline stated the key customer meetings were under way. The content of these
meetings deal with issues from the past and the changes in the new amendment that will
alleviate those issues in the future. In Mr. Hineline’s meeting with the Courts, the
Judges voiced concern about being tied into the ACS Court applications. It was made
clear to the Judges that there was no commitment; the applications were only an option
for local government in the future if the Justice community chose to move in that
direction.
Mr. Scott commented on behalf of the Courts. The Courts Case Information System is
causing confusion, but the Courts are working with the Council in getting the process
reviewed. There are issues with individuals concerned more with the political aspects
instead of working as a team to overcome misunderstandings. Mr. Scott acknowledged
ACS’ outstanding job with bridging the gaps and trying to resolve these issues.
Ms. Davis inquired about the duration of the contract. Mr. Hineline replied the contract
would use the three one-year extensions plus the one remaining year. In response to Ms.
Davis’ comment, Mr. Hineline explained he weighed out the pros and cons regarding the
duration of using the last year and a one-year extension. If an RFP is to be done with
proper time frames, there would only be a six-month period where the effects of the
renegotiated contract could start to be implemented and the effects evaluated. The
process, if done properly, takes 18 months, meaning in June or July another decision
would need to be made to either execute another year of the contract or go out for RFP.
To accurately judge the success of the new negotiations there would only be 5-6 months
to base a decision on, which is not adequate.
Dr. Tunstall asked what could be done to solicit responses from ACS to provide the
City/County with the future visions of technology. Mr. Hineline stated he believed the
amendment has been structured in a manner in which ISA directs ACS to acquire the skill
sets that are needed in the specific areas. The correct resources should be available in the
third and fourth year even if the requirements have changed.
Mr. Ricketts requested a comparison of the average cost of the original agreement over
the last six years including the percentage of increase seen and how the cost is offset with
the four-year term being negotiated currently. Mr. Ricketts also inquired if meetings with
users have been held to determine what their needs are. Mr. Hineline replied the
determination of technological needs is an internal IT Governance process. Mr. Ricketts
would like the contract to recognize and anticipate the future IT needs of the users.
Mr. Ricketts requested the regular Board meeting be moved back a week and a special
Board meeting be held to discuss the contract and invite users to address their concerns to
the Board.

IT Board Minutes
Page 3
Dr. Tunstall motioned to hold an information meeting on January 15th and the regular
meeting a week later, Ms. Taylor seconded. Ms. Davis inquired if there was any value in
hearing what other vendors have to offer before a decision is made on the duration of the
existing ACS contract. Mr. Hineline replied there may be other vendors that would
surpass ACS in some areas, but there are no indications that one specific vendor is worth
the associated risks involved.
Mr. Hineline voiced his concern with the comment that ACS is responsible for telling
ISA how to lead technology. Mr. Hineline strongly believes it is the responsibility of his
department and local government to decide where technology needs to go and have the
vendor assist ISA in getting there. Ms. Davis agreed that local government should be the
business leader, yet there are some things we expect vendor leadership on. Mr. Hineline
explained under the new business model, ISA is able to seek help from ACS. In contracts
of this size, many of the vendors partner with each other to assist and deliver services.
The idea is to establish a process that maintains access to new technological
opportunities. The proposed four-year term does not preclude the ability for local
government to get this kind of support from a variety of vendors. New large scale
initiatives will require additional support from any number of possible companies. The
base services contract being discussed covers primarily the day to day activities and
maintenance of existing system with some new development.
Mr. Ricketts requested to extend the length of the special meeting to four hours.
Following the discussion, the Board voted unanimously to hold a special Board meeting
on the 15th and the regular meeting on the 22nd.
CIO Report
Mr. Hineline commended his staff members and the ACS staff for their hard work over
the last year. In response to Mr. Ricketts question, several telephone outages have been
seen at the remote sites. Avaya and Expanets have been working on the software patches
and trying to resolve the problems.
ACS Report
Mr. Curtis reported the County Assessor’s Office is now testing the document
management application and the Auditor’s office will be receiving the application after
the first of the year.
CAMA continues to make progress and is ahead of schedule in modifying the mainframe
applications.
Mr. Curtis encouraged departments to utilize the orange evaluation cards to help ACS
evaluate and maintain customer satisfaction levels.

IT Board Minutes
Page 4
ACS has been involved in updating the overall IT asset inventory. Reports have been
sent to the departments asking for adjustments in inventory such as transferred or deleted
equipment. Several departments still need to relay this information to ACS.
Mr. Curtis discussed the SLA Dashboard to the Board members.
In response to Dr. Millers question, the disaster recovery test went according to plan. In
future meetings, Mr. Hineline would like disaster recovery as a task item on the agenda
for more in depth discussions on the planning and different components of this subject.
At this point, planning has begun to locate a facility to use in the event of a major

Mr. Ricketts called the meeting to order at 1:08 PM.
Feedback from Stakeholder meetings and Function Groups
Mr. Hineline reported presentations on Amendment 59 had taken place with the IT Team
and Functional Groups, as well as individual departments and stakeholders. The
presentations covered the following points: reasoning behind the recommendation to
extend the contract, changes that would take place within ACS, positives and negatives of
the extension, and discussions dealing with the next steps of the renegotiation and final
decision process. Issues brought forth dealt with the first years of the contract, however,
most individuals stated they had seen an improvement within the last two years. Those
improvements are met with skepticism from some, wondering if the improvements made
in the last 18 months are due to the contract expiring.
In general the comments were supportive, one individual strongly believes that the
extension is not in the enterprises best interest. Many said they would like to see more
defined details in the service level expectations. Several individuals found the incentives
portion of the Amendment was not appropriate because an organization doing business

IT Board Minutes
Page 2
for the City/County should already be motivated enough to go above and beyond what is
required.
Customer Comments
Mark Hauser:
Mr. Hauser from the Sheriff’s department stated he was employed at the time SCT was
first brought into the City/County. He spoke in favor of the amendment and the full
extension period. In the Sheriff’s area, a new vendor would need to be re-educated about
the processes in the department. The IT people currently in ACS have a working
knowledge of the departments’ IT processes. If ISA were to go out for an RFP, the risk
of losing that institutional knowledge is greatly increased.
Mr. Hauser said he liked the helpdesk arrangements proposed and the penalties
associated with them, but would like to see ISA develop a clearly defined procedure to
measure the service levels in the helpdesk area. His great concern is in the application
development area. The Sheriff’s department has their own application development staff
working directly with the ACS application development staff. He sees this area needing
a significant amount of improvement and would like to see ACS grow in this area, but
likes the ability to break that portion of the contract if improvements are not seen.
In response to Ms. Davis’ question, Mr. Hauser stated in the next three years, the
Sheriff’s Department would like to see the paper-based systems moved into a managed
workflow process and the JUSTIS system interfaced with the jail management package.
One of the deficiencies seen in the original contract was the leadership expected from the
IT vendor. Mr. Hauser believes, he should be able to approach ACS with his problem
and ACS should be able to help him determine how to solve it using technology. Mr.
Hineline replied it is the responsibility of his staff to utilize the vendor to assist in getting
IT knowledge needed to solve the problems. Mr. Ricketts would like to see the leadership
more clearly defined so that the users know who to direct their needs to.
Joe Finch:
Mr. Finch from IPD said he was in favor of the Amendment and a two-year extension.
His major concern is the phrase “it’s not in the contract.” He believes the contract needs
to be more clearly defined to include instances where that particular phrase might adhere.
Due to security issues with the law enforcement computers, it was brought to Mr.
Hineline's attention that IPD would not be able to benefit from the restructuring of the
helpdesk portion of the contract. Mr. Hineline stated they are recasting portions of the
contract to specify issues with high security areas such as the law enforcement
community and courts.
Rosalie Hinton:
Ms. Hinton from DMD Permits has been with the City/County for 17 years. Ms. Hinton
stated she is in favor of the Amendment and the duration of the extension is not an issue.
Tidemark has been an application that ACS has been working with DMD on from the

IT Board Minutes
Page 3
beginning. The response from ACS on any improvements or requests has been very
good. The recent upgrade was well planned and executed by their ACS support.
Bill Young:
Judge Young is not in favor of a four-year extension. His recommendation is to agree to a
two-year extension. He specified he was speaking on his own merit and is not
representing the views of the courts. Judge Young stated he thought the improvements
seen from ACS are due to the contract expiring soon. He is against the rewards portion
of the contract and feels they should not be rewarded for something they were expected
to do all along. Judge Young is concerned about the stand-alone systems that do not
communicate with one another. The JUSTIS system is not easily accessible because the
different systems are not integrated, and he believes the problem stems from the lack of
leadership shown by ACS at the time the stand-alone systems were brought in.
Dr. Tunstall asked Judge Young if it is ACS’ fault because the data is not accessible or if
it is the organizations fault because the funds were not provided to integrate the systems.
Mr. Piper explained the systems further for clarification stating Tiburon is integrated with
other systems, but JUSTIS and Tiburon are not integrated due to the languages and ages
of the two systems. He stated that the problem is not ACS’ fault; the problem lies with
the inability to integrate the two languages. Mr. Hineline clarified further stating Daniels
& Associates Inc. is contracted to support the JUSTIS applications, ACS only runs the
machine and network JUSTIS resides on.
CTMP
Handouts of the Draft CTMP were distributed to the Board. Mr. Hineline stated the
CTMP and the Amendment are directly connected because the CTMP is intended to deal
with the vision of where and how technology is to be utilized within local government.
The Amendment is specific to define and deliver services that are deployed for ISA to
accomplish the direction stated in the CTMP.
Dr. Tunstall would like a technology roadmap of where the systems utilized by local
government need to go in the next 5-10 years included into the CTMP.
Gartner Study and Tactical versus Strategic View
Mr. Hineline discussed the four-quadrant matrix which provides a visual summary of
where the areas addressed in the Amendment fall on the customer or IT focus scales. He
made the point that this contract Amendment addresses areas that are more focused on
day to day operations versus the strategic areas of activity. The line on the top of the
chart depicts a border between strategic and tactical focus. Mr. Hineline then discussed
the base allocation chart with the Board. This graph identifies in broad categories, where
the base charges contracted to ACS are used. It indicates that of the total base charges,
only 9 % of the total, representing Applications Development activities, is totally focused
on what would be described as new activities for systems. This contract is primarily a
lights on type of contract representing the basic work that must occur to keep the

IT Board Minutes
Page 4
environment working. Various summaries of the Gartner studies were then quickly
described for the Board.
Unisys Presentation
Unisys representatives presented the IT Board with information about their company.
One of Unisys’ core competencies is outsourcing. Each one of their service level
agreements have been met, and they pride themselves on their customer service. They
provide flexible contracts with some containing a commitment contractually to reduce
costs by 20-40% over the course of 5 years.
ACS Presentation
The ACS representative reviewed information about ACS with the Board. ACS has six
major data centers and over 8,300 applications. They are ranked as the number one IT
provider to State and Local Government. The outsourcing objectives include being
responsive to end-user expectations with measurable service standards, introducing
proven methodologies and new technology tools to enhance critical business processes,
and maintaining a solid computing and telecommunications infrastructure to support endusers and their reliance on technology. ACS sees this extension as a relationship and an
opportunity to continue providing the City/County with IT solutions.
Further discussion
Mr. Ricketts suggested delaying the January 29th vote to allow Mr. Hineline more time to
conduct meetings with key users. Mr. Turner and Ms. Davis are in favor of a two-year
extension. Ms. Davis would like to see a comparison of pros and cons regarding the
different duration times of the contract. Ms. Womacks stated she is in favor of the threeyear extension. Mr. Hineline, after conferring with ACS representatives, stated they
believed they could provide feedback to the Board by the scheduled January 29th
meeting.
Adjourn
Mr. Ricketts adjourned the meeting at 4:15 PM.

CIO Comments
IT Board Members,
2001 has been a good year from the ISA perspective. With the help of our
sourcing partners, we have accomplished significant work that has resulted in
improved services for our customers. I commend all of the ISA staff, the ACS
staff and the SchlumbergerSema staff for their efforts. I am looking forward to
building upon these accomplishments and continuing our improvements in
service delivery in 2002.
We completed our year-end closing process very effectively this year. I thank
Diana and her staff for their efforts to ensure customers are aware of their
charges and that they have taken care of all the year-end closing issues that
come up. I also want to thank the Controller and Auditor staff that work so well
with us in this process. Without a true team approach, it cannot be successful.
Our major focus throughout December has been on the recommendation
regarding the contract extension with ACS. We started meetings with key
customers and stakeholders within local government as well as discussing the
amendment at other opportunities like the IT Team or IT Function Team
meetings. We have discussed these results at our January 18th meeting.
Sincerely,
Mike Hineline

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
MONTHLY STATUS REPORT
December 2001

ADMINISTRATION
A major focus of ACS during the month of December was the restructuring of the Help
Desk call handling processes. Realizing the need to continue our improvement of
response times to customer problem calls, ACS management addressed process
deficiencies in the dispatch of trouble calls beyond the first level of support. These
changes went into effect on December 10. The results since then have been very
favorable which are reflected in improved response statistics for all severity levels in
December. We fully expect the January numbers to be at or above service level
requirements.
ACS management continues to analyze and respond to the customer feedback forms
submitted after our technicians make Help Desk calls. The vast majority of the responses
indicated favorable results relative to customer satisfaction. For December, we issued 657
cards and received 209 back. That represents a 31.8% return rate that is an improvement
over previous months. ACS management will continue to follow-up with individual
customers to investigate any negative, or less than satisfactory responses.
The CAMA Property Tax system project remains on schedule. The Township Assessors
have tentatively scheduled the conversion of the production system for the end of January
or February timeframe depending on State rulings. The certification of the 2001 CAMA
Roll is scheduled for the January 19th weekend. This is the beginning of the rollover of
the 2001 values to the Auditor’s office. The 2001 values will be locked at this time but
the Township Assessors will be able to update the 2002 values under the old system until
the final production conversion is done.

Project Name: PC Focus Application Conversion
Assigned Business Consultant: Kathy Fluke
Department/Agency: Department of Metropolitan Development
Division of Permits
Brief Project Description: The City of Indianapolis Division of Permits currently has a
PC Focus application that contains tracking data for microfilmed records dating prior to
the implementation of IndiFind. Access to this data must be maintained, as it is the sole
indexing for microfilmed permit records prior to IndiFind. The PC Focus application
cannot run on computes containing an operating system newer than Windows95. Given
that computer upgrades now come with Windoes98 or Windows2000, the PC Focus
application has become obsolete. The Division of Permits has made a conscious effort to
keep an older computer with Windows95 available for the PC Focus application. This
project will convert the PC Focus application to a new relational database application,
compatible with Windows98 and Windows2000, while maintaining current search
functionality. No new fields or functionality are required.

IPD Training Academy
The upgrade of PC equipment in IPD's Training Academy computer lab is complete.
Nine new machines were added, and the existing ten were replaced with new PCs.
We received a wiring quote from a vendor that was too high. This has resulted in a
temporary work-around; we have run a single CAT5 line from the wiring closet to a
hub at the front of the classroom. Patch cables were then run from the hub to each
PC. The Wiring group is working on obtaining a more reasonable quote from other
vendors, to allow for full replacement of all CAT3 lines to CAT5, running from each
unit directly to the closet. Lt. Joe Finch volunteered his time-off to assist in moving
the equipment from the CCB to the Academy; this was greatly appreciated.

•

IFD GroupWise Project
ACS personnel are working closely with the Indianapolis Fire Department to add
