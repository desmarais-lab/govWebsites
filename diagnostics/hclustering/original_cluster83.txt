and residents they protect and serve; and
WHEREAS, John Feeney, Concierge, The Nestle Inn, exemplifies what it means to go above and beyond. He
functions in the areas of reservations, front desk, concierge, housekeeper, bell man, maintenance, and groundsman. A
daily example of supreme service is John’s initiative to call every guest prior to their arrival to let them know he’s looking
forward to their check-in, asking if there is anything he can do to help their stay go more smoothly. John wants all guests
to feel how special The Nestle Inn is, just as he treasures it as the place he was married; and
WHEREAS, Darren Fish, Concierge, The Westin Indianapolis, preps the Westin’s breakfast buffet, then heads over
to the Omni to work, returning to the Westin to help service and clean the hospitality suite. He has been doing this for 13
years, and his outgoing attitude is contagious even early in the morning; and
WHEREAS, Lucy Hawkins, Server, Omni Severin Hotel, has been serving breakfast to Omni Severin guests for the
past 26 years, treating them like royalty. Loyal guests often say that Lucy is someone they feel like they’ve known and
loved for years; and

Her energy and positive outlook are contagious, not only with fellow employees, but the guests that come in for lunch.

WHEREAS, Jess Parrotte is a Server at Bluebeard. When Jess is not hosting one of her famous vintage sales with
Nine Lives Vintage or making potted peculiarities that are dotted in windows all over downtown; she’s busy serving
hungry diners who have traveled far to finally taste what so many foodies across the country have been raving about. Jess
always puts other’s needs above her own. She is a hospitality queen and one of Indy’s biggest ambassadors, especially
for her new neighborhood in Garfield Park; and
WHEREAS, Tillara Turner, Front Desk, Enterprise Holdings, works the night shift at Alamo and National rental
car kiosks at the airport. She is always standing outside in the heat or cold with a smiling face, welcoming weary travelers
off the plane, impressively maintaining calm to diffuse any situation; and
WHEREAS, these Rose Award winners and honorees are true goodwill ambassadors for their companies and the
city. These industry champions, through one-on-one or behind-the-scenes contact, positively influence a visitor’s
experience in Indiana; now, therefore:

PROPOSAL NO. 73, 2017. Councillor Adamson reported that the Public Works Committee heard
Proposal No. 73, 2017 on March 30, 2017. The proposal, sponsored by Councillor Adamson,
approves an additional appropriation of $435,000 in the 2017 Budget of the Department of Public
Works (Federal Grants Fund) to repurpose the Energy Efficiency Community Block Grant for
energy upgrades at the Riverside Park facility. By a 7-0 vote, the Committee reported the proposal
to the Council with the recommendation that it do pass.
Councillor Jackson asked from where this money is coming. Councillor Adamson said that this is
a repurposing of grant dollars that were left over. Councillor Jackson asked in whose district this
facility is located. Councillor Adamson said that it is in Councillor Osili’s district. Councillor

Jackson asked for clarification that there are no local tax dollars that are a part of this. Councillor
Adamson said that they are federal grant dollars, and not local tax dollars.
The President called for public testimony at 7:38 p.m.
Mr. Vaughn said that this is a misappropriation of funds being turned over to a private corporation.
Communities are already experiencing a loss of programming in the parks, with many of the doors
to park facilities locked to children, even during peak weekend hours. He added that programs like
this are using federal grant money for other things instead of using them to benefit the poorest
children in the community. President Lewis asked Mr. Vaughn to again keep his comments
germane to the proposal. Mr. Vaughn said that his comments are germane, and he feels he is being
denied the right to speak.
There being no further testimony, Councillor Adamson moved, seconded by Councillor Osili, for
adoption. Proposal No. 73, 2017 was adopted on the following roll call vote; viz:
24 YEAS: Adamson, Coats, Cordi, Evans, Fanning, Gray, Holliday, Jackson, Johnson, Kreider,

PROPOSAL NO. 90, 2017. The proposal, sponsored by Councillor Osili, authorizes additional
public parking on St. Clair and 9th Streets from the Indianapolis Water Company to Senate Avenue
(District 11). By a 7-0 vote, the Committee reported the proposal to the Council with the
recommendation that it do pass.
Councillor Mowery asked what defines public parking and stated that it seems there is already
adequate public parking along this area of the canal. Alex Beatty, Faegre Baker & Daniels, stated
that there are 17 spaces facing south that are open for public use, but some of the retail tenants
along the canal are having problems with turnover of spaces. The decision was to put in metered
parking so that tenants are not taking up parking spots for days at a time, which will enhance access
along the canal for customers of these retail tenants.
President Lewis asked in whose district this parking is located. Councillor Osili stated that it is in
his district.

Councillor Miller asked if there has been any discussion about including a four-hour parking option.
He had the same issue along Virginia Avenue, with people poaching parking spaces for several
hours; and four-hour parking limits were installed to address that situation. Mr. Beatty said that
they followed ParkIndy’s suggestions in this area.
Councillor Adamson moved, seconded by Councillor Scales, for adoption. Proposal No. 90, 2017

PROPOSAL NO. 97, 2007. The proposal, sponsored by All Councillors, recognizes the
Indianapolis Colts on their impressive SuperBowl XLI (41) win. Councillor Conley read the

follows:
CITY-COUNTY SPECIAL RESOLUTION NO. 14, 2007
A SPECIAL RESOLUTION recognizing the Indianapolis Colts for their impressive SuperBowl XLI (41)
win.
WHEREAS, on Sunday evening, February 4, 2007, with 93.15 million viewers tuned in to the third
most watched program in television history, the Indianapolis Colts quieted the doubters and critics with
an impressive 29-17 win over the much-touted Chicago Bears in SuperBowl XLI (41) at Dolphin
Stadium in Miami, Florida; and
WHEREAS, decked out in their finest blue and white and armed with total confidence in their team,
Colts fans watched in horror as 14 seconds into the game, the Bears’ Devin Hester returned the opening
kick for a 92-yard touchdown; and
WHEREAS, a Peyton Manning/Reggie Wayne pass completion touchdown rallied fans as the Colts
battled back in the first quarter, even though pouring rain and wet conditions caused them to miss the
extra point conversion; and

55

Journal of the City-County Council

WHEREAS, the impressive running game of Joseph Addai and Dominic Rhodes (191 yards), short
pass completions to Dallas Clark and Ben Utecht, and a key reception from Marvin Harrison left the
usually sharp Bears’ defense shaking their heads, as the Colts steadily gained first down after first down
to set up an Adam Vinatieri field goal and Rhodes’ touchdown run-in from the one-yard line, resulting in
a 16-14 lead for the Colts at half-time; and
WHEREAS, the Bears desperately tried to rally back with a field goal to answer Vinatieri’s second
three-pointer, but the much-maligned Colts’ defense thwarted them at every turn, culminating with
Kelvin Hayden’s 53-yard interception return for a touchdown and Bob Sanders’ game-clinching
interception; and
WHEREAS, at 10:11p.m. on Sunday, February 4, 2007, even the pouring rain could not dampen the
celebration as Colts’ Owner and Chief Executive Officer Jim Irsay held aloft the Vince Lombardi Trophy
as the crowd chanted “World Champs”; and
WHEREAS, although awarded the Most Valuable Player trophy, Manning credits the entire team with
the win and admits that any number of teammates deserved that title; while players, fans, and outsiders
alike credit the leadership of Head Coach Tony Dungy, the first African-American coach to win the
SuperBowl, as a world-class mentor, motivator, friend, and coach, as well as a shining example of
winning with class, grace and humility; now, therefore:
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CITY-COUNTY COUNCIL OF THE
CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS AND OF MARION COUNTY, INDIANA:
SECTION 1. The Indianapolis City-County Council specifically recognizes Colts’ Owner and CEO Jim
Irsay, President Bill Polian, Head Coach Tony Dungy and all the players, coaching staff and
administration of the Indianapolis Colts and congratulates them on their impressive SuperBowl XLI (41)
win.
SECTION 2. The Council recognizes that the Colts’ win has brought together the Indianapolis
community like no other event, with more than 45,000 fans greeting the team in freezing cold
temperatures for a parade and pep rally punctuated with shouts of “Repeat! Repeat!” as fans look to the
future with a team that still has not realized their full potential and have proven themselves as champions
both on and off the field.
SECTION 3. The Council also recognizes the Indianapolis community for supporting their local team all
season long and rallying around them when it mattered most, all the while following the example of the
team and celebrating with dignity and class.
SECTION 4. The Mayor is invited to join in this resolution by affixing his signature hereto.
SECTION 5. This resolution shall be in full force and effect upon adoption and compliance with IC 363-4-14.

CITY-COUNTY SPECIAL RESOLUTION NO. 15, 2007
A SPECIAL RESOLUTION recognizing the George Washington Community School of Indianapolis on
receiving Washington, DC’s Coalition for Community Schools’ inaugural Community School Award.

56

February 12, 2007

WHEREAS, Coalition for Community Schools honored George Washington Community School of
Indianapolis with the Coalition's inaugural Community School Award at its national forum in Baltimore,
Md., June 14, 2006; and
WHEREAS, the new national honor recognizes intensive school/community partnerships, family and
community engagement, connections to student learning with evidence of achievement results and
innovations that other schools could adapt; and
WHEREAS, the Coalition for Community Schools defines a community school as "both a place and
set of partnerships between the school and other community resources”, with an integrated focus on
academics, services, supports and opportunities that lead to improved student learning, stronger families
and healthier communities. A community school also uses public schools as hubs to bring together many
partners to offer a range of supports and opportunities to children, youth, families and communities-before, during and after school, as well as on weekends; and
WHEREAS, The award recognizes the excellence of the community school in achieving positive
results for students, families, and the community through high quality teaching that engages students,
purposeful partnerships, strong involvement of families and community residents, and deep roots in the
community; and
WHEREAS, in 2000, community partners, parents and educators convinced the Indianapolis Public
Schools to reopen the closed Washington H.S. as a community school, which serves 900 near-Westside
students in grades 7-12. Fifty seven percent of the students are male and 43% female; with regards to
race, 47% are white, 27% black, 23% Hispanic, and 3% other (American Indian, Asian, and Multi-Race).
Eighty nine percent live in neighborhoods where the Census reports less than 5% of the population has
attended college. The community fully intends to reverse the trend and has established a solid foundation
with its first group to graduate; and
WHEREAS, George Washington Community School has 49 community partners that provide a
wide range of onsite academic support services to ensure students have necessary conditions for learning.
The services include tutoring, mentoring, after-school, health, mental health, dental, career and collegeprep, cultural, service-learning, positive youth development, public swimming and other recreational
activities, parent, adult financial literacy, GED and English as a Second Language (ENL) programs; and
WHEREAS, Partnering Mary Rigg Neighborhood Center, through funding support from Chase and
USA Funds, provides the school with a full-time community school coordinator. A unique position
within IPS, the coordinator serves as school liaison to community and service provider organizations,
which collaborators suggest is a key part of Washington's success; and
WHEREAS, in 2004, the KnowledgeWorks Foundation of Cincinnati, Ohio, named Washington
"one of the nation's best examples of a school as center of community", and in 2005, Washington was
one of six school communities from across the country selected to participate in a long-term Learning
Communities Initiative sponsored by USA Funds, ScholarshipAmerica and eight other national
organizations collaborating to help prepare students for post-secondary education.; and
WHEREAS, the school's first commencement took place May 24, 2006, with the following student
progress: 100% passed the math portion of the Graduation Qualifying Exam, 90% passed the language
arts portion (half of the 10% that did not pass were ENL students), and 81% identified the college they
planned to attend this fall, and earned more than $1 million in scholarship awards. This performance
exceeded that of students at all of the traditional IPS high schools, as did the community school's first
graduation rate of 60%; and
WHEREAS, In addition, the December 2006 American School Board Journal cover article, "Children
at Risk," cites IPS' George Washington Community School as a "break-the-mold success story" and asks:
"Can we conceive of a nation where all disadvantaged teenagers could have the opportunity to attend
such a school?"; and
WHEREAS, President George Bush forwarded a letter encouraging the students of George
Washington Community School to continue to reach as far as their vision and character can take them.
President Bush appluaded the teachers, school officials, and community partners for working to give
young people the knowledge and guidance they need to succeed and excel, and recommended that all
take pride in their school and their accomplishments; now, therefore:

armor vests after her heartbreak of seeing a K-9 Cop killed in the line of duty; and

the program, and soon after, other members within the Family Success program and Maplewood
Elementary School began raising funds for the cause; and
WHEREAS, the Family Success Initiative Program is a CICF funded project to assist 30 families in
achieving personal, family, and community goals; and
WHEREAS, once a month all 30 families come together for an educational session called Family
Night. Topics are of a wide variety from psychosocial, housing, and parenting issues. All participants
must complete a workshop in financial literacy before graduating from the Family Success program; and
WHEREAS, the mission of the Family Success K-9 Community Project is to raise enough money to

1701 EAST 25TH STREET (Approximate Address), INDIANAPOLIS
CENTER TOWNSHIP, COUNCILMANIC DISTRICT # 9
HOPESIDE COMMUNITY, L.P., by Joseph D. Calderon, requests rezoning of 3.341 acres, from
the SU-1 District, to the D-7 classification to provide for multi-family residential uses.

SPECIAL ORDERS - PUBLIC HEARING
PROPOSAL NO. 621, 2006. Councillor Nytes reported that the Economic Development
Committee heard Proposal No. 621, 2006 on January 24, 2007. The proposal, sponsored by
Councillors Sanders, Keller, Mahern, Conley and Gray, approves an appropriation of $330,620 in
the 2007 Budget of the Department of Metropolitan Development (Consolidated County,
Transportation General and Federal Grants Funds) to fund start up and operational costs
associated with the Regional Transportation Authority, which is a joint effort to coordinate
regional transportation planning, funded by a federal transportation planning grant, motor vehicle
highway funds, and contributions from the local government members of the nine-county
Metropolitan Planning Organization. By a 6-0 vote, the Committee reported the proposal to the
Council with the recommendation that it do pass.
Councillor Schneider said that if this is truly to be a temporary division, he would like to offer a
friendly amendment to sunset the division after two years. He said that his concern is that most
of the time when a division gets established, it is seldom eliminated, and he wants to insure that
this one is. Councillor Nytes said that this type of amendment may not produce the result
Councillor Schneider wants. She said that they will want the Regional Transportation Authority
(RTA) to continue their efforts after the incubator period as a transportation authority outside of
the Department of Metropolitan Development (DMD). She said that she would not be
comfortable with this amendment. Councillor Schneider stated that he cannot therefore support
the proposal without that amendment.
Councillor Keller said that he would prefer it not be amended to disband the division, as the
counties surrounding Marion County that are kicking in dollars may still want to do so.
Councillor Schneider said that his objection is not to other counties continuing to fund this
initiative, but that it not be a division within DMD and instead be an independent RTA.
Councillor Nytes said that the spirit of Councillor Schneider’s amendment is well-intended, and
she asked that DMD take this into consideration and hear the message and move in that direction.
She added that Marion County’s share in this funding comes from gasoline taxes and not from
property taxes.
President Gray called for public testimony at 7:49 p.m. There being no one present to testify,
Councillor Nytes moved, seconded by Councillor Gibson, for adoption. Proposal No. 621, 2006
was adopted on the following roll call vote; viz:

ADOPTION OF THE AGENDA
The President proposed the adoption of the agenda as distributed.
Councillor Langsford made the following motion:
Mr. President:
Remonstrators and petitioners continue to negotiate a compromise regarding Proposal No.
133, 2005. Therefore, I move that the public hearing on Proposal No. 133, 2005, Rezoning Case
2004-ZON-123, be postponed until the May 9, 2005 Council hearing.

Councillor Bradford seconded the motion, and Proposal No. 133, 2005 was postponed by a
unanimous voice vote.
Councillor Nytes stated that she understands there are a number of amendments for consideration
on Proposal No. 68, 2005 this evening. Because of the extensive work and time invested by the
Equal Opportunity Advisory Board on this ordinance, and because the proposal is under Final
Adoption and not up for public debate this evening, she is concerned about last-minute
239

Journal of the City-County Council

amendments which the board has no opportunity to respond to. She moved, seconded by
Councillor Gray, to return Proposal No. 68, 2005 to Committee so that the board can weigh in on
any proposed amendments.
Councillor Schneider opposed the motion to return the proposal to Committee. He said that
numerous meetings have been held and the board has had two years to consider amendments.
Sending the proposal back to Committee will not accomplish anything, as all of the information is
before the Council. He said that the public has had ample time to weigh in on the matter and he
would prefer it be heard tonight.
Councillor Gray said that it is not unprecedented to return a proposal to committee for
amendments so as not to hold lengthy discussions on the Council floor. He asked his fellow
Council members to support the motion.
Councillor Sanders said that as chair of the committee, this issue only had two hearings and many
members were absent at these meetings. She said that it is important to give this issue proper due
diligence. She said that the advisory board has spent two years on this ordinance, but the
committee has only had two hearings.
The motion to return Proposal No. 68, 2005 to committee failed on the following roll call vote;
viz:
14 YEAS: Abduallah, Bowes, Boyd, Brown, Conley, Gibson, Gray, Keller, Mahern, Mansfield,
Nytes, Oliver, Sanders, Talley
15 NAYS: Borst, Bradford, Cain, Cockrum, Day, Franklin, Langsford, McWhirter, Moriarty
Adams, Pfisterer, Plowman, Randolph, Salisbury, Schneider, Speedy

President Talley stated that Proposal No. 68, 2005 will then be heard under Final Adoption this
evening as in the originally published agenda.
Without further objection, the agenda was adopted.

APPROVAL OF THE JOURNAL
The President called for additions or corrections to the Journal of April 11, 2005. There being no

SPECIAL ORDERS - FINAL ADOPTION
PROPOSAL NO. 68, 2005. Councillor Sanders stated that the Administration and Finance
Committee heard Proposal No. 68, 2005 on March 15 and April 19, 2005. The proposal,
sponsored by Councillors Nytes, Keller and Mansfield, amends the Code with respect to the
Equal Opportunity Advisory Board and complaint adjudication. Councillor Sanders said that she

253

Journal of the City-County Council

has been concerned about the response to this proposal. She said that focusing on one aspect and
not looking at the proposal as a whole would be throwing the baby out with the bathwater. This
proposal is about civil rights. Each person is created equal under the law and in the eyes of their
God to whom they choose to show respect. She deferred to Councillor Nytes, primary sponsor of
the proposal. Councillor Nytes detailed the aspects of the proposal and outlined all amendments.
By a 4-2 vote, the Committee reported the proposal to the Council with the recommendation that
it do pass.
Councillor Bowes said that he has received 1,600 e-mails on this subject and he hopes no one
makes their decision and bases their vote on misinformation that has been provided in some of
these communications. He said that this proposal will not infringe on the rights of religious
freedom or place any gag orders on any church’s ministry. He said that the Council should
respect the work that the Equal Opportunity Advisory Board has done to protect those who are
discriminated against.
Councillor Nytes said that many who said that they would support the proposal previously
because they believe in basic fairness and inclusion have now become uncomfortable and
intimidated by misinformation. She said that this proposal simply expands the policy against bias
and is not asking anyone to change their beliefs. She said that this proposal simply ensures that
hiring and firing decisions are based on merit only. She said that she is saddened by the
hypocrisy that fills this room this evening. She moved, seconded by Councillor Gray, to return
Proposal No. 68, 2005 to Committee.
Councillor Schneider said that this motion has already been offered and failed. He asked for a
point of order on allowing this motion. President Talley stated that he will allow the motion.
General Counsel Aaron Haith said that there is nothing in the Council rules to prevent the Chair
from recognizing a motion, even if it has already been made. Councillor Schneider asked how
many times the same motion can be offered over and over. President Talley said that it can be
offered as many times as it is recognized.
The motion to return to Committee failed on the following roll call vote; viz:
14 YEAS: Abduallah, Bowes, Boyd, Brown, Conley, Gibson, Gray, Keller, Mahern, Mansfield,
Nytes, Oliver, Sanders, Talley
15 NAYS: Borst, Bradford, Cain, Cockrum, Day, Franklin, Langsford, McWhirter, Moriarty
Adams, Pfisterer, Plowman, Randolph, Salisbury, Schneider, Speedy

Councillor Nytes moved, seconded by Councillor Sanders, for adoption. Proposal No. 68, 2005
failed on the following roll call vote; viz:
11 YEAS: Bowes, Boyd, Brown, Conley, Gray, Keller, Mahern, Mansfield, Nytes, Oliver,
Sanders
18 NAYS: Abduallah, Borst, Bradford, Cain, Cockrum, Day, Franklin, Gibson, Langsford,
McWhirter, Moriarty Adams, Pfisterer, Plowman, Randolph, Salisbury, Schneider, Speedy,
Talley

Councillor Sanders stated that this is now a dead proposal that affects so many other areas. She
stated that this issue will therefore have to revisited in the near future to make amendments that
need to be made.
Councillor Conley reported that the Public Works Committee heard Proposal Nos. 147-154, 2005
on April 21, 2005. He asked for consent to vote on these proposals together. Consent was given.

PROPOSAL NO. 143, 2015. Councillor Adamson reported that the Public Works Committee
heard Proposal No. 143, 2015 on May 7, 2015. The proposal, sponsored by Councillors Lewis
and Adamson, appropriates the proceeds of IndyRoads Revenue Bonds, not to exceed $35
million, to fund the cost of certain street, road, curb and sidewalk projects, along with incidental
expenses. By a 7-0 vote, the Committee reported the proposal to the Council with the
recommendation that it do pass.
The President called for public testimony at 7:57 p.m.
Mr. Vaughn said that they are only resurfacing a half inch and it will only last two to three
months, and the materials and work is superficial and is an election year push.
Councillors Adamson and Barth said that this has been in the works for many years, and this is
the second phase and has nothing to do with an election year.
Councillor Mansfield said that her district will benefit greatly from these dollars, as it does not all
go toward re-paving, and there will be sidewalks in areas that lack safe walkways.
Margaret Gross, citizen, said that there are some newly paved areas that seem to be in disrepair
after less than a year. She asked if the Council could speak to Public Works about their
standards, as the standards seem sub-par.
Councillor Freeman said that it is ironic that they argued about $4.7 million for police officers’
equipment, and there seems to be no qualms about approving this amount for Public Works. He
said that a couple of situations have come up in the last few weeks with regard to Public Works
and their administration of those parking dollars, spending excessive money on electric cars and
no-bid contracts with ridiculous per-car prices. He said that he has many issues with Public
Works right now. He will support this, but he hopes there is a bi-partisan effort to address these
recent issues.
Councillor Pfisterer said that these are needed projects, but she agrees that some of the re-paving
seems to be sub-par and should be lasting much longer.
Councillor Adamson said that when this body approves an appropriation, it is not always used for
the same purpose as testified in the committee. He said that if they have to allocate one project at
a time to have better oversight, this will end in gridlock and keep projects moving forward. They
need an administration that will tell the truth.
Councillor Miller said that a majority of these funds are 2016 projects, so it has nothing to do
with an election year. He said that he agrees that some of the work by Public Works has been
sub-par, and he has fought for them to re-do some projects in his area, and he urged citizens to
call their Councillors and report shoddy work.

16

May 11, 2015May 11, 2015

Councillor Hickman said that Councillor Adamson has been complaining about the quality of
work for many years, and DPW asked for more money, and they were denied until they provided
more information.
Ms. Gross asked what citizens can do to get this addressed and brought forward, because their
money is being wasted. Councillor Barth said that testifying here is a start. He said that they can
also document when they see poor work and write down the names of the people with DPW they
have spoken to. He asked them to report shoddy work. Ms. Gross asked if she can meet with her
Councillor, Councillor Gooden, to discuss ways to keep this administration from wasting their tax
dollars.
Robert Ajax, citizen, said that he had to replace an entire wheel and a couple of tires due to poor
roads and poor quality repair jobs. He said that a quality report inspector needs to examine these
projects and make sure things are being done properly.
Councillor Oliver asked if someone is present from DPW to answer questions. Seeing no one
present, Councillor Oliver asked that the administration make the effort to have personnel
available when these items come before this body to answer questions.
Councillor Gooden said that there are always warranty obligations and bond claims, and citizens
should make a note of when a project is finished and when deterioration is noted. If they then
report this information to their Councillors, they can investigate. Ms. Gross asked if instead of
asking the citizens to do all the work, the Councillors can be pro-active and demand
accountability from the administration.
There being no further testimony, Councillor Adamson moved, seconded by Councillor Barth, for
adoption. Proposal No. 143, 2015 was adopted on the following roll call vote; viz:
29 YEAS: Adamson, Barth, Cain, Clay, Evans, Freeman, Gooden, Gray, Hickman, Holliday,

SPECIAL ORDERS - FINAL ADOPTION
PROPOSAL NO. 121, 2015. Councillor Mansfield reported that the Administration and Finance
Committee heard Proposal No. 121, 2015 on April 28, 2015. The proposal, sponsored by
Councillor Hickman, determines the need to lease approximately 3,373 square feet of space at
5226 Elmwood for use by the Marion County Assessor. By a 7-0 vote, the Committee reported
the proposal to the Council with the recommendation that it do pass.
Councillor Lutz said that they voted recently on the sale of the West Office, and the Assessor said
that they were planning on moving one of the eastside offices further west. He does not
understand why they are entering into this lease now. Councillor Moriarty Adams said that there
is another office lease that is up for renewal in November, and they are looking at some properties
further west and south in the next few months instead of renewing that particular location lease.
Councillor Lutz said that he feels Wayne and Decatur Townships are not currently being served,
and he is concerned they are leasing space in an area where they already have one office.
Councillor Moriarty Adams said that the Assessor is looking into locating services in the Wayne
Township Trustee’s Office. Councillor Lutz said that he understands this is being discussed, but
the services need to be more equally spread across the county. Councillor Moriarty Adams said
that they will keep Councillor Lutz apprised as they continue to look at locations.
Councillor Hunter asked if all public hearings and advertisements have been adhered to with this
lease. Councillor Moriarty Adams responded in the affirmative.
Councillor Mansfield moved, seconded by Councillor Hickman, for adoption. Proposal No. 121,
2015 was adopted on the following roll call vote; viz:
25 YEAS: Adamson, Barth, Cain, Clay, Gooden, Gray, Hickman, Holliday, Hunter, Jackson,
Lewis, Mansfield, Mascari, McQuillen, Miller, Moriarty Adams, Oliver, Osili, Pfisterer,
Robinson, Sandlin, Scales, Shreve, Simpson, Tew

Proposal No. 121, 2015 was retitled GENERAL RESOLUTION NO. 7, 2015, and reads as
follows:

May 11, 2015May 11, 2015

CITY-COUNTY GENERAL RESOLUTION NO. 7, 2015
PROPOSAL FOR A GENERAL RESOLUTION determining the need to lease approximately three thousand, three
hundred and seventy three (3,373) square feet of space located at 5226 Elmwood Avenue, Indianapolis, Indiana, for use
by the Marion County Assessor.
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CITY-COUNTY COUNCIL OF THE
CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS AND OF MARION COUNTY, INDIANA:
SECTION 1. The City-County Council, pursuant to Indiana Code § 36-1-10-7, has investigated the conditions
requiring the subject lease and hereby determines that the lease of approximately three thousand, three hundred and
seventy three (3,373) square feet of space for use by the Marion County Assessor, on behalf of Marion County, is
needed.
SECTION 2. The property to be leased is located at 5226 Elmwood Avenue, Indianapolis, Indiana and is owned by the
Doyle T. Haywood d/b/a Haywood Properties LLC.
SECTION 3. This resolution shall be in full force and effect upon adoption and compliance with I.C. § 36-3-4-14.

PROPOSAL NO. 125, 2015. Councillor Moriarty Adams reported that the Public Safety and
Criminal Justice Committee heard Proposal No. 125, 2015 on April 29, 2015. The proposal,
sponsored by Councillors Moriarty Adams and Pfisterer, approves a transfer of $31,500 in the
2015 Budget of the Marion County Circuit Court (County General Fund) for contractual services
and office furniture. By a 9-0 vote, the Committee reported the proposal to the Council with the
recommendation that it do pass.
Councillor Gray said that he does not understand using $30,000 for consultants and $1,500 for
furniture. He asked what they will be doing. Sue Patterson, Director of Finance, Marion Circuit
Court, said they have constitutional responsibilities and when issues arise in the Legislature, they
need representation on these issues. The furniture costs are due to the chairs in the Paternity
Court desperately needing replaced. Councillor Gray asked what the term is for the consultant
contract. Ms. Patterson said that it is for one year. Councillor Gray asked if it would be up for
renewal at that time. Ms. Patterson responded in the affirmative. Councillor Gray asked if this
will end up being a lifelong contract. Ms. Patterson answered in the negative, but stated that it
will probably end up being a multi-year contract.
Councillor Evans asked if the lobbyists have already been decided. Ms. Patterson said that the
judge has chosen Ice Miller as the lobbying firm.
Councillor Freeman said that he understands the concern about this expense, but with the city
spending $32 million on electric cars, while Councillor Hunter’s chair is falling apart in this very
meeting so that he is falling off of it, this expense makes more sense. He said that the Paternity
Court is in great disrepair and needs some help; and there are some major issues facing the courts
due to Legislation that affects them.
Councillor Gray said that he is not opposed to the expenditure, but it is always good to understand
the explanation for the dollars.
Councillor Lutz said that he would like to see more of the money invested in the Circuit and
Paternity Courts, but the General Assembly has really messed up the small claims courts due to
recent legislation. He asked his colleagues to support this good Democrat judge.

speak for or against a proposal. You would press the green button if you’re in favor of a proposal and the
red button if you’re against. If you simply have a question on a proposal, you will still need to choose either
green or red to have your name appear in the queue. Your names will appear on President Lewis’ screen in
the order the buttons are chosen. I have put little note cards in front of each of your voting stations with a
reminder of this as well. Please keep in mind that this is a new system to all of us, so there will be a bit of a
learning curve, not only on the processes, but the language to prompt the correct actions. Thank you.
Respectfully,

SPECIAL ORDERS - UNFINISHED BUSINESS
PROPOSAL NO. 228, 2015. Councillor Osili reported that the Rules and Public Policy
Committee heard Proposal No. 228, 2015 on August 11 and December 1, 2015. The proposal
was adopted by the full Council on December 14, 2015, and subsequently vetoed by former
Mayor Gregory Ballard on December 23, 2015. The proposal, sponsored by former Councillor
Tew, amends the Code by adding a new Sec. 451-4 regarding the reporting of lost or stolen
firearms. Councillor Osili moved, seconded by Councillor Simpson, to override the Mayor’s veto
of Proposal No. 228, 2015.
Councillor Oliver said that the federal government has attempted to regulate Sudafed, an overthe-counter cold medicine, because it is used to make drugs that have proved deadly to people.
He said that weapons would fall into this same category, and he would think that a responsible
gun owner would want it known if their weapon had been lost or stolen. He said that the only
reason he can think of for not reporting it lost or stolen, is if they are sharing it with a person who
cannot get one legally, and they are shielding that person.
Councillor Miller said that he has been anxiously waiting to hear from the new Mayor or the new
police chief on this issue, and has not heard any comments from them. He said that he does not
feel it is necessary to vote on these issues until they hear from them, and he would prefer they
work with the new administration to see if they concur with this action.
Councillor Clay said that this proposal is reasonable, proportionate, measurable, and logical. He
said that individuals report animals that are lost and other items of value, and he would imagine
that reasonable gun owners will not see this as an additional burden, but rather as a responsibility,
and he does not think that this action is overreaching in any way.
Councillor Sandlin said that it was testified that this would help identify where guns might have
come from if they were used in a crime, but there is already a mechanism in place now to
research that information. He said that they have a group of detectives now in the Indianapolis
Metropolitan Police Department (IMPD) who track this on a regular basis. He said that while
people do report valuable items or animals as lost or stolen, there is no law requiring it, and no
fine associated if they do not report it. He said that he does not see value in this proposal, and the
way that it is written makes it the responsibility of IMPD to capture the data and enforce it, even
within the excluded cities. He said that it is not the National Rifle Association (NRA) that will
engage in suing the city, but rather an individual exercising their rights. He said that this proposal

13

Journal of the City-County Council

impedes on State statute, and the deputy city attorney testified in committee about the risk the city
could incur should this pass. He added that the reasons articulated by Mayor Ballard for his veto
are valid, and the way to prevent gun violence is to educate people on gun safety.
Councillor Simpson said that it is amazing that members of this body can act like crime is not an
issue in this community. Maybe it is not happening in some Councillors’ districts, but it is
happening in his community, and he is tired of the killing. Wanting to know where guns are
coming from seems like common sense, and if the violence was an issue in every Councillor’s
district, they would feel his pain. He said that they do whatever they can to prevent suicides and
overdoses, but if it goes against the NRA, all of a sudden, they are afraid to do anything.
Councillor Fanning said that the violence in crime is in all their districts, and almost all areas of
the county have had fatal shootings in the past year. It is a huge issue and very important.
However, she recently participated in a ride-along with some IMPD officers, and it was their
unanimous opinion that this legislation would not help them combat crime, but instead would be
one more piece of administration they would have to deal with. She said that in actuality, it does
not prevent the use of weapons or crime from happening, and it does not really allow them to
adequately track the weapons. She said that they need to instead strengthen the penalties for
those who commit crimes with illegal weapons and address drug addiction and other crime
factors.
Councillor Adamson said that he agrees with Councillors Clay and Oliver and urged his
colleagues to vote to override the veto.
Councillor Pfisterer said that she is elected to speak for her district, and her credit union was
robbed at gunpoint, and she can hear gun shots from her home. She said that crime affects every
district. However, before she can support this legislation, she needs to see some data about where
these guns are coming from that are used in crimes. She said that she does not believe this will
have any real impact on combatting crime, and therefore will not be supporting the vote to
override the veto.
Councillor Oliver asked if an owner of a handgun can be charged with a penalty or held
accountable if it is used by someone else in an unlawful crime and was lost or stolen. Mr.
Biesecker said that he does not know. He said that there may be some civil liability, but he
assumes there would have to be some proven fault on the part of the owner. Councillor Oliver
asked if the prosecutor could not charge the owner in this case. Mr. Biesecker said that it would
depend on the level of the owner’s knowledge and participation, and they would not be charged
simply because they were the registered owner. Councillor Oliver asked if they could say they
did not know it was stolen or lost, and therefore that would be enough to satisfy the prosecutor.
Mr. Biesecker said that it would be subject to circumstances, and there is no way of knowing.
Councillor Gray said that it seems a double standard that they would favor the “three strikes and
you’re out” approach with the crack cocaine epidemic a few years ago, and now are supporting
clean needle programs with the arrival of heroin, but can be so against something that might solve
the problem of violent crimes and homicides. He said that it amazes him that elected officials
would be so negative about prevention and so positive about punishment.
President Lewis called for a vote on the motion to override, and stated that 17 “yea” votes are
needed to override the veto. The Council failed to override the veto on the following roll call
vote; viz:

PROPOSAL NO. 413, 2015. Councillor Simpson reported that the Administration and Finance
Committee heard Proposal No. 413, 2015 on December 8, 2015. The proposal was adopted by
the full Council on December 14, 2015 and was subsequently vetoed by former Mayor Gregory
Ballard on December 23, 2015. The proposal, sponsored by Councillors Moriarty Adams and
Mascari, increases the compensation of the mayor and the city-county council. Councillor
Simpson moved, seconded by Councillor Adamson, to override the veto.
Councillor Adamson said that he finds irony in the Mayor’s reasoning that this took place after
the election in the dark of night, when the redistricting plan was handled in the same way in 2011
and 2012.
Councillor Coats said that he has talked with many city employees who have not received raises
in over seven years. He said that the city is struggling with a $50 million structural deficit, and
while this may seem a small amount in the grand scheme of things, voting to give themselves a
raise is not a picture he wants to paint.
Councillor Miller said that it is interesting that the Mayor refers to the Council as doing this in the
dark of night, when it received lots of news coverage, and certainly more coverage than when he
gave his senior staff $20,000 a year increases. He said that he had no problem with the Mayor
giving his people a raise, because competitive salaries are needed to attract talent. He said that he
is a single dad, and it is tough to do this job while raising a young son. Without raising the
salary, they are creating a job that no one can hold unless they are independently wealthy. He
said that some employees might have gone without raises for seven years, but it has been 16 years
since the Council’s salary was raised, which is over twice that. He said that being a Councillor is
a lot of work and it is infuriating that the Mayor would take away their home rule. This is the
Council budget and should be an internal decision. He said that with four positions dropped,
there is some funding for this action, and he believes the Mayor’s veto is out of place.
Councillor Sandlin said that this raise was brought up at the last minute, even though there was
plenty of opportunity to consider it earlier last year, giving the community time to comment on it,
and giving them the time to work it into the budget properly. He said that he was under the
impression that due to the elimination of the four at-large Councillor positions, that the personal
services character funding was reduced during the budget process. However, in committee, it
was testified that this money was re-budgeted in Character 03. In order to fund an increase, they
would need to transfer it back to Character 01, and then still find extra dollars to fund the rest. He
said that he would hope they would be better stewards of the taxpayers’ money and allocate funds
more appropriately. He said that the information the fiscal staff presented at committee was good
information in regard to comparison with other cities, but this information was not distributed in
the community. If this body decides to raise their own pay, they need a detailed analysis of their
finances to go out to the public for input and documentation of such an important decision.
President Lewis called for a vote on the motion to override, and reminded members that 17 “yea”
votes are needed to override the veto. The Council failed to override the veto on the following
roll call vote; viz:

WHEREAS, elected officials have an obligation to ensure that community standards of living are
maintained through prudent use of resources and strong economic development policies; and
WHEREAS, at a time of fiscal uncertainty, Marion County and the City of Indianapolis are
considering a substantial public investment of $48 million in a new convention center hotel, and have a

SPECIAL ORDERS - PUBLIC HEARING
COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE COUNCIL
PUBLIC TESTIMONY – BUDGET ORDINANCES
The President asked the Clerk to read those budget proposals for which public testimony will be
accepted this evening. The Clerk stated that public testimony will be accepted on the following:
PROPOSAL NO. 238, 2011 - approves the tax levies and rates for the Police Special Service
District for 2012; PROPOSAL NO. 239, 2011 - approves the tax levies and rates for the Fire
Special Service District for 2012; PROPOSAL NO. 240, 2011 - approves the tax levy and rate for
the Solid Waste Collection Special Service District for 2012; PROPOSAL NO. 241, 2011 adopts the annual budget for the City of Indianapolis and Marion County for 2012; PROPOSAL
NO. 250, 2011 - adopts the 2012 operating and maintenance budgets and tax levies of the
Indianapolis Airport Authority; PROPOSAL NO. 251, 2011 - adopts the 2012 operating and
maintenance budgets and tax levies of the Capital Improvement Board of Managers; PROPOSAL
NO. 252, 2011 - adopts the 2012 operating and maintenance budgets and tax levies of the Health
and Hospital Corporation; PROPOSAL NO. 253, 2011 - adopts the 2012 operating and
maintenance budgets and tax levies of the Indianapolis-Marion County Public Library;
PROPOSAL NO. 254, 2011 - adopts the 2012 operating and maintenance budgets and tax levies
of the Indianapolis Public Transportation Corporation (IndyGo); PROPOSAL NO. 255, 2011 adopts the 2012 operating budget of the Ben Davis Conservancy District. The President then
called for public testimony.
Shayna Martin, Marion County Commission on Youth (MCCOY), explained that they work on
behalf of the Early Intervention Planning Council (EIPC), with representatives from many
different entities serving on their board. She said that MCCOY is requesting $70,000 to continue
the work of the EIPC, and this is the first time they have asked for assistance from the city. She
explained the different programs and services that will be provided with this investment.
John Zaphiriou, eastside resident, said that he has seen many abandoned homes in the city that
could be rehabbed to help provide shelter for low and middle income families. He asked the
Council to find funds to address the housing needs of this community.
Cathy Burton, president of the Marion County Alliance of Neighborhood Associations
(MCANA), said that she is concerned that there has been no summary review of revenues, with
negative placeholders representing further cuts from the controller. Revenues have dropped in
fund balances and the city is trying to shed 200 jobs by attritition, but some budgets suggest there
will be layoffs or additional appropriations needed in a few agencies to fund positions. None of
the departments or agencies have accounted for SuperBowl expenditures and there is no real
grasp on those costs. She said that she has a concern about stormwater fees funding other
segments of public works, as well as the Sheriff’s budget shortfall of $21 million.
Liam Roche, citizen, said that since 2009, the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department’s
(IMPD) budget has been slashed by $30 million, and the Library budget has been cut $4 million,
and the slight raise this year does not compensate for that. Yet the Capital Improvement Board
(CIB) and the Airport Authority are both seeing increases this year of 16% and 10.5%,
respectively. He said that he finds it outrageous that they can find funding increases for the CIB

14

September 19, 2011

and the Airport, yet are cutting services for the citizens of Marion County to accommodate
tourists. He said they need to take care of their own residents first, and he urged them to also
support Proposal No. 242, 2011.
Tom Marvin, citizen, said that the priorities of the budget have been out of whack for a while. He
said that too much attention has been given to large corporations and out-of-town visitors, while
this city is being built on the backs of its workers. He asked Councillors to support Proposal No.
242, 2011, and give tax money back to those workers who need it most. He said that libraries are
closing or have restricted hours and bus routes are being eliminated or decreased. The city needs
to stop giving away money to people who already have enough, and pay more attention to the
hard-working people who make this city work every day.
Cynthia Konrad, Butler-Tarkington resident, said that she visits the libraries regularly and they
are a major resource for citizens, but do not seem to be a major priority for the administration.
She said that the pools close earlier every year, affecting the quality of life of citizens. She said
that with less resources, the things that make the city liveable seem to take less and less priority.
President Vaughn thanked those citizens for their comments and said that the Council will take
further testimony at the next meeting for those items that have not yet been heard in committee.

CITY-COUNTY SPECIAL RESOLUTION NO. 20, 2010
A SPECIAL RESOLUTION recognizing the Saints Constantine and Elena Romanian Orthodox Church
on its 100th Year Anniversary.
WHEREAS, the history of the church begins with an influx of Romanian immigrants to Indianapolis,
where in 1908, the Indianapolis News set the Romanian population at 1,000 people; and

Street and Kentucky Avenue and West Street and the White River, and in the Haughville area, bounded
by 10th Street, Belmont Avenue, Michigan and Vermont Streets, and Tibbs Avenue; and
WHEREAS, in 1906, Father Moise Balea visited Indianapolis and organized a parish committee and
chose the name of Saints Constantine and Elena for the name of a proposed new church. Due to an
economic depression and a lack of available priests, the establishment of the new congregation was
postponed until 1910; and
WHEREAS, in 1910, a building fund for the new church was started, at which time $700 in pledges
was recorded. The parish council purchased a building on the corner of West Market and Blackford

exists on the Indianapolis canal walk today; and

27, 1947, agreed to buy the site on Blackford Street in exchange for the deed to five acres on West 16th
Street, plus $22,500 and the cost of dismantling the old church building, so that materials could be reused
to build the new church; and
WHEREAS, work on the new church began on March 1, 1948 and was done by the members of the
church in order to keep costs down. The work was completed in 1949; and
WHEREAS, at the church’s 90th anniversary, one Bishop stated that due to trials and tribulations, the
church may have been prepared to close its doors at more than one time, but the parish resisted and is
now at a level of balance and stability, because of the dedication and tenacity of some of the faithful,
particularly the women who were elected presidents of the Council; and
WHEREAS, Saints Constantine and Elena has continued to be a home for a diverse mix of people:
those who have received and kept the heritage of the founders and previous generations as their own and
those who recently immigrated to the nation and long for a place to stay connected to the ancient and
living spiritual heritage of their homeland; now, therefore:
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CITY-COUNTY COUNCIL OF THE

SECTION 1. The Indianapolis City-County Council proudly recognizes the Saints Constantine and

Committee heard Proposal No. 84, 2010 on March 23 and April 6, 2010. The proposal,
sponsored by Councillors Coleman and Hunter, determines the need to lease approximately
15,000 square feet of office space at 8115 E. Washington Street for use as a Marion Superior
traffic court and Clerk's office. By a 4-3 vote, the Committee reported the proposal to the
Council with the recommendation that it do pass.
Councillor Malone said that she has been one of the most adamant and vocal regarding some of
the provisions in this proposal, mostly with regard to concerns of a fiscal nature and oversight by
a disinterested third party. She said that as a Department of Public Works (DPW) project, the
build-out would be subject to minority and women-owned business (WBE/MBE) participation
goals of the city and county, but she has been assured that the build-outs will be overseen by
Building Authority and will comply with MBE/WBE requirements. She said that she will now
support the proposal, as she has been made assurances that the Office of Finance and
Management (OFM) will make sure that build-outs for the traffic court and probation will be
settled in terms of the total appropriation, with $900,000 being spent for both.
Councillor Hunter said that this project would be located in his district, and there are great
challenges for more development in this corridor, and he hopes this project will spur more. He
said that he supports the proposal.
Councillor Pfisterer moved, seconded by Councillor Cockrum, for adoption. Proposal No. 84,
2010 was adopted on the following roll call vote; viz:

Councillor Sanders asked for consent to explain her vote. Consent was given. Councillor
Sanders said that she is still concerned about some of the leases the city and county get
themselves into, and she is not sure the best effort was made to keep the two functions in a joint
space.
