Neal' s Growing System
for the

"APPLE of LOVE"
In this brochure we are going to give you one of the planting
methods for the "Apple of Love". This method can be used for
individual planting, row planting, or as in this brochure the six foot
circle concentrated growing system. Tomatoes are one of the
easiest of all vegetables to grow, but they do require two main
elements. One is preparation and the other is prevention. They are
one of the few vegetables native to the Americas. It was first
propagated in the U.S. by Thomas Jefferson in 1781, however it , was
not .until 1835 that the tomato was generally cultivated in the United
States. Before then it was considered a highly poisonous fruit. In order
to get over this myth English, French and Italian s.eed salesmen
labeled .the tomato the "Love Apple" or the ''Apple of Love".
Initially there were only a few varieties of this .vegetable available.
While you are reading this brochure a tomato of a different size,
shape and or color is being developed.

The first requirement for our concentrated growing system is an 8'
square section in full sun with a gently southern slope and rich, well
drained soil, or as close as possible. Tomatoes should not be located
were you have grown potatoes in the past or near Walnut trees. In
early Spring remove any debris or sod on top of the ground. Till the
soil as deep as possible and grade the area so that it is mounded in the
center. Spray the entire area with Vapam or another soil fumigant.
Cover with clear or green plastic and secure well. This will increase
the soil temperature and the effect of the soil fumigant. Remove
plastic on warm sunny days until soil is thoroughly dry. Remove the
plastic around the 15th of April. The soil should again be tilled. Make a
circle by running a string 3 to 4 feet out from a post driven in the
center of the circle. Evenly space 5 holes around this circle . Dig
holes 2' x 2' x 2 1/2" deep. Place soil from the holes in the center of
the mound. This soil should be layered with a mixture of 75 pounds
of sand, 50 pounds of peat, 10 pounds of lime, 10 pounds of gypsum,
5 pounds of bone meal, 5 cups Epsom Salt and 5 pounds of any low
nitrogen all purpose fertilizer . (These concentrations are assuming
that you have a high clay or poor soil.) The soil should then be well
spaded or tilled. Place six inches of manure, grass clippings, or
compost mixed with 1/2 cup of triple phosphate in the bottom of all
holes . Fill with hot water to which 1/4 cup of fish emulsion as
been added. If water takes more _than 4 hours to drain through the
soil, sand should be added to the base. Backfill holes to within 3
inches of ground level. Grade the remaining soil so that it is high in
the center. Add to 1 gallon of hot water 4 tblsp. fish emulsion,
and appropriate amount of low nitrogen high phosphorous fertilizer
such as Garden Life and 2 tblsp. calcium (Tomato Saver). Fill each
depression and allow to soak into the soil completely. Recover the
entire area with plastic. Around the 10th to 15th day of May it is
considered safe to plant tomatoes, however soi1 must be 65 d:egrees before
tomato plants will grow well. If you do wish to plant earlier, watch
weather conditions closely because newly installed plants are extremely
sensitive to cold weather and cool soil. When transplanting the tomato be
very careful not to overly disrupt the root structure of the plant.
Remove all bottom branches to within 2-3 inches of the top of the
plant, (regardless of the height of the plant). Dig holes in the center
of the 2' square to accommodate the full height of the plant. Place 2
tblsp. Magamp in bottom of holes and cover with 3 inches of soil. Â·
Install plant, and mud in with Vitamin B-1 and water. Place a paper
cup with the bottom cut out down over the top of the plant and push
down into the soil to a depth of approximately 1/2 to 1 inch. This
will reduce the damage caused by early winds and cutworms. Add a
1/2 inch layer of vermiculite or pearlite to the 2' square planting
areas. Place a clear plastic one gallon milk container with the
bottom cut out over the top of all the young tomato plants. Be sure to
take the top off of the milk container and to install air holes around
the sides of the container to assure proper ventilation and air
circulation inside your mini-greenhouse.
0

Six to eight inches on either side of each plant install a 2 or 5
pound coffee can with holes punched in the bottom. Place in the
bottom of the can 2" of manure, 3 tblsp. bone meal and 1 tblsp.
Epsom salt. Fill with lukewarm solution of Garden Life fertilizer and
vitamin B-1. The cans will be used for all future waterings and
fertilizer. Tomato plants should only be watered when they wilt.
Use only B-1 until plants blossom. At this time the plastic should
be returned to the mound to maintain ground heat but keep away
from young tomato plants to avoid sun scald. Stake plants as soon
as possible. There are two different methods for this. One is to
stake the plants individually, the other is to install a six foot fence
around the inside perimeter of the tomatoes. Be sure to leave access
to the center. Once the plant has outgrown the confines of the plastic
milk carton, it should be removed. Gradually introduce your new
plants to the sun. At this time the soil should be adequately warmed
for the removal of the plastic. Remove weeds and scratch the soil
surface. Add 1/8th of an inch of sand to the entire area. Place 6 inches
of straw, compost or other mulch over the entire area, being sure not
to cover your watering cans. Add compost as available. Dust mulch
with insect fungicide combination.

When blossoms first appear, mix Garden Life fertilizer, calcium,
and Vitamin B-1 with 1 gallon of water and fill each can. A
thorough spraying of the entire plant with Tomato Saver or Blossom
Set will result in early pollination and fruit development. Apply all
fertilizer and chemicals according to label directions. Do not add grass
clippings to the center compost area until they have aged 2 weeks and
especially avoid any that have been sprayed with a weed killer . All
gardens require one inch of water per week. With mulching less
watering is necessary. Every other time you water apply Garden Life
or Magamp through the can feeders. Starting with the first appearance
of blossoms a standard multi-purpose spray or dust of insecticide and
fungicide should be utilized. The planting of Basil near tomato plants
will help in their growth and development and will add flavor. This
will also help to repel harmful insects. We recommend that as soon as
the plastic is removed, plant 2 of the following in the immediate area
of the plants: chives, garlic, mint, onions, carrots, parsley, wormwood
or celery. Asparagus and tomatoes benefit each other. Another
addition to this concentrated growing system would be cucumbers of
the bush variety. These should be planted on top of the compost
mound. Around the outer border of your "Love Apple System" plant
marigolds or nasturtiums.

With the use of natural insect repellents and friends of the tomato
plant you should reduce your insect and disease problems
considerably. Try to avoid locating near radishes, peas, corn, broccoli,
beans, dill, potatoes, cabbage, fennel, horsenettle, nightshade, or
Kohlrabi, as all 'of these are damaging to the growth and health of the
tomato plant. (Insects do little damage compared to the disease they
transfer). The largest problem in any and all vegetable gardens is
over or under watering. Your plants require no more than constant and
even availability of nutrients and moisture. Not the excess. Your
second crop of tomatoes are planted from July 1 to August 1. A third
crop of tomato plants may be installed in 3-5 gallon containers which
are recessed 1/2 way into the ground. This should be done around July
30th to August 15th. The plants for this planting can be taken from
strong suckers on your existing plants or raised from seed. In the fall
when the first danger of frost appears, gradually introduce them into
your home. They will produce fruit far into the winter months. The
selection of tomatoes for this particular usage should be the short
bushy plants. Before bringing any plant into the house for Fall, they
should be sprayed twice with an insecticide and fungicide control.
House tomatoes must be hand pollinated. This can be done by using a
paint brush and dabbing from blossom to blossom. Do not rely on any
one variety of tomato plant. Try something new each year. Place
sliced apples around your tomatoes to speed up ripening inside or
outside of the house.

The second year is a piece of cake!

For more information, refer to Harold's Helpful Hints.

To extend growing season if a frost is predicted turn on a fine mist
sprinkler over tomatoes from 10:00 p.m. till 8:00 a.m.
Late in the season remove 80 percent of all foliage. Remove all
blossoms and fruit too small to ripen. Pull up plant with fruit attached
before the first hard freeze. Hang upside down in the basement. Fruit
will continue to ripen for weeks.

4 MITIGATION STRATEGY
44 CFR Requirement 201.6(c)(3): The plan shall include a mitigation strategy that provides the
jurisdictionâs blueprint for reducing the potential losses identified in the risk assessment, based
on existing authorities, policies, programs and resources, and its ability to expand on and
improve these existing tools.

This section presents the mitigation strategy developed by the Hazard Mitigation Planning
Committee (HMPC) based on the risk assessment. The mitigation strategy was developed
through a collaborative group process and consists of goals, objectives, and mitigation actions.
The HMPC used the following definitions, which are based upon those found in FEMA
publication 386-3, Developing the Mitigation Plan (2002):
Goals are general guidelines that explain what you want to achieve. Goals are defined before
considering how to accomplish them so that they are not dependent on the means of
achievement. They are usually long-term, broad, policy-type statements.
Objectives define strategies or implementation steps to attain the identified goals and are
specific and measurable.
Mitigation Actions are specific actions that help achieve goals and objectives.

4.1 Goals and Objectives
The HMPC developed goals and objectives, during the original planning process of 2004, to
provide direction for reducing hazard-related losses in Evansville -Vanderburgh County. These
were based upon the results of the risk assessment and a review of goals from other community
plans that have had public input and review and have already been formally adopted. This
information was provided to HMPC to ensure that the Mitigation Planning Goals would be in
concert, not in conflict, with other existing community priorities.
During the plan update process, the HMPC reviewed and revised the existing goals and
objectives through a collaborative group process. The first goal of public education was
modified to also emphasize preparedness. Goals and objectives are listed below, but are not
prioritized:
Goal 1: Implement a comprehensive Public Education and Preparedness campaign
regarding the hazards posing significant risk to Evansville and Vanderburgh County.
Promote awareness of Hazards and Vulnerability among citizens, business, industry,
school systems, and government.
Provide information on Hazard Mitigation alternatives and their respective costs, benefit,
and impacts.
Ensure that the information provided is accurate and consistent

Promote hazard mitigation as a public value in recognition of its importance to the health,
safety, and welfare of the population.
Strengthen communication and coordination between public agencies, citizens, non-profit
organizations, business, industry, and school systems to create a widespread interest in
hazard mitigation.
Goal 2 Reduce exposure to hazard related losses, before and after disaster strikes
Implement a Pre-Disaster mitigation Program.
Implement a Post-Disaster mitigation Program.

Goal 3: Utilize latest technology and data in hazard mitigation activities
Maximize âLead-Timeâ provided by an all-hazards warning system.

4.2 Identification and Analysis of Mitigation Actions
44 CFR Requirement Â§201.6(c)(3)(ii): The mitigation strategy shall include a section that identifies
and analyzes a comprehensive range of specific mitigation actions and projects being considered
to reduce the effects of each hazard, with particular emphasis on new and existing buildings and
infrastructure.

To update the mitigation actions from the previously approved plan, the responsible agency
listed for each action provided a status updated as to whether the action was completed, ongoing,
or in need of revision. The HMPC used this information to identify and prioritize mitigation
actions.
The HMPC also undertook a brainstorming session to generate a set of viable additional
alternatives that would support the above goals. Each HMPC member was provided with the
following list of categories of mitigation measures:
1) Prevention: Administrative or regulatory actions or processes that influence the way land
and buildings are developed and built
2) Property protection: Actions that involve the modification of existing buildings or
structures to protect them from a hazard or remove them from the hazard area
3) Structural: Actions that involve the construction of structures to reduce the impact of hazard
4) Natural resource protection: Actions that, in addition to minimizing hazard losses, also
preserve or restore the functions of natural systems
5) Emergency services: Actions that protect people and property during and immediately after
a disaster or hazard event
6) Public education and awareness: Actions to inform and educate citizens, elected officials,
and property owners about the hazards and potential ways to mitigation them
Potential mitigation measures, within each of the six categories, were presented to the HMPC. A
facilitated discussion examined and analyzed the alternatives. Then, with an understanding of
the alternatives, the HMPC generated a list of preferred mitigation actions to be recommended.
The HMPC included all previously recommended mitigation actions in its review. Thus, this
plan puts forth existing recommendations that are still to be implemented in addition to the new
recommendations that resulted from the HMPCâs detailed Risk Assessment process. This plan
serves as an update to the existing mitigation plans by identifying the recommendations from
previous plans that have already been implemented and by reprioritizing those that remain.

4.3 Implementation of Mitigation Actions
44 CFR Requirement Â§201.6(c)(3)(ii): The mitigation strategy shall include an action strategy
describing how the actions identified in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) will be prioritized, implemented, and
administered by the local jurisdiction. Prioritization shall include a special emphasis on the extent
to which benefits are maximized according to a cost benefits review of the proposed projects and
their associated costs.

Once the old and new mitigation actions were identified, the HMPC members were provided
with decision-making criteria to prioritize the recommended actions. FEMAâs recommended
âSTAPLE/Eâ criteria set (social, technical, administrative, political, legal, economic, and
environmental criteria) was utilized in order to help decide why one recommended action might
be more important, more effective, or more likely to be implemented than another.
Mitigation actions in the 2004 plan were given priority if they were identified as short-term
projects due to cost effectiveness and available resources. Other factors for prioritization in 2004
were related to projects that were most vulnerable, have great social impact, are technically
feasible, have limited environmental impact, have favorable economic impact, for which the
administrative capabilities exist, those with potential politics, and the total expected costs.
Tables 4.1 summarizes identified actions and provides information on the hazards addressed and
plan goals achieved. The individual action items, as recommended and prioritized by the
HMPC, are presented in order of priority. Each action item includes the background
information, ideas for implementation, responsible office, potential funding, cost estimates,
benefits, and timeline for each identified action. Completed action items, as noted in table 4.1,
are presented in Appendix D.

Mitigation Action 1 â Public Awareness Program

Develop and Conduct a multi-hazard, seasonal Public Awareness Program that
provides citizens and businesses with accurate information describing the risk
and vulnerability to natural hazards, and is implemented on an annual basis.

Project Description:

Vanderburgh County is subject to several natural hazards, each of which poses
a different degree of risk and associated vulnerability. Some hazards have a
combination of attributes, including a high likelihood of occurrence, a specific
location that is likely to be affected, and proven approaches that can reduce the
impact; therefore the HMPC has recommended that specific actions be taken in
regard to these hazards.
For other hazards, where either the likelihood of occurrence is very low, the
area of likely impact cannot be specified, or there is very little that can be done
to reduce the impacts of the hazard, the HMPC has determined that the best
approach would be to raise public awareness.

Local Prioritization:

Project Description:

Generally, Stormwater Master Plans are made for sub-watersheds, and include
master drainage planning, construction, and maintenance elements. They can
also propose new development regulations and drainage utility fees to pay for
the necessary improvements. The overall intent is to allow the community to
address increasing runoff as there are increases in impervious surfaces (roofs,
sidewalks, roads, parking lots), and to plan for drainage in a comprehensive
manner so that development in one area has minimal impacts on another, either
up or downstream, minimizing future flood damage.

About Zero Waste Events
Zero Waste Events minimize harmful impacts and maximize efficiency and waste
reduction, while having a positive effect on the community. SB150 events are
opportunities to educate participants in sustainability principles and
demonstrate that South Bend is investing in a strong future.Â 
There are two overarching themes found in a successful, educational, zero waste
event.
Engagement of Participants â Events designed to engage and educate
participants will Â increase awareness of sustainability issues and behaviors
in the South Bend community.
Procurement of Goods and Services- Thoughtful procurement of goods and services
can reduce waste, limit emissions, and even benefit the local economy.Â 
Quick Start Tips
Transportation
â¢Â Â  Â Encourage and incentivize walking, bicycling, carpooling, and taking
public transit to your event.
â¢Â Â  Â Use hybrid, electric, or natural gas vehicles / machinery.
â¢Â Â  Â Consider teleconferencing or broadcasting events online.
â¢Â Â  Â Enforce a no-idle policy (weather permitting).Â 
Waste
â¢Â Â  Â Provide easy-to-use waste separation â including food waste and
compostable items, recyclable items, and trash. Clearly label trash as destined
for landfill.
â¢Â Â  Â Promote a clear recycling/composting/anti-litter message at your
event. For example,Â have emcee make frequent announcements.Â 
Printing &amp; Advertising
â¢Â Â  Â Distribute physical handouts and marketing material only to those
with true need. PostÂ and electronically distribute event guides/agendas/
programs online.Â 
â¢Â Â  Â Print materials double-sided on 100% recycled-content paper, using
vegetable-based inks. Print signs/posters/banners without a date so that they
may be reused.Â 
â¢Â Â  Â Ensure that event giveaway items are reusable and recyclable
(reusable bags, water bottles, coffee mugs, etc.) and/or locally made and/or of
sustainable materials.
Food Service
â¢Â Â  Â Offer healthy, locally grown/produced, in-season, or organic food
options and alwaysÂ include vegetarian/vegan options.
â¢Â Â  Â Select vendors that use locally sourced products and environmentally-
friendlyÂ materials.
â¢Â Â  Â Avoid single-serving containers and individually wrapped items.
â¢Â Â  Â Avoid products that cannot be recycled or composted (plastic wrap,
Styrofoam,Â plastic utensils, plastic coated cups).
Energy &amp; Water Use
â¢Â Â  Â Encourage staff to turn off and unplug electric equipment when not in
use.Â 
â¢Â Â  Â Keep doors closed when heat or air conditioning is in use.

===============================================================================
A Sustainable SB150
**** Sustainability for Our Community ****
Sustainability is an approach to planning and problem-solving that minimizes
negative environmental, economic and social impacts from the actions of the
community. This approach not only manages negative impacts, but also maximizes
the benefits in these three areas. Sustainable choices create benefits across
the City. Communities that commit to sustainability have stronger economies,
bounce back more easily after disasters, are inclusive of all types of people,
and are enjoyable places to live and work. Working together towards
sustainability will promote investment in the South Bend community, celebrate
and preserve local assets, and cultivate parks and open spaces â all values
shared by SB150.
[3bline.jpg]
**** Zero waste Events ****
Community events are an excellent opportunity to practice making sustainable
choices. SB150 events will be highly visible indicators of South Bendâs
values as a community. Zero waste events will educate the South Bend community
in sustainability principles and will send a message to the region that South
Bend is investing in a strong future.Â 
Events, ranging from meetings to festivals, impact the environment and the
surrounding community in several ways, including;
â¢Â Â  Â Transportation â traffic congestion, parking, air pollution
â¢Â Â  Â Waste âhuge quantities of disposable products andÂ food waste
â¢Â Â  Â Printing &amp; Advertising â increased paper and bannerÂ use,
promotional items
â¢Â Â  Â Food Service â lack of healthy, vegetarian, or localÂ options
â¢Â Â  Â Energy &amp; Water Use â generators, temporary lighting,Â audio
systems
With early commitment and careful planning, organizations planning SB150 events
can reduce impacts in each of these areas using the strategies and resources in
this guide.
Â 
Getting Started
Commitment and Communication
A successful zero waste event requires a clear and early commitment by the host
organization. Working closely with staff, event partners, and vendors before
the event is essential to meeting zero waste goals during the event.Â 
Strategy: Select vendors committed to sustainability practices to support
theÂ organizationâs efforts.Â 
Strategy: Prepare a written statement of commitment to zero waste events.
Connect to the organizationâs mission and values.Â 
Strategy: Work with event-planning staff to assign clear roles and
responsibilities related to zero waste activities. Â 
Communicating the host organizationâs commitment to holding a zero waste
event is essential to its success.Â 
Strategy: Share the written statement with all your staff, vendors, suppliers,
and volunteers as early as possible. Incorporate desired behaviors into event
trainings and guidelines. Emphasize the organizationâs values and goals with
all vendors.Â 
Strategy: Mention the zero waste nature of the event on all marketing
materials. Prepare participants in advance for sustainable features they may
see, and for ways that they will be asked to contribute.
Strategy: During the event, communicate the âwhat, why, howâ to help all
participants contribute to zero waste behaviors and learn the value of those
behaviors. Utilize signage, staff, or volunteers to remind attendees and
vendors of expectations.Â 
Strategy: After the event, debrief on the successes and issues with hosting a
zero waste event. Include sustainability in any post-event surveys or
evaluations.
[Zero-Waste-Event-logo.jpg]
Basic Strategies
There are two overarching themes found in a successful, educational, zero waste
event.
Engagement of Participants â Events designed to engage and educate all
participants (vendors, staff, volunteers, the press, and attendees) help ensure
the event meets its zero waste goals, and also has a lasting impact -
increasing awareness of sustainability issues and behaviors in our community.
Procurement of Goods and Services - Thoughtful procurement of goods and
services can reduce and reclaim waste, limit transportation emissions, and even
benefit the local economy.Â 
The specific opportunities to reduce impacts at SB150 events are described in
this guide in the following Opportunity Categories:
â¢Â Â  Â TransportationÂ 
â¢Â Â  Â Waste
â¢Â Â  Â Printing &amp; AdvertisingÂ 
â¢Â Â  Â Food ServiceÂ 
â¢Â Â  Â Energy &amp; Water Use
Back_to_Top
Opportunity Areas
**** Transportation ****
Travel to and around South Bend for an event will be a significant contributor
of greenhouse gases and other air pollutants.Â  With speakers, attendees, and
vendors, along with supplies and equipment, all traveling to the site, traffic
and parking congestion can also become an issue that diminishes the
participantsâ experience during the event.Â  Strategies to reduce the amount
of travel needed, to encourage alternatives to driving, and, if vehicles must
be used, to maximize fuel efficiency and reduce environmental consequences can
help address the otherwise large impacts from transportation.Â 
Reduce Travel
Strategy: Select locations that are easily accessible by a variety of
transportation options.
Strategy: Consider live teleconferences or recorded speeches for some speakers.
Strategy: Facilitate shared rides from the airport and train stations.Â 
Support Alternatives to Driving
Strategy: Provide ample details on alternative transportation (biking, walking,
and transit) in all marketing and participant materials. Â 
[transpo.jpg]
Strategy: Make biking easy by providing secured bike parking and, if possible,
changing areas during the event. Provide information on biking to the event,
such as bike maps and bike parking locations. Remind users that TRANSPO buses
can carry bikes.Â 
Strategy: Encourage people to walk by making it safe and convenient - provide
escorts, shuttles, crossing assistance, and well-lighted paths between and to/
from event areas.Â 
Strategy:Promote the use of transit. Provide TRANSPO instructions specific to
the host organizationâs event. Work with TRANSPO or other appropriate
agencies to offer additional service (like later or earlier buses, route
adjustments, or shuttles).Â 
Use Vehicles Effectively
Strategy: Use the right-sized vehicle for the job â SUVs and trucks arenât
needed for most tasks, and often even a simple golf cart or utility vehicle is
sufficient.Â  Â Â Â  Â 
Strategy: Use hybrid or electric cars or trucks, or those fueled with
compressed natural gas (CNG), biodiesel, or ethanol. For rental cars, request
alternative fuel or low-emissions options. Encourage smooth driving and
inflated tires to reduce fuel consumption.
Strategy: Avoid entering grass areas/parks with motorized vehicles to prevent
wear and damage. Park nearby and use a handcart to bring in materials.
Strategy: Prohibit engine idling by all vehicles.Â 
Strategy:Have a volunteer/staff person monitor the load-in and load-out to
ensure vehicles are complying with guidelines.
Strategy: Encourage staff and attendees to carpool.
Â [hybrid.jpg]
Back_to_Top
Waste
Public events produce a huge amount of waste. Traditionally, events rely on
disposable items which are transferred to landfills after their single use. The
âThree Rsâ â Reduce, Reuse, Recycle â are still as meaningful today as
they were decades ago. Consider the disposal of any item purchased, and plan
for recycling, to cut down on trash created at the event. Food waste composting
or a âzero-waste eventâ are great goals for organizations ready to go even
further.Â 
Smart Purchasing
Strategy: Pursue creative options for sourcing materials, equipment, or
supplies, such as borrowing, buying second-hand, or doubling up with another
event.
Strategy:Â  Reuse name tags, supplies, artwork, and decorations from previous
events. Collect name tags or badges at the end of the event for reuse or
recycling.
Strategy: Request vendors supply quotes for non-disposable, recyclable,
compostable, or otherwise sustainable materials.Â 
Strategy:Â  Discourage the use of harsh chemicals such as paints, insect
sprays, and many cleaning materials.Â 
Strategy: Avoid products that cannot be recycled or composted (plastic wrap,
Styrofoam, plastic utensils, plastic-coated cups, plastic bags, etc).Â 
Recycling and Composting
Strategy: Communicate waste reduction and anti-litter goals before the event to
all vendors and participants. Explain available options and desired behaviors
so that participants know what to expect.
[recycling_0.jpg]
Strategy: Ask vendors what recyclables, food waste, or grease waste they expect
to produce, to determine the types and volume of containers needed.Â 
Strategy: Communicate waste reduction and anti-litter goals during the event
through signage and announcements. Use visuals to demonstrate desired
behaviors. Clarify that âwasteâ or âtrashâ goes to the landfill.Â 
Strategy: Carefully select waste service providers and incorporate the selected
providerÂ early in the planning process. The right provider will advocate for
and independently manage a low-waste event. Providers unused to offering
recycling and/or composting services will need additional oversight and
support.Â 
Strategy: Provide clearly marked containers for landfill, recyclables, and
compost. Place recycling/compost bins next to trash bins for optimal usage.
Ensure bins are readily available and large enough (or emptied often enough) to
accommodate expected waste, to prevent litter and contamination of non-trash
containers. Station volunteers to educate on proper disposal of waste,
recyclables, and compostables.
Strategy: Work with your waste service provider to measure, calculate, and
celebrate waste diverted from the landfill.Â 
Â 
Printing &amp; Advertising
Many special events communications materials, such as invitations, programs,
name tags, signs, presentation materials (handouts, booklets, giant easel
notepads), can be distributed electronically and/or have reusable alternatives.
Other marketing materials, such as signs, banners, and giveaway items can be
sourced in ways that conserve resources, benefit the local economy, and protect
workers. Being selective with printing and promotional items saves time, money,
and the environment and is a reflection of the host organizationâs commitment
to reducing its impact.Â 
Paper &amp; Printing
Strategy: Distribute physical handouts and marketing material only to those
with a genuine interest or need.
Strategy: Print responsibly to manage impact - double-sided, using high
recycled-content paper certified by the Forest Stewardship Council, with
vegetable-based ink.
Strategy: Use name badges made with recycled materials. Select reusable
nametags when reasonable.Â  Â 
Strategy: Ensure there is a convenient place for handouts, name badges, and
programs to be returned or recycled.
Strategy: In group activities, seek out whiteboards and projectors instead of
flip charts.Â 
Strategy: Provide presentations electronically after an event, rather than
providing handouts.Â 
Strategy: Instead of printing and mailing, use online event registration and
email to manage invitations and RSVPs.
Marketing and Promotional Items
Strategy: Print signs, posters, and banners without a date so that they might
be reused. Source recycled and recyclable marketing materials. Â 
Strategy: Provide event guides, agendas, and programs are posted online prior
to the event or distributed electronically. Consider using a smartphone
application to allow participants to access information during the event
without having a paper copy.Â 
Strategy: Ensure that event giveaways are reusable, recyclable, and of likely
value to attendees (reusable bags, water bottles, coffee mugs, live plants,
etc.). For special gifts or favors, purchase locally-made items. Â  Â 
Strategy: Make sure all event purchases, promotional materials and giveaways
are designed to be used multiple times. Purchase items with all of the host
organizationâs events in mind.Â 
Strategy: Select T-shirts or other manufactured promotional items are made
using sustainable materials and ethical business practices.
Back_to_Top
Food Service
Food and beverages served at events provide many opportunities for zero waste
event hosts. Reducing waste, encouraging fair treatment of farm workers,
supporting local farms and businesses, choosing environmentally friendly
options, providing healthy options, and educating attendees are all benefits of
carefully managing food, beverages, and food service supplies.
[portabellomushrooms950.jpg]
Food
Strategy: Offer meal and snack options for vegetarians, vegans, and those with
health restrictions.Â 
Strategy: Seek out caterers committed to sustainable food and practices.
Maximize locally grown/produced, in-season, or organic food options.
Strategy: Buy in bulk when possible to reduce waste. Serve in bulk to avoid
single-serving containers. Avoid unnecessary packaging and plastic bags. Avoid
individually-wrapped items. Select food that minimize the need for packaging,
utensils, or other waste.Â 
Strategy: Educate attendees about the sustainable characteristics of food being
served.Â 
Strategy: Offer buffets over pre-prepared boxed lunches to reduce both food and
packaging waste. Choose smaller buffet plates and less variety of dishes to
avoid food waste.Â 
Strategy:Consider salads and cold foods instead of hot food to reduce energy
used for cooking and heating.Â 
Strategy: Choose white meat over red meat: cows and sheep contribute greenhouse
gases that other animals do not and have larger impacts on the land. If beef is
served, choose grass-fed beef, as grain-fed meat requires three times the
fossil fuel input.Â 
Strategy: Donate event leftovers (fresh, cooked, or still-packaged food) to
food banks or shelters. Create a plan and a partnership in advance â not all
non-profit organizations can take advantage of all types of leftover food.Â 
Beverages
Strategy: Avoid bottled water. Provide drinking water dispensers or pitchers of
tap water and encourage attendees to bring their own reusable bottles.
Strategy: If disposable cups are provided, ensure they are recyclable or
compostable and place appropriate bins near the water dispensers.
[fruit-Infused-water-posh-event.jpg]
Strategy: Select soft drinks with a minimum of synthetic ingredients.
Strategy: Ensure drink containers and packaging are recyclable before
purchasing.
Strategy: Serve Fair Trade, Rainforest Alliance, locally-roasted and/or organic
coffees.
Strategy: Choose Indiana, Michigan or other locally grown wine. Wines produced
organically typically have less environmental impact than traditional
winemaking.Â 
Strategy: Serve beer on draftÂ to significantly reduce waste. Borrow keg taps.
Source local beer to reduce environmental impacts of transportation andÂ 
boost the area economy.
Food Service Supplies
Strategy: Minimize the use of disposable service items (straws, cup lids,
utensils) and instead opt for durable/reusable service items (such as souvenir
cups).
Strategy: If disposable serving ware is unavoidable, consider using
biodegradable or compostable plates and ensure that appropriate bins are
available. Alternatively, specify recycled-content/recyclable service ware and
instruct participants to recycle.Â 
Strategy: Use unbleached or chlorine-free paper products (like coffee filters
and napkins).Â 
Strategy: Most venues around South Bend will provide cloth tablecloths and
napkins, real glassware, and reusable dishes and silverware when specified by
the host organization.
Strategy: For casual events, such as those in a home or church, request members
of the organization bring reusable items from home.
Energy and Water
Conserving resources has many positive environmental benefits, and can also
yield cost savings. In addition, many strategies provide educational
opportunities for attendees to learn ways to be more efficient at home, or to
see innovative energy ideas.Â 
Energy Efficiency &amp; Renewable Energy
Strategy: Choose event rooms or outdoor areas that have a lot of natural light.
Use only the light thatâs needed for the space and use energy-efficient LEDÂ 
[solarpowergen.jpg]
or induction lights.Â 
Strategy: Use simple measures like pulling the blinds closed in summer to avoid
excess heat and holding events in naturally warm areas in winter. When holding
an indoor event, keep doors and windows closed and encourage use of revolving
doors.
Strategy:Â  Task staff and volunteers with turning off and unplugging audio/
visual, computer, and other electrical equipment when not in use. Provide power
strips to easily control many pieces of energy-using equipment.Â 
Strategy: Educate attendees on energy-saving features of the selected venue.Â 
Strategy: Use biofuel generators instead of diesel or gas. Even better, replace
generators with solar panels to power equipment or lighting as a visible
commitment to a zero waste event.Â 
Water
Strategy: Choose locations for outdoor events that feature landscaping that
does not require much watering.Â 
Strategy: Educate attendees on water-saving features of the selected venue.Â 
Strategy: Protect the river, streams, and storm sewers from trash and runoff
from the event site.Â 
Conclusion
Zero waste events demonstrate a commitment to protecting the environment,
growing the economy, and ensuring social equity. Planning a zero waste event as
part of SB150 reflects these values, shared by the host organization and the
South Bend community as a whole.
This guide provides a basic overview of opportunities for a sustainable SB150
celebration. For assistance with any specific zero waste event topic, contact
the City of South Bend Office of Sustainability at
sustainability@southbendin.gov or 574.235.5910. The Office of Sustainability is
committed to supporting SB150 community partners.Â

2000 Annual Budget
Department of Capital Asset Management

Mission Statement:
In order to promote a competitive city with safe streets, strong neighborhoods
and a thriving economy, we work in partnership with all members of the
community to provide effective wastewater, transportation, stormwater and
technological solutions which improve the quality of life for our residents and
visitors.

Organizational Policy:
The Department of Capital Asset Management (DCAM) is charged with the
responsibility of overseeing the cityâs capital improvements program, traffic and
access control, and the lighting of all streets, roads, bridges, and respective right
of ways in Marion County, with two exceptions:
â¢

All interstate routes and state and U.S. routes, outside of I-465, which are
all the responsibility of the Indiana Department of Transportation.

â¢

Local streets within other incorporated cities and towns in Marion County
(including Beech Grove, Lawrence, Speedway, and Southport).

DCAM is also responsible for the construction and reconstruction of wastewater
and stormwater infrastructure within the Sanitary District.
The Department is comprised of three divisions:
â¢

Asset Management - responsible for developing, implementing and
managing an asset management plan for capital and maintenance, of all
sewers, roads, curbs and sidewalks, drainage, advance wastewater treatment
plants, and respective right-of-ways. Asset Management is also responsible
for the development, implementation, and management of solid waste and
environmental programs.

â¢

Finance and Administration - responsible for the operating sections of the
department. The division includes the Director, Finance team, Public
Information team, Strategic Planning/Applied Technology team and the
Mobility Management team.

â¢

Permits - responsible for the review and issuance of permits for all
construction and access control in and adjoining the cityâs infrastructure
and for ensuring compliance with the cityâs code and specifications and
standards for such work.

Significant Events:
In an agreement made with officials from both the City of Indianapolis, and the
Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT), the City will take over the last
three remaining segments of state and U.S. highway routes within I-465. This
agreement will provide state and federal funds and additional or committed road
improvements from INDOT for these streets over the next five years. All
monies will be used to upgrade and improve these roads which run through
neighborhoods and all across the city. The relinquishment agreement will turn
over nearly 119 lane-miles of U.S. and State highway routes and 89 additional
traffic signals to the City of Indianapolis.
During 1999, the Department of Capital Asset Management continued to refine
its relationship with the Department of Public Works. The Department of
Capital Asset Management is responsible for evaluating, planning, and
implementing major improvements to the cityâs streets, sewers, bridges, and
drainage facilities. The Department of Public Works handles the daily
operational and maintenance duties--such as snow removal, pothole repairs and
minor drainage repair, placing pavement markings, sign manufacturing and
installation, repairing and maintaining traffic control devices and maintaining
drainage structures.

City of Indianapolis

2000 Annual Budget
Department of Capital Asset Management

The Department of Capital Asset Management plays a vital role in
neighborhood and economic development by maintaining and upgrading assets
throughout the city. The Department continuously evaluates and makes
improvements designed to facilitate the safe movement of people and products.
For DCAM, 1999 was again an exciting and successful year. Working in
concert with the Department of Public Works, the two agenciesâ efficient service
to taxpayers helped to fulfill the Cityâs vision of safer streets, stronger
neighborhoods, and a thriving economy.
The Capital Improvement Program has led to the employment of thousands of
citizens and has helped infuse our thriving economy with unprecedented
opportunities. Furthermore, the program has had a great impact on enhancing
our Cityâs neighborhoods, and encouraging neighborhood unity, strength and
pride as citizens participate in the process of determining what work should be
done.
The street resurfacing program operated on schedule throughout 1999 and
improved 178 lane miles of roadway. Infrastructure projects like our street
resurfacing program contribute to our thriving economy in many ways. By
building and maintaining our roads and sewers, we keep commerce moving and
improve the quality of life in our neighborhoods. Other infrastructure successes
include the repair and/or replacement of 13 miles of curbs and sidewalks.

New Initiatives:
The Department of Capital Asset Management Permit Division, working with
the Department of Metropolitan Development, continues to re-engineer the
organization and service delivery methods. By focusing on a âone-stop
shoppingâ opportunity for those who require city construction and development
permits, customers can save time and have their questions answered in one
office. The Permits Division has successfully operated a second permits counter
at the DCAM office at 604 North Sherman Drive, since 1998. The second
location gives contractors and citizens an alternative to the City-County

Building offices on the 21st floor, and also offers the added convenience of free
parking. The combined Permits Division is now using a common database of
information and has begun to utilize the Geographic Information System to a
greater degree. The Permits Division also now offers on-line services to the
citizens through the Cityâs website at indygov.org. This technology has
enhanced access to information and has expedited permit application and
issuance.
The Department announced an aggressive plan to upgrade the cityâs traffic
signal systems. Phase I of the five year, $12 million plan, which was completed
during the summer of 1998, included upgrading 96 traffic signals in the
downtown area. Phase II and III will got underway in 1998 with completion in
1999, and included improvements at an additional 120 traffic signals. A
consulting team was hired in 1999 to assist in the enhancement of the operation
of our existing signal systems. Included in this is the monitoring of
approximately 35 systems throughout the county and including the new
Regional Center Signal System. The Department will also be developing and
implementing new signal timing plans for several street segments around the
county and will also focus on improving traffic flow through better
synchronization and the use of new technologies. These efforts will continue
through 2000.
In April, the Department announced the WaterWise public education program.
This program is part of a 5-year, $100-million plan thatâs currently underway to
improve local stream quality in Indianapolis. The cityâs efforts include an
intense focus over the next five years on combined sewer overflows (CSOs) and
water quality improvements on White River, Fall Creek and Pogues Run. More
than $163 million has already been invested since 1992 in upgrading the cityâs
sanitary sewer system and wastewater treatment plants. While the Department is
developing its long-term control plan strategy to deal with water quality issues,
it will implement these short-term goals to make significant improvements in
water quality on these three streams.

Department of Capital Asset Management

Year 2000 will continue with an aggressive Capital Improvement Program. It
remains the goal of the City and DCAM to maximize available revenue for the
greatest budget impact and service to the public. These initiatives will help
Indianapolis remain competitive with our neighboring communities by making
sure that it is structurally and economically sound for the 21st Century.
The GIS Group and the Indygov team are also working on a number of new
DCAM projects including:
1.

Capital Improvement Projects (CIP) Inventory - A program has been
developed that will allow the DCAM Project Managers to enter in CIP areas
and link the database information to these areas. This information will be
available in the GIS for other departmental users to view. The CIP
information will also provide the GIS team in entering newly developed site
information.

2.

The GIS Group is developing an application to aid in the ADA Ramp
Inventory. Data will continue to be gathered in the same manner, but the
new system provides an automated interface for data entry and will allow
for a common database for the ADA Ramp information.

3.

The GIS Group is working with the stormwater staff to update the GIS
stormwater asset. A Request for Proposal (RFP) is being developed to have
a vendor update information for the storm sewer and associated assets.

4.

GIS Web Viewer Initiative - The GIS Group is developing tools to provide
GIS data user over the Intranet and Internet. Specific information,
including the CIP areas and street closure information, will be made
available in a read-only mode to the public via the Indygov.org GIS web
site.

Policy and Outcome Description:

INTERNAL SUPPORT. The department provides financial and managerial
support to its divisions.
Administration
To facilitate and coordinate the implementation of cross-divisional activities
which provide internal services to the operation division within the department.
SAFE STREETS. To provide a safe environment where citizens and visitors
can walk the streets and drive their cars without fear. To protect the rights and
property of all citizens and businesses through the enforcement of applicable
laws.

STRONG NEIGHBORHOODS. To empower citizens through active
involvement in directing city services (parks, zoning, sewers, liquor licensing,
etc.) to improve their neighborhoods.
Neighborhood Empowerment
The department enables citizens to work with the City to develop their
neighborhoods physically, socially, and economically.
THRIVING ECONOMY. To attract and maintain businesses to strengthen the
economy and keep unemployment low.

Efficient Traffic Flow

Maintaining A Sound Infrastructure

Safe travel on well-constructed and maintained streets is of importance to our
citizens and the Indianapolis business community. DCAM will continue to
preserve and rehabilitate the existing infrastructure through revenues from state
sources and parking management operations. DCAM also manages traffic
congestion, traffic signal synchronization and intersection improvements.

The City is making extensive efforts to extend the life of the existing
infrastructure. Major road widening projects will be fewer than in past
programs. The City continues working with consultants to develop a Pavement
Management System and other infrastructure management systems as a basis for
decisions regarding investing limited financial resources. Maintaining a sound
infrastructure supports the cityâs vision for safe streets and a thriving economy.

Safe Roads and Sidewalks
Public Mass Transit
There are features of the Transportation system that have dual roles of providing
efficient and aesthetically pleasing roadways for motorists, while providing the
same amenities for pedestrians, joggers, cyclists and other non-vehicular
travelers.

Efficient and effective public transportation services are being pursued through
improvements in routing scheduling, quality control, financial analysis and
oversight and enhancements in customer information and promotion.

City of Indianapolis

2000 Annual Budget
Department of Capital Asset Management

By taking a system-wide view of the transit system and service in Indianapolis,
our goal is to usher in the 21st Century with an efficient and effective means of
transportation for the citizens and visitors of this community.

2000 Annual Budget
Department of Capital Asset Management
Administration and Finance Division

Mission Statement:
The Finance and Administration Division provides for the Departmentâs
administrative, and financial needs; it guides and supports individual divisions
in administrative and financial matters.

Organizational Policy:
The Finance and Administration budget includes the Directorâs Office and the
following sections with their respective functions:
â¢
â¢
â¢
â¢
â¢

Administrative Services - Staff development, inventory, property and fleet
management.
Financial Services - budgeting, payroll, accounts payable.
Public Affairs - media relations and public information opportunities.
Strategic Planning/ Applied Technology - strategic planning for innovative
use of technology.
Mobility Management - coordination of transit services and carpooling
services.

Significant Events:
DCAM continues to be a major influence in the deployment of Geographic
Information System (GIS) technology at the City of Indianapolis. This
technology is being deployed to over 75 desktop systems and field operations
users within the department to assist in decision making. The goal is to
integrate this technology into the Cityâs normal workflow. This is particularly
true in the Asset Planning and Permits Division. DCAM is incorporating GIS
to reduce the amount of paper used in the submittal, review, and acceptance of
Permits. It is anticipated that the digitization and automation of the Permitting

Process will reduce the amount of time to issue a permit and provide faster and
more accurate information to DCAM staff members that are involved in the
process. Efforts are underway to assist contractors in the digital submittal of
applications and site plans. .
The Cityâs use of the Internet has grown and improved tremendously over the
past year. The IndyGov team is the group largely responsible for this success.
The mission of the IndyGov team is to provide online access to local government
information and services using the Internet. IndyGov uses leading-edge Internet
techniques to deliver a variety of functions - citizens can view and apply for
permits online; locate parks, golf courses and recycling sites near them; access
parking tickets online; and a wide range of other services.
The Office of Mobility Management (OMM) was created in 1996. Its purpose is
to take a system-wide view of the transit system in Indianapolis. Its primary
funding source is the Indiana Department of Transportationâs (INDOT) Public
Mass Transportation Fund (PMTF). The PMTF is made up of state sales tax
dollars and is distributed yearly according to a formula determined by INDOT.
The OMMâs four primary functions are (1) routing and scheduling; (2) quality
control; (3) financial analysis and oversight; and (4) customer information,
marketing and promotion. The office of Mobility Management is always
looking at ways to improve the transit system in Indianapolis for the 21st
Century as an efficient and effective means of transportation for the citizens of
this community.
The Public Transit Awareness and Education Program is being developed to
inform the public about the importance of public transit to our community and
how it can play a part in improving air quality. The program has three main
goals which are: (1) to raise awareness of the IndyGo public transportation
system and illustrate its benefits to the community; (2) to educate citizens and
businesses about how to access public transportation and its operations; and (3)

City of Indianapolis

2000 Annual Budget
Department of Capital Asset Management
Administration and Finance Division

to improve Central Indianaâs air quality. This program receives federal
Congestion Management and Air Quality (CMAQ) funding.
DCAM shares in the responsibility for the Cityâs compliance with the
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements. This is a broad charge
including physical compliance, employment, and policies and programs. The
largest quantifiable responsibility for any city is compliance with the ADA
Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG). These rules cover everything from building
features, to sidewalks and curb ramps. Through the Directorâs office, DCAM
facilitates the infrastructure compliance process. There are currently two critical
initiatives underway for infrastructure. The first is a countywide curb ramp
inventory. The inventory indicates every location where a curb ramp exists and
its status in relation to ADAAG requirements, or the lack of a ramp. This
information is being placed on IMAGIS, which is an invaluable tool in defining
where the greatest need for ramps exist. The other project involves the manner
in which we respond to the request of citizens with disabilities for curb ramps,
sidewalks, and so on. In these and other instances, DCAM ensures the
enactment of necessary work and appropriate policies.
The Public Affairs section will continue promotional efforts surrounding the
Capital Improvement Program and other departmental efforts. The Public
Affairs group is also finding the Internet an effective means of communicating
with the public.
The Public Information Section continues to utilize new technology to more
effectively communicate with its customers. Standard practices now include the
use of better and different communication methodsâincluding targeted
mailings, electronic media and alternative media and neighborhood
communication vehiclesâto improve interaction on key infrastructure projects.
This section is also evaluating its public meeting process, focusing on new
technology to improve meeting notice and the quality of presentations.

Gathering input on infrastructure projects is key for public support and is a
cornerstone to the overall success of the Capital Improvements Program. In the
last several years, the public affairs section has hosted a record number of public
meetings to discuss construction projects.
For most projects, at least three meetings are held to gather input from the
public. The first meeting occurs when the project is in the scoping phase. At
this point, when the project is in its infancy, various options for a specific public
improvement (new bridge, street reconstruction, sewer improvements, etc.) are
discussed with neighborhood residents. Through upgrades, the section is better
able to assemble mailing lists for public meetings and offer on-line help to the
public regarding questions about construction projects. The section also helps
neighborhood organizations disseminate construction information to their
members.
A second meeting takes place once a preliminary design is complete. The public
reviews maps that include scale drawings of the improvement. Residents again
have the opportunity to ask questions about the projectâs design and suggest
improvements.
Finally, a pre-construction meeting is held prior to the groundbreaking of the
project. This meeting gives people an opportunity to understand exactly how the
construction will affect them and what the timetables are for the work. They can
ask questions directly to the contractor who is doing the work and meet the City
staff who will oversee the projectâs construction.
Each of these meetings plays a key role in ensuring that the publicâs money is
spent prudently and that each individualâs comments are taken into full
consideration throughout the life of the project.
In addition, the public affairs office issues press releases to update the
community on the progress of major construction projects. The unit also keeps

City of Indianapolis

2000 Annual Budget
Department of Capital Asset Management
Administration and Finance Division

tabs on all street and sewer projects and distributes weekly construction updates
to public safety organizations, the media and the general public.
The section also plans and presents news conferences (including
groundbreakings and ribbon-cuttings) related to the CIP. These events are
important in bringing attention to new projects that will help the cityâs
neighborhoods and business communities.

New Initiatives:
â¢

With a greater emphasis on pursing and applying technical solutions,
DCAM has become heavily involved in technology issues as they relate to
the Permitting and Asset Management functions. Within the Permits
Division, there is a goal to develop a paperless process. This aggressive
project within permits will require the evaluation of the current software
and the integration of related, but separate databases. Integration with the
zoning/variance database is proposed. An evaluation and selection of
Mobile Data Terminal, (MDT) will need to be conducted. The MDTâs will
be used by the inspectors and other field personnel associated with the
Permits Division. At the completion of this project, Indianapolis will
possess the state of the art electronic permitting operation. The key
elements of the proposed system will be the accessibility and accuracy of the
data.

â¢

The Asset Management Division is currently requiring contract engineering
and construction firms to submit design drawings and as built documents in
digitized format. This facilitates the updating of the IMAGIS database.
Again, the key benefit is more accurate and timely data to those in deed of
this type of information.

â¢

IndyGov will continue to roll out innovative applications that enable
citizens to transact business with the city via the Internet and provide them
with direct contact to departments and public officials. In the near future,
IndyGov users will be able to access the Cityâs GIS system via the IndyGov
website.

2000 Annual Budget
Department of Capital Asset Management
Asset Management Division
Outcome and Combined Activities Description:

EFFICIENT TRAFFIC FLOW. Safe travel on city streets is of major
importance to our citizens and the Indianapolis business community. The
Department of Capital Asset Management manages traffic congestion and
intersection capacity problems through new signal systems, modernization of
existing systems, traffic synchronization and spot intersection improvements.

Traffic Control
â¢

Downtown Traffic Management. Through Indianapolis Downtown, Inc.
DCAM contributes to our thriving economy by producing a safe, friendly,
and aesthetically pleasing environment.

SAFE ROADS AND SIDEWALKS There are features of the Transportation
system that have dual roles of providing efficient and aesthetically pleasing
roadways for motorists, while providing the same amenities for pedestrians,
joggers, cyclists and other non-vehicular travelers.

MAINTAINING A SOUND INFRASTRUCTURE. The City focuses on
activities that extend the life of the existing infrastructure. Major emphasis will
be on bridgework with significant emphasis also on intersection improvements.
The City continues working with consultants to develop a Pavement
Management System, a Basin Masterplan, a Barrett Law Masterplan, a Storm
Water Masterplan and other infrastructure management systems as a basis for
decisions regarding investing limited financial resources. Maintaining a sound
infrastructure supports the Cityâs vision for safe streets and a thriving economy.
For citizens and visitors utilizing the renewed downtown, the Department of
Capital Asset Management, in conjunction with the Indianapolis Downtown,
Inc., supports programs that insure a safe, friendly, aesthetically pleasing
environment. Programs and services include, but are not limited to, bike patrol,
enforcement services and notices to citizens of traffic and parking related
matters. Specifically, extension of existing infrastructure life encourages
commerce and will be obtained through performance of the following activities:

Effective Storm & Sanitary Sewers
â¢

Street Lighting
DCAM manages the energy consumption from the streetlights within the Cityâs
jurisdiction. The lighting is vital to public safety and contributes to our thriving
economy by reducing the amount of property damage and injury that would
occur without them.

Sanitation Infrastructure Construction / Maintenance. Construction of
new sewers is important to the health of our community. As our city
expands, the need for adequate sewer systems grows. Properly maintained
storm and sanitary sewer facilities also contribute to the publicâs health and
safety. The effective storm and sanitary improvements include the repair
and replacement of manholes, sanitary sewers, laterals and siphons. In
addition, there are operational and capacity projects at the Advanced

City of Indianapolis

2000 Annual Budget
Department of Capital Asset Management
Asset Management Division

Wastewater Treatment (AWT) Plants, corrective measures for the combined
sewers and
lift station upgrades. The City began development of a comprehensive
combined sewer overflow (CSO) plan for implementation starting in late
1998 and early 1999. The first phase of the CSO project was initiated
during 1999. This work included improvements to Fall Creek, Pogues Run
and portions of White River. Other improvements are planned to be
completed early in 2000.
Flood Control
â¢

Flood Infrastructure Improvements. The Asset Management Division
will plan and design flood control projects to improve the efficiency of
storm water conveyance, thereby reducing the threat of flood damage.
Flood control improvements include channel work, repair and replacement
of the Cityâs levees/dams and culverts. Roadside and area drainage projects
consisting of storm sewer repair and replacements are also proposed.

Street Improvements
â¢

Street Improvements. As our city grows, streets need to be improved to
accommodate the increased traffic flow. Without such improvements our
city will not be able to compete with other communities for new business
and residents--essential elements for a thriving economy. Resurfacing is
also important to the health of our cityâs infrastructure. Smooth streets
contribute to the economic well being of our community by providing
surfaces that are easily maneuverable and safe for commerce, in addition to
driving down maintenance costs for pothole patching and street repair.

â¢

Bridge Improvements. Rehabilitating and replacing older bridges is key to
a safe and efficient transportation network.

â¢

Traffic Sign/Signal Improvements. Safe vehicular and pedestrian travel,
being of major importance to our citizens and the business community,
drives the Asset Management Divisionâs efforts for traffic related
improvements. Asset Management manages traffic congestion and

intersection capacity problems through new signals systems, modernizing
existing systems, traffic synchronization and spot intersection
improvements.
Solid Waste Infrastructure Improvements
â¢

The Department of Capital Asset Management contracts with the
Department of Public Works for removing, drying, and disposing of sludge
from the lagoons at the Advanced Wastewater Treatment plants. Safely
disposing of solid wastes contributes to the health and safety of our
community.

2000 Annual Budget
Department of Capital Asset Management
Division of Permits

Mission Statement:
The Division of Permits issues permits in compliance with land use,
development, infrastructure and building regulations and utilizes combined
inspections to enforce those regulations in order to promote responsible
development.

â¢
â¢

Organizational Policy:
The Division of Permits is staffed from employees by, directed by, and receives
budget support from two departments: the Department of Capital Asset
Management and the Department of Metropolitan Development.
The Division of Permits is organized into three functional areas:
Administration, Permits, and Inspections.
â¢

Administration
Administration staff supports all activities of the Division by providing
overall policy direction and management, program administration and
development, and budget and personnel management.

â¢

Permits
Permits staff works with citizens on a daily basis to provide quality service
in contractor licensing, registrations, issuing permits and responding to
requests for information. Permit staff licenses and registers contractors,
issues permits in compliance with applicable regulations, and manages
records and databases for all permitting files. In addition, the addressing
staff assigns all street names and addresses to new or replatted
developments in the County. The databases maintained by this section are
shared with the Metropolitan Emergency Communications Agency (MECA)
as the basis for Marion Countyâs Emergency 911 system.

Inspections
Inspection staff inspects properties to ensure safety and compliance with
local building codes and related ordinances. All inspectors and Project
Managers have been combined into geographic (Geo) teams and crosstrained so that more inspections can be done per site visit. The
inspectors in the inspection group do building inspections, zoning
inspections, rehab inspections, infrastructure inspections and right-of-way
inspections. This staff continues to focus enforcement on non-licensed
contractors and persons performing activities without permits.

Significant Events:
â¢

Code Compliance Pilot Project
A team of 10 inspectors from Health and Hospital and the Cityâs Permit
Division have been assigned exclusively to resolve code violations in the
NESCO area. During the first 3 months (March through May 1999) of the
pilot project over 2,200 initial inspections were completed and 1,600
violations resolved. The inspection team also works with IPD, IFD, DPW,
and the Indianapolis Housing Agency to resolve issues that go beyond the
scope of code enforcement but also affect the quality of life in the NESCO
neighborhood.

â¢

Number of Permits Issued
30,025 permits were issued during the first six months of 1999 compared to
27,598 for the same period of 1998. Increased efficiencies in the permitting
process have decreased the average time a customer waits from 47 minutes
in June of 1998 to 7 minutes in June of 1999.

â¢

Technology Changes
Computers have been upgraded and now include a GIS data viewer. Paper
documents are being scanned and will become available electronically. The
Tidemark PermitPlan system is in the process of being converted and

City of Indianapolis

2000 Annual Budget
Department of Capital Asset Management
Division of Permits

upgraded to a newer version which will allow the Division to implement a
mobile data field inspection system.
â¢ Y2K Response
Y2K issues were identified in the Contractor Licensing mainframe database and
the PermitPlan software. The Contractor Licensing database has been converted
to a web application that resolved those issues. The Version 2.5 upgrade of
PermitPlan has been certified Y2K compliant. Internal systems and databases
are being checked and will be confirmed Y2K compliant by October 1999.
Permitting staff is participating in a multi agency effort to develop a
contingency plan to assist in covering a major emergency should it occur.

New Initiatives:
â¢

Automated Document Management
The Divisionâs objective is to convert its documents into a digital format
acceptable for input into the document management system and reduce the
amount of time required to do permits research and reviews. Several
additional record sets have been targeted for scanning in 2000. In addition,
the division will pursue the opportunity for accepting digital submittals.

â¢

Tidemark
PermitPlan v2.5 will be implemented. This will enable the Division to
build new cases and add new fields of information without requiring outside
assistance. It will also provide the capacity to be accessed from remote
locations by mobile data units for field inspections. This software has been
certified to be year 2000 compliant.

â¢

M-Track
InspectTrack Mobile Data Field Inspection System will be implemented.
This will enable inspectors to interface with the City of Indianapolis
computer systems and improve operating efficiencies from field inspection
sites. This software has been certified to be year 2000 compliant.

â¢

Internet Permitting

The Division will continue to put more permits and information on-line.
On-line permit research has proven successful. Right-of-way and electrical
permits can be applied for on the Internet. Heating and cooling and
plumbing permits will be available on the Internet in 2000.

INTRODUCTION

This chapter provides an outline of the discovery
phase of the master plan process where the existing
conditions and policies of the City were analyzed.
Specific tasks within this phase include:
â¢ Existing Studies Review
â¢ Community Survey
â¢ Public Input Meetings
â¢ Existing Conditions Inventory

The review of existing documents and studies was
conducted to gather information already gathered in
previous projects to inform the master plan process.
A summary of the key documents and how the
elements from these documents directly relate to the
Bicycle and Pedestrian Master Plan is included below.
City of Richmond Comprehensive Plan (2006)
The Comprehensive Plan was adopted in 2006. The
vision for the city included becoming recognized as
a premier Midwestern city destination supported by
its strong business environment, focus on education,
culture and historically rich neighborhoods. The City
of Richmond will reach its premier presence through
its dedication to sustainable, efficient, and logical
practices in land-planning, downtown development
and transportation.
Goals and objectives from the Comprehensive Plan
directly related to the Bicycle and Pedestrian Master
Plan include:
â¢ System-wide
- The city will develop a balanced
transportation system including a completed
motorized and non-motorized network.
- The network of public rights-of-way and
easements that create travel corridors are
the primary infrastructure for all modes and
will be managed and expanded in a manner
that preserves or improves the capacity and
efficiency of all modes.

FACILITIES GUIDE

â¢

- Develop traffic calming measures to reduce
speeding and discourage through traffic on
local streets.
â¢

Safety
- Improve safety at locations where safety is
deficient, striving to design solutions that are
most consistent with Richmondâs city character.
- Provide and design for pedestrian safety, in the
form of well-defined crosswalks and safe,
identifiable access to trails and pathways.

Integrated Design
- Design all transportation facilities to contribute
to a positive and attractive visual image and
the desired community character.
- Include streetscape designs that improve the
physical appearance of roadways within the
city.

INTRODUCTION

Existing Conditions

- Develop and implement design standards that
require new development to provide sidewalks
and/or pedestrian and bicycle paths.
â¢

Multimodal Strategies
- Create an interconnected street system that
facilitates safe travel throughout the city for
pedestrians, bicyclists and automobiles.
- Promote the greater use of alternatives to
single-occupancy automobile travel with the
objective of limiting the extent and duration of
congestion.

â¢

Congestion Management
- The city will increase the efficiency of travel,
promote innovative strategies and implement
travel demand strategies to limit the increase
of congestion.

Unified Development Ordinance (2010)
The Unified Development Ordinance was developed
to help guide the growth and development of
the City in accordance with the City of Richmond
Comprehensive Plan. The UDO ensures that
improvements made within the City Limits adhere to a
level of standard to preserve the desired character
for the community. Policy standards directly related
to pedestrian transportation in the UDO include:
â¢ Public Sidewalks
- Public sidewalks shall be required along the
edge of the right-of-way, except when the
Zoning Administrator determines the
development is agricultural in nature or the
nearest existing public sidewalk or trail is
greater than 500 feet from the subject site.

â¢

Streets and Sidewalks
- The intent of the City is to take ownership of
streets and sidewalks located within the rightsof-way that have been constructed to meet
or exceed the City of Richmondâs Construction
Standards.

â¢

Applicability
- Developments shall integrate an interior and
exterior pedestrian network comprised of
concrete sidewalks and/or asphalt side paths
for pedestrian transportation and recreation.
This network shall consist of sidewalks
along street frontages and side paths between
developments and public destinations (e.g.
schools, parks, hospitals), nearby trails, other
developments and undeveloped properties.

National Register of Historic Places
The National Register of Historic Places for Richmond
includes sixty-two buildings, forty-seven of which
are contributing to historic preservation. The City
of Richmondâs downtown proudly adds a significant
chapter to the historical records of Indiana. With a
ratio of 3:1 buildings incorporating themselves into
a preservation program along with the excellent
current condition of nearly all buildings, it is evident
that the City of Richmond takes pride in its historical
artifacts. Like many downtowns, the City of Richmond
historically housed many functions from specialty
stores, department stores, financial institutions, a
theater, hotel and homes of many influential figures
during the early Indiana days, especially involving
industry and invention.

Cardinal Greenway
The 62 mile stretch of Cardinal Greenway passes
through Gas City and Muncie on its way from Marion
County to the terminus in Richmond. Approximately
4 miles of the Cardinal Greenway are located in
Richmond.The Cardinal Greenway is a heavily used
corridor and has been extremely successful as a rail
to trail conversion.

of the Railroad district came from key investments
by stakeholders in the late 1800s which prepared
Richmond to keep pace with the booming railway
industry of the time. The Railroad Station District is
in excellent condition and just five blocks north of
historic Downtown Richmond.

PUBLIC INPUT

In addition to the Community Survey, public meetings
were conducted to gather input from citizens. All
of the public meetings were well attended and
included a broad sample of residents from within the
community with different interests in the bicycle and
pedestrian network.
The first public meetings were held on February 11
of 2015 to present existing conditions to the public.
This open house style meeting incorporated multiple
opportunities for input from the public concerning
existing conditions and perceptions of the bicycle
and pedestrian system. Maps were utilized to allow
people to rate current facilities, list desired routes
and facilities and locate key destination points. Two
Open House meetings were held, one during the
work day and one in the evening to allow flexibility
and increase attendance.
The second round of public meetings were held
on March 11, 2015. These meetings were also
conducted in an open house format with one
occurring during the work day and one in the
evening. Map exercises were used to present
proposed routes to the public. Feedback included
rating the routes in terms of importance, identifying
missed destinations, and noting facilities that were not
as important in the short term. The input gathered
during these public meetings was valuable in not only
determining were the routes should go and what
type of facilities should be incorporated but also to
help determine the demand for facilities providing
priorities as determined by the community.
Advisory Committee meetings were also conducted
to better understand the current system and policies.
Recommendations were reviewed with the Committee
to gather specific input from a group of citizens
who have been active in the progress of the current
bicycle and pedestrian network.
The maps utilized during the Community Meetings
with the comments received during thsoe meetings
are included in Appendix B.

LAND USE

Not unlike many communities which have experienced
rapid growth in population in the past twenty
years, Richmond has land use patterns which do not
promote bicycling and walking from neighborhood
to neighborhood and to destinations. The general
nature of suburban development does not promote
connections between neighborhoods and in Richmond,
does not typically include the construction of
sidewalks or bike trails/paths. The rural land use
patterns reaching out into the areas of the county
further detract from the use of bikes and walking
for reaching destinations with narrow roads and
distances which make traveling by bicycle of foot
challenging for all but the most dedicated riders and
walkers.
The more dense land uses within the downtown and
the shopping corridors along Main Street, Chester
Boulevard, and US Route 40 are more conducive to
biking and walking as a means of travel to reach
destinations. These areas are primarily commercial
with residential areas directly adjacent to the
commercial areas. The location of schools within the
neighborhoods create short trips between homes and
schools, however, the facilities needed to get people
between these destinations are often absent. The
land use patterns within Richmond reflect the same
patterns seen across many towns and cities within the
region which were built around the automobile as the
only means of transportation.

EXISTING DESTINATIONS

The underlying purpose of the bicycle and pedestrian
network is to connect people to destinations. There
are many destinations that are desirable to travel
to on a daily basis. Typically, the starting point for
most trips is the home. Connections are made to
work, school, run errands, visit parks and places of
entertainment. The bicycle and pedestrian network is
designed to connect neighborhoods with all of these
key destinations.
There are numerous destinations within the study
area. These include: major retail areas, employment
centers, government center, schools, parks and
libraries. In addition, there are regional destinations
that must be considered for connections within the
system such as Cope Environmental Center and the
Cardinal Greenway.

Major Retail Areas: Major retail areas are found
within the downtown area and along US Route 40.

Additional retail areas and industrial land use are
located along 5th Street and Industrial Boulevard.

Employment Centers: The various retail
centers and industrial areas of Richmond serve
as employment centers for many residents. These
areas include industrial parks on Industries Road
and Industrial Boulevard. They also include
the commercial areas mentioned along Chester
Boulevard, Main Street and US 40. The employment
centers become key destinations for the bicycle and
pedestrian network to serve commuters.
Government Centers: The Government Center
is located on Main Street directly adjacent to the
downtown area of Richmond and with close proximity
to the Cardinal Greenway. The planned park at 7th
Street will further continue the civic efforts located
within the core of the downtown.

Schools: Richmond has six institutions of higher
learning including four colleges and two seminaries.
The colleges include: Indiana University East, Earlham
College, Ivy Tech Community College of Indiana and
Purdue University School of Technology. The two
seminaries include Earlham School of Religion and
Bethany Theological Seminary.
Richmond Community Schools includes Richmond
High School, three intermediate schools, and six
elementary schools. These schools as well as private
schools are shown on the Inventory Map, Figure 2.
Richmond High School includes the Richmond Art
Museum and the Civic Hall Performing Arts Center.
Tiernan Center, also located with the Richmond
High School campus is the 5th largest high school
gymnasium in the nation.

Parks: Parks and recreation facilities in Richmond
are managed by the Richmond Parks and Recreation
Department. The parks within the City are a great
source of pride for the community and are heavily
used throughout the year. Richmond has a well
developed parks system with many recreational
opportunities from organized events to hikes through
natural areas with wildlife and waterfalls. Glen
Miller Park is one of the most heavily used parks and
includes walking trails, playgrounds and picnic areas.
Many festivals and activities are programmed
throughout the year utilizing the existing parks
including the Egg Hunt at McBride, Family Earth

Day Celebration, Neighborhood Movies, Back to
School Splash Blast, Movies in the Glen, Halloween
Howl, and the Celebration of Lights to name a few.
In addition, many organized walks, runs and group
rides are programmed throughout the year by the
department.

Library: The Morrison-Reeves Library is located in
downtown on 6th Street. The library is an active
part of the community and includes several programs
which attract residents of all ages to the facility.
BICYCLE AND PEDESTRIAN FACILITY INVENTORY
The existing network of pedestrian and bicycle
facilities are shown on the Inventory Map, Figure 2.
The transportation system serves as the baseline for
bicycle and pedestrian travel in Richmond. Many of
the downtown streets include sidewalks on both sides
of the streets. The suburban development on the
edges of the city do not typically have sidewalks or
accommodations for bicyclists. Some of the slower
speeds of neighborhood streets lead to a general

feeling of comfort for most pedestrians and bicyclist
when traveling within the subdivisions but traveling
between neighborhoods or attempting to reach the
downtown and many of the shopping areas by bike
or foot is not currently bike and pedestrian friendly.
In the older parts of Richmond, mostly located near
the downtown area, some of the existing facilities
need improvements to upgrade to current standards.
Sidewalks are sometimes narrow and do not meet
ADA guidelines for minimum standards.
Richmond has made great strides with implementing
bicycle and pedestrian facilities. The Cardinal
Greenway has acted as a catalyst for the
development of additional greenways, bicycle
and pedestrian facilities. However, the lack of
connections between trails and greenways limit the
use of the trails. The gaps in the system require many
bicycle and pedestrian trips to begin with the use of
an automobile. Completing the system by connecting
these gaps will provide opportunities for residents to
reach their destinations without the use of a car.

INVENTORY NORTHWEST QUADRANT

The Northwest area of the study area is
characterized primarily by industrial and rural
land uses. There are waterways traveling across
the area which could provide some key north/south
connections. Development in this area is more sparse
and includes farms and industrial parks. The spread
out nature of development within this area can make
traveling to downtown and the shopping areas more
challenging. However, the natural quality of the
area provides many opportunities for smaller loops
within the system to connect key destinations within
this area.
Interstate 70 provides the northern border for this
quadrant. The Interstate is the main automobile
connection to Indianapolis and Ohio. The County
roads within this part of the city are fairly straight
but narrow. Many do not have developed shoulders
creating challenges for bicyclists and pedestrians to
safely use the roadway. Industries Road connects
the industrial park with the interstate interchange.
Although this is a heavily trafficked road, it does
have wide shoulders including on the bridges.
Industries Road provides an opportunity to connect
the more rural areas of this part of the city with
the shopping areas along US Route 27 near the
University campuses.
The rural nature of this quadrant provides the
opportunity for greenways along streams and more
scenic routes for on-road bike routes. The lower
traffic volumes on the county roads are often seen as
attractive for the bicyclist who is looking for a longer
trip and can achieve the mileage needed for those
types of rides.

Sim Hodgin Parkway

Chester Boulevard

The Cardinal Greenway connects to communities
to the north within this quadrant. The Cardinal
Greenway continues south adjacent to the Gorge
Park providing the opportunity to connect residents
in this area of the City to the downtown. Middlefork
Reservoir has many trails and environmental
opportunities which is destination for residents and
visitors to the city. The Cardinal Greenway is the
largest existing facility within this quadrant. There
are very few sidewalks or bicycle facilities that exist
in the area.

INVENTORY NORTHEAST QUADRANT

The Northeast quadrant of the study area is
dominated by the college campuses and commercial
areas along Chester Boulevard. The East Fork of
the Whitewater River provides the opportunity for
a regional connection to neighboring communities
in Ohio. Current projects are planned to provide
a greenway along the East Fork. The East Fork
corridor provides a natural and scenic connection
between the university campuses and the hospital
campus and both Glen Miller Park as well as Hayes
Arboretum. The East Fork also creates a challenge
by dividing these two areas of town. The character
of this corridor make it much more of an asset than a
challenge.

Reid Hospital

Chester Boulevard is much like the East Fork of
the Whitewater River in that it presents both
opportunities and challenges. This roadway provides
a direct link between the north side of town and the
downtown which then connects with both the east
and west sides. However, the design of the roadway
encourages heavy traffic volumes at high rates of
speed creating a less than desirable environment
for bicyclists and pedestrians whether on or off
the road. In addition, there are grade challenges
associated with Chester Boulevard. However, the
direct link between these sections of the city cannot
be discounted.
Bicycle and pedestrian facilities within this quadrant
include many trails in Glen Miller Park and Hayes
Arboretum. There are many existing sidewalks
within the downtown areas and through the college
campuses.

INVENTORY SOUTHWEST QUADRANT

The Southwest quadrant includes West Main Street
and the National Road. The Cardinal Greenway
continues to the south from the Northwest Quadrant
through Richmond. There are many schools, including
Earlham College, located within this quadrant. The
proximity of the schools to neighborhoods and to the
Cardinal Greenway can be seen in this quadrant.
With a more urban character this portion of the city
lends itself to more frequent and convenient trips
by foot and bike. The location of the schools within
the neighborhoods makes them conducive to allow
children and families to travel to the schools and
parks without the use of an automobile.
Clear Creek Park is located within this quadrant
and provides an opportunity to connect with
neighborhoods and the schools for additional
recreational use. The lack of connection between
the parks and the Cardinal Greenway are a missed
opportunity to further link the parks system. In
addition, gaps along the Cardinal Greenway have
kept the Greenway from reaching its full potential.
These connections are a large challenge for current
users of the bike and pedestrian system.
Although this portion of the city is located within close
proximity to the downtown, access to the downtown
for these residents is limited. The roadway bridges
that cross over the White River Gorge were not
built to accommodate bicyclists and pedestrians.
Modifications have been made to the bridges to
allow for travel across the bridges but it is not the
most comfortable experience with high rates of
speed and high volumes of vehicles. The facilities
provided for bicyclists and pedestrians are narrow
and do not accommodate many users at a time.

Clear Creek Park

West Main Sreet

The Cope Environmental Center is located outside
of the city limits but is considered a key regional
destination for the city. Through partnerships with
adjacent jurisdictions a connection should be made
between Richmond and the Cope Environmental
Center. This would provide benefits to both the city
and the environmental center with increased visits
and awareness.

INVENTORY SOUTHEAST QUADRANT

The Southeast area of the city is characterized by
both urban land use and suburban development.
The downtown area includes many historic and
well established neighborhoods. Many of these
neighborhoods have sidewalks on both sides of the
road. With parking on both sides of the street most
streets are relatively low speeds and do not usually
contain high volumes of traffic. The exception would
be US Route 40 which becomes Main Street. US
Route 40 is a heavily trafficked road and includes
many of the most dangerous intersections within
the city. Sidewalks do occur along parts of 40,
especially as you get closer to downtown but are
not present further out of town where the shopping
districts occur. With several neighborhoods located
just north or south of the commercial districts there
are many people that desire to, and do, walk
and bike from their homes to the shopping areas.
Footpaths are being worn along the roadway
showing the need for bike and pedestrian facilities
along 40.
Main Street provides an additional challenge in
the downtown area. Part of the character of the
downtown is its quaint Main Street shopping areas.
This character is created with brick sidewalks,
on-street parking and the narrow roadway. The
narrowness of the roadway and the volumes of
traffic going through downtown create challenges
for providing facilities which also accommodate
pedestrians. The character of downtown must be
maintained with any new improvements to this area
of the city.

Interstate 70 creates the eastern border to the
city limits and creates a challenge by providing a
barrier between Richmond and the adjacent areas.
However, the interstate can also provide some
opportunities with current roadway underpasses
which may be able to accommodate bicycle and
pedestrian facilities within the current road right-ofway.

Glen Miller Park

In addition, many of the neighborhoods within
this quadrant do not include sidewalks within the
neighborhoods. Although walking and riding on some
neighborhood streets is comfortable for all skill levels
there are many streets that are used as cut-throughs
and many that the actual speeds are very fast. This
creates an environment within neighborhoods which
discourages any sort of travel by bike or foot for
safety reasons. These neighborhoods also have an
opportunity to create smaller loops for recreational
travel by connecting to each other. There are no
current facilities to make these connections.
The roadways and corridors within this quadrant
provide opportunities to create many regional
connections including with existing routes in the
neighboring state but also with planned routes which
will cross the nation.

Ranking of Air Quality â Gary Schools
December 2008
USA Today Survey

Methodology
Children are uniquely susceptible to the dangers posed by many sorts of toxic chemicals because
they breathe more deeply than adults, and because their bodies are still developing1. That's why
USA TODAY worked with the researchers and scientists at the University of MassachusettsAmherst, Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, and the University of Maryland in College
Park to analyze exposure to industrial pollution at schools across the nation. The goal: To
determine what sort of toxic chemicals children breathe when they go to school.

Schools List
USA TODAY gathered information on about 127,800 public and private schools from the
National Center for Education Statistics and more than two dozen state education agencies2.
While we attempted to make the list as comprehensive as possible, it may not include some
recently opened buildings. It also includes some schools that have closed since 2005. We also
excluded some schools whose locations we could not map. If you don't find your school among
those listed in our database, let us know by sending the school's name and address to
smokestack@usatoday.com.

Toxicity Assessments
Toxicity assessments for each school are based on emissions data collected by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency as part of its Toxics Release Inventory program, also known
as TRI. More than 20,000 industrial and government facilities are required to tell the agency
about their emissions of hundreds of chemicals that are known to harm humans or the
environment. Most facilities do not measure their emissions; rather, their reports to the TRI are
estimates (PDF). It is difficult to verify the accuracy of those estimates, but some critics have
complained that TRI reports generally understate emissions3. Generally, only large industrial and
government facilities are required to report to the TRI, meaning there are many other potential
sources of pollution that are not included in the agency's data. As a result, those sources also are
not included in toxicity assessments for schools.
To assess how those emissions affect the air outside nearby schools, USA TODAY partnered
with researchers from the University of Massachusetts-Amherst's Political Economy Research
Institute. After more than two years of effort, the researchers obtained data from an EPA model
known as the Risk-Screening Environmental Indicators, which scores chemicals based on their
potential danger. The model also uses information about industrial facilities â such as the height
of its smokestacks and the way each chemical disperses in the air â to estimate where
concentrations of the chemicals they release will be highest. The model allows the EPA to assess
pollution's impact on every square kilometer of the nation, and the agency uses that information
to help identify potential problems spots. The University of Massachusetts researchers used those
findings to produce lists of chemicals that contributed to the air toxicity at each of the nation's
127,800 schools in 2005, the most recent year for which the EPA has completed its model. With

2
the help of the University of Massachusetts researchers and other experts, and after consulting
with the EPA, USA TODAY used those records to create three measures of a school's exposure
to industrial toxics:
â¢

â¢

â¢

Overall toxicity: This is the primary measure of toxicity from industrial pollution outside
a school. It reflects both the concentration of chemicals the EPA's model shows impacted
the school in 2005, as well as the potential harm associated with those chemicals. That
measurement is ranked against each of the other 127,800 schools for which USA
TODAY developed toxicity information, and is displayed as a percentile. For example, if
you see a school whose overall toxicity shows up in the second percentile, you'll know
only 1% of the nation's schools had higher toxicity levels.
Exposure to cancer-causing chemicals: This ranking is similar to the overall toxicity
measure, but includes only those chemicals known or thought to cause cancer4. The
measure shows how one school ranks relative to all of the nation's other schools.
Exposure to other toxic chemicals: This ranking shows the potential severity of
exposure to chemicals that do not cause cancer. For each chemical thought to cause
health problems other than cancer, we compared the likely concentration of that chemical
at each school to the EPA's reference concentration, the agency's exposure threshold. In
other words, the higher a school ranks on this scale, the more likely it is that noncarcinogens could exceed that threshold.

Because these measures are based on a model and estimates of emissions, they are subject to
some limitations. For example, the model makes certain assumptions about topography, the
height of smokestacks and the toxicity of certain chemicals, any of which could influence the
assessment of toxicity in a particular location. In some cases, the EPA model appeared to
underestimate exposure to toxic chemicals 5. In others, it appeared to overstate it6. Also, the
model is not meant to assess risk â your chances of getting sick.
Because it is based on reports from 2005 and includes only some potential sources of pollution,
the model may not fully reflect the current situation at each school. For example, some facilities
have closed since 2005, and others have opened. Also, large industrial sites account for only a
fraction of the nation's toxic air pollution. The EPA estimates that in 2002, cars, smaller
businesses and other sources accounted for 85% of the toxic chemicals in the nation's air.

Monitoring
Under the guidance of scientists from Johns Hopkins University and the University of Maryland
School of Public Health, USA TODAY monitored air quality near 95 public and private schools
throughout the nation. We placed monitors mainly â but not exclusively â near schools the EPA
model suggests face higher exposure to industrial pollution. To make the most complete
assessment possible, we used three main types of monitors, depending on the types of chemicals
the model suggested would be present:
â¢

Badges: We hung simple badge-like monitors near 95 schools in 30 states. The badges
collect a class of chemicals known as volatile organic compounds. We also used a similar
badge to detect ethylene oxide, a known carcinogen, near 23 schools. We left the badges
in place for between four days and a week before returning them to the University of
Maryland for analysis.

3
â¢

â¢

Active monitors: Because some chemicals, such as metals, cannot be picked up on
badge monitors, USA TODAY employees set up pumps to collect samples of metals near
17 schools and polycyclic aromatic compounds near 23 schools. At those schools, we
monitored the air for between 72 and 96 hours. Filters that picked up metals were
analyzed by Johns Hopkins; the rest were analyzed by the University of Maryland.
Ultraviolet monitors: To find chemicals that cannot be easily measured either by badges
or active samplers, we used an ultraviolet detection system made by Cerex Monitoring
Solutions to conduct additional monitoring near eight schools in Ohio, Pennsylvania and
Texas. That monitor delivers its findings in real time and does not require laboratory
analysis.

The monitoring work was conducted by employees of USA TODAY and other affiliated
newspapers and television stations. In every case, we attempted to place the monitors within
about 100 yards of a school, though a few had to be placed slightly farther away. Scientists at the
University of Maryland and Johns Hopkins analyzed each sample, and interpreted those results.
Because USA TODAY was able to monitor near schools only for a comparatively short period of
time, our findings may not reflect the extent of long-term exposure to pollutants at a particular
location. For example, changes in wind direction or activity levels at a particular industrial
facility can significantly influence the concentration levels near a school on any given day.

See, for example, A Framework for Addressing Health Risks of Environmental Exposure to
Children by the EPA's National Center for Environmental Assessment, published in 2006.
2

Includes Alabama, California, Colorado, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky,
Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma,
South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.
3

For example, Houston Mayor Bill White asked the EPA this year to adjust its emissions
estimates for petrochemical and refining plants, pointing to studies showing their emissions were
under-reported.
4

For chemicals that are linked to both cancer and other health effects, we used the severity
weighting the EPA assigned to the cancer-causing attributes of the chemical.
5

At Salina Elementary in Dearborn, Mich., for example, the EPA model did not suggest students
were exposed to acrolein, but an air monitoring station near the school detected high levels of the
chemical.

6

At Cesar Chavez High School in Houston, for example, the EPA model suggests students were
exposed to levels of 1,3-butadiene significantly higher than the levels detected by an air
monitoring station about a block away.

Questions and Answers
Question: What is considered a high or dangerous ranking on this database â top 1%, top
10%, everything above 50%, or something else?
Answer: There is no clear line between dangerous and safe in these rankings. The lower the
ranking, the greater the likelihood that toxic chemicals could be present at levels that could
threaten children's health. Those schools that rank above or just below Meredith Hitchens
Elementary School, about 450th in the rankings, would seem most at risk; Hitchens, near
Cincinnati, was closed in 2005 after Ohio EPA found high levels of two cancer-causing
chemicals in the air.
Question: When I type in the name of my school, it shows me all the chemicals outside and
tells me how it ranks compared to other schools. My school seems to rank pretty high.
Should I be worried?
Answer: Experts say the model is meant as "a screening tool. It isn't an in-depth analysis," says
Nick Bouwes, who helped create the model for EPA. That means you should take what the
model says and ask more questions. Its purpose is to compare one location against another to
determine which one might indicate more pollution problems.
Question: Why did USA TODAY choose to use this particular computer simulation to
identify schools that might be in toxic hot spots? I've heard the EPA has said it's not the
proper tool.
Answer: After weeks of talking with officials at the U.S. EPA and those who created the model,
USA TODAY determined that Risk-Screening Environmental Indicators, or RSEI, offered the
most current way to track industrial pollution around the nation. In many discussions with EPA
officials, reporters explained exactly how USA TODAY planned to use the model. During one
interview, for instance, the EPA official who helps oversee the model, Bob Lee, told a reporter
that USA TODAY's efforts "strike me as a highly appropriate use for RSEI and the kind of thing
that makes a lot of sense." Nick Bouwes, a former EPA staff member who helped create the
model, also said the way USA TODAY used the model to identify schools that may be in hot
spots is "exactly" how it is supposed to be used.
Question: How accurate are the school rankings?
Answer: The EPA model produces estimates of how each school ranks nationally based on its
exposure to industrial air pollution, and the hazards those chemicals can pose. But those rankings
are estimates. They are based on emission reports companies filed each year with the EPA. The
model also makes other assumptions about how those chemicals will travel through the air. For
more information about how the model works and its limitations, see a description of our
methodology.
In some places, the model likely overstates the levels of toxic chemicals in the air. For example,
the model ranks Ashland City Elementary School in Ashland City, Tenn., as having the worst air
in the country. That estimate is based on emissions reports by a hot water heater manufacturer in

16
the city. A spokesman says most of the manganese is trapped in tiny shards of steel that are
swept up from the shop floor and discarded, but is not emitted into the air, as its report said. USA
TODAY monitored the air near Ashland twice, and both times found manganese levels
significantly lower than what the model predicted. That said, environmental experts such as
Johns Hopkins University scientist Patrick Breysse stress that monitoring for longer periods is
necessary before residents can know for certain what's in the air.
In other cases, the model understates the extent to which children are exposed. For example, it
ranked Pacific Elementary School, in Davenport, Calif., among the best in the country, but this
summer a state agency found high levels of hexavalent chromium, which can cause cancer, near
the school. The discrepancy appears to have been caused by the model misplacing a cement plant
in town, moving it much farther from the school.
When the model overstates or understates emissions, the effect can reach far beyond the school
closest to the plant. Sometimes, a mistake in one place can change the ranking of schools as
much as 30 miles away; for example, the high emission reports in Ashland City affected the
ranking of schools in other areas around Nashville.
The most important point to remember: The EPA's model cannot say definitively whether
anyone is at risk. Instead, it is a screening tool to help identify places where industrial pollution
might pose problems.
Question: I tried to find my school in the database and couldn't. Why not?
Answer: USA TODAY collected data from the U.S. Department of Education and at least two
dozen states in an attempt to account for as many public, parochial and private schools as
possible. In some cases, states might not have submitted the most recent addresses for some new
schools. In other cases, schools may have moved or closed since the data were reported. USA
TODAY used the best data the government made available. If you know of a school that is not
included in the database, please email us at smokestack@usatoday.com.
Question: What does it mean if my school ranks low compared to other schools?
Answer: Experts say a low ranking means your school is probably exposed to fewer chemicals
from industrial sources. But that's not the same as a clean bill of health. The EPA model includes
only emissions from large industrial and government facilities; it does not account for toxic
chemicals released by smaller businesses or automobiles.
Question: I don't see any chemicals or industries associated with my school. Why not?
Answer: That happens when the model indicates very low pollution levels around a school. In
some cases, the levels reported by any facility are too low to be meaningful. That doesn't mean
the model indicates no chemicals in the air; it means it estimated them at extremely low levels.
I've heard environmental or school officials in my state say the information isn't up-to-date
or doesn't offer a full picture of what's really happening near my school. Is that true?

17
Answer: USA TODAY used the most current version of the model, which contains data from
2005. In that sense, it represents a snapshot in time of what pollution might have been like at
these locations then. Some companies say they've curbed emissions since. In a news release, the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection said USA TODAY's analysis "fails to
take into account mobile sources that can greatly elevate health risks." That's correct. Experts tell
us that what we identified was the tip of the pollution iceberg, and as we pointed out, other
sources -- such as cars and smaller polluters -- might contribute as much as five or six times the
level of pollution that the model we used shows.
Question: What do I do with this information?
Answer: The first step is to see whether the company that the government model indicates is
responsible is 1) still operating; and 2) has reported its emissions correctly. Although the model
is the government's most up-to-date gauge of industrial pollution, the emissions reports it uses
come from 2005. That means some of the companies might have gone out of business or cut
production. One way to check is to see whether that company reported emissions last year. Also,
contact your local school district and ask officials what they know. They should be able to direct
you to local environmental authorities who can tell you whether they have monitored the air
nearby.
You can also contact environmental advocacy groups that might help you find relatively
inexpensive ways to determine what's in the air. Groups such as Global Community Monitor
work with local groups to develop ways to check air quality in their communities.
Question: Until I know for sure, should I pull my kids from school and put my house up for
sale?
Answer: No, say environmental experts. Don't panic, but push for answers. Most of the
chemicals that might be outside your school are in small enough quantities that they likely pose
no immediate threats.
Question: Then why should I be concerned?
Answer: For many reasons. First, scientists aren't certain how specific chemicals affect children.
Kids are particularly vulnerable because they're still growing and they breathe more air than
adults, but safety standards are based largely on how chemicals affect adults in the workplace.
Second, the same companies that may be responsible for the pollution sometimes have spills or
accidents during which much larger amounts of toxic chemicals are released. The model does not
account for those. Third, thousands of other, smaller businesses aren't obligated to report their
emissions to the government. That means monitoring the air might be the only way to account
for what they release. Fourth, if you don't push for answers, no one else might; laws in most
states don't require school or environmental authorities to examine toxic chemicals in the air
outside schools.
Question: What about the air inside my school?
Answer: The model deals with the air outside the building, but experts say air quality outside
affects air quality inside. "You probably have a lot of pollutants collecting on the inside," says

18
Claire Barnett, executive director of the non-profit group Healthy Schools Network. "You do
need some very close monitoring to find out what's actually going on. You need to look indoors
as well."
Question: Why do two schools near each other have very different rankings?
Answer: To measure industrial pollution across the country, the EPA model divides the USA
into thousands of squares, each measuring one kilometer by one kilometer. Then it estimates the
potential impact of industrial pollution for each of those areas. Any schools within the same
square will have the same ranking. Sometimes, however, two schools near each other will be in
different squares. Their rankings will be different. Sometimes - especially for chemicals not
likely to travel very far in the air - the differences will be substantial.

CITY OF JASPER, INDIANA
JASPER MUNICIPAL UTILITIES
RULES, REGULATIONS, CONDITIONS, AND
NON-RECURRING CHARGES
Ordinance No. 2009-9 Effective February 18, 2009
Section 1. The following are hereby adopted as the rules, regulations, conditions and non-recurring charges applying to
utility service hereafter furnished by the City of Jasper, Indiana.
Section 2. Definition of Terms
"Utility" is herein used to designate the City of Jasper Municipal Utilities, which furnishes electric, water, wastewater and
gas services under these rules and regulations.
"Customer" is used herein to designate a person, partnership, association, firm, public or private corporation or
governmental agency, applying for or using utility service supplied by the City of Jasper, or a person, partnership,
association, firm, public or private corporation or governmental agency using or obtaining other services or materials from a
utility department of the City of Jasper.
"Commission" is herein used to designate the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, or any successor to the commission
having jurisdiction on the subject matter hereof.
"Month" is hereby defined to be the elapsed time between two (2) successive meter readings approximately thirty (30)
days apart. In the event of the stoppage of or the failure of any meter to register the full amount of usage, the customer
will be billed for such period on an estimated consumption based upon his usage in a similar period of like use.
"Dwelling" means an individual residence, including a mobile home or trailer or a room or combination of rooms, with
facilities for living for a single household.
"Heating Season" means the period beginning on December 1 of any year and ending on the following March 15.
Section 3. Application for Service
A free copy of the standard terms and conditions under which service is to be rendered to the customer shall be furnished
at the time of application for utility service or upon request at the Utility Business Office. Upon request, the Utility Business
Office shall furnish a free copy of applicable rate schedules to the customer.
A written application and/or agreement shall be required from each customer before service will be commenced. A copy of
the agreement shall be furnished to the customer upon request.
When the customer desires delivery of service at more than one point, a separate agreement shall be required for each
separate point of delivery. Service delivered at each point may be billed under separate accounts or may be billed together
under one account using the applicable rates for each.
The utility reserves the right to refuse to render service to any applicant indebted to the utility for service rendered at any
location served by the utility prior to such application, until such indebtedness is settled to the satisfaction of the utility.
Section 4. Service Security Deposits
A service security deposit shall be collected as set forth in Section 16(1), in advance of connecting service. The utility shall

have reasonable time in which to read and/or remove the meters and to ascertain that the obligations of the customer have
been fully performed before being required to return any deposit.
After final charges have been determined, deposits shall be applied to the customer's account and the balance, if any,
refunded; OR refunded in its entirety after all indebtedness for utility services, including the final bill, has been paid.

Section 5. Payment of Bills
Bills will be rendered monthly by the utilities to the customer in accordance with the rate(s) applicable to the customer's
service. All bills are payable at the Utility Business Office by the 10th of each month. If the 10th falls on a weekend or Cityobserved holiday, the first working day following the 10th will be considered the due date for bills. A night deposit is
provided at the Utility Business Office for the customer's convenience. Failure to receive the bill will not entitle the
customer to the remission of any charge for non-payment within the time specified.
The utilityâs rate schedules provide for delayed payment penalties for failure to pay bills within a specified time. Such
delayed payment penalty shall be added to the original bill if not paid on or before the time specified and/or in accordance
with conditions set forth in the rate schedules. Said penalties shall be applied as set forth in Section 16(2). When payments
are made by mail, bills will be considered as having been paid on the date of mailing as shown by the postmark. If the date
on the postmark is indistinguishable, Utility Business Office personnel shall have final authority to determine whether or not
said postmark qualifies as having been paid on or before the due date specified on the bill.
Payment must be made without regard to any counter claims whatsoever, and failure to receive the bills does not relieve
the customer of the responsibility for payment of the amount due. At the Jasper Municipal Utilitiesâ personnelâs discretion,
customers may be given the option of making payment of their monthly utility bill via âCashâ, âCheckâ, âBank Draftâ,
âMoney Orderâ or âElectronic Funds Transferâ.
Payment by check or electronic funds transfer which is subsequently returned to the utilities by a bank for insufficiency, or
any other reason, which is not made good on or before the due date, shall not constitute timely payment of a bill, shall be
assessed late payment penalties as set forth in Section 16(2), and may be subject to possible termination of utility services.
Further, a returned check charge shall be made by the utilities against the customer's utility account as set forth in Section
16(5).
The utilities may provide any residential customer whose account is delinquent an opportunity to enter into a reasonable
amortization agreement to pay the delinquent account. Such an amortization agreement is to provide the customer with
adequate opportunity to apply for and receive the benefits of any available public assistance program. The agreement must
be subject to amendment at the customer's request if there is a change in the customer's financial circumstances.

A reasonable rate of interest in addition to penalties set forth in Section 16(2) may be charged on the unpaid balance of a
customer's delinquent bill, should said bill remain unpaid for more than 90 days beyond the due date as stated on the
original bill.
Section 6. Discontinuance of Service
Whenever a customer desires discontinuance of utility service, they shall notify the utility, at the Utility Business Office, of
such desire and of the date on which service is to be discontinued, sufficiently in advance of such date to provide a
reasonable time for the utility to obtain the final meter readings. Customers shall not rely on their landlord, or any third
party, to notify the utility of such discontinuance of service.

The utility reserves the right to discontinue service for non-payment of bills and for other such reasons as stated in

âTermination of Serviceâ below. All bills will be due and payable on the 10th day of each month. Customers who fail to pay
on or before the 10th day of the month will be sent a written past due notice. Customers who have not paid their bills by
the due date as stated on the past due notice and have not made satisfactory payment arrangements will have their service
discontinued.
When the utility service has been cut off upon customer's default, the utility will not be obligated to restore service until
the customer has paid all bills due for service previously furnished and has made a satisfactory deposit, the amount to be
determined in accordance with the utilities' deposit policy, to insure future payment of bills. A reconnection fee will be
charged to reconnect a disconnected customer as set forth in Section 16(3). If a reconnection is desired during Business
Hours, the entire payment due must be made at the Jasper Municipal Utilities Business Office. If a customer desires
reconnection after hours, payment must be made by money order for the entire amount due, plus the reconnection fee as
set forth in Section 16(3). Jasper Municipal Utility personnel whose duty it is to reconnect utility service after hours may
not accept payment for reconnection by cash or check.
If the customer is in default and, while the utility is preparing to disconnect the customer's utility service, the customer
elects to pay the utility employee the total and exact amount in default, the customer may be charged a collection fee as
set forth in Section 16(6). Said collection fee shall be used to offset the additional labor costs associated with attempting to
disconnect.
In the event natural gas service has been terminated, for whatever reason, the gas utility will perform a gas inspection of
the premises at the time service is restored and the customer may be charged a gas inspection fee as set forth in Section
16(4).
In every circumstance where utility service has been disconnected, whether for nonpayment or at a customerâs request, a
Temporary Disconnect/Reconnect Fee shall be charged to the person requesting reconnection as set forth in Section 16(3).
Said fee shall be paid in full prior to reconnection.
The utility may disconnect service forthwith and without notice if the customer's wiring or other utility connections are
found to be in a dangerous or unsafe condition, or if necessary to protect itself from fraud. The utility may deny service to
anyone who is indebted to the utility for service rendered at another location, until such time as all such indebtedness is
paid in full. Any discontinuance of service shall not terminate the obligations under the applicable tariff between the utility
and the customer.

Section 7. Termination of Service
Notwithstanding any other ordinance or regulation, except as stated below, during the "heating season" of any year,
residential customers who have applied for and are having their eligibility determined, or are receiving, assistance from a
heating assistance program administered under state law shall not have their utility service terminated. It shall be the
responsibility of the customer to notify the Utility Business Office that application has been made to the heating assistance
program. Non-residential customers shall not be subject to this âheating seasonâ exclusion.
The Jasper Municipal Utilities reserves the right to discontinue utility service for non-payment of bills if the residential
customer has not applied for or is not receiving benefits from a heating assistance program regardless whether during the
âheating seasonâ or not.
The utilities may terminate utility service upon request of the customer or under the following circumstances:
(1) If a condition dangerous or hazardous to life, physical safety, or property exists.
(2) Upon order of any court, the Commission, or other duly authorized authority.
(3) If fraudulent or unauthorized use of any utility service is detected, and the utility has reasonable grounds to believe
the affected customer is responsible for such use.

(4) If the utilities' regulating or measuring equipment has been tampered with and the utility has reasonable grounds to
believe that the affected customer is responsible for such tampering.
(5) For nonpayment, under those rules set out in âTermination of Service â Noticeâ below.
In the event the customer requests a utility service be permanently removed, the customer will be charged as set forth in
Section 16(7) for each service involved.
Each service permanently disconnected shall also have the meter removed and, where appropriate, service lines abandoned
and disconnected at the main. Should the customer, at a later date, request re-installation of said utility service, the
customer will be required to reapply for a permit and pay all appropriate fees and expenses as though it were a totally new
service.
In the event the customer requests a utility service relocated, either temporarily or permanently, the customer will be
charged as set forth in Section 16(8).
In every circumstance where utility service has been disconnected, whether for nonpayment or at a customerâs request, a
Temporary Disconnect/Reconnect Fee shall be charged to the person requesting reconnection as set forth in Section 16(3).
Said fee shall be paid in full prior to reconnection.
Owners or managers of rental property shall complete, and the Utility Business Office shall maintain a âRental Property
Owner Questionnaireâ in which the rental property owner or manager shall elect to either 1) leave all utilities connected,
but to have payment responsibility transferred to the property owner during unit or property vacancies or 2) have all
utilities temporarily shut-off during unit or property vacancies and to be subject to the Temporary Disconnect/Reconnect
Fee as set forth in Section 16(3). Said owner shall also be subject to the Temporary Disconnect/Reconnect Fee if the
Ownerâs tenantâs service was disconnected for nonpayment and the Owner requests reconnection as set forth in Section
16(3).
Section 8. Termination of Service - Notice
Utility service being provided to an occupied âdwellingâ, or other occupied facility, may not be terminated because of the
failure of the customer to pay their utility bill until fourteen (14) days after the utility serves notice upon the customer of its
intent to terminate said service. Said notice shall be in the form of a past due notice.
The past due notice must, in separate numbered paragraphs:
(1) Indicate the date on which service will be terminated;
(2) State the reason and factual basis for termination of service;
(3) List the telephone number of the Utility Business Office that customers may call during business hours in order to
question the proposed termination of service or to seek information concerning their rights; and
(4) State that customers may refer to the pamphlet furnished to them when they applied for service for information as to
their rights.
Service of a past due notice under this section must be made by:
(1) First class mail addressed to the customer at the address listed for the customer in the records of the utilities; or
(2) Personal delivery posted in a conspicuous location at the service address.
No notice may be served before the date on which the customer's account becomes delinquent.
After following the notice provisions set forth above, utility service, whether it be electric, gas, wastewater, or water, or any

combination thereof, being provided to a residential customer at one metering point, residence, or location, may be
disconnected for failure to pay for utility service, whether it be electric, gas, wastewater, or water, or any combination
thereof, being provided to the same residential customer for the same form or class of utility service at another metering
point, residence or location if such bill has remained unpaid for at least forty-five (45) days.
Section 9. Meter Tampering, Fraudulent, or Unauthorized Use of Utility Service
In the event the utility has reasonable grounds to believe that the customer has tampered with the utilities' regulating or
measuring equipment, or if fraudulent or unauthorized use of any utility service is detected, the utility will estimate its loss
of revenue, including interest, and bill the responsible customer as set forth in Section 16(9).
Section 10. Accessibility of Meters
Utility meters must, at all times, be accessible to utility personnel for the purpose of reading, testing, and maintenance. In
the event shrubbery or other obstructions inhibit access to the meter and/or the viewing of the meter dials, the customer
will be formally requested in writing and given 30 days in which to remove (or trim) said shrubbery or other obstruction so
that uninhibited access of the meter can take place. Should the customer choose not to comply with said request, the
utility may contract with a professional for the purpose of removing (or trimming) the inhibiting shrubbery or other
obstruction. The customer, in this event, will be billed as set forth in Section 16(10).
Section 11. Inside Meters
In those cases where a utility's regulating or measuring device (including, without limitation, a measuring meter) is located
on the inside of a structure or is otherwise located in a place that is not readily available for sight reading by a utility
employee, the Jasper Municipal Utilities may request the customer to convert the regulating or measuring device to a
remote device that does not require sight reading and which can be read by means of an electronic signal transmitted via
radio waves, wire, optical cable, or similar medium. Any such request shall be made in writing and shall give the customer
30 days to make the appropriate conversion. In the event the customer does not make the conversion within 30 days, the
Jasper Municipal Utilities may charge an inside meter reading fee as set forth in Section 16(11). The owner of any structure
that has an inside meter must provide the Jasper Municipal Utilities with 24 hour access to said inside meter for the
purpose of testing, maintenance and disconnection of said meter.
Section 12. Meter Testing
Whenever the customer believes that a meter is not recording within the limits of accuracy as prescribed by the rules of the
Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, said customer may request that the meter in question be tested for accuracy.
Whenever a request is made for a test on a customer's meter and said meter has been tested twice in the previous twentyfour (24) months, the customer shall be required to make an advance payment of a meter testing fee, as set forth in Section
16(12), before the meter will be tested.
If the meter is found to be over-recording usage, the meter testing fee will be refunded. If the meter is found to be underrecording usage, or if the meter is found to be accurately recording usage, the meter testing fee will not be refunded.
Section 13. Electric Service Permit
All residential, commercial, industrial, governmental, and institutional facilities shall be required to obtain a permit before
connection to the utility's system will be allowed. This permit requirement applies to new, temporary or permanent,
service connections; changes in the size of service; additional service connections; and, the relocating of service

connections.
A permit fee, as set forth in Section 16(13), shall be paid at the time the Electric Service Permit is issued. The permit fee
shall apply toward recovering costs associated with inspecting the installation as described on the permit.
Section 14. Seasonal Service Disconnection/Reconnection
Utility service will be extended to customers on a seasonal basis under the same conditions as permanent residential,
commercial, and industrial accounts. When requested by the customer, service(s) will be temporarily disconnected,
however, a monthly customer charge, as set forth in the appropriate rate ordinance, will be assessed for each service
involved, each month said service(s) is/are disconnected. A reconnection fee, as set forth in Section 16(14), for each service
involved, shall be paid prior to reconnection of said service(s). In the event natural gas service has been shut-off, the gas
utility will perform a gas inspection of the premises when service is restored and the customer will be charged a gas
inspection fee as set forth in Section 16(4).
In the event the temporary shut-off becomes permanent as a result of direction from the property owner, time lapse, or
other criteria in the discretion of utility management, the provisions of âTermination of Serviceâ, as stated above, shall
apply.
Section 15. Miscellaneous Charges
The Jasper Municipal Utilities shall charge its customers for other miscellaneous items and services, as set by the Utility
Service Board.

6.0 Comparison and Applicability
The integrated approach to storm water management requires consideration of many new
concepts and practices. However, a direct comparison of the costs and performance of these new
practices to conventional engineered storm drainage systems, or for that matter to each other,
should be handled with caution for a number of reasons:
1. The practices apply to different areas and situations. Some, such as rain barrels, apply
only to residential areas, whereas others, such as rooftop storage, would be implemented
only in large commercial/industrial/ institutional buildings, and others, such as inlet
restrictors, would be installed in paved areas. The level of performance (amount of water
controlled) also varies widely.
2. Onsite storm water reduction practices offer a widely-varying range of benefits beyond
storm water reduction, such as water quality benefits, groundwater recharge, habitat
improvement, and educational values.
3. The integrated approach involves small scale, distributed practices that will have
accumulated results - maybe not always more efficiently than engineered solutions, but
often more effective, with improved benefits and increased participation and long term
implementation.
4. The concepts of green infrastructure, sustainable development, and improved site
design will require a mix of structural, nonstructural, institutional, and educational
elements. Implementation of these elements will necessitate increased partnerships. The
onsite practices attractive to private residents offer partnership opportunities with
community and neighborhood groups, special interest groups (such as garden clubs), and
municipalities. The practices that are more appropriate for institutional or commercial
property owners offer the City the opportunity to partner with existing organizations that
have many properties, such as school districts, banks, or developers.
5. The onsite practices offer a wonderful opportunity to educate the public about storm
water and watershed health and protection. Residential programs lend themselves to
enhancing homeowner understanding of storm water issues.
Practices such as rain gardens or downspout disconnects are very tangible, easily
understood concepts. Practices that involve established institutions allow the City to raise
awareness among large groups of people, such as service organizations or tenants of
properties. Practices such as green roofs, when partnered with a school district, offer the
City the chance to build an education program for school children and their parents.
Establishing some sort of recognition program to residents/institutions who participate in
storm water reduction practices provide the City with additional education/awareness
opportunities through publicity and media coverage.
It is helpful to evaluate the attributes and limitations of the storm water reduction practices and to
understand the conditions under which these practices perform best. For each practice, Table

Draft Green Infrastructure Supplemental Stormwater Document

Page 190
March 2010

6.1.1 summarizes the flow benefits, environmental features, implementability, function,
operation and maintenance needs, and potential to promote environmental awareness.

1.1. Evaluation of Green Design Techniques
1. All practices provide some reduction in storm water flow (otherwise, of course, they would
not be included in the table). However, the level of hydrologic/hydraulic performance varies
widely.
2. Three-fourths of the practices have the potential - depending on the design - to provide at least
marginal benefits during âmajorâ (> 1â) storms.
3. All but two of the practices may be expected to provide pollutant removal and water quality
benefits.
4. While many practices are believed to be acceptable to the public, a fairly intensive public
education program will be needed for successful implementation.
5. Over three fourths of the practices offer opportunities for partnerships.
6. About 65% of the practices utilize vegetation; 82% increase infiltration; and
53% involve storm water storage.
7. Over one-half of the practices have a âgoodâ or âvery goodâ potential to help promote
environmental responsibility and awareness.
8. A few practices - French drains, dry wells, and infiltration sumps - may have limitations that
merit site specific soils investigations.
Table 6.1.2 presents the cost effectiveness of the practices. Capital costs and costs per
impervious acre served are provided. Note that the amount of storm water reduction varies: a
rain barrel may store only Â¼â of runoff from a roof, while a green roof may accommodate more
than 2â of rainfall. The cost effectiveness estimates do not reflect these variations in
performance. The cost per impervious acre served ranges from less than $1,000 per acre to
$653,400 per acre. The median cost is approximately $16,000 per impervious acre.

INTRODUCTION

An important part of any bicycle and pedestrian
master plan is ensuring that the existing and
proposed improvements are cared for and
maintained. One of the most important reasons to
properly maintain the facilities within the system
is to maximize safety while minimizing the local
landowners concerns regarding liability. Planning for
the maintenance and management of the bicycle and
pedestrian system will ensure safety and will prolong
the life of the facilities within the system. Budgeting
and planning for the maintenance of the existing and
proposed facilities is imperative for the long-term
success of the system.
The operations and maintenance plan for the
Richmond Bicycle and Pedestrian Master Plan
provides guidance for tasks that need to be
undertaken by the managing agencies and project
partners. This plan provides a series of work items
that need to be completed in order to maintain
the system as an attractive, safe and enjoyable
amenity. The following defines key aspects of
facility management beginning with operational
policies, followed by facility assessment, maintenance,
maintenance costs, management, safety and liability
policies, and funding alternatives for the operations
and maintenance tasks.

OPERATIONS

The operation of the bicycle and pedestrian systems
includes day-to-day management of the system.
This includes law enforcement, map and brochure
updates, marketing, conducting special events, and
other functional tasks.

Hours of Operations Policy
With many of the existing and proposed facilities
within the system being incorporated into the
living and working areas of the City, there will be
no specific hours of operation for these facilities.
However, the greenway and trail facilities will be
operated as a non-lighted (except where existing
lights exist and are maintained) system of facilities
and shall be open from dawn to dusk, 365 days a
year. Where users are found using the non-lighted
portions of the greenways or rail-trail, they can
be deemed in violation of these hours and may be
subject to fines. The City will need to coordinate with
the Police Department on the level of enforcement
and methods to enforce this policy.

Care and Management Policy
Richmond Parks and Recreation Department and
the Richmond Street Department will be responsible
for the care and upkeep of the facilities and the
surrounding land, drainage features, signage,
fencing, bridges, trail heads, landscape plantings
and facility amenities such as benches and trash
receptacles. A management and maintenance policy
detailing the responsibilities of each department
in terms of bicycle and pedestrian facility care
shall be implemented to avoid overlap or gaps in
maintenance. Gaps in care are the largest complaint
of residents with existing facilities across the nation.

Fencing and Vegetative Screening Policy
The City of Richmond will work with adjacent
landowners on an individual basis to determine
where fencing and screening is needed to buffer
adjacent land from the bicycle and pedestrian
facilities. In rare occasions, fencing and screening
may be provided outside of the property owned
by the City of Richmond. Private landowners will
be responsible for maintaining these elements when
they are located on private property. This should be
part of the design consideration when installing these
elements outside of the public right-of-way.

Trail Users
One of the goals when planning the bicycle and
pedestrian system was to provide facilities and
routes that would accommodate all users. However,
there may be occasions where multiple users are not
appropriate. In such instances, such as with bike trails
and hiking trails, the City may want to limit the user
type allowed on the trail with signage. Although
enforcing these limits may not be possible on a
regular schedule, providing signage will reduce the
number of conflicting users on the facility.
Established guidelines provide for the following
policy recommendations concerning users on the
system:
Multi-use Trails
â¢ Bicyclists should yield to pedestrians
â¢ Access for motorized vehicles on trails is limited
to authorized vehicles such as maintenance
vehicles and emergency response vehicles
â¢ Unauthorized motorized vehicles such at dirt
bikes and ATVâs are prohibited on multi-use trails
â¢ Wheelchairs are allowed on multi-use trails
when used solely for use by a mobility impaired
person.

Environmental Resources Policy
Habitat enhancement and control can improve
aesthetics, help prevent erosion, and provide for
wildlife habitat. Habitat control involves mitigation
of damage caused by wildlife. Where possible,
environmental preservation and restoration should be
included in the bicycle and pedestrian facility design,
especially along greenways and naturalized trails.
Policy measures to enhance environmental resources
include:
â¢ Plant vegetation, such as trees and shrubs
â¢ Take preventative measures to protect.
environmental features from wildlife, such as
installing fencing around sensitive or newly
planted materials.
â¢ Apply herbicide to eliminate any problem plant
species, such as poison ivy or crown vetch.
â¢ Apply herbicide to maintain facility edges and
prevent encroaching vegetation, such as along
trails and sidewalks.
â¢ Deter interaction between users and wildlife such
as feeding the wildlife and people gathering
wildflowers.
â¢ Prohibit and sign litter and dumping along
facilities. Users violating the littering laws may
be issued a citation.
â¢ Dogs should be kept on leashes at all times.

Emergency Response
Emergency services to the trails and facilities will be
provided by various agencies depending on location.
In many cases, the closest public safety agency will
respond, which might include county sheriffs, town
police or parks department personnel.

Closure Policy
There will be times when specific facilities will need
to be closed for repair or during emergencies such
as flooding. When the facilities are closed signs shall
be posted and information regarding the closing
shall be posted on the City and Parks Department
websites. Alternate routes shall be designated and
signed. Barriers shall be installed to prevent access
to the closed portion of the facility. Due to safety
and liability issues, individuals who are found using
the facilities while they are closed are subject to fines
and prosecution.

ASSESSMENT
Create a Facility Assessment and Repair Sheet
A facility assessment process should be conducted to
ensure all facilities are inventoried and the condition
documented prior to performing maintenance tasks.
A facility assessment and repair sheet should be
developed to keep this process consistent across
facility types and through the years as facilities
age. The form should include information needed
to document needed maintenance and repair
locations and types of repair. Items to be included
on the form include: maintenance issue description,
strategies to repair, notes on the trail or facility
condition, space for sketches of the problem and/or
solution, and action to be taken. The assessment and
repair sheet should be completed on-site and should
include the date conducted and name of person
conducting the assessment. Preliminary training
should be given to ensure consistency between staff
members conducting the assessments.

Walk or Ride the Bicycle and Pedestrian
Facility
Assessment of the facilities should include walking
and riding the facility. Facilities should be inspected
on a routine basis to identify current conditions,
drainage issues, erosion, and other areas of
needed repair. In addition, amenities such as
fences, restrooms, kiosks, and wayfinding should be
assessed. Walking or riding the facility will allow
the person conducting the assessment to perform a
more accurate assessment in terms of facility use and
safety.

Coordinate with Land Owners
When possible, discuss any proposed repairs or
maintenance with adjacent land owners to the
facilities prior to scheduling the repair work. The
assessment sheet will help describe the problems to
the adjacent land owners and describe the repairs
that will take place.

INTRODUCTION

Operations and Maintenance

Work Crews
Special training should be provided to maintenance
crews responsible for maintaining the facilities
including how to identify potential hazards, most
efficient methods of repair, and types of repairs that
can be performed by in-house staff. Issues identified
by the maintenance crews should be included in the
overall maintenance and repair budget and schedule
for the City Departments.

MAINTENANCE

The maintenance of the bicycle and pedestrian
system includes many activities involved in keeping
the facilities in a safe and usable condition. This
includes several tasks ranging from mowing and
brush removal to repair and reconstruction of
facilities. Lifetime maintenance will place ongoing
costs on the different agencies maintaining the system
and should be considered when planning and funding
new and existing projects.
A guideline for the most commonly performed tasks
should be developed by the agency responsible
for performing for both annual and seasonal
maintenance. The recommendations should be
reviewed on an annual basis and adjusted as
experience determines more or less frequent
applications are needed. Maintaining safe facilities
will be the determining factor when scheduling tasks
as outlined below.

Mowing and Spraying
Mowing along trails and other facilities should occur
on a regularly scheduled basis. Mowing can be
used to maintain certain types of vegetation such as
turf and invasive species control. Schedule mowing
and spraying regularly, based on knowledge of
how fast such growth occurs to that facility so that
it is not significantly inhibited. With some types of
fast-growing species, it may be necessary to consider
the use of herbicides. Special precaution and
certified training must be included with any spraying
operations. Environmentally safe weed removal
methods should be used, especially along waterways.
Facilities with mowed areas should have four (4) feet
mowed from the edge of the facility.

Tree and Brush Trimming
Trimming is performed to maintain clearance for
users of the bike and pedestrian facilities. Workers
performing the pruning must be trained in proper
pruning to provide aesthetic treatments while

protecting the health of the vegetation. Such work
is usually done with clippers, string trimmers, and
chainsaws. In some situations, it may be necessary
to clear root systems or remove embedded plant
material with more industrial equipment. Operators
must have proper training and education to operate
machinery in a safe manner. Limbs should be
trimmed four (4) feet back from the facility. In high
use sections of trail or pathway use, dead or dying
trees that have the possibility of falling on the facility
should be removed.

Debris Removal
Removal of debris is one of the fundamental needs
of the bike and pedestrian system and is necessary
to provide safe facilities while extending their life
expectancy. Keeping the facilities clear of mud and
sediment, fallen leaves, branches and fallen trees will
increase use while providing a safe environment for
users.

Drainage Control
Proper drainage protects the bicycle and pedestrian
system facilities from erosion damage. Facilities
should be routinely inspected to ensure that
all culverts, dips, bridges, low water crossings,
drainage ditches, and open box culverts are free
of debris and ready to function in the proper
manner especially during the rainy season in the
spring. Routine maintenance is not only necessary
but valuable in terms of labor, material, and money
saved on emergency repairs, and in the number of
days the facility is useable. Erosion repairs should
be made as quickly as possible to prevent further
damage to the facility.

Signs and Other Amenities
Signs, benches, kiosks, bollards and fencing need
to be kept clear to provide safe and aesthetically
pleasing elements along the trail, path or sidewalk.
Amenities that fall into disrepair are more susceptible
to vandals. Prompt repairs are essential to keep
vandalism from becoming a recurring problem.
These items also have life-cycle limits which should be
considered in the annual maintenance budget.
Signs provide both safety and information for users.
They provide users with their location, where they
are going, and the rules to safely use the facilities.
Upkeep of the signage along the system should be a
high priority.

Graffiti Removal
Prompt removal of graffiti will deter additional
graffiti and other destructive acts to the facilities
within the system. Once graffiti has been reported,
it should be removed as soon as possible. Providing
a system free of graffiti will increase usership by
increasing the perception of safety.

Facility Repair or Replacement
All of the facilities will require repair or replacement
at some time. Repair and replacement should be
closely tied to the inspection schedule. Setting
priorities for the repairs will be a part of the
inspection process. The time between observation
and the repair or replacement will depend on the
nature of the issue. If the problem requiring the
repair is deemed to be a hazard, and will affect the
safety of the user a higher priority will be set. The
time delay will also depend on whether the repair
can be performed by in-house maintenance staff
or if it so extensive that it will require an outside
entity. Some repairs are minor enough in nature that
they can be done with other capital projects such as
resurfacing a bike lane at the same time as repaving
an adjacent street. When repairs are required,
they should meet or exceed the original construction
specifications.

Seasonal Maintenance
Seasonal maintenance tasks should be performed
as needed and include leaf, snow, and ice removal.
When conditions cannot be improved to provide for
safe use, the facility should be closed to prevent the
risk of injury to the user. Designated maintenance
crews shall remove leaf debris, snow and ice from the
facilities. Leaf debris can be hazardous when wet
and special attention should be given to facilities with
higher usage. Ice and snow removal is necessary for
user safety but also to prevent damage caused to
the facility from the freeze-thaw cycle.
â¢ Leaf removal should be done through raking,
blowing and mulching as needed to provide a
clear and safe facility for users and to prevent
any storm water drainage or erosion issues.
â¢ Remove snow and ice from the facilities by
shoveling, picking, salt and sand as soon as
possible after a storm.

COST OF OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE

Operations and maintenance budgets should take
into account annual and long-range maintenance
over the life cycle of the facility. Annual operations
and maintenance costs vary depending on the facility
to be maintained, level of use, location, and standard
of maintenance. The following estimates should be
used for reference only as these costs will fluctuate
depending on actual conditions of the facilities within
the town. The estimates include field labor, materials,
equipment and administrative costs and are based
on national industry standards.

Paved Shared-use Path
Annual: Depending on the intensity of use and
development, the number of associated amenities
and the standard of care the typical cost to maintain
a paved shared-use path ranges from $4,000 to
$15,000 per mile. Volunteers may absorb all or
part of this cost.
Long-Range: Asphalt pathways usually have a 1012 year life. An overlay is usually required at this
time with a complete resurfacing after 20-25 years.
Concrete paths have a life cycle of twice as long.

Natural Surface Path
Annual: Maintenance costs range from $200 to
$2,000 per mile per year depending on usage and
level of development. Volunteers are valuable in
reducing this maintenance cost and can perform
many of the required tasks.
Long-Range: The day-to-day maintenance
performed on natural surface trails is usually
adequate for even the long-range maintenance of
the trail. Volunteers can also provide much of the
maintenance needed over the life of the trail. There
may be some administrative costs associated with the
natural trails but long-range maintenance costs are
negligible.

Greenway Trail
Annual: Crew sizes can range from 1 to 5 full time
employees once the system is fully developed.
This cost varies widely depending on the level of
maintenance for not only the trail but also adjacent

properties including stream banks and floodways.
The maintenance costs can range from $3,000 to
$20,000 per mile per year to maintain. Day-today maintenance and monitoring of greenway
facilities should be divided between volunteers and
maintenance crews when possible to lessen the impact
of these fees.
Long-Range: The majority of greenway trails will be
either asphalt or concrete. As such, they will require
the same long-range maintenance as the paved
shared-use path. Greenway trails which experience
regular flooding should be analyzed for a shorter
life cycles.

On-road Bicycle Facility

Annual: It is assumed that the Richmond Street
Department and INDOT will maintain the on-road
bicycle facility system. Additional sweeping will be
required where bike lanes are installed. Additional
attention should be paid to any potholes or other
pavement damage. Regular inspections should occur
every year to assess the condition of roadways with
bike lanes. Maintenance for these facilities can be
included as a part of street maintenance with costs
up to $250 per mile per year.

FUNDING OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE

Identifying current and future funding sources
specifically for the maintenance and management of
the bicycle and pedestrian system must be done to
ensure the longevity of the facilities. Development of
new facilities should only occur when a plan has been
completed for maintenance of the facility. Several
types of funding sources should be identified and
used in combination to fund the maintenance rather
than relying on one source of funding. This will
lessen the impact when one source has a short-fall.
The following are potential sources for funding the
operations and maintenance of facilities within the
system.

Budget Allocations
The most common source is through budget allocations
of existing departments. As facilities are added
to the system these budgets should be increased to
plan for the continued maintenance and repair of
the facilities. This is usually the base revenue for the
operations and maintenance of the facilities.

Public/Private Partnerships

Long-range: Long-range maintenance tasks for onroad bicycle facilities include repaving and restriping
when roadway improvements are implemented.
Pavement markings include bicycle lane lines, bicycle
stencil markings, and edge lines. This work should be
included with current street maintenance and would
have negligible costs.

The development of the new facilities will serve many
public and private entities providing benefits for
multiple departments including floodway and ditch
maintenance, street maintenance, utility access, and
enhancement of adjacent properties such as with
new sidewalk and cycle track development in the
downtown area. These shared benefits may present
the opportunity to share funding for tasks associated
with the up-keep of the facilities. This may include
business and residential association partnerships with
the city.

Sidewalks

In-kind Services

Annual: Typically sidewalks are maintained by
adjacent property owners with major repairs done
by the maintaining agency. Cracks, surface defects,
tree root damage, and other problems should be
identified on a regular basis and fixed to ensure
that sidewalks remain accessible to all types of
pedestrians. Sidewalk maintenance costs up to $100
per mile per year.
Long-range: Sidewalks will be constructed with
concrete which requires replacement every 50-75
years.

In-kind services can be an important tool in funding
the maintenance of the bicycle and pedestrian
facilities. These services might include routine
maintenance performed by volunteers, youth groups,
student labor and seniors. Services might also
include donations of materials and labor.

Revenue from Programming
The Richmond Parks and Recreation Department
should work to capture and direct fees and revenues
that are obtained from facility events and activities
into a fund that can be dedicated to operating and
maintaining the system. Programming events such as
fun-runs, bicycle races and other races can generate
revenues for the bicycle and pedestrian system.

MANAGEMENT
Richmond Metropolitan Development
Department
The Richmond Metropolitan Development
Department shall act as the lead agency for
implementing the plan. Duties for the Metropolitan
Development Department include carrying out the
recommendations of this plan including applying for
funding and managing the construction of projects.
Metropolitan Development Department staff will also
be responsible for proposing future alternative routes
and working with adjacent communities to coordinate
linkages. The Richmond Planning Department will be
responsible for creating and updating GIS layers of
all network facilities. Planning Department staff shall
provide guidance to developers when implementing
new projects in the town to incorporate proposed
facilities when appropriate.

Richmond Parks and Recreation Department
The Richmond Parks and Recreation Department shall
act as the lead agency for coordinating maintenance
tasks for the bicycle and pedestrian network. Duties
for the Parks Department include conducting routine
maintenance of greenways, naturalized trails and
other bicycle and pedestrian facilities located on
Parks Department property, and overseeing the
safety and operations of all facilities through Parks
Department property. Parks Department staff will
also be responsible for updating and publishing
maps, coordinating community events utilizing the
new facilities and running parks programs to help
supplement the facilities.

Richmond Street Department
The Richmond Street Department shall continue to
oversee the construction, day-to-day maintenance
tasks, and seasonal maintenance tasks of the multiuse trails adjacent to roadways, sidewalks, bike
lanes and any other bicycle and pedestrian facilities
located within or next to the street right-of-ways.

Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT)
INDOT should continue to design and build on-road
facilities along with maintaining all pedestrian
and bicycle facilities within the road right-ofways that are owned by the state. This includes
paved shoulders, bike lanes, crosswalks, pedestrian

signals, and sidewalks along state roads. Richmond
Metropolitan Development Department should
coordinate with INDOT anytime new projects are
proposed, or when repairs on existing facilities are
scheduled, to implement facilities as proposed on the
master plan.

Richmond Police Department
The Richmond Police Deparment shall act as the lead
agency for enforcement issues regarding the bicycle
and pedestrian system. Law enforcement along new
facilities should be dealt with in the same manner as
on any other public or private land within Richmond.
All local police officers should go through training
courses so that they are up to date with the most
current laws governing bicyclists and pedestrians
in Indiana. Safe use of the facilities will depend
largely on enforcement of policies identified for the
network especially on infrastructure in the outlying
areas with less exposure to surrounding traffic. The
Metropolitan Development Department and the
Parks and Recreation Department should work with
the Police Department to assess current needs and
availability for assisting in enforcement of network
facility rules.

Volunteers
Volunteers can provide services to help offset or
reduce the costs of construction and maintenance for
the system of facilities. The use of volunteer citizen
groups are especially valuable for a variety of
activities such as: trail construction and maintenance,
trash and litter control, exotic vegetation removal,
safety patrols, and educational outreach. Volunteer
groups can work with the City of Richmond and
stakeholders to promote growth and maintenance of
the system. By developing an organized volunteer
program, it will allow people to get involved with
implementation and upkeep of the system. The
Parks Department and the Street Department
shall organize/coordinate volunteer groups for the
facilities maintained by each respectively. Volunteer
opportunities might include:
â¢ Civic groups, youth organizations, or businesses
might want to adopt a section of a trail or
greenway and assume responsibility for litter
patrol and light maintenance.

curriculum guides, etc.
High school and college students seeking
recreation or conservation internships could
be recruited to provide a somewhat long-term
commitment maintaining facilities within the
network.
Law enforcement agencies could train volunteer
âtrail stewardsâ to assist with enforcement of trail
policies and rules.
High school and middle school students wishing to
perform community service might assist in a trail
clean-up day.

SAFETY AND LIABILITY ISSUES
Safety
The owner of a bicycle and pedestrian facility must
provide a safe facility for those that use it. The basic
components of a risk management program include
identification, evaluation, and treatment.
â¢ Identification â regular inspections shall be
conducted to identify potential risks and hazards.
â¢ Evaluation â evaluating the risk to determine the
likelihood of an accident due to the age of the
facility, amount of use, or poor design.
â¢ Treatment â treating the risk or notifying the user.
Treating the risk can include repair, redesign,
increased maintenance or reducing the use of the
facility. Treatment also might include prohibiting
use of the area. Notifying the user can include
posting signs notifying the user of the danger, or
by obtaining waivers from users of the facilities.
Implementation of such risk management
programs will minimize safety problems.

Liability
The public operating agency of the bicycle and
pedestrian facilities should fully understand the
liability associated with the specific types of facilities
and verify that insurance is adequate.
Some techniques which can help limit liability issues
include:
â¢ Implement a volunteer program to report
problems and safety issues.
â¢ Limit facilities to bicycles and pedestrians,

â¢
â¢
â¢
â¢

prohibiting motorized use.
Educate users and adjacent land owners
concerning private property rights through
signage, brochures and outreach.
Provide private property buffers such as
vegetative screens and fencing where possible.
Notify adjacent property owners of any
development plans or changes in policy.
Keep the lines of communication open between
public agencies and adjacent property owners.

Conflict Reduction
When a facility serves multiple user groups there will
be inherent conflicts that will arise. The bicycle and
pedestrian system shall work to reduce these conflicts
where possible. Some conflict reduction methods
include:
â¢ Recognize the different goals of different users
such as hikers and mountain bikers and separate
facilities where feasible
â¢ Plan and design to reduce conflicts between
users and adjacent property owners. Post rules
and regulations concerning reckless and unsafe
behavior, trespassing, littering and disturbances.
â¢ Provide user education through signage,
brochures and media.
â¢ Provide contact information for user input to
report problems, complaints and concerns.
â¢ Promote facility user etiquette
â¢ Develop a plan to respond to any illegal or
disturbing activity quickly.
â¢ Avoid excessive regulatory signage while
providing adequate signage to inform facility
users.

SW5.01 Purpose
This Chapter provides design policies which shall be used during a hydrologic
analysis performed within the City of Fort Wayneâs stormwater jurisdiction.

SW5.02 Rainfall
The probability that a storm event of a certain magnitude will occur in any
given year is expressed in terms of event frequency and return period. The
frequency, or exceedance probability, is a measure of how often a specific
rainfall event will be equaled or exceeded. For specific storm durations, a
rainfall intensity exists that corresponds to a given frequency. The intensityduration-frequency (IDF) curve provided in Figure SW5.1 illustrates the
average rainfall intensities corresponding to a particular storm frequency for
various storm durations. Figures SW5.2 and SW5.3 contain frequency and
duration of events based on rainfall intensity and rainfall depth, respectively.

The Huff rainfall distribution most accurately reflects rainfall conditions
in Fort Wayne. To use the Huff distribution, the Engineer specifies the
total depth of rainfall, the duration, and the proper quartile. The
distribution for each of the quartiles is provided in Figure SW5.4. Storm
distributions for hydrograph computation are determined by applying
the appropriate Huff Distribution for the following conditions:

4 â Lesser capacities may be considered, refer to Chapter SW8 for additional information.

SW5.03 Runoff
Proper calculation of runoff is critical to proper planning and sizing of storm
drainage facilities. This section identifies the methodology to be used for
determining the storm runoff design peaks and hydrograph generation for
preparation of storm drainage studies, plans, and facility designs.
1.

Time of Concentration Calculation
Time of Concentration (Tc) is the amount of time it takes for the most
hydraulically distant point in the watershed to contribute flow. Tc
influences the shape of the runoff hydrograph and has two
components:
ï·
ï·

The time for overland flow to occur from a point on the perimeter
to a natural or artificial drainage conduit or channel.
The travel time in the conduit or channel to the outflow point of the
catchment.

The minimum time of concentration for all computations shall be 5
minutes. Technical Release 55 (TR-55, June 1986) Chapter 3 provides
the procedure for calculating Tc. Refer to Exhibit SW5-1 for the Tc
worksheet.

2.

Peak Flow Calculations
Peak flow calculations represent the first level of runoff analysis. This
analysis is used to determine the maximum flow rate at a given point
resulting from a storm event. Peak flow analysis is sufficient to design
storm sewers and culverts whose purpose is only to convey runoff. As
indicated in Figure SW5.6, the Rational and Graphical Peak Discharge

June 1, 2015

4

City Utilities Design Standards Manual
Stormwater

Book 2 Chapter SW5
Hydrology

Methods are approved peak flow calculation methods for use in Fort
Wayne.
A. Rational Method
The Rational Method can be used to compute peak flows for
watershed areas less than twenty (20) acres. This method assumes
that all rainfall abstractions are represented by a single runoff
coefficient, C. Where distinctive land use features are known, use
of an area weighted C factor is required. The Rational Method
equation is:
Q= CiA
Where:
Q = Runoff (cfs)
i = Rainfall intensity (in/hr, see Figure SW5.2)
A = Drainage area (acres)
C = Runoff coefficient (see Exhibit SW5-2)
Using the Rational Method assumes:
ï§
ï§
ï§

The rainfall intensity is uniform over the entire
watershed during the entire storm duration.
The storm duration is equal to Tc.
The Tc is the time required for the runoff from the most
remote part of the watershed to reach the point under
design.

B. Graphical Peak Discharge Method - (TR-55)
The Graphical Peak Discharge Method uses the runoff curve number
(CN), where CN > 40. This number is a function of soil type and land
use. For details on using the NRCS (SCS) procedure refer to TR-55,
June 1986. This method is implemented by first applying the
following equations to calculate the runoff depth:
Q = (P-0.2*S)2/(P+0.8*S) and S=(1000/CN)-10
Where:
Q = Runoff depth (in)
P = Rainfall depth (in, see Figure SW5.3)
S = Retention (in)
CN = Curve number (see Exhibit SW5-3 & Exhibit SW5-4)

June 1, 2015

5

City Utilities Design Standards Manual
Stormwater

Book 2 Chapter SW5
Hydrology

Peak discharge is estimated as:
qp = qu *A*Q*Fp
Where:
qp =Peak flow rate (cfs)
qu = Unit peak flow rate (cfs/mi2 per inch of runoff, refer to TR-55)
A =Drainage area (mi2)
Q = Runoff depth calculated from previous equation (in)
Fp = Pond and swamp adjustment factor
= 1 if there are no ponds or swamps
3.

Hydrograph Generation Methods
A hydrograph represents runoff flow as it varies over time at a particular
location. The area under the hydrograph represents the total volume of
runoff. As opposed to peak rate of runoff, the hydrograph accounts for
the variation in volume and flow rate over the duration of the of the
storm event. Hydrographs are necessary to assess the effects of
stormwater detention/retention facilities. Hydrographs are also
necessary for assessing the effects of combining runoff from two or
more subcatchments discharging to a common location in complex
drainage areas with multiple subcatchments.
Hydrologic modeling software or the Tabular Hydrograph Method listed
in Figure SW5.5 are approved methods for hydrograph generation.
Engineers are responsible for understanding the limitations and correct
application of modeling software used for hydrograph generation. For
details on the Tabular Hydrograph Method refer to TR-55, June 1986. In
some cases detailed hydrologic studies may have been completed for
the area of interest, and can be used with approval from City Utilities.

Where the offsite area is fully or partially undeveloped, the runoff shall be
calculated assuming the basin is fully developed. Fully developed land use
parameters (i.e. C and CN) shall be based on current zoning.
Downstream analysis of the impacts of drainage improvements shall be
completed to a point in the receiving watercourse where an increase in
the stage of the receiving stream during the design storm is less than or
equal to 0.14 feet (0.14â).
