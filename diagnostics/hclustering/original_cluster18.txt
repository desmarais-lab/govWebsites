***** Why_should_I_spay_or_neuter_my_pet? *****


It is nearly springtime again and along with hearing the birds singing and the
bees buzzing it is a busy time for animal shelters to have many puppies and
kittens brought in. The nice weather and warmer temperatures after a long
winter encourage many owners to let their animals outside. This is wonderful
for the animal too, unless they are not spayed or neutered.
Unfortunately, an estimated 2.7 million dogs and cats are euthanized each year
due to overpopulation according to the Association for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals.
Even being a purebred dog does not give that animal a safe ticket to a new home
as 25% of the 55% of dogs and puppies being put down are purebreds. 71% of cats
and kittens entering shelters are put down each year. In the U.S. 70,000
puppies and kittens are born each day compared to the 10,000 human babies born
daily. There simply are not enough homes for each animal.
Spaying or neutering is the solution to this overpopulation problem. Consult
your veterinarian to determine the age at which the spay or neuter process for
your pet can occur. Spaying is for the female and it is the removal of both
ovaries and the uterine horns. Neuter is for males and it is the removal of
both testicles. These operations are not painful because the animal is under
anesthesia. When the animal wakes up it is usually back to its normal activity
within 24-72 hours.
There are many benefits to your pet&rsquo;s health when you spay or neuter. For
the female there will not be the heat cycles twice a year that can leave
bloodstains on the floor and it will reduce shedding. There will be no chance
of her developing Pyometra-a uterine infection that causes many deaths in
unspayed females. Also her chances of developing breast cancer and mammary
tumors will be minimal. For males, neutering keeps him from developing
testicular cancer. This means less money could be spent on medical bills for
your pet. There is also a reduced city pet registration fee for sterilized
animals ($5 annual fee for spayed or neutered pet OR $100 not fixed) and the
behavior modifications are rewarding.
Sterilization does not change your pet&rsquo;s personality or cause weight gain
as many myths suggest. Any changes brought about by spaying or neutering are
generally positive. There is a reduction of many behavioral issues. Neutered
male cats usually stop territorial spraying. This leads to a reduction of
roaming and finding females in heat. Research shows that 80% of dogs hit by
cars are un-neutered males. The idea that males do not need neutered because
they do not give birth is misleading. While females can only have one litter at
a time, male animals can impregnate many females each day. Males being neutered
leads to less aggression and they are less likely to bite. Spayed and neutered
animals make better pets and are more loyal to their families. Spaying and
neutering also saves taxpayer dollars. It costs over $100 dollars to capture,
house, feed, and euthanize a homeless animal and when your looking at over 7.5
million animals a year, it all ads up.
Spaying and neutering is not as expensive as many pet owners think. There are
many communities with sterilization programs and one can usually find a low
cost spay and neuter clinic in their area. Including SNAP, which stands for
Spay Neuter Assistance Program. Asking your veterinarian about programs that
provide aid is a good place to start. Encouraging friends and neighbors to spay
or neuter their pets is beneficial to their animals and will also keep your
pets safe.


***** Small_animals_are_no_small_task *****


No matter what pet you decide to adopt, be sure it&rsquo;s the right pet for
your family.
Do you have a busy lifestyle? Are you away from home a lot? Who will take care
of your pet(s) if you are not there? What type of budget do you have to feed
and care for your pet?
For those reasons and more, many families will make the choice to adopt a
&ldquo;small animal.&rdquo; A small animal is typically a pet that will spend
much of its time in a cage; a rabbit, ferret, hamster, guinea pig, parakeet,
rat, mouse, or gerbil. Get a cage, fill it with bedding and give it food and
water, what could be simpler, right? WRONG!
Did you know that small animals need just as much, if not more stimulation than
many other pets? Because these pets spend much of their time in a cage, it is
very important to be sure they are getting proper exercise, nutrition and
attention. They are more social than many people think.
Some other important factors to consider are:
   1. How long will our pet live
   2. Who will be the primary care-giver for our pet
   3. How active is our pet
   4. What type of time commitment will I need to care for our new pet
Many small animals have teeth that continue to grow throughout their lifetime
and need things to chew on so their teeth can remain healthy. Rabbits, guinea
pigs and other small pocket pets will need appropriate outlets for their
chewing!
Small pets are also sensitive to extreme temperature changes and can have
delicate respiratory systems. Being sure that their bedding is appropriate for
their species as well as keeping their living space clean and dry is critical.
Just like dogs and cats, small animals need food, water and shelter. They also
need attention, mental/physical stimulation and veterinary care.
Fort Wayne Animal Care &amp; Control has many small animals available for
adoption including rabbits and small birds ($10), guinea pigs, mice rats,
gerbils and hamsters (all $5 each) and ferrets ($50).
To see current availability visit www.fwacc.org and click the adopt link and
choose other.

***** Holiday_cautions *****


The holidays are a great time for fun decorations, presents, and lots of good
food.
Just remember that while the holidays are fun for you they can pose many un-
suspecting dangers to your pets.
Christmas trees for example, can be very dangerous if your pet should ingest
pine needles, ornaments, tinsel, or ribbon. If you use an additive in the water
of a Christmas tree, cover the water with foil to keep your pet from drinking
it. Always supervise your pets around decorations &ndash; especially those with
electrical wires that a pet might chew or become tangled in.
Be sure to keep a close eye on doors leading to the outside. Many pets escape
and become lost as the family come and go for festivities. Always keep a collar
and identification tags on your pet for its safety.
After big family meals, be sure to seal the garbage and remove it from the
home. Chicken, turkey, and ham bones are a real temptation and if chewed by
your pet, could splinter and create an emergency situation. Food from the
dining room isn&rsquo;t the only danger waiting to make your pet sick. Many
holiday plants can be poisonous, so be sure to keep them out of reach. All
around avoid the temptation to indulge your pets. The best advice is to keep
your animals diet the same as it is the rest of the year.
Presents are always nice, whether giving, or receiving. Just keep in mind that
animals have a powerful sense of smell. If you give a gift of candy or food to
some one with a pet, let them know that a pet might try to investigate it, so
they can place the gift out of the pet&rsquo;s reach.
Adopting a new pet can bring the best of holiday joy to any family. Discuss it
with all your family members and think it through. An animal can have
difficultly adjusting to busy schedules and excess activity, but for many
families, the holidays can be about quiet time with those you love. Be sure if
you are adding a new pet to your family this holiday season you do so knowing a
new pet will do better with additional attention, learning a routine, and
getting to know your expectations. Make the holidays a happy and safe
experience for all &ndash; including your pets.
Happy Holidays from all of us here at Fort Wayne Animal Care &amp; Control.

Final defendant pleads guilty for role in Richmond Hill explosion case
(Indianapolis, Ind.) Marion County Prosecutor Terry Curry announced today that Glenn
Hults has pleaded guilty to Assisting a Criminal (Class D Felony) for his involvement in the
Richmond Hill explosion that occurred in November 2012 on the south side of Indianapolis.
Hults admitted his knowledge and subsequent failure to notify law enforcement of Mark
Leonard, Bob Leonard, Jr., Monserrate Shirley, and Gary Thompson‚Äôs intent to destroy
Shirley‚Äôs home for insurance money. The incident at Shirley‚Äôs residence ignited an explosion
and resulting fire at the next door home of John D. and Jennifer Longworth, causing their
deaths. Numerous nearby homes were also damaged in the explosion.
Pursuant to the plea agreement, a potential sentence for Hults is left to the discretion of the
court. A sentencing hearing is scheduled for December 28 at 1:00 p.m. in Criminal Court 3.
Mark Leonard and Bob Leonard, Jr. were previously convicted by a jury and sentenced to
Life Without Parole for their roles in the crime. A fourth individual, Gary Thompson, pleaded
guilty in August to Conspiracy to Commit Arson (Class A Felony). A sentencing hearing is
scheduled for December 2 at 10:30 a.m. in Criminal Court 3. Pursuant to the plea
agreement, Thompson will receive a 30 year sentence, with 20 years executed in the

a.m. in Criminal Court 3.

 ======================== South Bend ======================== Democratic ======================== 
 ======================== South Bend ======================== Democratic ======================== 
 ======================== South Bend ======================== Democratic ======================== 

LEGAL DEPARTMENT REPORT - 2002
I. OVERVIEW
In 2002 the City of South Bend Legal Department continued its role of providing support,
advice, and representation to various units of the City of South Bend and representing the City in
litigation in state and federal courts, and before administrative agencies.
During 2002, the eight attorneys of the City Attorney‚Äôs staff provided assistance to all of the
departments and divisions within the City of South Bend, together with various City and City-related
boards, commissions, and authorities, including the Alcoholic Beverage Board, the Human Rights
Commission, the Board of Zoning Appeals, the Redevelopment Commission, Redevelopment
Authority, Board of Public Safety, Board of Public Works, Park Board, the Century Center Board,
and the Historic Preservation Commission.
The Legal Department provides advice to each of these departments and entities with respect
to the conduct of their business under local, state, and federal law so that each entity will operate in
compliance with all legal requirements. The department also represents the City in disputes in state
and federal court and before administrative agencies in order to protect the City‚Äôs interests when the
City has been named as a defendant in lawsuits or administrative actions or to advance the City‚Äôs
interests when the City has a claim against a third party and litigation is the only way to achieve that
goal of advancing and protecting the City‚Äôs claims and interests.
The department also engages in negotiations with outside parties to establish the City‚Äôs role
in various projects and undertakings and prepares a variety of documents to memorialize the
relationships which have been established to provide the framework for an ongoing relationship.
II. SELF-INSURANCE
The department managed the City‚Äôs self-insurance liability paying out $341,655.19 in claims
against the City in 2002. If the risks covered by the self insurance program had been fully insured,
the estimated premiums would have been in the $2.5 Million to $5 Million range. The cost savings
are thus substantial although the amount of payout varies substantially from year to year. The history
of the City‚Äôs liability self-insurance cost is as follows:
2002
2001
2000
1999
1998
1997

$ 341.655.19
$ 648,242.73
$1,121,523.20
$ 541,026.11
$ 414,674.30
$ 354,633.16

The claims review process, in conjunction with the defense, negotiation, and settlement process,
assists City departments in identifying areas of risk and engenders discussion and action on the best
way to manage that risk.

III. PROSECUTION OF ORDINANCE VIOLATIONS
The Legal Department also prosecutes claims in the local courts for violations of City
ordinances, occasionally through the injunction process, but most often through civil actions to
collect fines. During 2002, $122,226.37 was collected for ordinance violations and other
miscellaneous claims. This history of collections for ordinance violations is as follows:
2002
2001
2000
1999
1998

$122,226.37
$114,053.78
$ 78,713.17
$ 75,446.00
$ 70,797.92

The Legal Department has begun discussions with the St. Joseph County Auditor‚Äôs Office
to use tax billings as an additional collection method to increase to overall efficiency of collections.
IV. LEGISLATIVE SERVICES
Legislative work of the department includes preparation of proposed ordinances to be
submitted to the South Bend Common Council and review of proposed state legislation pending
before the Indiana General Assembly. The attorneys from the Legal Department and the Common
Council Attorney meet regularly to confer on issues of mutual concern.
V. TRAINING ON LEGAL ISSUES
The Legal Department also provides information and training to City employees on changes
in the law. Members of the City Attorney‚Äôs staff have provided training to the South Bend Police
Department, the Department of Community and Economic Development, and the Department of
Code Enforcement with respect to various issues.
VI. LITIGATION
At the end of 2002, the Legal Department was involved in the following litigation on behalf
of the City of South Bend:
Litigation Area

City as Plaintiff

Code Enforcement
Injunctions
Police Actions
Vehicles Accidents
Contract Disputes

Minor miscellaneous matters not included in this table are: Foreclosures with the City named
because of its judgment liens, infraction cases in Small Claims Court, and Code Enforcement
collections in Small Claims Court.
The Legal Department also participated in five (5) mediation sessions in 2002 in an attempt
to resolve disputes in litigation. Three (3) of the five (5) mediation sessions resulted in settlement
of the dispute.
Department attorneys also participated in the following administrative hearings in 2002:

No major litigation was concluded during 2002. Significant litigation in process included
the challenge to the City‚Äôs Adult Business Ordinance, the construction contract dispute involving
the Leighton Center Parking Garage, the challenge to the State‚Äôs current annexation laws, and the
Roseland water/sewer dispute.

VII. NEGOTIATIONS
Negotiations during 2002 involving department attorneys included collective bargaining with
Teamster‚Äôs Local 364 and FOP Lodge 36, settlement negotiations and mediation to resolve pending
claims and litigation, and project term negotiations to assist economic development activity.

Walking dogs is just plain fun. They make me laugh out loud at their antics in
the pooch playground. I especially like it when they hop up on the bench next
to me when we sit down to rest and insist on some good attention. ~Ken O.
I volunteer because I want to make a difference in my community. It is such a
rewarding experience that allows me to help animals find a forever home all
while showing them love. I get paid in wagging puppy tails and purring cats!
That goes to show the saying is true, the best things in life are free!

Volunteering is all about educating people; responsibilities, breed
characteristics, simple care, and loving an animal.  It&rsquo;s about match
making for the good of the people and their adopted friends.
It&rsquo;s about the tears for a lost animal, the joy of a furry friend, the
delight of a child holding their new buddy, the satisfaction of a good match
and the chance for a new home and new beginning for all.
It&rsquo;s about doing good with no pay or accolades other than a smile, a hug
and a lot of wet kisses.
Volunteering is about the satisfaction of saying goodbye to a happy family with
their newly adopted pet.  Mostly, the second chance made possible for all our
animals, all with big hearts wrapped in fur. ~ Marty L.
[Dan]
I started volunteering with my little sister about four years ago, mainly
because I wanted to do something besides school that I could easily fit around
my schedule (and working with the animals is a huge perk!). I stayed because
it's always a joy to see an animal go home and I love working with the other
volunteers and staff. I believe in what we do. ~Mary M.
 
 
[Rebecca Gremaux]My experience over the years as a volunteer at Animal Care
&amp; Control has been rewarding and fun. I have participated in the dog wash
program as well as the headstart training program. I love working with the
dogs.  They each have their own personalities and teach me something new every
time I work with one of them. I like to think they are here to teach me about
my own humanity. One of the many rewards of volunteering is that I met some of
the best people. When you care for the animals, you show that you have a big
heart and a willing spirit. I am truly grateful for my volunteer experience.

Defendants sentenced for roles in 2013 Robbery and Murder
(Indianapolis, Ind.) Marion County Prosecutor Terry Curry announced today that Ryan
Clark and Janai Hudson were sentenced for their roles in the Sept. 25, 2013, robbery of a
BP/Rickers gas station at 38th Street and High School Road. Attendant Evalide Ndyiae was
shot and killed during the robbery.
Ryan Clark was sentenced to 40 years in the Indiana Department of Correction for his role
in the BP/Rickers robbery and a second robbery that took place that same evening. In
August Clark pleaded guilty to Robbery Resulting in Serious Bodily Injury (Level 2 Felony).
He was also found guilty by jury of Robbery (Class B Felony) and Resisting Law
Enforcement (Class D Felony) in August for his involvement in the robbery of a Speedway
gas station at 71st Street and Keystone Avenue.
Janai Hudson was sentenced to 30 years with 15 years suspended for her role in the
BP/Rickers robbery. She pleaded guilty in August to Conspiracy to Commit Robbery (Class
A Felony). Upon completion of her executed time Hudson will be required to complete 80
hours of community service in the form of presentations to high school students about the
importance of decision making.
Shayne Thompson was previously convicted and sentenced for the murder of Ndyiae and
his involvement in both robberies. Additionally, Thompson pleaded guilty for his role in a
home invasion on the east side of Indianapolis. He is currently serving a 110 year executed
sentence in the Indiana Department of Correction for those crimes.
A charge of a crime is merely an accusation, and the defendant is presumed innocent until and
unless proven guilty.

employees: one Supervisor, one Installation and Repair person, one Assistant
Installation and Repair person, five Parking Control Enforcement Officers, and one parttime supervisor for the VES Program. One New Enforcement Officer will be added in
2006 due to Aboite Annexation and the Carroll Road Annexation in 2007.
Working under the control of the City Clerk this department generates revenue for the
city through enforcement of applicable laws and city policies relating to vehicles parking
in violation of city statutes, and city policies relating to residential parking and
abandoned vehicle code infractions.
Goals and Objectives:
In 2006 we completed our 5-year program of replacing all outdated meters within the
City with electronic digital meters. In 2006 we replaced our 9 year old auto-cites with an
upgraded auto-cite with single unit construction, built in printer, color camera and full
color display with many other options available. Upon recommendation of City Fleet
Manager, we will continue to replace vehicles on our ‚ÄúVehicle Cycle Program‚Äù with
hybrid vehicles to save in fuel costs.
Continue to educate the public regarding disabled parking through the VES (Volunteer
Enforcement Specialist).

METROPOLITAN DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE
The Metropolitan Development Committee of the City-County Council met on Monday,
February 6, 2006. Chair Dane Mahern called the meeting to order at 5:33 p.m. with the
following members present: Ron Gibson, Scott Keller, Angela Mansfield, Marilyn
Pfisterer and Steve Talley. Arriving shortly thereafter were Councillors Jackie Nytes and
Mike Speedy. Absent was Lance Langsford.
PROPOSAL NO. 437, 2005 - requires project sponsors who receive Federal entitlement
funds distributed by the Department of Metropolitan Development employ at least ten
(10) persons on any such project so funded from the service district of the sponsor
Chair Mahern stated that the sponsor and the members of the Department of Metropolitan
Development have been meeting but would like to further study the proposal.
Councillor Gibson moved, seconded by Councillor Talley, to hold the proposal for
further study. The motion carried by a vote of 6-0.
[Clerk‚Äôs note: Councillor Nytes arrived 5:36 p.m.]
Great Indy Neighborhoods Initiative and Economic Improvement Districts ‚Äì presentation
by William Taft
William Taft, Program Director for Local Initiative Support Corporation (LISC),
discussed the Economic Improvement Districts (Exhibit A, attached). He said LISC is
involved in the Fostering Commercial Urban Strategies (FOCUS) initiative for the City
of Indianapolis. FOCUS is a commercial corridor revitalization program that was
developed four years ago.
[Clerk‚Äôs note: Councillor Speedy arrived 5:40 p.m.]
Mr. Taft said LISC has been working in implementing Economic Improvement Districts
(EIDs) in which property owners in a certain area can choose to assess additional
property taxes against themselves. He said excess dollars collected are directed back to
the neighborhood, and a neighborhood governing board decides how the funds are used.
Mr. Taft said the majority of the property owners have to agree with the increase in
property tax before EIDs can be established. He said some of the neighborhoods that
have shown an interest in EIDs are: Fountain Square, Massachusetts Avenue corridor,
East 10th Street, Indiana Avenue, and Downtown.
Councillor Mansfield asked if consideration has been given to increased taxes on
businesses in the selected districts. Mr. Taft said the districts that tend to adopt EIDs are
those that are on the upswing and would look at EIDs as an investment.
Councillor Gibson asked where in Indiana they are currently doing the EIDs initiative.

Metropolitan Development Committee
February 9, 2006
Page 3
Mr. Taft said cities that compare to Indianapolis that use EIDs are: Denver, Cleveland,
Chicago, etc. Councillor Gibson asked if there are some neighborhoods that are currently
pursuing a petition with the Council to establish EIDs. Mr. Taft said the three that seem
interested are: Massachusetts Avenue corridor, Fountain Square, and Downtown.
Councillor Pfisterer asked if property owners in EIDs who are against the increase are
still assessed. Mr. Taft replied in the affirmative. Councillor Pfisterer asked if there is a
standard levy assess. Mr. Taft said this is part of what is being evaluated.
Councllor Keller said Massachusetts Avenue has done something similar to EIDs where
some businesses put in an extra $50 a month, and with that money they were able to hire
extra security, flowers for the neighborhood, and receive matching grants from various
groups.
Councillor Nytes asked for an investigation on the feasibility of using EIDs to support
capital improvements and green space within the neighborhood. Mr. Taft said that
investigation can be done.
Councillor Speedy asked if the procedures of the neighborhood board are through State
law. Mr. Taft said the board and board procedures have to be approved by Council.
Councillor Speedy asked if EIDs is similar to the Barrett Law. Mr. Taft said functionally
it is similar to the Barrett Law.
Mr. Taft continued with the second half of his presentation and said the Great Indy
Neighborhoods initiative was started by neighborhood development organizations in
Indianapolis. In October 2004 a Community Development Summit was held where
community leaders discussed what was important to their neighborhoods and their vision.
Mr. Taft gave a presentation on Great Indy Neighborhoods which can be found at
www.greatindyneighborhoods.org. Great Indy Neighborhoods is based on 11 principles
of healthy neighborhoods (Exhibit B, attached):
1. Leadership
2. Vision
3. Education
4. Safety
5. Collaboration
6. Economy
7. Environment
8. Housing
9. Culture
10. Mixed-use
11. Services
