BOARD OF PARKS AND RECREATION
CONSOLIDATED CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS
October 23, 2014
The meeting of the Board of Parks and Recreation was called to order by Chairman
Williams, Thursday, October 23, 2014, at 3:45 p.m. at 200 East Washington Street, Public
Assembly Room, 2nd Floor ‚Äì City County Building, Indianapolis Indiana 46204.
Board Members Present:

Chairman, John Williams, Mr. Joe Wynns,
Ms. Anne Valentine and Mr. Josh Bowling

Staff Present:

Louvenia Holstein, Board Secretary
Suzanne Martin, Assistant Board Secretary
Doug Kowalski, Deputy Corporation Counsel

Directors Announcements:
Chairman Williams greeted the Board and the audiance and he welcomed them to the Board
of Parks and Recreation and before we get started he has a couple of announcements.
Chairman Williams stated that Indy Parks was recently recognized, and he rephrased that
the Taylor Siefker Williams Design Group was recently recognized by the Indiana American
Society of Landscape Architects for the work that they did on the Greenways Master Plan.
This was called an honor award so just another one of those things to demonstrate the
partnership that we have and the work that we do in the park system and the folks that we
contract with and work with on a day-to-day basis, do great work for Indy Parks. Chairman
Williams stated that he would like to thank Ron Taylor and his group for all the hard work
that has gone into the development of the Greenways Master Plan, the Full Circle Plan, Don
and his planning group, Andre in particular for all the work that they have done and staff for
all your hard work in helping them bring that stuff together. We appreciate everything that
you have done to help out in that regard. The other thing that he wants to say is that this last
year, he thinks we have had had a great year with regard with the types of Days of Service
events we have had in our park system. He would like to say thanks to the Parks
Foundation and their group because they have helped us with some of the major sponsors
that we have and major donors that have refreshed a few of our family centers and he
thanks them for all their support. All the other folks there are too many to mention this year.
The year is not over and we have projects going this weekend as a matter of fact. This past
year we have had over 900,000 of value from individuals, groups, corporations that have
come through days of service and worked at our facilities. That is amazing. We can‚Äôt do
what we do without the support of the community. He would like to thank everyone who has
been a part of that and the things that they do on a day-to-day basis to realize that type of
investment in Indy Parks. Thank you.
Approval of Minutes: August 28, 2014
A motion was duly made by Ms. Valentine, seconded by Mr. Bowling, and unanimously
passed to approve the minutes from August 28, 2014 Indy Parks Board meeting.

New Business
1. Agenda Item #33, 2014 ‚Äì Indy Parks staff is recommending that the Board of Parks
and Recreation of the Consolidated City of Indianapolis, Indiana approve the five year
(5-year) extension to the existing agreements for the Management and Operation of
the City of Indianapolis thirteen (13) golf courses owned by DPR through 2024 which
are as follows:
ÔÇ∑
ÔÇ∑
ÔÇ∑
ÔÇ∑
ÔÇ∑
ÔÇ∑

Cooprider Golf Management for the operation of Sahm Golf Course, Douglass
Golf Course, and Whispering Hills;
M.A.N. Golf Management for the operation of Coffin Golf Course, Riverside
Golf Course and Riverside Golf Academy;
Capital City Golf Management for the operation of Thatcher Golf Course, South
Grove Golf Course and Winding River Golf Course;
R.N. Thompson for the operation of Smock Golf Course;
Denny Ford, Inc. and Fored, Inc. for the operation of Pleasant Run Golf Course
and Sarah Shank Golf Course; and
T&M Golf Management for the operation of Eagle Creek Golf Course.

Kent Knorr stated that we are actually at a very early stage in their process but they wanted
to come before the Board today just to give you an update on where they are looking to go
with the current golf agreements. They are in their 5th year of these agreements which run
through December 2019. What they would like to do is meet with their operators and start a
discussion on possibly extending those for an addition five (5) years. Right now with the
current trends in golf they have seen a downturn in both play and revenue starting with the
recession basically. There may be some leveling off of this and the potential is definitely
there for growth but they didn‚Äôt see it again this year. If you recall, spring weather was not
real good for golf. Their numbers this year are pretty stagnate from last year. The hope is
though is by doing an additional five (5) year, they can continue with agreements that they
feel are more favorable to Indy Parks. During the previous negotiations they passed capital
improvement projects to the operators and they also passed on responsibilities of utilities
and maintenance costs. The hope is, as they look at meeting with their operators that they
can meet with them to look at revenue potential increases along with keeping those with
pieces of the operation attached to the golf courses. It really is at an early stage and they
will start that process of meeting with the operators and hopefully be able to move forward
either later this year or early next year with an agreement. At this point they just wanted to
notify you of this process and hope that they can execute an extension in their near future.
Chairman Williams asked the Board if they have any questions. Mr. Wynns asked if there has
been any assessment of what the capital needs are going to be for the next five years. He
thinks this is critical because that has not been done and you are going to pass the costs onto
the pros and the revenue is already short at this time, he can see them getting into a debate
with the pro‚Äôs, for instance, at Smock with the bridge going out. Mr. Wynns stated that if you
don‚Äôt know what the capital improvements are going to be for those courses for the next five
years, and are going to pass that on to the pro and the pros are going to come back and say,
‚ÄúI have to adjust my revenue because they can‚Äôt make those improvements‚Äù, and pay the
current revenue that is in the contract. He is wondering how this is going to work. He stated
2

that the pros will state 2 to 3 years down the road that they didn‚Äôt know this was going to
happen. Just like who should now fix the bridge at Smock golf course. He is just wondering
how far along with that assessment on the capital needs of the course. Chairman Williams
stated that this is a good question. One of the things that we feel like is very advantageous for
us is specifically for those kinds of circumstances. For example, the bridge that you are
speaking of he assumes is the Pleasant Run. This is the only one that the Chairman knows
of, unless Don knows of... Mr. Wynns stated, yes, he meant Pleasant Run. Chairman
Williams stated that this is a very good example and the current agreement calls out for these
maintenance items which may turn into capital and are the responsibility of the contractor. We
feel, and we have talked with some of them and they have been amenable to this extension,
because they understand too that an extension gives them a little bit more time to recoup
some of these types of activities so we feel like if we don‚Äôt do this now, and unless golf turns
around he is fairly confident that when we put this back out to bid in five years they have
learned the gambit of things and they know that some of these things that they have
experienced so, they will not be able to negotiate that into a contract. They will say ‚Äúno‚Äù they
are only going to this capital project or that capital project and that is it. This puts us at a
disadvantage. The way these contracts are structured right now, really leverages those kinds
of unknown capital projects to be done by the vender and it is clearly stated in there. We
believe that if we are working with them being able to extend this agreement, it gives them to
see golf hopefully turn around and profit starts going back up a little bit and therefore being
able for them to do the things needed to be successful at the golf courses. Then again, in the
last three years that he has been here, as Kent has said, golf has pretty much been at a plato.
Mr. Wynns stated that before, going back in history when Leon Younger was the director of
Parks and in the negotiations of the contracts, there was a percentage of the greens fees set
aside for capital improvements and where the Pro and the director would agree on how much
money was to be spent and that money was determined by agreement between Indy Parks
and the Pros. Then it was determined between the Pro and the director on any capital
improvement fee and if after that improvement fee was paid then remaining money was
returned back to the department. This always guaranteed there was money set aside and for
some reason, over the years, that piece was taken out of the golf contracts. He is just
concerned with the capital. He is concerned with that capital piece because that capital piece
can really be a digger. You could lose 2 or 3 greens out there and all of a sudden it is push ‚Äì
pull of who covers these costs. Chairman Williams stated that this is a good point and again
the current language in the contracts that we have had, and Doug you can correct him if he is
wrong, places that responsibility on to the contractor. The vendor has that responsibility and
they know that. He is fairly confident that if we are to put this out to bid in a few more years
they will come back very strong against something like that. Because our staff has been in
conversation with them on how golf is doing. We know that they have been struggling with the
challenges of borrowing a little more money and if we give them more time, so they can move
into the direction they need to accomplish this, and then do the things that contractually are
already there. This sets us up for Indy golf to be more favorable in the event that golf goes
down in the next five years.
Mr. Wynns stated that he would like us to be more sensitive to the courses like Douglas and
Coffin. At Coffin he could lose his whole back 9 with a flood and he knows that the revenue at
Coffin is not great and if this would happen to put that course back in place. He just thinks
that it deserves a little sensitivity because that is a flood plain and the whole back 9 could be
washed away.
3

Chairman Williams asked if there were any other questions from the Board. There were none.
Mr. Wynns stated that this would actually take it out to 2019? Kent replied that this would
actually take it out until 2024. Their current contracts go until 2019 and with this it adds an
additional 5 years onto the current agreement. Mr. Wynns stated, so in essence. Chairman
Williams interrupted Mr. Wynns and stated that this is what happened here recently, we went
to the bank to try to refinance because what had happened at Eagle Creek and we had a
very difficult time with doing that because of what had transpired. Another scenario was we
had a couple golf course operators that were having an extremely tough time securing the
resources they needed to fulfill their obligation as is stated in the current contracts. They
were supposed to tear down and build brand new facilities and they couldn‚Äôt obtain the
financing to do so. Part of that is because golf had gone down and they didn‚Äôt have the time
left on the agreement to be able to secure that loan and they were not able to say what their
amount of revenue was going to be for a certain number of years so again, with this we want
to forward thinking and be proactive and say, well if we have an opportunity to lock this in
now, let‚Äôs go ahead and do this. The agreement, the way that it states now gives us that
opportunity ability based on everything that we have done, from the RFP process all the way
to the contract to lock this in so that we have the most favorable agreements that we can
possibly have.
A motion was duly made by Ms. Valentine, seconded by Mr. Wynns, and unanimously
passed to approve Agenda Item #33, 2014.
Chairman Williams stated that what they are asking for here is the approval from the Board
to authorize him as the director, to enter into an extension of this agreement. And as Kent
stated, if we don‚Äôt believe that the negotiations that transpire are favorable, then they will not
execute an extension of the agreement. What is needed here is to have the authority from
the Board for us to enter into that level of discussion.
2. Agenda Item Resolution #33, 2014 ‚Äì Indy Parks staff is recommending that the Board
of Parks and Recreation of the Consolidated City of Indianapolis, Indiana approve the
transfer of real estate parcels #8005144 (5115 Michigan Road) and #8006931 (5106
Grandview Drive) property from the Washington Township Trustee, to the Board of
Parks and Recreation for the City of Indianapolis.
Don Colvin thanked the Board Secretary and stated that he wasn‚Äôt sure if the Board knows
but Paul Smith, Real Estate Manager for the City of Indianapolis has moved on in his career
and accepted the position as the Director of SEND down in the Fountain Square area and he
believes it will be Andre and Don who will be presenting the real estate items to the Parks
Board now. We will miss him very much. He received a nice going away party and during
Paul‚Äôs tenure here working for Parks brought in just under 15 acres of parkland and at little
or no cost to the City. Paul was very good with negotiation skills and a very likable guy and
could meet with folks and explain the pluses and the minuses and worked very closely with
the Parks Foundation who ends up being a repository for many of the gifts that come to the
Parks Department, particularly in the land area. We are all going to miss Paul Don stated
that he will never be able to fill his shoes but he will at least be able to get through the
business of the day. This resolution is in regards to a very interesting property basically at
4

Michigan Road and Grandview going over to Juan Solomon Park. The Washington
Township Trustee owned this property and they will be talking about today only the property
that is outlined in red on the overhead screen. Lori will speak to you regarding the
grassroots efforts from the community but from the technical side the Trustees Office is
donating this and it is an inter-governmental transfer of property. All of the infrastructure has
been removed and grated and is now level ground. Andre Denman did a conceptual plan
and the community wanted this to be a simple green space and this isn‚Äôt one that will have
water fountains and necessarily playgrounds on it. It really is just sort of a gateway into their
community. There will be a simple parking lot for guests to arrive and park. There will be
some connectivity with a few walking paths and benches and just a simple reflective space
that may eventually receive a piece of artwork.
He will now let Lori Hazlett speak about the future funding opportunities that goes along with
this particular park. (Highwoods Park). Don stated that all they are asking the Board to
approve today is receipt of this particular parcel of land.
Lori greeted the Board and stated that this property actually shows buildings on it that have
since been removed by Washington Township so it is cleared now. The community who live
around this parcel, which is a gateway into their neighborhood, they want to take it and make
it a better looking site than what it currently is. The neighbors have already raised about
$250,000 to help with transforming this piece of land and the maintenance, because we
know this is an issue once we take ownership of land and the upkeep of that and this
community is very involved to make sure that they are going to adopt this park and they
raised that money in just a few weeks and so they are very vested in accomplishing this and
she feels like they will be here for the long haul to make sure it happens and just to keep it a
nice piece of property and a park. Lori stated that she didn‚Äôt know if the Board has any
questions about that piece of this but that is their plan for this small piece of property. Don
Colvin stated that the area outlined in red on the overhead screen is just slightly under a half
acre and when you bring this front piece in, this whole parcel will be about an acre of land.
This will be a small little neighborhood mini park. It will never be a community park or
anything larger.
Chairman Williams asked if there were any questions from the Board. Mr. Bowling stated
that they may have already mentioned this but the ownership of the other corner piece. Don
stated that this piece is being negotiated with a private owner that the Trustee didn‚Äôt have
ownership of. The owner of that piece seems willing to discuss this this would be at no cost
to the City.
Chairman Williams asked Lori about the maintenance part of this, are we still going down the
path where the maintenance dollars will still be received by the foundation. Lori stated ‚Äúyes‚Äù.
Lori stated that the neighbors are actually looking into which of them could possibly help with
maintaining it to help keep the cost down so it doesn‚Äôt fall onto DPR or DPW solely. They
are looking at the big picture and the funds will be held at the Parks Foundation to make
sure that any funds donated will be going toward that purpose.

Chairman Williams asked if there were any other questions from the Board. There were
none.
A motion was duly made by Mr. Bowling, seconded by Ms. Valentine, and unanimously
passed to approve Agenda Item Resolution #33, 2014.
Chairman Williams thanked Lori and stated that he knows this has been a long time coming
and he said he knows that she has had several meetings about this and we are finally there.
Lori stated that it is nice to have the community involvement that we have and thanked the
Board.
Chairman Williams stated that next up we will have a presentation from Joenne Pope
speaking about the Indy Parks Day Camps.

ÔÇ∑

Indy Parks Day Camp Update ‚Äì Joenne Pope

Chairman Williams said good afternoon to Ms. Pope. Ms. Pope thanked the Board for
allowing her to present. She stated that if she starts rambling on about Day Camps and they
want to get out of here, just cut her off. She can go on for a while but she will try to make
this brief. Ms. Pope pointed to the overhead screen kind of tell the story for her.
She stated that Indy Parks has four different types of day camps.
ÔÇ∑
ÔÇ∑
ÔÇ∑
ÔÇ∑

Traditional Camps at Broad Ripple, Garfield, Krannert, Christian, Riverside and
Ellenberger
Therapeutic Camp at Rhodius (children and young adults with developmental
disabilities)
Arts Camp at Garfield and Ellenberger
Environmental Camps at Southeastway, Holliday and at 2 locations at Eagle Creek
Park (four camps at the ornithology center and multiple camps that they have had in
the past at the nature center).

They have 13 different types of camps in eleven parks. So Ellenberger has a traditional and
an arts camp and Eagle Creek has the 2 locations.
There day camps prices vary. They start as low as $55.00 to $175.00 per week. The
$175.00 is for more of a specialty camp at Eagle Creek or Holliday or Southeastway that
requires a lot of transportation, overnight and those kinds of thing. These camps usually are
reserved very early in the season. They have payment plans and multi-child discount.
Camps are geared for children ages 3 to 15 years. The majority of the camps are geared
between that 6 and 13 year age range. The only exception would be Camp GATHER for
youth ages 6 to 18 years for children and young adults with developmental disabilities.
Sometimes they have physical disabilities as well and that range goes up to age 18.

6

The exciting part that she likes and definitely day camp is a young person‚Äôs job, when she
fills in for a day she is pooped. They hire over 80 camp counsellors for over the summer and
the majority are between the ages of 16 and 24 so their perfect age is that 21 or 22, college
kid who thinks they want to be a teacher or go in the recreation field or something like that.
These are the groups that they really like to hire and it is also awesome when you get a 16
year old that may have been a camper and now they have moved up and they are now a
camp counselor and they stay until there are 24. Somebody like her, they may just stay on
forever. Their staff receive about 30 hours of training which is on-site training and then they
have a big group where they get the 80 plus councilors together with the park managers and
they do a training together going over Indy Parks procedures, over leading games, lots of
games, busy hands are happy hands when it comes to camp. They like to keep the campers
busy. They go over lots of games, activities and things to fill their days. All of their camps
are accredited by the American Camp Association and it is kind of a process that goes every
3 years and nice to note that Indy Parks was one of the first day camps that became
accredited by American Camp Association around eleven years ago and before that it was
always over-night camp and it is kind of a special thing to be accredited and we had to go
through a lot of steps but it also makes us more accountable to our campers and their
families.
This summer they had an awesome summer. They added four new bird themed camps at
Eagle Creek Ornithology Center. The one she is really excited about is the Garfield Camp.
This was the first time since the 90‚Äôs that they have had a camp out there. They received
funding from the Parks Foundation who had secured some funding through the Lilly
Endowment to start their first year and kick it off and help us get going. It provided staff
funding, scholarships and all kinds of good things. The staff funding and the scholarships
were probably the most significant of things since they are the biggest part of the budget.
They had a great time out there. All of their camps have had increased revenue and
attendance. They had 3,213 campers this summer and their revenue is approximately
$295,784. They had 11 locations last year and this year we have 13. It was a very exciting
year this year.
They do have scholarships. $43,587 scholarships were distributed to 108 families and this
included 62 children. All of the camp locations had scholarships except for Holliday Park.
The application process is based on income. They have 3 tiers, 50%, 75%, and 100%. The
only exception this year was Garfield awarded separate scholarship money from a separate
fund was $8,367.00.
Their Day Camp registration will start on January 26, 2015. They held their first meeting day
before yesterday to sort through what they will be offering in the 2015 season.
Chairman Williams asked if there were any questions from the Board. Mr. Wynns stated that
he thinks it is a great program. Does the 295 cover their operating expenses? Joenne
replied that they are just about even. Mr. Bowling asked how they decide which parks
receive programs. Obviously you have those that occur each year. Joenne replied that it is
difficult because every park wants a day camp because there are certain benefits that come
with that. They are hoping to add another one this summer. Their procedure is just continue
doing what they are doing with the existing parks and it is kind of based on people who can
7

afford to pay for camp and those parks who have the staffing or the facilities at their park.
Sometimes neighborhood parks are not conducive for day camp because they do not have
the indoor facilities with flushing bathrooms. Although this is changing rapidly with the
comfort stations but they don‚Äôt always have the facilities that a park with a center has to
offer.
Chairman Williams asked Joenne to explain for the Board what it means to be certified by
the American Camp Association. Joenne stated yes. The association representatives come
out every year and there is a lot of paperwork that staff has to submit every year. They do
not always look at it every year. All of their staff has to be certified in first aid and CPR,
which is mandatory process that is required of them. They inquire about the department‚Äôs
payment plan, scholarship, registrations, immunizations, their exits at the facilities, their
restrooms. These are some of the things that the come to see. It takes all day, they visit at
least 3 different camps so they will go to definitely a traditional day camp, they usually go to
an environmental day camp and they have to visit the therapeutic day camp.
Chairman Williams asked if there were any more comments or questions from the Board.
There were none. Chairman Williams thanked Joenne for her presentation.
Adjournment
A motion was duly made by Chairman Williams for adjournment, seconded by Ms. Valentine,
and unanimously passed to adjourn.
The next Board of Parks and Recreation meeting is scheduled for November 20, 2014,
at 3:45 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. at the City County Building, Room 260, 200 East Washington
Street, Indianapolis, Indiana 46204

CITY ADDRESS
===============================================================================
***** MAYOR_PETE_BUTTIGIEG'S_REMARKS_AS_PREPARED_FOR_THE_2017_STATE_OF_THE_CITY
ADDRESS [1] *****

¬ 
Mayor Pete Buttigieg's Remarks as Prepared for the 2017 State of the City
Address
Thank you Principal Bayingana, Dr. Spells, Imam Sirajuddin, Council President
Scott, and thank you to the Riley High School Jazz Band for that great
performance.
It is a pleasure to be here at one of the great high schools in the South Bend
Community Schools system, and I am thankful for the many good things taking
place in our public schools. From John Adams High School, whose Mock Trial team
again won state and is headed to national competition this May, to Washington
High School where I joined the League of Women Voters last week to talk with
students about voting and civic involvement; from Clay High School which just
put on a terrific performance of a play tackling tough issues to right here at
Riley where two students were honored by the state Chamber of Commerce for
their work with the Bowman Creek Educational Ecosystem; there is a lot going on
in our schools to make us proud.
I want to thank and acknowledge our City Clerk, Kareemah Fowler, our Common
Council members, and all officials and dignitaries attending this evening. And
I want to thank everyone who has joined us tonight for taking time to hear
about just some of the significant developments in the life of our community.
As you probably know, I spent a large portion of the first two months of this
year campaigning for a national leadership position in the Democratic Party.
Many people lately have paid me the nuanced compliment of sharing that they are
glad that I was not elected, so that I could remain here and continue to serve
South Bend. And having had mixed emotions about the prospect of leaving this
job for that one, I feel much the same way. Though I entered that competition
with every intention of wining, now that it is over, I am wholeheartedly
delighted about the chance to continue my second term as mayor.
Every intense experience brings the gift of perspective, and that was certainly
true of the weeks I spent traveling the country, interacting with leaders from
every state in the union. In reflecting on the experience, the biggest thing I
drew from it is a deepening of my convictions about problem-solving at the
local level.
It used to be the case that local government was regarded as a kind of minor
league, with more serious and sophisticated work taking place at the state and
federal level. But the more opportunities I have had to witness how our
national policymaking works, the more convinced I am that political salvation
for our country will come from the local.
It is in cities and towns across America that the most sensitive and important
issues actually play out, from police-community relations to the development of
our infrastructure. In telling South Bend‚Äôs story across the United States, I
had endless reminders of how our work, here in this community on a daily basis,
touches every issue of importance to how people live.
Today, South Bend is on a roll. After a long and challenging transformation, we
are now seeing the strongest growth in a generation when it comes to jobs,
population, and prosperity. We are now more than halfway through what will
certainly go down in history as South Bend‚Äôs turnaround decade, and the best
is yet to come.
Tonight I would like to share some of the most important progress, and suggest
what it will take to rise to the challenges and opportunities ahead. Today all
of us who serve the City, from the newest hourly employee to the mayor, can
draw energy from the importance of our mission: to deliver services that
empower everyone to thrive.
There are three lines of effort that allow us to meet that mission. We make the
basics of life easy by providing for the essentials. We invest in people and
places so that our city is a truly great place to live, work, and visit. And we
offer good government so that the very way we do business embodies the values
that guide us in our daily work: the values of excellence, accountability,
inclusion, innovation, and empowerment.
In service of this mission, we have begun redesigning our budget from the
ground up, using a priority-based framework to make decisions based not on how
we‚Äôve always done things, but on what our residents consider most important.
After a thorough process of collecting internal and external input, last year
the team established six priorities for South Bend: a safe community for
everyone; robust, well-planned infrastructure; a strong, inclusive economy;
thriving public spaces and culture; vibrant, welcoming neighborhoods; and
residents empowered with education, mobility, and technology. Alongside these
community goals, we laid out the necessary internal priorities to ensure that
residents can always count on a well-governed and well administered city.
From now on, our major decisions will be organized around these goals‚Äîthe
central priorities that drive all of our administration‚Äôs work‚Äîand
tonight‚Äôs remarks will be organized around them too.
Safe community for everyone
In operating a government just as in operating a vehicle, safety comes first.
For a family, a country, or a city, all the things we do depend first on our
being able to take safety for granted. This is one reason government exists in
the first place, and we recognize it as our most fundamental obligation.
When it comes to crime and police, we are determined to continue the approaches
that help to explain why South Bend is one of the urban areas in our region
that did not see a sharp increase in gun violence last year. In fact, victims
of criminally assaulted shootings fell from 85 to 81, and the number of fatal
shootings fell significantly from 16 to 11. While homicides went up 14%
nationally in one year, they went down here in South Bend. We believe this is
partly due to the Group Violence Intervention, a partnership that involves
local and federal law enforcement and prosecutors, social services, and
community leaders.
The work of police has never been more important, more sensitive, or more
scrutinized. In our community, we know that it is not only possible but
necessary to be strongly supportive of our men and women in uniform, and
strongly supportive of fairness and racial justice. We are not immune to the
tension that exists in many communities around America between police
departments and some of the neighborhoods they protect, but we have the benefit
of deep relationships between our neighborhoods, activists, and our law
enforcement family.
In the mayor‚Äôs office, we routinely monitor the number of cases that lead to
the use of force, and the number of complaints about officers. Last year the
number of complaints filed and sustained, as well as the overall number of uses
of force, all went down, as did the number of citizen complaints. In the
interest of transparency around these issues, last year South Bend joined
President Obama‚Äôs national Police Data Initiative to ensure the public can
access this information. We have placed information concerning complaints and
training on the city‚Äôs Open Data Portal, and next month we will begin
publishing data on use-of-force incidents as well.
Complaints about the conduct of officers are rare, but they are taken very
seriously, and I want to be sure residents understand how discipline is
handled. The final decisions around major cases of officer discipline are made
by a panel of five appointed citizens who are racially diverse, highly
respected in the community, and have an important and sometimes thankless task.
The Board of Public Safety is one example of a ‚Äúcitizen review board,‚Äù and
there are many different forms of citizen review board around the country.
Among the different models of citizen review board, our version is among the
most powerful, since it makes decisions, not just recommendations. We support
and thank them for their important work.
For every high profile case that reaches the Board of Safety, there are
countless stories of model community policing that best demonstrate our values.
Our police athletic league, which joins officers with local youth to provide
mentorship through sports, has over six hundred participants. Patrol shifts
competed for the ‚Äúflatfoot‚Äù award to see who could perform the most walking
patrols. And in cases ranging from the lifesaving rescue of a severely injured
8 year old boy, to the apprehension of the so-called ‚Äúpillowcase burglar‚Äù
in partnership with other area departments, to making sure all of the
presidential candidate visits went smoothly last Spring, our officers continue
to do extremely important work, mostly out of the spotlight.
So we can have the best possible Department, we have undertaken a number of
reforms, including streamlining the organization chart and a new emphasis on
training. Our newly negotiated four-year contract makes us one of the most
competitively paid departments in the region. But we do face severe challenges
in manpower after a number of retirements and departures. Force strength is
down to 227, a number that is simply not sufficient, and so growing the force
must be a major priority in the coming year. At the same time, this represents
an opportunity to shape the force with new members, new experiences and new
talent. We want anyone who has ever considered a career in law enforcement to
know: South Bend is hiring, and we want the best.
We are also partnering with Mishawaka and the County to deliver a next-
generation 911 center that brings area agencies onto the same system. Dispatch
center employees are now all working side-by-side in a new facility, and we are
in the process of moving toward full integration by this summer. The process
has been challenging but I have appreciated the cooperation of various agencies
to ensure safety and cost-effectiveness.
Meanwhile, our Fire Department reached a major milestone this year when the
Insurance Services Office rated us as a Level 2 Fire Department. This makes us
one of the top fire agencies in the state and places us in the top 2 percent
nationally. The Fire Department has also worked hard to boost recruiting from
inclusive sources of applicants, attracting the highest level of minority and
female applicants ever, while maintaining the highest standards for our hiring
process.
To ensure our residents have the benefit of excellent fire facilities, the City
has begun the process to replace Fire Station 4, located on Olive Street, and
Fire Station 9, located in a historic River Park building and unsuitable for
modern equipment. After a great deal of community listening and creative
problem-solving by Fire Department leadership, I was pleased to announce last
week that we have found an excellent location which does not require
encroachment on any park space.
Many things that affect safety that are beyond the reach of our police and fire
departments. One example is the threat to health from lead paint present in
some older homes, particularly in low-income neighborhoods in our city. In
order to address this, we have been working closely with the County Board of
Health.
In December, City and County officials were made aware that certain areas of
South Bend had unusually high percentages of children who tested with elevated
blood-lead levels between 2005 and 2015. While this is a long-standing issue,
the recent statistics prompted a very healthy increase in visibility. To better
support County efforts, the City has increased funding for lead abatement
through the South Bend Housing Improvement Program grant, pledged $100,000 in
matching funds for the PHA HUD lead abatement grant, and is exploring
possibilities for local legislation that would lead to the testing of homes
prior to sale or rental.
We are working to get the word out that parents cannot simply assume that your
doctor is testing your children for lead. Testing is free for those on
Medicaid, and free at the St Joseph County Health Department for all children
under 7 and all pregnant women. Residents can also request a free environmental
risk assessment from the County Health Department. I want to stress that these
test results are not related to our water supply, which meets or exceeds all
environmental standards.
This issue is a reminder of our responsibility as an administration to support
public health. While the City has no specific officer, staff, or funding for
health, we will continue to actively support other health authorities in
ensuring we live in a safe environment, especially for children. Our city also
took a step in the direction of better health when smoking in our bars and
restaurants came to an end this year, and it is a pleasure to see these
business establishments thrive with clean air.
On another safety and health matter, I would like to take this opportunity to
thank the working group established by my office to help address the issue of
homelessness. The group, which includes representatives from social service
agencies, businesses, city and county government, and residents, is working to
develop a strategic plan for addressing chronic homelessness in South Bend.¬ 
Their recommendations will be delivered, after extensive community engagement,
by July of this year.
In addition, our ability to tackle some of the toughest cases of homelessness
will take a major step forward later this year as the FUSE project, a
collaboration with South Bend Heritage, opens this fall, with 32 units of
permanent supportive housing for homeless individuals.
And the City, in partnership with the regional Continuum of Care, has also
entered the national Mayor‚Äôs Challenge to End Veteran Homelessness last
November, and will continue with this effort until we are able to say that no
person who served our nation in uniform will go without access to shelter.
Unfortunately, many members of our community have come to feel particularly
unsafe or vulnerable as a consequence of the current national political climate
and uncertainty over federal immigration policy. This is one reason I am glad
we are leading the way in our state with the creation of the South Bend
Municipal ID Card. This card allows anyone who can prove who they are to
identify themselves for purposes ranging from routine retail transactions to
interactions with law enforcement, making all of us safer. Best of all, it lets
anyone say they are a card-carrying resident of our city.
Here at the local level, we can combat the climate of increasing fear and
anxiety among residents who live peacefully and work in our community. We want
to make sure that all who live here understand that this is a city that
supports everyone who is here to contribute to our community positively,
regardless of national origin or religion, and I want to emphasize that our law
enforcement officers are not responsible for federal immigration enforcement,
but for keeping the people who live here safe. All of us.\
¬ 
On a foundation of safety rests our second major priority: robust and well-
planned infrastructure.
When people think of infrastructure, they often speak of trains, planes, and
bridges. But much of our vital infrastructure is completely out of sight. Some
have argued that the most important invention ever, besides the wheel, is
sanitation, and if you ever doubt the importance of the humble sewer, consider
what life would be like without it.
Our sewer and wastewater planning continues to be affected by the federal
requirement that we manage our combined sewer overflow, or CSO. The good news
is that fresh analysis has shown that we can deliver the required environmental
improvements for hundreds of millions of dollars less than expected in the
original 2011 agreement‚Äîif the federal government allows us to update the
plan. It is too soon to know how the new federal administration will address
these negotiations, but we will work hard to arrive at a cost-effective answer
that still meets our legal and moral obligations to ensure clean water in our
area.
Meanwhile, it is imperative that we act to provide adequate drinking water
infrastructure for immediate needs and the longer term. Our Utilities team has
done extraordinary work making older pipes and equipment function safely and
effectively, but this cannot continue without new investment. Our public works
team has identified over $88 million in capital needs, which has prompted us to
prepare an adjustment to South Bend‚Äôs unusually low water rates.
After a year of public discussion on this topic, last night, the South Bend
Common Council acted to take this important step. The Council approved a rate
increase that will raise $22.5 Million over 5 years which can be used for
fixing broken down pumps, rehabilitating non-functioning wells, and replacing
broken water mains, valves, and fire hydrants. Supplemented with TIF funding,
this will meet the most urgent and critical of our water infrastructure
needs‚Äîand even after the increase, our water rates will be lower than most
comparable Indiana cities. I thank the Council for taking seriously our shared
responsibility to provide clean, safe drinking water.
Back above ground, we are working to ensure that roads are in good condition
despite increasingly tight funds. At the current level of funding, we are able
to pave every lane-mile of street in the city roughly every one hundred years.
That‚Äôs not good enough, which is why we are closely following House Bill
1002, a road funding bill in the state house to better enable us to fund our
neighborhood roads and streets. After 14 years without any adjustment to the
gas tax, this could deliver needed funds that we can use immediately for
paving, pothole repair, and other vital projects. The legislature is also
considering a measure to index the gas tax to inflation, a common-sense move
that would prevent future funding from getting caught up in politics. I have
crossed party lines to support this Republican-sponsored House bill, and we
hope that it will pass before the session ends in April.
In addition, we are working with TRANSPO to support their efforts to deliver
great transit to the community. Last year, the first city-funded bus shelters
were installed on the West Side along Lincoln Way and Western Avenue, with more
planned for 2017. We are also working with the TRANSPO team to use new
technology for evaluating route adjustments to better connect residents to
jobs, and providing real time information to riders on bus activity in the
network.
Speaking of transportation, we have been presented with a truly game-changing
opportunity with the potential for a faster South Shore Line connection to
Chicago. With double-tracking improvements and a relocation of the train‚Äôs
path to the airport, the vision of a one-and-a-half hour train trip to downtown
Chicago is truly within reach. We are in close contact with South Shore
management to develop a regional partnership with the state that could raise
the necessary funds. South Bend will have to do its part. If we can achieve a
90-minute train ride from here to Chicago, every single neighborhood in our
city will benefit. The potential for increased jobs and population is
tremendous.
Strong Inclusive Economy
Of course, the infrastructure work getting the most attention of all is the
ongoing Smart Streets effort, which brings me to the third major City priority:
a strong, inclusive economy. Smart Streets is as much about economic
development as it is about streets.
The bulk of the road work is now complete, and contractors have until June 1st
to complete all signal and streetscape work. A year ago in this address, I
warned that there would be disruption and, perhaps, a level of grumpiness as
daily commutes were affected by the construction. But the decision to do in one
year what would ordinarily take two or three has paid off, tearing off the
band-aid and ensuring that most of the construction-related inconvenience is
already behind us. I am thankful to the public for their patience during the
heavy construction phase.
While this initiative enjoyed strong support from the downtown business
community and the common council, I am aware that its overall popularity is‚Ä¶
mixed. So I would like to take this opportunity to briefly revisit the reasons
why we undertook this project.
America‚Äôs best downtowns are not bypasses or through-ways, but destinations.
Ensuring complete streets‚Äîwhich means streets with two-way traffic and ample
room for pedestrians and bicyclists‚Äîleads to a more vibrant city because
people are more inclined to spend time on a pedestrian-friendly sidewalk than a
narrow path along a four-lane, one-way highway that serves to evacuate vehicles
from our city at top speed.
We are already seeing many of the economic benefits. For example, the
renovation of the Chase Tower, the restoration of the LaSalle Hotel, the
conversion of the JMS building, the renewed fa√ßade at Main Street Row, and the
new hotel at the former College Football Hall of Fame, are all projects
involving major private investment‚Äîover $63 million total‚Äîfrom investors
who have each publicly said that the Smart Streets project was an important
factor in their decision to invest here.
The project also gained national attention, including the Mayor‚Äôs Challenge
Success award from U.S. Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx, which we
accepted on the city‚Äôs behalf at a ceremony in Washington‚Äîthe first time in
recent memory that our City has been directly recognized by a U.S. Cabinet
Secretary.
By design, traffic calming does mean that vehicles move more slowly in the
central business district. Then again, we live in a city where you can traverse
the entire central business district in five minutes or less. Right now,
according to Google data, you can drive from here at Riley High School on the
South Side to Memorial Hospital on the north end of Downtown, in 13 minutes, up
to 15 minutes in rush hour. It used to be more like 11 or 12 minutes. As the
cost of having a truly great downtown, we can afford those two or three
minutes.
Bringing a new streetscape to the heart of our city has not been simple, with
many issues coming up including a forgotten underground vault in the project
area, and issues with entry to the Colfax Parking Garage during highly attended
shows at the Morris Theater. But we are working through these and believe that
by the time we celebrate completion of the project, very few people will be
able to honestly say they would rather go back to the old way.
The timing of this project helps us capitalize on a major economic resurgence.
Overall, our city has seen 4,499 net new jobs since this administration began
in 2012, with the unemployment rate cut by more than half even as labor force
participation increased by over one thousand in the same period. This
administration has sought from day one to establish that South Bend is open for
business. That‚Äôs why we have simplified and streamlined processes, and
supported growth in every part of the city. From industrial developments near
the airport, to hundreds of new residential units downtown, to the opportunity
for a full-service grocery on the East Bank, since the beginning of last year
the Department of Community Investment has supported over $261 million in
private investment representing up to 651 associated jobs. All this with $34
million in public investment, or about 7 private dollars for every 1 taxpayer
dollar of support.
And there is much more where that came from: with manufacturing facilities in
the Adams Road area, the Marriott Hotel under construction on the former Hall
of Fame site, The Ivy at Berlin Place to open by next year‚Äôs opening day for
the South Bend Cubs, phase two of Innovation Park and Eddy Street, and more, we
can expect the months and years ahead to be filled with more celebrations,
ribbon-cuttings, and most importantly: new jobs.
When it comes to growing the economy, cities can no longer think, in blinkered
terms, only about what happens within their own borders. In a connected and
globalized economy, that mentality is ultimately self-defeating. We need to
understand that our region shares a common economic fate, and this is the
insight of the state‚Äôs Regional Cities program, which compelled us to come
together with other counties and cities in our region. The result was our
region winning a $42 million competitive grant from the State of Indiana, which
we are using for efforts ranging from the Riverfront Parks and Trails to the
reinvention of the Studebaker assembly building.
Still, we recognize that no matter how good the total job counts or the topline
numbers, an economy is not truly strong if it is not truly inclusive. Societies
that experience great inequality perform more poorly than those that are
economically and racially integrated, and we must pay close attention to
inclusion if South Bend is to truly consolidate her comeback. Parts of our
community experience concentrations of generational poverty, and that not
everyone has benefited from or had access to the economic growth around us.
This is one reason we have sought to lead by example when it comes to making
sure there is adequate pay for all in our community. State law prevents cities
in Indiana from establishing any community minimum wage, but the City of South
Bend acted in last year‚Äôs budget to increase the minimum wage paid to City
employees to $10.10, one year ahead of schedule. We urge other employers in our
area to look at wages and join us in this, knowing that economic evidence shows
a stronger economy whenever we do this as a society, and knowing that doing so
will make South Bend a community of choice. We also decided to voluntarily
implement new overtime rules put forth by the Department of Labor even though a
court prevented them from becoming mandatory. In the years to come we will
continue to seek ways to lead by example and do right by workers, evaluating
leave and family policies to ensure we model the kind of economic participation
we would like to see across the region.
We also work to ensure development takes place across neighborhood and
geographic boundaries. That‚Äôs why we are thrilled to see more industrial
development taking place on the West Side. And it‚Äôs why in addition to paving
the way for a future downtown full-service grocery, I was pleased to be present
for the opening last week of a new Martin‚Äôs location on Western Avenue,
building on improvements to streetscapes and parks facilities on the city‚Äôs
West Side. The West Side, and every side, of our city deserves great places to
shop, work, and play, and we will continue to work to make sure that happens.
We must also confront that a legacy of racial injustice continues to result in
inequality across our country, with South Bend no exception. In our community,
racial minorities face poverty rates up to 33 percent. Equality of opportunity
is one reason we became involved with the White House‚Äôs My Brother‚Äôs Keeper
program, an initiative to ensure equality of opportunity for all, including
young men and boys of color. Driven by a community coalition and anchored at
Memorial Hospital, this initiative has three central goals for our young
people: getting a healthy start and entering school ready to learn; keeping
kids on track and offering second chances; and successfully entering the
workforce. We will closely track infant mortality rates, third grade reading
scores, juvenile arrest rates, labor force participation, and disparities in
the unemployment rate to ensure we are making progress toward these goals.
In keeping with the desire to practice what we preach, we are working as a city
to deepen our commitment to working with small businesses as part of our city
Diversity and Inclusion plan, so that being newer, smaller, or owned by a
historically disadvantaged group is no barrier to doing business with the city.
We are partnering with the Latin American Chamber of Commerce to offer small
business support through seminars on how to build small businesses and compete
for contracts, and we will be in contact with the Council about refinements to
our city‚Äôs diversity utilization policy.
We also continue to work to compete for new residents, especially veterans, who
can benefit from the Vets Community Connections program. Staffed by volunteers
and routed through 311, this initiative lets veterans and military families get
key information about how to settle into our community, and we are always
looking for more volunteers who want to take part‚Äîjust call 311.
We continue to work with area employers and labor organizations on Workforce
Development, ensuring that the economic ladder is available to everyone and
that our employers will have access to a superb workforce in order to grow and
succeed here. Through our Pathways partnership with WorkOne, the city has
directed nearly half a million dollars to train workers in some of our most
important industries - healthcare, building trades and manufacturing - and has
placed over 100 local residents into employment.
Thriving Public Spaces and Culture
Wealth alone does not make a City great, nor can a great economy develop in a
city with no distinctive cultural or recreational life. That‚Äôs why another
stated goal is to ensure Thriving Public Spaces and Culture.
In this address one year ago, I promised that we would develop a new way to
manage quality of place, and a year later we are pleased by the successful
establishment of a new department in the City of South Bend: the Department of
Venues, Parks, and Arts. Bringing under one roof the formerly separate teams
from parks and recreation, Morris and the Palais, Century Center, management of
DTSB, and our involvement in arts and cultural activity, we are closer to
unlocking the full potential of a community that already punches above its
weight class when it comes to cultural and recreational life.
The City now has entirely new categories of parks facilities, from South
Bend‚Äôs first dog park on Niles Avenue to the Aerial Adventure Park at Rum
Village. And the new department has set to work immediately using the resources
provided by the Parks Bond to enhance public space everywhere. I want to again
thank the Common Council for supporting this bond, which has enabled a number
of recent improvements. For the first time, we have an air-conditioned
gymnasium at the Martin Luther King, Jr., recreation center. New basketball
courts and pavilions have been installed at Fremont, Kelly Park &amp; Kennedy
Parks on the West Side, while an expanded parking lot will serve Potawatomi
Park on the east side. Needed roof replacements came to Pinhook Pavilion in the
Northwest, and Rum Village Nature Center on the Southwest side. And we have
been able to address dozens of deferred maintenance needs on playgrounds,
restrooms, picnic areas, and public spaces. And as soon as testing confirms the
site is in good condition, we plan this year to begin construction on a $4
million renovation and expansion of the Charles Black Center which, after
temporary closures for construction, will be a truly outstanding facility for a
generation to come.
Soon we will be embarking on an ambitious program of enhancements to the
Riverfront Parks and Trails, aware that the river that gives our city her name
is also one of the most important treasures we possess. The improvements will
include a replacement and upgrade of Howard Park Recreation Center, a new
combination ice skating facility and splash plaza in Howard Park, and upgrades
throughout the riverfront trail system to improve safety, accessibility,
ecological integrity and connectivity. Much of the funding for this vision is
already in hand, but our community will need to come together to find the
resources to make the most ambitious elements of this vision into a reality.
Meanwhile, we are partnering with the University of Notre Dame to use the power
of our river in new ways. A hydroelectric turbine will be installed beneath
Seitz Park to power an estimated 10% of the university‚Äôs electrical needs.
Beginning this October, Seitz Park will be offline for an 18-month construction
project. We thank the public for its patience, which will be rewarded upon
completion when a $1 million commitment from the University will support a
newly redesigned Seitz Park while the turbine demonstrates this region‚Äôs
commitment to sustainability.¬ ¬ 
We are also making sure that our public spaces reflect our values and our
heritage. That‚Äôs why I was pleased, after an abundance of community input and
deliberation by a citizen committee, to unveil the new Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr. Boulevard, renaming one of our most prominent downtown streets after one of
America‚Äôs great leaders whose message is as resonant and timely today as
ever. This also created the opportunity to rename the former Martin Luther King
Jr. Drive for one of our own moral lights, Charles Martin Sr., whose mentorship
and support for youth in our community lifted up generations of South Bend
residents.
And later this year, Leighton Plaza on Main Street will feature a distinctive
new piece of public art: a life-size statue commemorating the historic occasion
when Notre Dame‚Äôs President, Father Ted Hesburgh, stood arm in arm with Dr.
King calling for justice at Soldier Field in 1964. The statue will invite
passersby to join their hands with these two leaders, symbolically
participating in the ongoing struggle for justice and equality.
This year will bring great developments not only in our physical spaces but in
special events as well. The Venues, Parks, and Arts team is currently hard at
work on a new event which we are calling the Best Week Ever.
The Best Week Ever will be a week-long celebration of our Culture, Creativity
&amp; Progress filled with 2-3 signature events each day. It begins Memorial
Day, May 29 and will carry through the following weekend, June 4. Each
signature event‚Äîincluding the West Side Memorial Day Parade, Meet Me on the
Island, Sunburst Races and a special 90s Concert at Four Winds Field‚Äîwill be
peppered with unique experiences created by local businesses, neighborhood
associations, churches and more. We encourage anyone who envisions something
special for the Best Week Ever to visit Bestweekever2017.com for more on how to
participate and get involved.
A great city not only has great shared spaces and activities, but also makes
sure the most immediate areas around us‚Äîthe neighborhoods where we live‚Äîare
vibrant and welcoming, and this is our fifth major priority in the budget.
With strong efforts from the Code Enforcement department and leadership from
the Common Council, we have worked to tear down the barriers to safety and
comfort in every neighborhood. Our Code Enforcement Department is seeing
increased effectiveness and compliance. We also continue to benefit from the
chronic nuisance policy established in 2013‚Äîa successful policy now in danger
due to state legislation that threatens to block cities from enacting these
common-sense neighborhood policies. It is the latest example of state pre-
emption of local government, and we hope that the legislature will return to
the bipartisan principle of local control.
This was also the first year for landlord registration, a policy to ensure that
the city can contact the owners of properties when issues arise. Already we
have had nearly 4,000 properties registered by over 800 owners, and are working
to refine the system for collecting this data.
Of course, the most positive energy in our neighborhoods comes from within the
neighborhoods themselves. Whether it‚Äôs the Local Cup, a pay-it-forward coffee
shop in the NNN, or West Side Wednesdays, which delivered a free family
festival on Western Avenue in December as well as help with future events
coming this summer, we see residents coming together with pride to enhance the
neighborhoods around them.
Right here by Riley High School, the Bowman Creek Restoration Project continues
to harness the talent from local colleges and universities and use it to
empower neighbors in a previously neglected area. Students and volunteers
helped build 9 rain gardens, worked on smart sensors for monitoring the gardens
and creek, and took on other activities to remediate the area.
This year we will be undertaking a thorough review of our neighborhood policies
to ensure they is up to date for the opportunities and challenges ahead. This
includes continuing to find productive uses for vacant lots where collapsing
houses were removed as part of the 1000 Houses in 1,000 Days effort, engaging
more closely with the South Bend Housing Authority, working with the
Neighborhood Resources Council to support neighborhoods, and ensuring that we
have a shared community vision about the role of planning. We must move forward
with plans that are both feasible and ambitious, making sure we are faithful to
the intention of our plans but never allowing ourselves to be trapped by them,
never permitting the perfect to be the enemy of the good.
The sixth of our six major goals is to ensure all residents are empowered with
education, mobility, and technology. We need to look beyond the traditional,
direct, and obvious responsibilities of city government to ensure we are doing
all we can to make sure residents have what they need to thrive.
There is no better example of this than education. The City needs to be an
active partner with the schools in our community, and especially with the South
Bend Community School Corporation. That‚Äôs why we are in communications now
about a new model for framing and formalizing that cooperation: a Schools
Compact that will formalize the commitment of the City and the School
Corporation to support one another in key areas. Our intention is to organize
cooperation around four central components of the educational ecosystem in
South Bend: empowered students, strong schools, career-ready graduates, and an
engaged community.
We will work together with the School Corporation to make sure that students
have the economic and social resources that empower them to succeed in school;
to strengthen our schools with diverse, talented educators and safe
infrastructure; to set rigorous standards and develop new partnerships for
ensuring students graduate on time and prepared for success in careers or
college; and to engage our community in the growth and progress of South Bend
students. I have been in preliminary conversations with our Superintendent, Dr.
Spells, and interested board members, and we hope to present language to the
School Board and the Common Council for consideration before the end of the
year.
Our commitment to youth also inspired the South Bend Youth Task Force, which
selects and empowers a diverse group of students from all schools in our area
to discuss and solve problems that matter to them. They have chosen to sink
their teeth into some of the most challenging issues in our community‚Äîlike
violence among youth‚Äîand sponsor town halls and dialogues in schools and in
the community to help address them. These young people make me proud and give
us great hope for the future leadership of our city.
In addition, we must pay close attention to ensuring children arrive in school
with a good foundation to begin with. The current version of the Indiana
legislature's pre-Kindergarten bill acknowledges that this is an important area
but does not provide the funds for a dramatic change in availability.
Sustainable funded pre-K is good economic sense. It allows more parents to
enter the workforce and is a well-researched investment in the health and
success of children. And so we will not only advocate for more statewide
activity in early childhood, but will continue to explore strategies to make
high-quality pre-K available to every child in South Bend.
Like education, the ability to physically move around our city is one thing
that can make or break a resident‚Äôs ability to thrive. This is one reason why
we have embraced a policy of complete streets in the City, so that those who
rely on bicycles and pedestrian mobility can better take advantage of city
life. Since low-income and minority Americans are more likely to bike for
transport and walk or bike to school, this is also a matter of equity. Being
pedestrian and bike-friendly is important to all of us, and we are now actively
exploring the implementation of a bike share system to enhance transportation
choices in partnership with MACOG.
When it comes to technology as a way to empower residents, we are a city that
recognizes the relationship between technology and equity. To address the
digital divide, we have expanded on downtown Wifi with free connectivity now
available at the Martin Luther King and Charles Black recreation centers,
helping connect over 2,500 users in 2016. Meanwhile, the private South Bend
Code School has done remarkable work in locations ranging from the Robinson
Community Learning Center to the Juvenile Justice Center. Students from 11 to
16 years of age have built over 100 websites and created 24 civic apps aimed at
improving their community.
Meanwhile, our Innovation team has been working with Notre Dame‚Äôs Wireless
Institute to ¬ pursue a major grant from the National Science Foundation to use
our city as a pioneering test bed‚Äîa living laboratory‚Äîfor the latest
wireless technology, creating new economic strength in our city and region.
All of these gains are enabled by the way we do business as an administration,
guided by internal principles that add up to a well-governed and administered
city. We strive to be a great employer with great employees, making sure not
just our compensation but our workplace climate make us an employer of choice.
We cultivate enduring financial strength, continuing to have one of the top
bond ratings in the state, AA, and preparing in advance for the strain that the
2020 fiscal ‚Äúcurb‚Äù will place on our finances. We aim for excellent
services and efficient processes, using the data from our 311 center to drive
better decision-making and using performance data to guide management decisions
through SBStat, a data-driven management program modeled after leading cities
and pioneered by Baltimore.
Keeping it this way means making sure we make the best use of our physical and
technical assets. Behind the scenes, we are working to realign our purchasing
and central services departments to save taxpayer money. And the IT strategic
plan has been largely implemented, with an improved help desk running at one-
third of the cost of the old system, and other updates helping us to save up to
a $1 million a year while delivering better technology to help our employees
serve the public. Also out of the spotlight but extremely important is the
continued work on transparency. Our Department of Law recently passed the
milestone of 10,000 records requests processed in this administration without a
single finding of violation. Meanwhile legal claims have declined each year
since 2013 by a total of more than two-thirds, thanks to enhanced training and
excellent legal work, further saving taxpayer dollars.
We continue to work on both high-tech and old-fashioned ways to interact with
the public. Mayor‚Äôs Night Out allowed over 150 residents to sign up for
direct conversations with me last year, while 311 answered over 150,000 calls
last year alone.
Last but perhaps most importantly, we seek to be an administration that models
our values of Excellence, Accountability, Innovation, Inclusion, and
Empowerment. To highlight the importance of these values, we have begun an
employee recognition program that has already brought forth inspiring stories
of leadership by our employees.
None of this is possible alone, not even for our terrific administration team.
We rely on partnerships at every turn, and will continue to do so in order to
get things done. Whether it‚Äôs our Bowman Creek Educational Ecosystem, with
involvement from Ivy Tech, IU South Bend, and the University of Notre Dame, or
our civic innovation work sponsored by the Bloomberg Philanthropies What Works
Cities program; whether it‚Äôs the vital role played by our local hospitals on
efforts from My Brother‚Äôs Keeper to the Group Violence Intervention; we are
dramatically better off thanks to the nonprofit, philanthropic and educational
institutions that support our city‚Äôs growth. In the business world, we have
partners at every turn on efforts ranging from economic growth in our
industrial areas to the continuous enhancement of Four Winds Field by Andrew
Berlin and the South Bend Cubs. Speaking of Four Winds, one of our most
extraordinary partnerships took a major step forward last year when the Pokagon
Band of Potawatomi Indians were federally recognized. This makes our city the
first and only place in Indiana to have tribal land. And thanks to a generous
agreement with the Tribe, the restoration of their tribal homeland will yield
major benefits to our City, too, as millions of dollars in revenues from the
planned gaming facilities are committed to the enhancement of our economy and
the betterment of our children.
We also collaborate with county, state, and federal government‚Äîand these
partnerships will experience considerable change in the months and years to
come. The County-City relationship will become more important than ever, and we
will build on current collaborations like the Building Department, the 911
Center, and our involvement with the Health Department to explore working
together in new areas like collaborating with our Human Rights Commission to
address discrimination. In particular, I would like to acknowledge the work
that the County Assessor is undertaking to ensure the latest data and
techniques are applied to support truly fair assessments and stabilize property
tax revenue.
Under the Obama administration, the City enjoyed a number of fruitful
partnerships with the White House and other Federal agencies, from My
Brother‚Äôs Keeper to the MetroLab Network of city-university partnerships and
the Let‚Äôs Move effort to combat childhood obesity, for which South Bend was
recognized at the White House by First Lady Michelle Obama. It is too soon to
know all the ways in which the new administration will be different in its
dealings with South Bend, but I will say that the initial budget released by
the administration would have severe implications for all cities, including
South Bend. The proposed elimination of CDBG and HOME funds, to take just one
example, would mean $4 million less going into our City.
Every decision in Washington has implications here at home, however indirectly.
Take the actions that took place just a few hours ago to reverse the previous
administration‚Äôs actions on climate change. This is not a remote issue.
Consider the extreme rainfall event that damaged or destroyed hundreds of homes
in our City and surrounding area in August. Statistically, this was considered
a ‚Äúthousand-year‚Äù rainfall, and it represents three times the biggest
rainfall ever recorded, which was in the 1930s. It seems extremely improbable
that this weather event, which is exactly the kind of extreme weather that
scientists have warned us about for decades, is pure coincidence. South Bend
will be better off if officials in Washington are serious about addressing
issues from climate change to immigration reform. We will monitor these issues
closely, and work with allies like the U.S. Conference of Mayors to ensure the
local perspective is taken seriously in Washington.
Last but not least, I want to emphasize our relationship with the State of
Indiana. Not every decision in the state has benefited our city. I mentioned
earlier our concern with actions that will pre-empt City authority and take
power away from local government. But we are also currently benefiting from
forward-thinking state initiatives like the Regional Cities of Northern Indiana
effort. I know that our delegation of state Representatives and Senators is
working hard to advance the interests of our region. I sat down with our new
governor, Eric Holcomb, last week in his office, and he spoke of his commitment
to progress in our part of the state in areas from economic development to
public health. I let him know that the City of South Bend looks forward to
working with him to benefit our community and the state as a whole.
Tonight I have shared just a select fraction of the activities taking place in
our administration and across our community that should make South Bend proud.
We are not shying away from the challenges we face, but each year we are not
only addressing our greatest challenges but seizing opportunities that would
have been difficult to picture just a few years ago. To continue this momentum
our city will need to be ready to face an uncertain future with continued
fidelity to our values and commitment to our priorities.
Amid all the noise in media and politics, I have never been more convinced that
our city is headed in the right direction because of our shared values:
excellence, innovation, accountability, inclusion, and empowerment. No matter
the unpredictable headwinds and tailwinds of our times, this is a City of
people who know how to support one another. And we know that our City‚Äîbig
enough to matter, small enough to be nimble and original in how we solve
problems‚Äîcan continue to be a place where everyone is empowered to thrive.

New Business
1. Agenda Item #50, 2013 ‚Äì Approval by the Board of Parks and Recreation of the Consolildated
City of Indianapolis, Indiana for their 2014 Board meeting schedule.

Louvenia Holstein the Indy Parks Board Secretary asked the Board to approve the 2014 Board
Schedule and read off the dates of each month‚Äôs meeting.
A motion was duly made by Mr. Wynns, seconded by Dr. Greenwood, and unanimously passed to
approve Agenda Item #50, 2013.
2. Agenda Item #51, 2013 ‚Äì Approval by the Board of Parks and Recreation of the Consolidated
City of Indianapolis, Indiana of the Parks Department 2014 Fees and Charges.
Chairman Williams greeted Kent Knorr and Lisa Leming from Indy Parks Financial Division. Mr.
Knorr stated that they are presenting the 2014 Fees and Charges and to start out he just wanted to
share with the Board what that process entails. The Finance team met with all the Regional
Managers starting in August of of 2013 and also met with the Superintendant of Operations, the Park
Managers, the Aquatic Managers, Senior Manager of Customer Service and this was really a wideranging team effort within Indy Parks to compile this data comparing our 2013 fees and charges and
history going back as far as five or six years. This process was very detailed. They looked at
examples within other departments and studied emensely supply and demand questions as far a how
our facilities are being used. We studied the amenities we are offering and we looked at ways to
have continuity between our fees and charges so that we are charging similar fees for like facilities.
We really, he thinks have had a very detailed process this year that has gone a long way to clean up
even further the fees and charges document sheet so that it continues, in his opinion, improve every
year and be a better working tool for the department. As he mentioned that they have met yearly
with staff and were able to move forward with what you have before you today. The document you
have before you, on a detailed basis, has the changes highlighted in red. There have been a number
of changes and they will try to go through those on a high level and if you have any specific questions
they will be more than happy to answer those for you and talk you through the justification process
was for making those changes.
Daily Admissions:
He started out with the daily admissions and within Aquatics you will see some changes that include
th
new rates for holidays. What we are looking at here is the anticipation of holidays, 4 of July,
Memorial Day, and these dates tend to have a higher attendance rate so they have matched those
up to meet their week-end rates. There are some locations where they have proposed discounts
after 5:00 p.m. at locations that stay open late. What they have seen is a general trend that by 5:00
p.m. their attendance levels drop and with this discount hopefully this will encourage families to come
back to the pool and spend those couple hours at the pools to increase our revenue by offering that
discount.
At a few of our locations you will see some increases of both 50 cents and $1.00 to the addmission.
These increases are the first increases we have had in six years. The justification for doing so is
fairly simple to understand, our costs for chemicals, for utilities for water, continue to go up and we
are trying to address some of that, not drastic increases but a few increases none the less. Also
changes at Perry Ice Rink we have some adjustments admissions for both the week-end rates for
Stick & Puck where he believes it has been about 10 years since they have adjusted this and also for
free style which is a time for figure staters. Again here they just looked at industry standards and
really brought Indy Parks in line with what the other rates were in town. Josh stated that this is pretty
substantial for Stick & Puck. Kent answered, yes, it is but he doesn‚Äôt think for Stick & Puck users it
will be too detrimental because he believes they realize that Indy Parks has been giving them a big
break compared to other facilities. Kent mentioned that they have pretty limited Stick & Puck
sessions as it is at Perry, one or two a week, because they are maximized on most of the ice rental
time. You are correct. It is substantial in the sense that they have neglected to make any changes

2

on this for a number of years. J. R., the manager at Perry did some investigation and his findings
were that we were way below market value on this.
Kent asked before they move on if the Board had any questions regarding daily admissions.
Passes and Memberships:
Lisa mentioned that there are just a few changes with our Passes and Memberships. One is their
Bark Park Passes. They have created a combo pass which is new for the southside dog parks Paul
Ruster and Smock ‚Äì for the $75.00 fee you can go to both parks which are relatively close and they
feel this is a way to increase attendance at these parks without decreasing the fees. You get more
bangs for your buck! Throughout the year they also discounted rates and they have discounted
those even further for 2014 to encourage more people to buty passes throughout the year.
The weight rooms, this is something that they implemented this year, in 2013, she wanted to give the
Board an update on this. They will continue with this program and they have received a lot of feedback that it is a nice benefit to include that the parents or guardian can come in and workout while
their childrend participate in other programs. Chairman Williams wanted to add to this by stating that
the department took a look at this amenity and they not only looked at the time, not only with the
weights, but the other programs as well, and the opportunity that was there in regards to folks making
a choice to come in and swim in the later part of the day. They noticed that there was a monitary
return from offering this option to the public last year. On to the athletic fields. Josh asked a
question about the passes. He stated that this may be comparing two different things, and if so let
him know, it seems like we are raising the price of admission on pretty much all of our inner city pools
but we are lowering the price to take dogs to the dog parks. So are we seeing really good
attendance at the pools so we don‚Äôt need to encourage more folks going to the pools, but we are not
getting as much attendance at the dog parks so we are encurraging more folks to attend these?
Kent answered that there is only a decrease from July 1 and beginning September 1st because
historically the majority of people will buy their passes April through June. The feedback they have
received from customers is that they do not want to buy a pass in August if it is only going to be good
for the next four or five months at full price. It really is a pro-rated discount. The interesting thing we
are seeing at dog parks is that we are seeing more competition now. There are a few more private
dog parks and a few more park agencies that are becoming involved in dog parks too. Kent stated
that we are not the onlyt ‚ÄúDog‚Äù out there. The reality of it is we are having to become a little more
competitive on how we are pricing these.
Rental of Pavilions, Shelters, and Park Areas:
There are very few changes and most of them have to do with our shelter and pavilions. As you may
recall they did implement a Marion County Resident Discount Policy 2 years ago. This year they
have had an increase in the amount of about $2,000. Customers would find ways to get around the
higher fee for out of county residents by having other family members make the reservation.
Mr. Wynns asked what process is in place to improve the quality of the shelters. The shelters are
not in good shape, the trash is not being removed timely. This is something that you can‚Äôt control for
the quality of the shelter. There are several people that he knows who have canceled their shelter
rentals and asked for their money back because after they showed up everything was trashed. He
stated that you want to make sure that when you put your fees out there especially for high usage
areas, that you are guaranteeing a quality facility. You should make sure whoever is responsible in
DPW understands that this carrys a heavy weight for the department. Chairman Williams stated that
he can answer that question. He stated that there are a couple of things that have been going on.
The people in charge at DPW have worked with the Office of Audit and Performance to look at,

3

through a 6 sigma process, how trash collection was going to take place. They have come up with a
different plan as to how they will be addressing trash collection at those shelters and get better at
being able to identify what spots are trouble spots and marshall the resources approppriately. The
sedond thing is they have talked about how we can change what we commit to as far as a time frame
for those shelters to be clean. So instead of saying that they will be clean by 9:00 that we move that
back an hour so we will say they will be clean by 10:00 so the renter knows there is a certain period
of time that the expectation of it being cleaned is not going to be that way once they get there. If they
arrive before that time, it will not be cleaned, and we have already let them know that. We have
changed that a little bit. The third thing is, when he first started he had the Resource Team take a
look at all of our structures, like shelters and things, and tell him what shape they were in. They
rated them from good to bad. They were looking at and Danny and Dave they were both looking at
these facilities to see what needed to happen as far as getting them in better shape. Now that we
have this type of information we are able to go out and secure partnerships to try to help us, when we
do days of service, if we are going to do a roof on a shelter or something like that on a beautification
day then we make sure that we tie those things together or go out and find some more who are
willing to come on side with us with regard to rehabing the shelter and so on.
Mr. Wynns stated that these shelters could be a means of revenue for the department. You can
make money off of shelters. Chairman Williams stated that the first thing we needed to do was to go
out and take a look at them to see what shape they were in and that was what we did and now we
are moving forward.
Lisa stated that that you will see that we have a few increases as well as decreases and this is based
upon scheduling and also the amenities in the parks and what they are close to. They have also
added several new shelters in the neighborhood parks that now have either spray grounds, restroom
facilities so they do have some new sites. Mr. Wynns asked if they still have some first come, first
serve sites. Lisa stated yes. They started around three years ago when they upgraded to modular
restrooms they made sure that at least one shelter in that park was available for this option.
Chairman Williams stated that Grassy Creek Park is a good example of this as you have a shelter
and a sprayground as well. Lisa stated that you will notice an increase as well with the garden plots.
They have found that most of the people using these are seniors, so even though we have added the
increase they still receive their senior discount of 50%.
Rental of Facility Rooms:
Ken stated that under the Facility Rooms you will notice a number of changes. Those basically
reflect in a few different areas. They have some new opportunities for rentals that will stand out there
at locations that just didn‚Äôt exist before. They also have some opportunities for extended hours
where they had not been renting previously. You will see some locations where they have added
hours, say like, 6:00 p.m and this is new and then we have also made some distinction between
weekday and weekend fees. These are what constituants most of the changes. Most of the
changes within the rental facilities are not extremely drastic. Probably the location with the largest
increase is the Post Road location where you will see increases of about 30% and just a reminder
there, we have had a number of updates that are finally completed out there. So we are starting to
see the need to bring this facility in line with outher private rental facilities.
Ken stated that if the Board has any specific questions about any of these that they would be happy
to go through those. Really these changes fit between those two areas, either new opportunities or
extended hours.

4

Rental of Aquatic and Sports Facilities:

Lisa stated that the big highlight here is that they have added a new party deck at the swimming
pools for rental during the summer time. They are making this available at most of the aquatic
centers. You are basically guaranteed a certain areas on deck at the pools with picnic tables where
cutomers can have their own party. Another change is the endurance events that are not at Eagle
Creek Park rates have been the same for over 7 or 8 years which is basically $1.00 per person and
they are increasing this fee to $2.00 per person. There was an increase for demand of the large
group endurance events on the west side of Eagle Creek and more and more requests for that side
of the water on the weekends so they really didn‚Äôt have a fee set so they now have a fee for that.
They have added a new fee, the $840.00 runs are expanding on both sides.
Rental of Equipment:
Just a few changes at Perry for rental of hocky equipment, rental fee and skate sharpening. This is
still just keeping up with the industry fees as well. And new kayak rental slips out at Eagle Creek
Park and they will phase into this in 2014.
Miscellaneous Fees:
Lisa stated that the only thing they have is their preferred catering list increase. The preferred
catering list is for our caterers that cater in our park facilities and in our park shelter rentals. Once
you are on our catering list you can cater at any of our parks and it is a one-time annual fee.
The other information that they have attached, which is the athletic field list which is very detailed as
to specific fields and a part of that is the new Post Road Park usage fees that is included as well and
with that the fields are supposed to be completed in August so these fees would be effective in 2014
and they know that they will have a short season with these just opening in August and they have
st
done a lot of research, a lot of homework and they feel these are good 1 year fees and they will
have to go through 2014 and see what adjustments need to be made for the following year. Lisa
stated that she did attach their Employee Discount Program sheet and there were not changes but
usually every year we have a little bit of a tweek or change but she went ahead and attached that
anyway.
Lisa asked if there were any questions from the Board. Mr. Wynns stated that it is a very detailed
document and he doesn‚Äôt want to sound facicious, but ‚Äúcan you do anything free at Indy Parks‚Äù?
Kent answered that there are fees and these guaranteed that they can use the amenity on a said
date, for a set time, and it is available to them. Mr. Wynns stated that the question is can Indy Parks
maintain the dimond for their customers to use? Mr. Wynns stated that when you are doing fees, you
have to produce a product. If you are going to charge me $25.00 to practice at a diamond then
Maintenance is going to have the diamonds ready. It is collaboration here. If I pay $25.00 to use a
diamond and I show up and it is not lined and it is not taken care of, then you have a maintenance
issue and an image issue and you have to make sure with these fees that you are not extending
DPW workload to maintain all these fields. Kent replied that he believes Mr. Wynns is asking a fair
question and that gives us the tool to prioritize that are getting that higher level of maintenance and
the fields that are being rented we know have to be our prioritized fields. Mr. Wynns wants to make
sure that when they put a price on something then you need to provide a quality product.
Chairman Williams stated that since he has been here this is what has been done historically as far
as having fees for certain groups to come in and participate. He said he does know that a few years

5

back he had the priviledge of sitting in on the Parks folks when they did the six sigma and looked at
the fees that were not being charged for field uses for a lot of these organizations so, what we had
then was folks would come in and use the fields and pay $1.00 and tear the fields up and we were
collecting no resources, no revenues to fix the fields at that time so this is really a happy medium, if
you will, to give us a little bit of revenue for some of the fields that we know are going to be utilized by
folks who have historically used our fields and quite frankly, some of them have used them for little or
nothing and there is a deteriation of the fields because of that usage. We are trying to recoop some
of that cost and with the same thing being at mind, that there is an opportunity for people to go out
there because it is an open space to utilize these fields when nobody else is out there using them.
When they are reserved and that kind of thing then people will have to undertand that someone has
paid money to utilize that field. There are a number of parks that we have where people will just go
up and start playing soccer or throwing the ball around and unfortunately, and this is just the day that
we live in, Joe and I am sure you can appreciate this, kids just don‚Äôt get together and go play
baseball any more like we did when we were kids. They just don‚Äôt do that anymore. Most of the
activity that takes place really is about organized groups who have seen an opportunity for them to
bring kids through a group atmosphere and participate in a group sport like baseball, or soccer.
Mr. Wynns stated that he wants to offer just one small comment. He agrees. A lot of these
organizations are providing a service that Indy Parks is not providing. They are Little Leage
organizations they are charging sponsorships, their mom and dads club and if they were not
provideing that service those kids would not be served or they could organize it and give it to Indy
Parks to run and Indy Parks doesn‚Äôt have the money to do it. It is a balancing effect. You need to be
very careful that you do not price these youth organizations out of the parks because they are
providing a service for those kids. Chairman Williams stated that we are very cognisance of that. It
is a balance and that is what we are trying to do. Kent stated that we do have discounts for those
organizations built into this and we also have many examples of partnerships too. Chairman
Williams stated that a couple of baseball folks have redone the fields for us which has a dollar value
that we can actually attach to that work that they have done. Mr. Wynns stated that he is just
concerned that this service not be denied, and these organizations running these programs are
running them on shoestrings. Chairman Williams stated that that is true and he will say this, in
closing, he coached basketball and many times he came out of pocket for that and helping kids that
were disadvantaged and based on the tournaments that he participated in we are far from market
value as far as what we charge in our organization. He doesn‚Äôt think that it would be pricing folks out
of the Indy Parks system charging what we charge. He thinks that we have to continue down this
path of making sure that we have some resources coming back to us that we can help our sister
agency, like DPW, with regard to maintenance and that kind of thing because at the end of the day
whomever uses the field, they are going to put some wear and tear into them and if we are not
getting anything back for it then all we can expect to do is to continue to have an increased budget
with regard to expenditures for maintenance. We are trying to do our best to level the playing field,
no punt intended. Mr. Wynns stated that keeping kids out there playing is the goal. Mr. Williams
stated that this is Indy Parks goal as well. Mr. Wynns asked what percentage of increase of total
dollars was there from last year to this year. Lisa and Chairman Williams stated that they will
calculate this for you. Chairman Williams stated that they can calculate the number of projected
revenue would be. He wants to be sure that any additional revenue be reinvested into the
maintenance fund. His priority as a Board member is to make sure that Indy Parks has the resouces
and if you are going to generate 10% more than you did last year then this should be reinvested back
into maintaining and helping DPW with the maintenance costs.
Chairman Williams asked if there are any other questions from the Board members. Ms. Valentine
stated that she assumes this is an annual process of evaluating the fees and that sort of thing.
Chairman Williams replied, yes. Ms. Valentine stated then following up on what Mr. Wynns said, if
you find that there are some fees that all of a sudden you notice a real big down tic then we would

6

adjust them next year or if there were some sort of group that came and said we can‚Äôt afford what
you are charging, we are a reasonable organization that would respond appropriately to that if we felt
that there was a need in the community and we were not able to meet that need basically on the fees
that we are charging. Chairman Williams stated that we have worked with groups as far as trying to
help find sponsorships and things of that nature to make sure that we will continue to do the things
that we do. Again there are other groups out there who are really pretty good at doing some of these
youth sport type of things and we have been talking with them about how they can be in the parks
and how they incorporate opportunities for some of the kids that may not have. We would talk to
these sponsors to have them do outreaching to those kids that would not have the opportunity to be
on these teams etc. Chairman Williams has personnaly talked with a couple of groups to try to
determine whether or not it is feasible for them to be in Indy Parks and do the things that we would
like them to do as well. Ms. Valentine would also echo your observation that a lot of other sports that
we are well below the market rate for facility rental for those types of things and this seem to be a
good middle ground for the offereing that we have.
Dr. Greenwood asked if we have any discounts for our schools. For instance for track and field we
used to have the kids out there and she knows that the coaches state that they do not have the
money. So there is a plan of action if they do not have funds they can come to one of you and
request rental at a reduced rate? If so, who is the contact person?
Chairman Williams stated that as part of the Indy Parks policy we have 501C3 government
organizations can request a fee waiver and receive a certain percentage off of the cost of renting any
one of our facilities. If they want to do this they must first contact that park manager to discuss what
it is that they want to do and get the ball rolling. That form would be filled out and sent up to the
Director and ultimately he will sign off on them and determine what that fee waiver would be. Dr.
Greenwood thanked the Chairman.
A motion was duly made by Ms. Valentine, seconded by Mr. Bowling, and unanimously passed to
approve Agenda Item #51, 2013.
Amendment:
3. Agenda Item #17A, 2013 ‚Äì Approval by the Board of Parks and Recreation of the
Consolidated City of Indianapolis for Amendment #1, to the Professional Service Agreement
with Edward George & Associates by extending time for Evaluation & Programming of
Existing HVAC Controllers at Thatcher, Indy Island, Perry and Municipal Gardens Parks.
Danny Swails thanked the Board secretary and introduced himself, as the Construction Project
Manager for the Department of Public Works. Back in February of 2013 the Board allowed them to
enter into a Professional Services Agreement with Edward George & Associates to evaluate and
program the existing HVAC controllers at the above-mentioned parks. He is only requesting a time
extention on this. After entering into this agreement they discussed with the contractor a way that
they could be more efficient with the labor hours and through ISA obtained them remote access and
it took awhile to obtain this access which allows them to log onto these systems remotely and save a
ton of labor hours. That agreement expires December 31, 2013 and this amendment is to extend it
to June 30, 2014 and this is all this is. If the Board has any questions he would be happy to answer
them.
Dr. Greenwood asked if there was any additional cost. Mr. Swails answered that there were no
additional costs.
Chairman Williams asked if there were any additional questions from the Board. There were none.

7

A motion was duly made by Dr. Greenwood, seconded by Mr. Wynns, and unanimously passed to
approve Agenda Item #17A, 2013.
Mr. Swails thanked the Board and wished them a Merry Christmas. Chairman Williams stated that
this concludes any agenda items that we have. Chairman Williams thanked the Board members too
and he thinks he failed to mention them when he was speaking earlier for your service and he knows
that sometimes it takes you away from family and the things that you could be doing to sit on this
board and offer your opinions and also offer your expertise and helping us move the City‚Äôs Parks
Department in the right direction so again I appreciate your service to the City of Indianapolis and
help him out as we move forward into 2014 to do bigger and better things. Happy Holidays
Adjournment
A motion was duly made by Dr. Greenwood for adjournment, seconded by by Mr. Wynns
and unanimously passed to adjourn.
The next Board of Parks and Recreation meeting is scheduled for January 23, 2014 at 3:45 p.m. to
5:00 p.m. in Room 260 of the City-County Building, 200 East Washington Street, Indianapolis,

APPROVAL OF MINUTES
Mr. Rudolph: May I have a motion to approve the minutes of the July meeting?
Mrs. Greenwell: There is a correction. There was a scrivener‚Äôs error on the King‚Äôs
petition. It said it was approved and it was actually denied. The vote count was correct.
But we need to make a record that it will be corrected in the minutes.
Mrs. Musgrave: I will move approval and make the necessary changes and the staff will
bring those changes forward. (Upon unanimous voice vote, the minutes of the July
meeting will be approved at the September meeting when corrected.)
Mrs. Musgrave: Mr. Chair, you said that several of the matters are not going forward
today. Which ones are they for the benefit of anyone who may be here?
Mr. Rudolph: It is the first three on our agenda.

If you are here on any of these matters, you may want to leave at this time.
Mr. Rudolph: The Board of Zoning Appeals is an appointed seven member Board
established by State Legislature. It is given the responsibility to hear and act on all
appeals, requests for variances from the zoning code and establishment of special uses.
Since there are seven members of the Board of Zoning Appeals, to establish a quorum, we
must have four members present in order for a petition to be approved or denied. If you do
not have four votes to either approve or deny the request, you have the opportunity to go
before the Board the next month and be heard again. The denial of a petition for a
variance, special use, or an appeal by the Board of Zoning Appeals or the withdrawal of
such a petition by the petitioner shall prohibit the Board of Zoning Appeals from hearing the
petition for a variance, special use, or an appeal for the subject property or a part thereof
for 12 months from the date of the denial or withdrawal. An exception may be made upon
unanimous vote of the Board of Zoning Appeals. In granting a variance or special use, the
Board may set any conditions, requirements or limitations that it deems necessary and
which are appropriate to implement the principles and purposes of the zoning ordinance.
The Board keeps minutes of official action of its proceedings. These minutes and files are
public records and are kept in the Area Plan Commission office in Room 312 of the Civic
Center Complex. When you come before us, we ask that you state your name and
address into the microphone, since everything is recorded and kept as record.
This Board, which by State law, is a quasi-judicial body that cannot be contacted by the
public prior to the Board of Zoning Appeals hearings, has jurisdiction over two types of
petitions. One is special use and the other is variance. Neither of these categories is a
rezoning. They are special waivers or special conditions that this Board has authorization
to grant to the petitioner. A variance is an application to waive or modify certain
requirements of the Zoning Ordinance. It is not a rezoning of the property. In order to
receive approval, the following criteria must be satisfied.
The four conditions necessary to grant a variance are summarized as follows:
1.

The approval will not be injurious to the public health, safety, morals, and general
welfare of the community;

2.

The use and value of the area adjacent to the property included in the variance will
not be affected in a substantially adverse manner;

Board of Zoning Appeals
August 15, 2013
Page 3

3.

The strict application of the terms of the zoning ordinance will result in practical
difficulties in the use of the property;

4.

The variance is not a variance of the use of the property;

In our review of variance requests, the Zoning Code establishes the criteria that must be
applied to each petition. The Code specifically requires that these criteria must all be met
for a variance to be granted.
The second category that we have before this Board would be special uses. Certain uses
are necessary to the life and economic health of the community. But they have
characteristics of the operation that do not readily permit classification in the usual
residential, commercial or industrial districts. Special uses are secondary classifications.
They are not rezonings. In order for a special use to be approved, the following criteria are
used:
1.

whether the specific site is the appropriate location for the use;

2.

whether the use, as developed, will adversely affect the surrounding
area;
whether there will be a nuisance or a serious hazard to vehicles, pedestrians
or residences;
whether adequate and appropriate facilities will be provided for proper
operation of the use;

3.
4.

5.

whether the use is in harmony with the Evansville and Vanderburgh County
Comprehensive Plan; and

6.

whether the use is essential or desirable to the public convenience and
welfare.

The Board of Zoning Appeals approval or modification of a special use classification may
include whatever reasonable conditions, limitations, or temporary uses necessary for the
protection of the public interest.
To protect public interest and to ensure compliance with requirements to be included in the
site plan, the Board of Zoning Appeals may require whatever evidence and guarantees are
necessary to assure compliance with conditions, limitations, and temporary uses. There
will be a ten minute time limit for petitioners and then a 10 minute opportunity for
remonstrators. Following that, the petitioner will have five minutes for rebuttal.

Mr. Rudolph: The next meeting of the Board of Zoning Appeals is Thursday, September
19, 2013 at 4:00 p.m. in Room 301 of the Civic Center Complex. Now let‚Äôs move on to the
first petition on the agenda.
Mr. Stahl: Mr. London, do you swear or affirm that the testimony you will give is true and
accurate so help you God? (Mr. London has been sworn in.)
VARIANCES
Docket No: 2013-36-BZA Applicant: Ronnie & Patsy Thomason
Common Address: (Complete legal on file.) 5815 Millersburg Road
Nature of Case: Applicant requests relaxation of the restrictions of the zoning code to
allow temporary placement of a mobile home.
Mr. London: Ronnie and Patsy Thomason are requesting a renewal of their temporary
variance to relax the restrictions of the zoning code to allow temporary placement of a
mobile home. The Vanderburgh County code allows only one dwelling per lot in the
Agricultural district. In 2009, the Thomasons contacted Area Plan Commission regarding
reconstruction of their flood-damaged residence. At the time of the application, it was
noted by staff that there was an existing mobile home on the site, occupied by a sick
elderly parent of the owners. Area Plan Commission staff contacted the Thomasons with
an agreement, allowing the construction of their new home, subject to immediate removal
of the existing mobile home upon the demise of the mother who was residing in the mobile
unit. Since that time, Area Plan Commission staff was notified by the Building Commission
office that the existing Thomason house had received such extensive damage to its
foundation as a result of recent flooding that they had ordered the residence to be vacated
immediately for safety reasons, and all utilities were disconnected from the house as a
safety precaution. The Thomasons then moved into the existing mobile home on the site.
The existing residence has been demolished. In August of 2012, the Board of Zoning
Appeals approved a one-year time limit to allow the temporary maintenance of the mobile
home on the site. The Thomasons have obtained permit approval for their new home from
Area Plan Commission, and have been preparing their site for construction of their new
home. They had run into an issue with their septic system which has just recently been
resolved, and are preparing for their issuance of final building permits. They are requesting
additional time to work through the issues that they had encountered. It is recommended
by staff that the mobile home be approved only for the period of construction of the new
home. Once the Thomasons are able to move into their new home, the mobile home
should immediately be removed from the site or they will be in violation of the zoning code
for having two residences on one lot. This is a request for relaxation of zoning
requirements to allow for the temporary placement of a mobile home.
Mr. Stahl: All those who will speak on this petition, raise your right hand. Do you swear or

Board of Zoning Appeals
August 15, 2013
Page 5

affirm that the testimony you will give is true and accurate so help you God? (Those
persons have been sworn in.)
Mrs. Thomason: Patsy Thomason.
Mr. Thomason: Ronnie Thomason, 5815 Millersburg Road, Evansville.
Mr. Rudolph: And you are both living in the trailer now?
Mrs. Thomason: Yes.
Mr. Rudolph: I remember the case a year or two ago when you came before us. Les
Shively was your attorney. So I‚Äôm familiar with what is going on. How much time do you
think you will need to work out the problems with the septic tank and get the home under
construction?
Mrs. Thomason: We are hoping that the problems have already been taken care of. But
the way things are going, we are afraid to say yes because it seems like every time we
think something is going right, something else happens. So if you could, we would like
another year, if possible. But the mobile home will be gone when we can get into our home
and are living in it. That‚Äôs not an issue. We just don‚Äôt know how long this is going to take.
Like you said last year, the way weather is, and getting everything set up the way we need
to do before we can move in. We were supposed to be able to get our building permit after
I saw you that day. There was issues with that that I wasn‚Äôt aware of so there is a holdup
on that now. So it‚Äôs just one thing after another. So we would appreciate the year.
Mr. Rudolph: Janet, I have one question for you. As the trailer sits there now by itself, is
there any violation of any ordinances or codes?
Mrs. Greenwell: Technically yes because trailers and mobile homes are allowed only a
mobile home court. This one has been there since the 70s so I think that it‚Äôs probably close
to being uninhabitable in that they probably couldn‚Äôt move it off if they wanted to. It would
probably destroy the unit. I will say, the problems that the Thomasons encountered,
because I went to Building Commission and asked them, dealt with the flood elevations
which you probably didn‚Äôt even know. I think you may already have the information, you
just don‚Äôt know it. When you applied before, you gave elevations by a surveyor and that is
what they were looking for. Had I known that, I would have gone and helped them. But I
didn‚Äôt know until you left.
Mrs. Thomason: Yes we were unaware of everything.
Mrs. Greenwell: I think it is already taken care of. If you come in our office, we will help

Board of Zoning Appeals
August 15, 2013
Page 6

you work with Dave Ballew with the Building Commission.
Mrs. Thomason: He has already called me and he has some other issues that I had to
call the surveyor to talk to them about. It takes a lot of doing which we didn‚Äôt realize we
were going to have to do all of this. We are new at this.
Mr. Rudolph: I was by there today. Is the new home going to be built on that elevated
pad I see and that‚Äôs up above the floodplain?
Mr. Thomason: No. The home has to be three foot higher than what the dirt is that we
hauled in.
Mr. Rudolph: Does that road flood?
Mr. Thomason: Yes. The road in front of our house does get under water. Not every
year.
Mrs. Thomason: We have lived there for 42 years and we have only had water in our
basement one time. That‚Äôs when it destroyed the basement.
Mr. Rudolph: Are there any other questions or remonstrators?
Mrs. Thomason: I know they want the mobile home gone immediately. But if we could
just relax that a little bit and give us a couple months after we get into the house because
you are talking about a lot on us to do all that and then turn right around and try to empty
the mobile home also. So a couple month leeway there would really help us out.
Mr. Rudolph: Is a year going to be enough time?
Mrs. Thomason: A year would be enough. But the problem I had was the way it was
worded. It would have to be removed immediately. The immediately I‚Äôm not sure we can
do after we move into the home.
Mr. Rudolph: I don‚Äôt think we mean that the second the builder completes it.
Mr. Stahl: I think if you want to make a motion that clarifies that, you can say they have a
year to build the house and then 60 days from the completion of the house, so that would
give you a maximum of two months. That‚Äôs just one way to do it.
Mr. Rudolph: Another way would be 18 months or two years.
Mr. Lehman: I will make a motion that we approve it for 18 months.

Board of Zoning Appeals
August 15, 2013
Page 7

Mr. Rudolph: So you motion is that in 18 months, they need to have the house built and
the trailer off the property. (Motion was made and seconded.) Call the roll.
Ayes: Mr. Lehman, Mrs. Musgrave, Mr. Parkhurst, Mr. Pedtke, Mr. Utley, Mr. Zehner, Mr.
Rudolph
Nays: None
There being 7 affirmative votes, Docket No: 2013-36-BZA is approved.
Mr. Rudolph: So as of today, you have 18 months to get the house built and your stuff
moved.
SPECIAL USES
Docket No: 19-2013-APC Applicant: Alan Ripplemeier
Common Address: (Complete legal on file.) 4116 Koressel Road
Nature of Case: Applicant requests a special use for a farm winery/vineyard
Mr. London: Alan Ripplemeier is requesting approval of SU-25 to allow establishment of
a farm winery in conjunction with his vineyard at 4116 Koressel Road. Mr. Ripplemeyer
has a 15 acre site located on the west side of Koressel Road, north of Marx Road. The
zoning code Chapter 17.28.050 requires approval of a special use permit (SU-25) by the
Board of Zoning Appeals for those uses identified in Use Group 19 in the zoning code. On
June 18, 2013, Vanderburgh County adopted a change to Use Group 19, adding ‚ÄúFarm
Products Processing and Sales - where fruits, vegetables, or other planted crops grown on
site are processed including but not limited to cooking, mixing with other ingredients,
bottling, packaging, etc. that transforms the fruits, vegetables, or other crops into higher
valued farm products for human ingestion (‚Äúvalue added farm products‚Äù). Such processing
may involve the making of wines, ciders, jams, jellies, and other consumable food or
beverage products.‚Äù The approval of this proposed farm winery requires SU 25 approval.
The proposed farm winery use requires parking spaces in an amount determined by the
Board of Zoning Appeals to be reasonably adequate to serve the public for customers,
patrons, visitors, and employees. The submitted site plan indicates a 15-space compacted
stone parking and access drive. Farm wineries and similar uses are further restricted by
ordinance as follows: 1. Written requests for temporary use of substitute crops grown off
site may be submitted to and approved by the APC Director upon the review of
documentation provided with the request of an unusually low on site crop harvest or other
special circumstances. 2. The sale of these value added farm products is allowed as
follows: a. The sale of other foods and beverages is allowed as long as these items are
associated with or commonly consumed with the value added farm product, are incidental
to the primary farm use, and do not involve cooking or preparation on-site; b. The sale of

Board of Zoning Appeals
August 15, 2013
Page 8

other incidental items commonly associated with the value added farm product or the farm
use is also allowed. 3. Facilities for the on-site processing, retail display, sales, and
sampling of value added farm products are allowed within the following parameters:
a. The facilities must be strictly ancillary and incidental to the primary farming use; b. The
facilities may include patio seating or other outdoor areas for picnics, agri-tourism
gatherings, private noncommercial gatherings hosted by the property owner or the farm
use operator, or other activities incidental to the farm use.
Mr. Stahl: All those who will speak on this petition, raise your right hand. Do you swear or
affirm that the testimony you will give is true and accurate so help you God? (Those
persons have been sworn in.)
Mr. Ripplemeier: My name is Alan Ripplemeier, 5010 West Franklin Road. I am the
owner of the property.
Mr. Rudolph: Why don‚Äôt you tell us a little about what you are here for and what you hope
to accomplish?
Mr. Ripplemeier: What we are here for, we currently have a vender on the property
consisting of about five acres of grapes and we would like to open up a farm winery and
operate it there on site at the vineyard, according to Indiana Code, and according to the
new amended ordinance. That‚Äôs our main purpose, to try to open up a business, have a
farm winery in Vanderburgh County.
Mr. Rudolph: So you are going to be building and taking the grapes and making the wine
there on the site?
Mr. Ripplemeier: Grapes would be processed on site and in the building, we would have
a tasting room for patrons to come in and taste and purchase the wine.
Mr. Rudolph: Alright. I‚Äôll open it up to questions from the Board.
Mrs. Musgrave: So you own the ground and you leased it to someone for this operation?
Mr. Ripplemeier: I own the ground and I operate the vineyard, grow the grapes myself. It
would be ours.
Mrs. Musgrave: I just got confused. I obviously easily get confused today. But you gave a
different address than the address of the property.
Mr. Ripplemeier: Yes. You asked where I live. I live at 5010 West Franklin Road. The
property is located at 4116 Koressel Road. I do not live there.

Board of Zoning Appeals
August 15, 2013
Page 9

Mr. Rudolph: Will you be using only your grapes, or are you going to be bringing in
grapes?
Mr. Ripplemeier: According to the county ordinance, I can only use my grapes.
Mr. Pedtke: This is something that, at Area Plan, we crafted with the expertise of Mr. Stahl
and Mr. Blaine Oliver at Area Plan staff. The trick was that they grow the grapes there,
they process it and then they serve it. So that‚Äôs how the special use kind of came up with
it. So there is a lot of thought in how this special use is going to be applied. As far as I‚Äôm
concerned, there are other bodies like the State of Indiana that regulate the business that‚Äôs
going to be happening on sites. So there are some things that typically we might look into.
But in this case, I think we don‚Äôt have too. It‚Äôs good to see that this land can be used in a
very productive way and now we get a winery in our county.
Mr. Rudolph: Will you be selling other products there like jams and jellies?
Mr. Ripplemeier: Probably not jams and jellies. It would be probably associated items that
go along with wines that you would normally see or have at a winery. You could have
cheeses, sausages, bottle holders, cork screws, things like that that would be associated
with it.
Mr. Rudolph: Not that they are going to, but what if they use it for a farmer‚Äôs market kind
of location? Does that fall within the parameters of what you all have set up?
Mr. Pedtke: I think it has to be the processing on that parcel. It‚Äôs got to be what you grow
there. The only flexibility that I can see of the product being grown and processed and
served there is that if there is a bad year for a crop, they may bring in more supplies to
make that same kind of product, as long as they get the authority or permission from the
executive director of the Area Plan Commission.
Mrs. Musgrave: Is he being limited to wine only? Or if he bought a bunch of goats, he do
cheese and things like that?
Mr. Stahl: That‚Äôs why the ordinance was written as a value added products rather than
specifying that it‚Äôs‚Ä¶INAUDIBLE
Mr. Rudolph: Any other questions? Are there any remonstrators?
Ms. Schenks: My name is Peggy Schenks. 4224 Koressel Road. Our property is located
directly next to their property. So there‚Äôs questions we have. The location of the 2,500
square foot building, where exactly is it going to be located?

Board of Zoning Appeals
August 15, 2013
Page 10

Mr. Rudolph: You know where the existing building is that sits there? My observation
when I was out there was it looked like it was going to be north of that building. There is
going to be a driveway coming off Koressel Road. Then as it approaches that existing
building, it makes a turn to the right going north.
Ms. Schenks: Is that a copy of something that we are available to have also?
Mr. Stahl: Yes.
Ms. Schenks: Do we walk right out of our house and see the whole back of the building?
That‚Äôs kind of in reference to it as what I‚Äôm looking at.
Mr. Rudolph: Are you located north of this property and on the same side of the road?
Ms. Schenks: Yes.
Mr. Rudolph: I don‚Äôt know the answer to that question but I think that might be a
possibility that you would walk out and see the back of it.
Mrs. Musgrave: Have you had the opportunity to talk with them?
Mrs. Schenks: Yes. These are the questions I have. The location of the building, and if
the building is directly right by our property, if there would be consideration in moving the
building south or towards the lake or anything like that. The other one is, how does that
affect our property value with a business going right next to us? Secondly, when the
ground was being done, there was some drainage issues and we just want to know that is
taken care of. When you start digging dirt and putting a building in, there is a hill and it
could drain down into our property. We just want to know that is taken care of. Then just
in general, because there is a lot of, in the asking of things, there is a lot of clay in it. They
could host private things and then, because it‚Äôs County, is there a noise ordinance? At
one in the morning when they are hosting a private event, is that going to affect noise and
things like that? And that we also have a special needs child at home. We just want to
know that the safety of her is taken care of. Just a lot of questions.
Mr. Rudolph: Those are all good questions.
Mr. Ripplemeier: As far as the location of the building, according to the site plan, the
location of the building sits to the south side of their property and to the rear of their
property. If you are looking directly to the north, it is not in direct view of their house. The
building would be like on the back side of their back yard.
Mr. Rudolph: About how far off the property line?

Board of Zoning Appeals
August 15, 2013
Page 11

Mr. Ripplemeier: It is listed to be 50 feet off the property line. It is roughly close to 180190 feet off the road, which that property line is probably maybe 290 feet.
Mr. Rudolph: So from a western direction, it is going to be about in the same location
west-wise as the existing building?
Mr. Ripplemeier: It would be farther west.
Mrs. Greenwell: The site plan shows it 188 feet from Koressel Road.
Mr. Ripplemeier: I don‚Äôt know if the site plan shows the property line being 200+ feet,
Mrs. Greenwell: It doesn‚Äôt show it.
Mr. Ripplemeier: Currently, the mouse, if you ran that a little to the north, that would be
about the location of the building.
Mr. Rudolph: On the west side, is that about also where it would be located?
Mr. Ripplemeier: Probably a little farther to the east, not much, maybe 50 feet.
Mr. Rudolph: What business hours do you think you might operate?
Mr. Ripplemeier: It was projected proposed business hours would be Thursday-Sunday
11-6. We don‚Äôt plan on doing any 1 o‚Äôclock private functions. I am retired. This is a
retirement business for me. I don‚Äôt plan on spending most of my life there. Best case
would be that we opened up on a Wednesday. But it would be closed Monday and
Tuesday as well. The same hours, 11-6.
Mr. Rudolph: Can you sell wines on Sundays there?
Mr. Ripplemeier: Yes according to the Indiana Code.
Mr. Rudolph: Give me your hours again?
Mr. Ripplemeier: 11-6 say Wednesday through Sunday.
Mr. Rudolph: Are you aware of any drainage problems?
Mr. Rudolph: Are you aware of any drainage problems?
Mr. Ripplemeier: We are the highest point so all the water on our property drains downhill

Board of Zoning Appeals
August 15, 2013
Page 12

and they are at a low level below us. There is some natural drainage, a little swale that
goes right down into the yard.
Mr. London: I would like to let everybody know that this will have to go in front of Site
Review so drainage issues and things like that will have to be reviewed and approved by all
the members of that committee.
Mr. Stahl: That‚Äôs a good point. The drawings that we have are kind of just to give us an
idea of what it might look like. But this body does not approve exactly where the building is
going or anything like that or drainage. The question before this body right now is, is it
appropriate to allow this special use on this parcel of land, somewhere on this parcel of
land.
Mr. Rudolph: I think you need to be cognizant of how your construction may affect
additional drainage onto their property and do everything you can to keep it on your
property. The matter of property values, I don‚Äôt know if we can speak to that or not.
Mr. Stahl: That‚Äôs an element of the considerations. But without evidence, ma‚Äôam, have
you talked to a realtor or appraiser?
Ms. Schenks: This is the first thing that we have done.
Mr. Stahl: So it was more of a question on your part.
Ms. Schenks: We just had questions about it.
Mr. Lehman: What‚Äôs the dash line up in the corner up there? Is that an existing thing
going to be torn down or something?
Mr. Ripplemeier: The dash line is the location of the septic system.
Mr. Rudolph: What kind of grapes are you going to grow/
Mr. Ripplemeier: We currently grow about 2,000 grapes. We have seven varieties.
Concord, Stuben, ???, ?? whites, Nortons. Most of them are American and French
hybrids.
Mrs. Musgrave: I wanted to ask the neighbor if she was satisfied with those answers,
whether she had any follow up questions?
Ms. Schenks: I do have a couple. This is just to approve the permit, not the building or
the hours even or what would happen on the property?

Board of Zoning Appeals
August 15, 2013
Page 13

Mr. Stahl: Well, it would approve his ability to use that property for that purpose.
Ms. Schenks: Just because too, just sometimes because you don‚Äôt have plans to host
parties and do that, but if that‚Äôs in there to approve and there is lots of people and do you
have the space, I didn‚Äôt know if that is what we are asking in the permit? As far as the
safety, the traffic, how is that stuff regulated?
Ms. Musgrave: Well at this meeting is when you have the opportunity to request changes.
Not that I‚Äôm suggesting you do anything like this, but if you wanted him to put a fence or
build a berm or plant trees or other things like that, this is where you would get him to make
this commitment. Once he gets that building to do this and it sounds like a wonderful thing,
this is where that would happen. Once he gets the permission and leaves, he is pretty
much done. Exce0pt for the site review.
Mr. Schenks: I‚Äôm not opposed to that being there It just like all those things. If the
building is 50 feet from our house, and I‚Äôm not saying change happens, but for the last
however many years we have been the only person right there. That‚Äôs kind of hard to walk
out and see a commercial building 50 feet, because it‚Äôs not a residential building. It‚Äôs a
commercial building, 50 feet from your property that could potentially have people there
drinking or this or that, and you know that‚Äôs their reasoning for coming there. And just with
our child‚Äôs safety. And you have other children and I know they are perfectly aware of that
because they have family that has kids our age right there too. I just want to know that
stuff like that is taken care of.
Mrs. Musgrave: He is not proposing to take care of anything. If there is something you
want to propose‚Ä¶
Ms. Schenks: Well, I would propose that the building location be moved. Or somehow
that there is a property fence or things like that. I would also propose that there was some
regulations on how many people could, a maximum capacity. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs possible
or not. Or the hours of special gatherings are different. Or that the noise, I‚Äôm not really
sure. And just to make sure. The drainage, he is the highest point and it down hill. Not
only does it affect our property, but just the drainage in general drains down the hill into
other people‚Äôs driveways to wash out things.
Mr. Rudolph: The drainage issue, I‚Äôm certainly at a loss to see how the building of this is
going to increase the water flow on your property. I don‚Äôt see how it would.
Ms. Schenks: I don‚Äôt know. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm just asking because right now there isn‚Äôt
necessarily. But when it rains heavy and hard, just on our property line down, you can
watch it down our fence line and go down and make it dirt spots, which not a huge deal.
We just don‚Äôt want it to be exceeded more.

Board of Zoning Appeals
August 15, 2013
Page 14

Mr. Stahl: I think from a certain standpoint, these are not strictly speaking commercial,
more like ag there, a special ag operation, agricultural. As far as the occupancy, the fire
marshal sets that in terms of indoor capacity. I don‚Äôt know that there are any, and there
could be but I just don‚Äôt know of them, I don‚Äôt know of any regulations relating to outdoor
spaces. I guess it‚Äôs possible to have a big party anywhere. Living out there, if you‚Äôre like
most people who live out there that I know you have been to maybe a bonfire.
Ms. Schenks: Well we don‚Äôt. But we understand that.
Mr. Stahl: There are limited parking spaces. It‚Äôs not a terribly large site. In terms of
moving the building, the septic bed can‚Äôt be moved according to the owner. I think that
was, who told you that sir?
Mr. Ripplemeier: I had a soils engineer come out and test the soils. And it would be very
difficult to INAUDIBLE PORTIONS
Ms. Musgrave: Are you willing to do anything to address her concerns? I know she hasn‚Äôt
asked you anything in particular.
Mr. Ripplemeier: I would be willing to plant trees. INAUDIBLE‚Ä¶
Mr. Rudolph: So she would still see you?
Mr. Ripplemeier: INAUDIBLE
Ms. Schenks: I think that would help if there is not other options.
Mrs. Musgrave: Well, I would be willing to include that in a motion since you have agreed
to it on the floor, if we are ready for one.
Mr. Rudolph: If there are no other remonstrators, we are ready for a motion.
Mrs. Musgrave: Move approval of the request and make it a condition that you plant trees
that are mutually agreeable wit this particular neighbor.
Mr. Stahl: And where do you want the trees?
Mrs. Musgrave: In a location that is agreeable to Peggy Schenks.
INAUDIBLE
Mrs. Musgrave: You guys work that out.

Mr. Parkhurst: Well the biggest problem I see is, what if they can‚Äôt work it out? Maybe
the better thing is, if we can get him to agree to put up trees along the property line that
would block her view.
Mr. Ripplemeier: I would be willing to plant two rows of trees along the north property line
of their property within 10 feet of the existing fence.
Mr. Stahl: On how big centers?
Mr. Ripplemeier: Probably eight foot centers.
Mrs. Musgrave: And how long?
Mr. Ripplemeier: INAUDIBLE‚Ä¶.at least to the 25 foot setback line.
Ms. Schenks: I would be willing to just, I don‚Äôt know, like, meet you there and just kind of
you point out, ok. You say this is where it is, and we could kind of talk about that. I mean I
don‚Äôt have any issues with that.
Mr. Ripplemeier: INAUDIBLE
Mr. Lehman: The other thing about tying it to the property line exactly is, because of the
contours, if you plant them next to the property line by your fence, it may take 20 years for
them to get tall enough it blocks their view. Whereas, if you move them up the property
line a little big, it might be better. I know Mr. Ripplemeier and he would be easy to work
with. I‚Äôd have this next door to my house no question. So I kind of like the idea of letting
them work it out. I think that Peggy seems to be a reasonable person and I know Mr.
Ripplemeier is. He is very conscientious and wants to be a good neighbor. I would
recommend we just let them work it out.
Mr. Stahl: The motion needs a second.
Mr. Rudolph: We have a motion and second. Call the roll.
Ayes: Mrs. Musgrave, Mr. Parkhurst, Mr. Pedtke, Mr. Utley, Mr. Zehner, Mr. Lehman, Mr.
Rudolph
Nays: None
There being 7 affirmative votes, Docket No: 19-2013-APC is approved.
Mr. Rudolph: We will leave it up to you guys to get it worked out. I think it is going to work

out just fine.
Ms. Schenks: I thing we had seasonable questions. Absolutely.
Docket No: 21-2013-APC Applicant: Living Hope Baptist Church, Inc.
Common Address: (Complete legal on file.) 4925 Hitch Peters Road
Nature of Case: Applicant requests a special use for a church and church-related
incidental facilities.
Mr. London: Living Hope Baptist Church is requesting SU-2 approval to allow
establishment of a church within the commercial building at 4925 Hitch Peters Road. The
petition filed by the church indicates that the church is requesting to lease the existing
commercial building one day each week, presumably on a day when the structure is not
otherwise in use by the owner Medic On-Site Services. The zoning code Chapter
18.145.050 requires approval of a special use permit (SU-2) by the Board of Zoning
Appeals for churches and church-related incidental facilities. There is an existing, partially
paved and partially graveled parking lot that was installed when the building was built in
1980. There are two paved access drives onto Hitch Peters Road, one at the south end of
the property, and one approximately 130 feet north of the south drive that leads to the front
of the building. The site plan submitted indicates approximately 106 parking spaces could
be available on the site within the area that is predominantly gravel. Space is available for
additional parking on site if it should become necessary for the use of the site. A church
requires 0.3 parking spaces for each seat in the church. Although no information has been
submitted regarding the proposed church attendance, the existing parking lot would
facilitate up to a 350-seat church, and there is space available on-site should the
congregation exceed that amount. Compliance with all code requirements will be
determined by Staff upon issuance of a Change of Business (occupancy) permit.
Mr. Stahl: All those who will speak on this petition, raise your right hand. Do you swear or
affirm that the testimony you will give is true and accurate so help you God? (Those
persons have been sworn in.)
Mr. Garrett: My name is Tim Garrett, 4007 Stringtown road.
Mr. Rudolph: I don‚Äôt have any questions so I‚Äôm going to open it up to the Board.
Mr. Utley: Do you have anything to add other than what was read into the record?
Mr. Garrett: No.
Mr. Rudolph: And this is just one day a week?

Board of Zoning Appeals
August 15, 2013
Page 17

Mr. Garrett: Yes. We used it on a Saturday for a funeral dinner and like a Good Friday
service on a Friday night. But we basically lease it one day a week, Sunday.
Mr. Stahl: Do you have another facility somewhere?
Mr. Garrett: No, what happened was, we are just two years old, so we met at the Holiday
Inn, the Clarion Inn. We borrowed my sister‚Äôs church in the afternoon. So the owners who
were great to work with said we could put a sign up. So we had the sign built and did the
permit and got a call that said we couldn‚Äôt have a church there. So we had no idea. So
soon as we found out, we started the process. So we have met in those hotels, but we
have been in this building since January. So we are just trying to make it right.
Mr. Rudolph: What part of the building do you utilize for the church?
Mr. Garrett: We use the front part. But the building is kind of set up into two parts. The
back part is where they keep their ambulances and equipment. Then the front part is about
7,000 square feet and has the big auditorium, nursery and three classrooms, kitchen, two
bathrooms. They also use those classrooms and teach CPR and that kind of thing. So we
use the front part of the building.
Mr. Rudolph: So it‚Äôs kind of already set up to your benefit?
Mr. Garrett: Yes. It used to be used for like weddings, banquets, receptions. Then when
these people bought it, they kept the front end like it was for classrooms and the big room.
So we rented it one Sunday by the previous owner and I found out they were keeping it
that way so I contacted them and we worked it out to set up a one year lease.
Mr. Rudolph: Great. Any other questions? Any remonstrators? (None.) Is there a
motion for approval? (Motion was made and seconded.) Call the roll.
Ayes: Mr. Parkhurst, Mr. Pedtke, Mr. Utley, Mr. Zehner, Mr. Lehman, Mrs. Musgrave, Mr.
Rudolph

Docket No: 22-2013-APC Applicant: Christian Fellowship Church/Sign Crafters, Inc.
Common Address: (Complete legal on file.) 4100 Millersburg Road
Nature of Case: Applicant requests a special use for an electronic message sign.
Mr. London: Sign Crafters is requesting Special Use # 13 approval on behalf of Christian

Board of Zoning Appeals
August 15, 2013
Page 18

Fellowship Church at 4100 Millersburg Road. The church proposes erection of an
electronic sign along their Millersburg Road frontage. The County zoning code Chapter
17.28.050 requires approval of a special use permit (SU-13) by the Board of Zoning
Appeals for all electronic message boards and/or signs with flashing, moving, rotating or
intermittent lights, or animated messages. Special Use # 13 is permitted with BZA approval
only in commercial or industrial districts. The church rezoned a 20‚Äô x 20‚Äô part of their 67+
acre site to C-1 zoning with a use and development commitment limiting use of the small
site to signage for the church. The C-1 zoning classification allowed the church to file for
the BZA electronic sign special use. Access exists on the site as was approved by Site
Review. The proposed electronic signage must not interfere with traffic by reducing
visibility for egress onto Millersburg Road. This is a request to allow installation of a 28 sq
ft electronic message unit as part of a proposed new 84 sq ft monument sign planned on
the church property along the Millersburg Road frontage. Compliance with overall signage
will be addressed by staff prior to issuance of permits for the new sign.
Mr. Stahl: All those who will speak on this petition, raise your right hand. Do you swear or
affirm that the testimony you will give is true and accurate so help you God? (Those
persons have been sworn in.)
Ms. Owens: My name is Brenda Owens with Sign Crafters, 1508 Stringtown Road. I‚Äôm
representing Christian Fellowship Church. Basically we are requesting your blessing for
their new sign that they need desperately.
Mr. Rudolph: It‚Äôs a good looking sign I think. Not invasive. Fits in with the neighborhood.
Ms. Owens: It‚Äôs actually smaller. The initial sign they had was a pole sign a lot taller.
They want something lower to the ground just to let the church members know different
activities and things that is going on at the church.
Mr. Rudolph: Any questions? How far off the edge of the road will this be, because I think
there is a ditch. Are you going to be in the ditch?
Ms. Owens: No, it‚Äôs actually back.
Mr. Rudolph: It looks like it is set back far enough where it‚Äôs not going to be an issue.
Ms. Owens: We had so many feet back from the right-of-way that we had to be. Then we
had Morley and Associates who did a survey also.
Mr. Rudolph: Are there any questions? Are there any remonstrators? (None.) Is there a
motion for approval? (Motion was made and seconded.) Call the roll.

BUSINESS MEETING
Mrs. Greenwell: The first two items on the agenda tonight, according to our ordinance,
should the petitioner fail to comply with notice requirements as provided by this section
before the second regular meeting (and this is he second meeting) of the Board of Zoning
Appeals following the date the petition is filed, the petition shall be withdrawn by the Board
and the time limits imposed for the withdrawal is the same as a denial. So it would be a
one year time limit before they could reapply.
Mr. Rudolph: Okay. Is the applicant aware of that?
Mrs. Greenwell: I have talked at length with the first two on the agenda. Mrs. Porter
doesn‚Äôt seem to know exactly what she wants to do. Just yesterday I talked with Mr.
Helmer. I had expected him to email me a withdrawal letter. He is not going to go forward.
He is going to let his home go into foreclosure. The company that placed the manufactured
home on the site placed it incorrectly. He is having trouble getting them to correct it and he
is walking away from it. I‚Äôm sure the company, if they are not going to get paid, will
probably move the house. In the past, we have typically given one final notice letter if you
don‚Äôt comply with a notice and pay your continuance fees by a certain date then we would
ask them to withdraw. By ordinance, you could withdraw it tonight. It‚Äôs totally up to you.
But we have in the past, as a courtesy, given them a letter spelling out that it will be
withdrawn if they don‚Äôt do notice.
Mr. Stahl: Janet, where is the ordinance you are reading from?
Mrs. Greenwell: I‚Äôm looking at the County. It says 17-36-09.
Mr. Stahl: Because when you read it, you said shall.
Mrs. Greenwell: That‚Äôs the way it reads. It says, the petition shall be withdrawn.
Mr. Stahl: Can you read me the number again?
Mrs. Greenwell: 17-36-090(B)-6.

Board of Zoning Appeals
August 15, 2013
Page 20

Mr. Stahl: I do not believe it is totally up to you. I think it says shall.
Mrs. Greenwell: Okay.
Mr. Stahl: If you want to be belt and suspenders about it, you can call for a motion.
Mr. Rudolph: Do we need to have a motion on it?
Mr. Stahl: Let‚Äôs have a motion.
Mr. Pedtke: Just to be clear, it‚Äôs because they were on the agenda twice and didn‚Äôt do
their mailing properly twice?
Mrs. Greenwell: They didn‚Äôt do their notice at all.
Mr. Stahl: They have to comply with the notice requirements before the second regular
meeting of the board following the date the petition is filed. So they‚Äôve got two months to
comply with notice requirements. Whether you consider it as being this month and last
month or just sometime within the last, they‚Äôve got to get here by now.
Mr. Pedtke: I‚Äôm okay with that being withdrawn. But to wait for a whole year again to do
something about it‚Ä¶
Mrs. Greenwell: They have the ability to come before this board and with unanimous
approval, you can waive the one year time limit.
Mr. Pedtke: Alright.
Mr. Rudolph: Have either of them paid anything?
Mrs. Greenwell: Neither of them have paid any continuance fees. We did send a letter
telling them they failed to show up. They need to pay the continuance fee by this date.
Neither of them replied. Neither of them did notice. I contacted both of them by phone and
confirmed that neither of them have done notice or paid any continuance fees.
Mr. Lehman: They paid the filing fee though?
Mrs. Greenwell: They paid the filing fee to get on the agenda, $200.
Mr. Rudolph: And to continue it requires another fee?
Mrs. Greenwell: Yes, half the original fee, $100, unless it is waived.

Board of Zoning Appeals

Mr. Stahl: We need to be clear. I thought you said all three of the ‚Ä¶
Mrs. Greenwell: No, not all three. The 2013-34-BZA, Sean Reising, this is his first, he
forgot to do notice. He came in our office and it was too late to do notice. He paid a
continuance fee. He will do notice and he will be here next month.
Mr. Stahl: Okay, so the motion is as to the first two on the agenda.
Mr. Rudolph: I think they have had two opportunities to be here.
Mr. Stahl: It‚Äôs deemed withdrawn as a matter of law, but if you would rather make the
record clear, you can make a motion and vote on it.
Mr. Pedtke: Well what‚Äôs the term we use? Do we withdraw it Dirck?
Mr. Stahl: Yes. It says the petition shall be withdrawn by the board.
Mr. Pedtke: Then I make a motion to withdraw the first two due to the compliance with the
ordinance.
(Motion was made and seconded.)
Ayes: Mr. Utley, Mr. Zehner, Mr. Lehman, Mrs. Musgrave, Mr. Parkhurst, Mr. Pedtke, Mr.
Rudolph
Nays: None
There being 7 affirmative votes, Docket Nos. 2013-25-BZA and 2013-27-BZA are
withdrawn.
Mrs. Greenwell: We will send them a letter telling them it has been withdrawn.
Mrs. Musgrave: In the future it would be fine with me if you just did that as a consent
agenda item.
Mrs. Greenwell: We don‚Äôt have this happen very often. It just happened that you had two
people on the same agenda who, one who can‚Äôt make up their mind what they want to do
and the other who flatly told me they are not going to go forward.

Findings of Fact
Docket No: 2013-22-BZA Petitioner: King‚Äôs Great Buys Plus
Address: 5010 Vogel Road
Mr. Rudolph: They came before in June and had some banners up on their light poles.
They got caught doing that. So they came before us to see if they could keep them up and
voted it down. Mr. Stahl has drawn up these findings of fact.
Mr. Stahl: First of all, the findings stop at page four with the signature line. I attached for
reference the transcript behind it and the staff report. Basically, this is a case where the
sign company had a new type of product and put up this product on the King‚Äôs property sort
of as a test to see how it did. They were not aware that there was a rule against putting too
many signs up. If you go to page three, they already have three signs. 15 identifies Mr.
Odell who is from Colormax Digital Imaging. 16 says that they put it up, they made it and
put it up and didn‚Äôt know about the ordinance. 17 says members of the BZA expressed
concern regarding retroactive approval of signage and the waiver of fees. 18 says no
evidence was presented to show the need for the variance other than the fact the violation
had already occurred. 19 says the BZA does not find that the strict application of the terms
of this title will result in practical difficulties in the use of the property because the use of
the property doesn‚Äôt require approval. They didn‚Äôt present any evidence regarding the
nature of the property at all. 20 says the BZA does not find that the need for the variance
is not created by the applicant, which of course is a double negative and means that the
BZA found that the need was created by the applicant. It means that the BZA found that
the need was created by the applicant. Nothing inherent in the physical properties of the
business premises or circumstances that would keep them from using the commercial
property consistent with their zoning uses or from having signs. So it was voted down 1-5.
Mr. Utley: I would like to make a motion that we accept the findings of fact on the King‚Äôs
Great Buys Plus at 5010 Vogel Road, Evansville, Indiana, Docket No: 2013-22-BZA to be
correct and accurate.
Mrs. Musgrave: Second.
Ayes: Mr. Lehman, Mrs. Musgrave, Mr. Parkhurst, Mr. Pedtke, Mr. Utley, Mr. Zehner, Mr.
Rudolph
Nays: None
There being 7 affirmative votes, the findings of fact are approved. Is there any other
business?
Mr. Stahl: I have one thing that is more like an announcement. In the next week or so I

Board of Zoning Appeals
August 15, 2013
Page 23

hope, you will be receiving a letter and a confidential questionnaire that I need you to return
to me and this is simply so that we can have information that will allow me to help identify
conflicts of interest. It will be an attorney-client privilege document, not subject to public
disclosure. The letter should be self-explanatory, but if you have any questions, please
give me a call. It is something that the General Assembly has really been focused on in
terms of conflicts of interest on public boards and commissions and I think it is important
that we try to comply with that with as much information as we can. That‚Äôs all I have.
Mr. Pedtke: Will it be emailed directly from you to each of us? Or from the staff?
Mr. Stahl: It will come from me.
Mr. Rudolph: In the form of an email?
Mr. Stahl: I haven‚Äôt decided yet whether it is going to be an email. It will be to Mrs.
Musgrave.
Mrs. Musgrave: That was one of the things I wanted to talk about. Mr. London sent us all
an email asking if he could email the board packets. I know there has been some
discussion about that. I responded to you that I felt it should go on the website. Ms. Peggy
Schenks‚Äô appearance here this evening really brought it home to me about how very useful
to me it would be if you posted the packets on the website letting everyone see them. I
think that it would help everyone who appears in front of this board.
Mrs. Greenwell: The packets are available online. Everything you get in your packet we
put online the next day. You simply go to ‚Äúagendas and meetings‚Äù, click on the little blue
link to the docket number you want to see and the whole staff report pops up.
Mrs. Musgrave: Oh, well that‚Äôs so useful. Maybe everybody should know that. Maybe
you should perhaps let those folks know. Thank you.
Mr. Rudolph: So they can check maybe a week and a half or two weeks before and see
what is going to be on the agenda and have access to the same information we do?
Mrs. Greenwell: They have access to the same information that you have. As a
courtesy, we always mail them out to the members first and then within 24-48 hours, we
get them online.
Mr. Rudolph: The other matter we talked about earlier before the meeting started was
trying to save some paper. Are we sort of all in agreement that the minutes from the
previous meeting, that‚Äôs okay to email and we will read those. But the agenda and specific
pages related to the special uses and variances will be mailed to us? I‚Äôm okay with reading

Board of Zoning Appeals
August 15, 2013
Page 24

the minutes online but I always take the printed material with me so it makes it a lot simpler
for me if I‚Äôve got that in front of me. I prefer to have the specific pages relative to the
special uses.
INAUDIBLE CONVERSATION
Mr. Rudolph: Is there anything else?
Meeting adjourned.

BOARD OF PARKS AND RECREATION
CONSOLIDATED CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS
March 20, 2014
The meeting of the Board of Parks and Recreation was called to order by Chairman
Williams, Thursday, March 20, 2014, at 3:45 p.m. Room 260, City-County Building, 200 East
Washington Street, Indianapolis, Indiana 46204.
Board Members Present:

Chairman, John Williams, Mr. Joe Wynns,
Josh Bowling and Anne Valentine

Staff Present:

Louvenia Holstein, Board Secretary
Suzanne Martin, Assistant Board Secretary
Doug Kowalski, Deputy Corporation Counsel

Staff Absent:

Dr. Jackie Greenwood

Approval of Minutes: None
Directors Announcements:
Chairman Williams greeted the Board and the audiance and he thanked everyone for being
there. Chairman Williams greeted the Board members and guests. Chairman Williams
stated that he has a couple of announcements. First and foremost, it is that time of the year
again where we at Indy Parks are looking for lifeguards for our pool season. Those of you
who are watching on television if you know someone who may be interested in becoming a
lifeguard this summer please contact the Indy Parks Department and we would be more than
happy to put you on staff. You have to know how to swim obviously, and be able to pass our
tests of rigourous training to become certified and we are looking forward to having a full
confident summer staff to help us open up our pools for a safe summer season.
Secondly we have been working on different kinds of promotions and there is a new one that
he believes is a good idea that if you want to support Indy Parks the Macy‚Äôs Department
store and the National Parks and Recreation Association have chosenBroad Ripple Park as
a location for what they call a new your park initiative through Macy‚Äôs. What this means is
you can go to the Glendale Macy‚Äôs location only and when you purchase items and
acknowledge that you would like part of the proceeds to go towards the project at Broad
Ripple Park. If you happen to find your way to Macy‚Äôs at Glenday Mall, please remember to
support Indy Parks. Thank you.
This is all Chairman Williams has as announcements and we do not have any minutes to
approve at this time and we will be approving last month‚Äôs minutes in April.

Agenda Item #4, 2014 ‚Äì The Resource Development Division is recommending that the
Board of Parks and Recreation support the Sons of Confederate Veterans in their efforts to
raise all funds necessary to restore the Garfield Park Confederate Prisoner of War
Monument.
Don Colvin greeted the Board and introduced Bryan Blevens and he has been able to have
the benefit to work with Brian on this project for quite a while now to work with his ideas and
what he is trying to accomplish and as we all know the Sons of Confederate Veterans
memorial down at Garfield Park has been there for a number of years and has fallen into
disrepair. The caulking joints are deteriating and in particularly the brass plaques are
needing aid and typically this is not something that the park agency have the resources to
make those repairs and particularly when we have leaky roofs, HVAC systems expenditures.
Brian came to him with an idea he would like to take on an opportunity to take on to fund
raise this and what we have here before you today seeking out the Board support to start
this initiative. They are not asking for any of the City‚Äôs dollars to be involved in this and he
will let Brian really speak to you of all the details. They have met with the Indianapolis Parks
Foundation president, Lori Hazlett and the foundation is more than happy to receive the
funds. They are not going to raise any additional funds for this project but they are very
much in support of receiving the funds and holding those funds until the time of the
expenditures and if there are any additional dollars left over from the fund raising process
those dollars will remain with the foundation for any future maintenance activities. If the
Board would so allow him he would like to turn the floor over to Brian to go over his
presentation to talk about what he is hoping to do for this war monument. Mr. Blevins
thanked Don and the Board for his opportunity to present his proposal to the Board. Brian
pointed to the first slide on the overhead screen noting that the monument is about 35 to 40
feet tall and about 20 foot wide. The monument has six bronze plates on its sides 3 on each
side. This monument, and of course that is him standing in front of it on the slide which
gives you a proportion of how big this monument is. The monument was errected in 1912 by
the United States Federal Government to honor the 1616 confederate POWs that died here
at Camp Morton here in Indianapolis during the Civil War. In the early 1920‚Äôs as the city
began to grow the Green Lawn Cemetary, presently the Diamond Chain Company became
in disrepaired so they disinteared every body located in the cemetary which included the
1616 confederate soldiers which took them about 3 years to finish the project and they
moved them out to Crown Hill Cemetary where they rest at this time.
In 1928 the Southern Club of Indianapolis asked the Parks Board to move the monument
while they were doing this disintearment of these veterans to Garfield Park as Garfield being
the only city park in Indianapolis at that time. Of course the Board approved the monument
to moved to Garfield Park. During the reintearment due to cost overuns and the great
depression that struck the United States, this monument was not moved due to the financial
costs that they could not afford, so it has been sitting in the park since 1928.
The condition of the monument is not bad for 102 year old monument. The stones are in
great condition. A lot of the caulking is missing and of course the brass plates are severely
weather worn with mold and in a bad state of affairs. The next picture on the overhead
screen shows the monument on the shady side and you can see all the black mold. The
picture on the right is a close-up of what the brass plaque will look like when restored.
2

With Mr. Blevins is Mr. Greg Hurrly, president of Hurrly Monument Company who has been
in business since 1999 and he has been asked to help them restore this monument. His
goal and request is to restore the monument for the City of Indianapolis public for the next
100 years. He is a member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans which is southern historical
society geared towards the preservation of the history and the heritage of their confederate
ancestors. Brian has received approval from the SCV to raise these funds for this projecrt.
He has obtained a quote from Mr. Hurrly to complete the project and he has been in contact
like Mr. Colvin stated with the Indianapolis Parks Foundation and they have stepped up and
agreed to hold the funds and distribute the funds for the expenditures of the repair and that
with any funds left over they will hold as future funds into an escrow account for future
maintenance expenses and there will be no burden on the City of Indianapolis or the tax
payers of Indianapolis for maintenance of this monument and they hope it last for a very long
time since the monument is in extremely good shape for a 102 year old monument.
Brian went on to tell the Board of his personal story. He stated that he is extremely excited
for the Board to give him the opportunity to make this restoration and thanked the Board for
allowing him to present to them his proposal. He is hoping that he will received the Board‚Äôs
approval for him to proceed with this restoration. It is a win win for Garfield Park and for the
City of Indianapolis.
Lastly, being a member of the Sons of the Confederate Veterans, people look at you in a
strange way and he understands the sensitivity behind this but his organization is in now way
here to make a political statement in any way or stir up any old wounds. They are here
strictly for a restoration project of a beautiful monument which sits in the city park at Garfield
Park. One last thing, there are some people he would like to thank and they are of course
the Indianapolis Parks Foundation, The Friends of Garfield Park, City County Councillor Jeff
Miller of District 19 which encompasses Garfield Park who is on board as well as Carlos
May, City Advisor to the Mayor who is also on board, Kip Morgan who is a legislator of
Indiana for the Disabled American Veterans and Michael Ham with the Indiana Department
of Veterans Affairs and Don Colvin who has helped him over the last year and a half reach
this point for the approval of the restoration and he thanked the Board for their time and
hopes that they approve his request.
Chairman Williams thanked Mr. Blevins for his presentation. Chairman Williams asked if the
Board had any comments or questions. Mr. Wynns stated that this is a very sensitive issue
obviously. Mr. Blevins also stated that it is. Mr. Wynns stated that they have also had
issues with putting statues on the Cultural Trail and it got all blown out of proportion and he
doesn‚Äôt know how he will move with this because there will be some sensitivity from the
public and he didn‚Äôt think that there would be such an isse with the statue on the Cultural
Trail either about slavery and the slave monuments and with the confederacy you have to be
very sensitive when you bring something like this forward in the public eye. The statue on
the Cultural Trail became a big issue with neighborhood meetings and they said they were
not going to do it. When you talk about confederacy and things like this you will be opening
old wounds. He grew up in South Carolina and this is a very sensitive issue and he only
says that to let everyone know that it could be opening up something that needs to be very,
very careful in dealing with it. He does support the restoration but he wants everyone to
know what this could involve into a big issue and the people who were involved with putting
the statue on the Cultural Trail the Community Foundation didn‚Äôt think that there would be an
3

issue with that and it went crazy with issues. When the push back comes you need to figure
out how you are going to deal with it. They didn‚Äôt deal with it very good with the Cultural Trail
statue issue. They spent a lot of money developing it. Mr. Blevins stated that he and Don
Colvin have had this discussion several times and in his first meeting with Don about a year
ago this was one of the first things that he discussed with him. Mr. Blevins stated that it is a
little different because they are not putting up a new monument they are just restoring the
one that is and has always been there for 102 years with private funds. He does undertand
the sensitivity for sure and would like to do this low key as possible. They don‚Äôt need
newspaper articles, cameras or stuff like that. This is not there goal. Their goal is simply to
take care of the restoration.
Mr. Wynns wants them to be prepared if there is any push back and to not be totally caught
off guard if there is. Chairman Williams stated that first of all there is a very good distinction
between putting up a new statue verses restoring an historic monument. There is always
going to be that sensitivity. Chairman Williams stated that he would advise Mr. Blevins to do
a little bit of research and maybe you will have answers to any questions that arrise and be
prepared to answer if they come about. With regard to African Americans Sons of
Confederate Soldiers, because those organizations do exist as well. Mr. Blevins stated that
there are 26 African American veterans that are buried at Crown Hill Cemetary along with 2
Hispanics and a truck load of people from South America and he is not sure what countries.
And for historical purposes people are in the war not necessarily because they wanted to be.
And as a veteran, he knows that for himself and he wasn‚Äôt unfortunate to go to battle but he
was in the military at a time when the country was at war during the firsrt Desert Storm and
he was very close to deployment and he knows there are a lot of people on both sides as to
whether or not we should have been there. He would hope that because of the service that
he provided for our country he will be honored for his service regardless of wether or not they
agree with why he was there. In this respect he believes it is similar in nature, people lost
their lives on both sides of the battlefield. Mr. Blevins stated that he prays that there will not
be any repercussions from the public of this restoration process. It is a historical monument
and he hopes that it can be restored without any repercussions.
Chairman Williams asked if there were any other questions or comments from the Board
members. Ms. Valentine stated that she has just a question on the restoration piece of it. Is
this put it back together for another 100 years? Is it a 50 year; is there a way to guage this
process? Mr. Curry stated that the monument is 100 years old now and it just depends and
it should look fine for the rest of our lives. It will be completed in several steps. Step 1 is to
take the bronze plaques and send those to Muncie Indiana factory for sanding with crushed
walnut shells to keep the bronze from abrassive restoration. Crushed walnut shells are less
abrasive and then paint them and then belt them with a very large sander to go over the
letters and the seal it. It should last a very long time since it is is hanging on the wall.
There may be general upkeep as general cleaning. No maintenance on a regular basis.
The process will clean all the details out of the green and grey clay out.
Chairman Williams asked if there were any other comments or questions from the Board.
There were none.

A motion was duly made by Ms. Valentine, seconded by Mr. Bowling, and unanimously
passed to approve Agenda Item #4, 2014.
Chairman Williams stated that we have a presentation and while they get set up for the
Greenways Master Plan which will give the Board members an opportunity to hear the
exciting things that have been going on this year with our Greenways Master Plan
development. Taylor Seifert and Williams has been doing this and in the process of obtaining
public comments and things of that nature so without further a do, Ron are y our ready?
Ron replied yes.
Presentation ‚Äì Indy Greenways 2014 ‚Äì 2024 Master Plan ‚Äì Andre Denman, Principal Park
and Greenways Planner
Andre Denman stated that before you hear from Ron he wants to thank the Board for letting
them present and next month they will have the resolution before you for approval and
hopefully if you have had a chance to read this massive document, he knows it has been
thrilling reading but he wants to thank a few key staff, first the Board for allowing them to be
here today, his boss, Don Colvin for pushing them to do the plan as well as they have, Julee
Jacob, for her assistance at several meetings and putting up with his bad jokes. He would
also like to thank DPW staff and the PIOs from both DPW and Indy Parks. He believes that
they have gone through every PIO with this plan and last but not least he would definitely like
to thank his right hand man, Ben Jackson who doesn‚Äôt get as many kudos as he should as
the man behind the curtain doing lots of work so he definitely wants to thank him for all his
hard work and heavy lifting as other things are getting accomplished. With that said, he has
challenged Ron because they presented this plan yesterday before the Greenways
Development Committee to finish the presentation to have us out of the meeting in time to
watch Scandle later on today so, he is going to turn it over to Ron and Andre would like to
thank him and a couple of his staff, Scott Seifert, Amy Williams and Dave Foster who does a
lot of their heavy liftin gin their office with putting together a lot of the graphics. He is turning
it over to Ron but he will be around to tell any jokes or answer any questions you might have.
Ron thanked Andre and said he noticed that Andre is running for cover. Ron thanked
Director Williams, Deputy Director, Colvin and members of the Parks Board he appreciates
the opportunity to talk to you today. You received a hard copy of the Greenways Master
Plan document and hopefully you have had a chance to thumb through it. They are actually
really excited about this project and what he wants to do is take a few minutes to give you an
overview of what you are going to see in this Master Plan and give you a little bit of direction
because he knows that the amount of information in here can be a little bit intimidating so we
are going to step back a little and tell you a little about the process and how the
recommendations from this document came to be and then we are going to show you what
the Master Plan includes. He believes you will see why they are real excited about this.
When we think about the Greenways a lot of times we go back to the George Kessler Plan
which really was the first plan that really started to look at how we use some of our
recreational open spaces. If you look around the city today you can find pieces of that plan
still in place. There was a legacy that was left in the city by Kessler‚Äôs work but it is by no
means complete. This is still a vision that they are implementing today. On the overhead
screen is a photo of right before the winter began of the new construction happening on the
Fall Creek Greenway just to the west of the Monon Trail.
5

There has also been some contemporary planning done. The First Greenways Plan that
established the plan that is in place today was done in 1994, updated again in 2002, and it
too left a legacy, if you will, on the city. When we go out on a Saturday and we look at the
people that are walking along the Monon cooridor in Broad Ripple, this really is the legacy
that that plan has left. This vision as well has not been fully implemented and today we are
still implementing part of that system. This is an image on the overhead screen from the
South White River Greenway that‚Äôs construction is just currently rapping up on that. So he
thinks it is important to understand when we start this that what they are doing is establishing
the next vision, if you will, for where greenways need to go in the city, in the next 5 years, the
next 10 years, and the next 20 years and beyond.
Just to give you a little bit of background, our current system of trails and greenways, we
have just under 60 miles of greenway trails in the city. In the original or the plan from 2002
we still have about 44 miles that have not been constructed. Another key number that we
like to remind people of is the fact that we take user counts on all of our greenway trails.
Last year, or in 2012 we had over 3 million people use Indy greenways. These are some
significant recreational spaces. Their current system is broken into 10 separate greenways
cooridors and some are rail cooridors. Some are long waterways but we currently have 10 of
those different systems in place and this is what the current plan system looks like on the
overhead screen. They have bolded the redlines to show you what is currently in there from
the 2002 master plan. Now he is backing off a little bit and stated that the picture on the
overhead screen now is actually the graphic that shows just what has been built from that
plan. You are starting to see some things emerge when you look at this map. He is going to
add this yellow line in here and what this is is what they term as the service area of that
greenway and it basically is a half mile fringe on each direction from a built greenway and
that is roughly a 10 minute walk from a greenway. This starts to show us how many people
and how many geographic area within Marion County is within a 10 minute walk of our
greenways. Again, he thinks you can see that there is a pattern emerging and if you can‚Äôt
see it well lets change the graphic a little bit and take a look at the additional graph on the
overhead screen which depicts the map of Marion County and their townships and you can
see perdominately our greenways are developed in washington and center townships.
There are reasons for that with some of the early planning that went on, but we do have a
system today that is perdominately in those 2 townships. We also are living in a time in the
city that is much different than when the 2002 or the 1994 plans were done. What they are
seeing around the city now is we have an exploading bicycle culture. We are seeing many,
many miles of new on-street bike facilities such as the bike lanes and the emphasis on using
your bicycle to get around. There is an evolving health and fitness awareness as well as the
new transit initiatives that are happening across the city. There are initiatives out there to
reconnect to our waterways and there really is a growing resurgence in neighborhood
planning and development trying to figure out at the neighborhood scale we are starting to
plug into the city both the uniqueness of getting people to those neighborhoods as well as
how those neighborhoods can plug into the greenways system to be connected to other
things.
What they are doing with the full circle plan obviously trying to look at obviously some of the
improvements that are needed to that existing system but they are really establishing the
new vision for Indy Greenways and this is an important thing that we have to do because
6

completing this plan helps to ensure that the greenways are not only plugged into these
other initiatives and the regional transportation plan but also make sure that the greenways
are elegible for the different types of federal funding we seek to try to construct different
portions. We have been going through our planning process for a little bit over a year now
and he thinks this is probably something that is important for the Parks Board to understand,
and this is that this plan really has been driven by public engagement. It has been driven by
a level of public engagement that you don‚Äôt often see in plans like this. He wants to show
the Board some of those tools that they have used throught the past year and a half.
From the very beginning of the project they wanted to make sure that people were aware of
what was going on, what was happening with the plan, why they were doing it, what it was all
about so they began the process by having a series of promotional brochures printed and
distributed to libraries, community centers, schools, any place that would take a stack they
pretty much delivered those. There was also a project website established and this website
really is the portal, if you will, to this greenways plan. They have been able to put materials
on this website for the public meetings so that if people were not able to attend the public
meeting they have been able to direct them to the site and they are able to obtain the
information and know what has been going on. They have had a very active social media
platform. One of their tools that they have used the most has been their Facebook page that
is specific to the project and what this has really done has allowed them to connect with
several different people on a more intimate basis. Much more informal basis so that they are
able to strike up conversation about anything that might come up in the planning process.
Another unique thing that was done for this is that they opened a project office in Boulevard
Station, the historic rail depot is right where the monon meets 38 th Street and one day a
week the project development team and folks from his office would be staffed there where
people could schedule meetings and come in and talk to them, the neighborhood groups
could come in and talk to them, or if they just wanted to stop by and see what they were
working on they could sit down at the table and pull out some sketch paper and work with
them. They were pretty successful there in broadening the type of input we were able to get.
Incredibly they expected to get folks to come in with scribbled notes on notebook paper and
they got some of that but they also got some of this. People were coming in with their
neighborhood plans with ideas for what the trails could be, of how trails could connect and
where things could go and they think that this was really successful and they think that they
are starting to see that same model being replicated in some other processess going on in
the city. There also was an online survey conducted with residents and this was just a
facinating experience because what you are going to see in some of the recommendations is
driven by some of the things we received as part of this. He has blown this part up and he
thinks that one of the startling facts to them was that of the people who took the survey, 60%
of those people have to drive to get to a greenway. And if this isn‚Äôt startling enough, 49% of
the people who had to drive to a greenway had to drive more than 5 miles. So another way
that the same question was asked as seen on the bar graph on the right side of the
overhead slide asked the question of if you don‚Äôt use the greenways, why is that? 78% of
the people said because there is no greenway near their home or neighborhood. The data
that they received from this survey was pretty beneficial because it allowed them to start
bringing those types of things into their recommendations.

7

They have also been pretty active, as you may have noticed, rather it be the Greenway
Development Committee meetings or public meetings on Channel 16 and they have had a
real extensive series of different public events and meetings. They have held 14 official
public meetings, including one in each township and by his count tonight it is the 30th public
presentation that they have given on this plan and they have been very visible and very
active and they have been trying to make sure that if you have something to say about the
greenways and they haven‚Äôt heard it by now, he is not sure if it is shame on us or shame on
you, but they have made a great effort to make sure that the folks have had an opportunity to
talk to us. We have shown up everywhere. If you went to the Mayor‚Äôs Polo Pedal, you
probably saw a bunch of them walking around with the ‚ÄúAsk Me‚Äù stickers on their shirts
wanting to talk about the greenways. They held a Greenways Day at the City Market during
the lunch hour and they set up every exhibit that has been done and talked to folks as they
walked through. Even on National Bike to Work Day at Boulevard Station they sponsored a
rest stop where they invited people to stop on their commute home and come in and get
some refreshments and talk about the plan so they have had a significant amount of public
engagement and when you look at your Master Plan packet there is a DVD that is in the
back cover that contains all the notes from the different meetings and all the public meeting
comments so you have some access if you want to see the types of things that they have
heard, and people responded pretty positively to them.
Now, he has shown you all these different things that they have done in terms of public
engagement and if you were to ask him ‚ÄúWhat are the four biggest things you heard throught
the and we had to narrow that down to 4, these are the four things that they heard.
ÔÇ∑
ÔÇ∑
ÔÇ∑
ÔÇ∑

Connectivity
Multi-Modal Options
Interface with Neighborhoods
Lack of Greenway Options in the Southern Townships

He also thinks it is pretty interesting to hear some of the other things that were discussed
during the life of this design process. A couple of these things are pretty recent and he
thinks these are exciting because these are things that the greenways start to plug into and
the types of things that the greenways can help elevate within the City of Indianapolis. We
know that Livability Magazine just ranked Indianapolis as one of the 10 best downtowns in
terms of connectivity. The readers of USA Today has ranked Indianapolis as the top
convention center city largely due to the connectivity of its downtown and walkability and the
Cultural Trail is often mentioned. The New York Times has done a feature travel article
telling people that you need to come to Indianapolis, that‚Äôs where big things are happening.
Another big thing that has just happened, the People For Bikes has just selected
Indianapolis as one of the 6 cities for their new GreenLane project which is a really big deal
and this one just blows his mind. He is going back to the New York Times ‚Ä¶In 2014
Indianapolis was listed as one of the 52 places that they feel you have to see. He doesn‚Äôt
know if you have looked into this or if you have read this article, but when you go to this list,
Indianapolis is not what you would typically think one of those cities would be and it is a great
recognition of some of the things that are going on. So this brings us back to the
Indianapolis Star. This is the editorial from May 12, 2013 and this was the Sunday morning
of the grand opening of the Cultural Trail, so that weekend we had downtown flooded with
people. There were events all along this trail. Marching bands going up and down the trails
8

and the Indianapolis Star posed the questions ‚ÄúWhat is the next big thing that the City of
Indianapolis will undertake? We think this is the Indy Greenways Full Circle Master Plan.
He went on to show a little of the document itself which was passed out the the Board
members for their reading pleasure and he went through the 8 goals and he didn‚Äôt go
through all of them but showed them on the overhead screen.
A copy of this Indy Greenways Full Circle Master Plan is attached to these minutes as well.
He would be happy to address any questions the Board may have and he appreciates the
time that they have given him to give them this update.
Chairman Williams thanked Ron for the presentation and all his hard work that he has put
into this process.
Mr. Wynns stated that he didn‚Äôt hear anything in the plan about security. He would hope
that this plan is shared with someone in Public Safety because when you open up a system
this wide you you are definitely going to have security concerns and he didn‚Äôt hear him touch
on this.
Ron replied that they started to address this heavily and they had some meetings with some
different Park Rangers out at the project office as well as with IMPD 96 people on their
survey said they feel safe on Indy Greenways. That was another number that was startling
to them. We expected to hear a lot about the public security and safety and people feel
relatively safe so what they have done is that they have met with them and they have talked
about what some of their needs are in order to be able to patrol this and he thinks it is part of
an ongoing discussion that needs to happen just like everything else because rather it be the
maintenance or security a lot of people will look at the system and wonder how do we
expand to take care of all these new miles? He thinks that every body is still trying to deal
with some of these issues. Mr. Wynns stated that this is what he saying and you are talking
about opening up a county-wide system, from his standpoint, somebody from Public Safety
needs to look at the plan and the cost of providing security throughout this system. Another
thing that came about during the recent new signage package was developing a new
emergency response symbology. They currently have mile markers and somebody can call
in and say they have a problem at mile #.... of this trail and there is always a little bit of
ambeguity of where exactly is that or how do I get to that point and part of the design
standards include a new system that was developed that provides specific coordinance at
different places along the trail. Mr. Wynns stated that this is the kind of discussion that
needs to be discussed for monitoring from Public Safety to start thinking about how to
monitor the emergency calls.
Andre stated that as part of the whole public meeting process Public Safety. These
discussions will still be taking place and when they get the construction documents Publioc
Safety is difinitely be people at the table seeing what these issues are.
Ms. Valentine asked when was this started as a process? Has it been a year, 2 years?
Andre replied that it was January of last year. Andre stated that it was actually a little be fore
then but their contract started in January of 2013. Ms. Valentine stated that is is very
9

impressive and she is a huge fan of the Greenways Trails and she trained for the Chicago
Marathon on the White River Parkway and would run over the the Canal Towpath and she
feels she might have ran on all 4 of them. You mentioned somewhere and then she didn‚Äôt
see it as a priority and she is assuming this didn‚Äôt come out from the public input part of it,
and it is a totally selfish question. Restrooms‚Ä¶ Is that something that emerged or just
something that is just so costly when you look at the entire 40 existing miles. She also has 2
small children and it is also important for families. Restrooms came up during the public
process. They have taken a look at the public restrooms and they have taken a look at
some of the standards that kind of meet the requirements. Careful thought has to be taken
about the design, hours of operation, safety and trying to strike the balance of having those
types of facilities and it really is a tough question. The City is trying to position those type of
facilities in their local parks that are near the greenways so that there will be more activity
and more security. One of the things the plan does deal with and they are still working
through what we want the comfort stations standards to be but that is included in there.
Ms. Valentine also stated that at some point you have to think about cost of implementing
and she turned to the back page and it didn‚Äôt have a giant number so she is assuming that in
process you would adopt a master plan and then you look at the priorities and then you
begin to piece out the cost for that? Is this how this works? Chairman Williams stated that
he believes Ron touched on this and the different things that are associated with each trail is
that correct? Chairman Williams stated that you may have to look at the individual trail. Ron
stated that they have a planning level cost. It is difficult because especially with some of the
new routes with this master plan level it won‚Äôt get you into the number of properties that you
have to buy, and there is always unknowns but they sort of have a rule of thumb cost that
they can tell you what they think the costs would be in the range of but one of the things that
he thinks they have been careful with thoughout the planning process, rather they are
meeting with maintenance or the public security people, it is the same thing with the costs
and this is really the long term vision and we don‚Äôt necessarily build and operate trail
systems the same way today that we did even 5 or 10 years ago and he thinks part of the
challenge the City has, even when you look at the trails that are being implemented now,
they are being paid for a little bit differently and implemented a little bit differently than what
they may have been just a few years ago, so part of that cost, you know, there may be some
areas in there of undeveloped parts of Marion County where there may be some private
investments, or a developer may be abele to help build segments. There may be creative
ways to get other types of construction done to bring the costs to the City down. Ms.
Valentine stated that it is a beautiful design.

New Business
a) Thompson Thrift ‚Äì Shoppes on Six

1

Mr. Garrett reported that as the Commission is aware staff has been working with
Thompson Thrift on the Shoppes on Six project. We are getting closer and closer to
where we need to be. A couple of months ago the Redevelopment Commission
authorized staff to work with Council to come up with an agreement that made sense for
both the development company and the City. Mr. Garrett believes that we are to that
point now. Representatives from Thompson Thrift are present to give a short
presentation and then discuss the draft agreement.
Mr. Ashlee Boyd stated that it felt good to be back in Elkhart. Thompson Thrift has been
working very closely with Mr. Garrett and his team to get to this point. They are excited
to be back before the Commission to refresh everybody on what they are attempting to
do.
Mr. Boyd explained that Thompson Thrift is proposing the expansion of the current
property that they own at Cassopolis and C.R. 6. Thompson Thrift is an Indiana based
company who has been around about 25 years. They have completed projects in 100
cities and 10 states. They have closed a significant number of new projects over the last
four years. They will complete a number of new projects on the horizon in addition to the
Shoppes on Six project. Thompson Thrift has a strong and diverse banking relationship
that will allow them to get projects like this done.
Mr. Boyd showed the Commission projects that Thompson Thrift had completed in
Carmel Indiana, Terre Haute Indiana, the Barnes and Noble Bookstore for ISU, LA
Fitness in Chicago Illinois and Cincinnati Ohio.
Shoppes on Six will consist of a unique and upscale shopping center destination
containing an exciting mix of first class retailers and restaurants. It will have a cohesive
up scaled landscaping design theme, unique upscale architectural design containing an
appropriate mix of brick masonry and other quality building materials. It will be truly a
first class retail project unique to Elkhart.
It will be approximately 20 acres and consist of approximately 115,000 square feet of
total space including the out parcels. Some of the offsite improvements that will be
performed, Thompson Thrift is proposing installing a signal at the west access drive,
separating their project from the Walmart. It will take you up to Lowe‚Äôs.
Thompson Thrift is projecting that a project of this size will create upwards of 200 new
jobs for the community, which is always exciting. Ultimately approximately $15 million
dollars will be invested in the project which will include Thompson Thrift‚Äôs investment
and the investment from the restaurants and the people who will ultimately occupy the
out parcels.
The project will be marketed and leased to regional, national and credit retailers and will
contain a complimentary mix of apparel boutique shops, jewelry, sit down and fast,
casual restaurants and other upscale uses commonly found in similar retail projects.
Thompson Thrift is working closely with Carmike Cinemas. Last time they were here
2

they spoke a little bit about that. They have had some dialogue with them since. They
have obtained construction estimates for the construction of their new facility and are
working with a group that will provide the financing for that. They are making progress
on that front which will be an exciting addition to the project. Thompson Thrift is
designing their project so that it will encompass the theatre redevelopment, however
that might take shape. Thompson Thrift does have a proposed site plan that would
accommodate the theatre.
Mr. Boyd showed a concept plan with the existing theatre and a concept plan with the
theatre option.
Tenants that Thompson Thrift is currently working with are TJ Maxx, Shoe Carnival, Pet
Smart and other shops.
Mr. Boyd encouraged everyone to visit their completed project in Warsaw, Indiana. It is
very similar to what they are proposing to do in Elkhart. The project in Warsaw is a total
of 175,000 square feet. The expansion that they completed is approximately 75,000
square feet. The project in Elkhart is approximately 80,000 square feet. It has proven to
be a huge success in Warsaw.
Mr. Boyd stated that their goal is to get this project on the ground in the summer of
2013, but they have agreed in their discussions with the Economic Development staff
that it will be no later than December of 2013. Thompson Thrift would like to get moving
on this project as soon as possible. Part of their challenge is making sure that they get
the appropriate retailer commitments in place.
Once they do start construction it will take approximately nine months to complete the
project from the day they put a shovel in the ground to the day that the first retailers are
open for business. It is a relatively short build period once it starts.
Mr. Boyd said they are working to complete the TIF and the project approvals. They will
commence with a complete project design once they solidify the economic development
agreement with the City and continue to work towards securing the pre-leasing
commitments and construction financing. Mr. Greg Buckhout is present who heads up
Thompson Thrift‚Äôs capital group. He is available to answer questions about that aspect.
As discussed in the last presentation, the project requires financial participation from the
City. Thompson Thrift has worked through the details of that agreement with the
Economic Development Department. They feel like they have a good structure in place.
Phase two of the expansion in front of the main shopping center will be at a cost of
$13.5 million dollars. Thompson Thrift is seeking a $3 million dollar investment by the
municipality by the City of Elkhart. Thompson Thrift will then fund the balance of the
$10.5 million dollars in cost.

3

The public investment is supported through a substantial increase in tax increment
created by the project. Thompson Thrift will only utilize the incremental taxes that they
are creating. They will not touch the existing tax bases that exist today with the
properties there.
The public investment will consist of three components: a twelve month bond issued
from existing Cassopolis TIF district. That bond will be purchased by Thompson Thrift
and be paid back using Cassopolis Street TIF district fund. The second component will
be a five year bond purchased by Thompson Thrift and paid back by incremental taxes
generated by just their project. The third component is an approximate five year loan
from the City, which will be paid back utilizing the tax increment from the overall
Cassopolis Street TIF district.
As mentioned before one of the commitments that Thompson Thrift has made, is that
this project will be 75% pre-leased before they issue a bond or put a shovel in the
ground. They want to make sure that this is a real project that is viable, and that there
are tenants and leases in place. Thompson Thrift is also providing a completion
guarantee as part of their agreement with the City so that the City can be assured that
once they start the project will be completed. If it is not completed, then Thompson Thrift
would have to stand behind that.
The next steps are that Thompson Thrift respectfully request the Commission‚Äôs
approval of the Economic Development agreement that will allow them to move on to
the Council level. They will then proceed with completing their due diligence and
wrapping up their pre-leasing commitments and finalizing the project.
Mr. Garrett stated that the draft agreement is part of the Commission‚Äôs packet. The
agreement is something that Barnes & Thornburg is comfortable with. Representation
from Barnes & Thornburg is present. Staff has also utilized Crowe Horwath as the
accounting firm. This is an agreement that they are also comfortable with. Mr. Boyn has
been involved intimately with the discussions throughout the last couple of months. Mr.
Eldridge has been able to pop in and out as time permitted with some of these
discussions.
Mr. Eash referenced that the company shall not later than December 31, 2014 invest
and complete the project. If they do not meet the deadline, will Thompson Thrift pay
back the full public investment? Or just the Class A bonds and loan?
Mr. Boyn replied that it pays back the Class A bonds and the $1.5 million dollar loan.
The Class B bonds, the City has no obligation to pay anything on if it is not completed
and TIF revenue generated.
Mr. Eash stated that the start dates were going to be earlier, were there issues with the
tenants or something? How is that going?

4

Mr. Boyd replied that Thompson Thrift is working very diligently to secure those
commitments and as indicated they are at their mercy for how fast they move. There
has been a small delay but that was to be anticipated because as a developer that can
happen. Thompson Thrift want to make sure that they have a little bit of flexibility in here
to make sure that they are getting the right tenants and the right structures in place. The
driving factor is to make sure that this project is completed in time for the tax increment
to be in place and established by the end of 2014.
Mr. Eash asked if there were any possibility of further delays. Mr. Boyd replied that he
hopes not. They are going to push this really as hard as they can. Once they are able to
secure the agreement with the City they will be able to move forward.
Mr. Eash said he was tremendously excited at first, but he wants to make sure that it
gets done because every time Thompson Thrift comes back, it is six months later. Mr.
Eash would like to see this project completed and wrapped up.
Mr. Boyd said right now for Thompson Thrift it is money out the door for them. This is a
very costly venture for them.
Mr. Eash said this has been a long time for the City also.
Mr. Boyd said he is confident they will get things completed.
Mr. Eldridge asked Mr. Boyn to go through the timetable on the funding. Mr. Boyn stated
that the City is not going to fund anything until 75% of the leases are in place. At that
point, the bonding will take place and the loan will take place.
Ms. Paolillo concurred with Mr. Eash thinking that she would hope that things will get
going as Mr. Boyd has explained, with no more delays.
There being no further discussion, Ms. Paolillo made a motion approving the resolution
authorizing the Commission to approve the form and content of that contract as
presented, seconded by Mr. Eash; motion carried.
b) 212 Jefferson Development Agreement
Ms. Welsh stated that at the last meeting the Redevelopment Commission approved Mr.
Boyn and Ms. Welsh working on getting the documents in place so that they can move
ahead with the $50,000 loan for DEI to acquire and renovate the property at 212
Jefferson Street. The four documents that Mr. Boyn had to create to make that work are
in the Commission‚Äôs packets.
There is a resolution and development agreement that indicates all of the details
associated with the project. The responsibilities of the City and the responsibilities of the
developer (DEI). There is a promissory note which sets forth the terms for the
repayment of a portion of the loan and a warranty mortgage which puts us in a title
5

position so that we do not run into a problem with having the house lost without us
knowing about it. It puts us in a second lien position after the primary lender which is
Inova Federal Credit Union.
Ms. Welsh stated that the Commission will be providing $50,000. It is from a fund that is
proceeds from sale of Redevelopment Commission properties. It isn‚Äôt directly tied to the
TIF dollars that the Commission see in the TIF budget for downtown TIF, but it is in that
area.
The second thing is given the fact that the property needs significant renovation and
cash flow after the project is a bit in question. Staff is not sure how the units are going to
rent. They are hoping that the community is excited about the project and that DEI gets
some good quality tenants in there and they can charge a reasonable rent. To insure
that that happens, staff has decided to give them two years to kind of figure that out and
at the end of two years, they should have a pretty much stabilized operating budget for
the project. Any repayment of that $50,000 would be based on pretty much an excess of
what they need to actually operate the building. In the promissory note it indicates a 1.4
debt coverage ratio which gives them enough funds to actually meet their operating
expenses, their debt payments, their other issues that they have to operate the building
and a little bit of a cushion. Staff does not want them to run exactly at zero zero. We
need to make sure they have funds available to do renovations or if they have a unit
that needed to be renovated after a tenant left. We want to make sure that they are
operating the building in a good way.
After that two year mark, we will evaluate their actual operating expenses and their
revenues and decide what a reasonable payment will be on that $50,000 mortgage. Ms.
Welsh said if it would have gone by itself without the City‚Äôs help, we would have loved
that. This project is one of those, like many downtown, that needs a subsidy to make
them work. This is very similar to the concept that we worked out at 214 Division
project. Let the market tell us what this property is worth and that will determine what
subsidy we need. We do not want to over subsidize the projects we want projects that
are going to be successful, but we also understand that these projects would not occur
without the subsidy from the City.
Mr. Eldridge asked if Ms. Welsh was comfortable with the fact that $50,000 would be
enough to do the renovation. Ms. Welsh said that is what the experts has told her. Mr.
Eldridge said his concern is that we had these things in the past where we put out
$50,000 to get the project off the ground and then we find out it is going to take another
$50,000 to get it done. Mr. Eldridge is just wondering how much due diligence has been
done at this point to make sure we are reasonably in the ballpark.
Ms. Welsh said that we have representatives from the developer (DEI) present, Mr. Dan
Boecher and Mr. Mike Huber to answer those questions.
Mr. Boecher replied to Mr. Eldridge‚Äôs question. This is something that collectively the
Board does have some experience in doing single family, multi family and some
6

commercial renovations. The amount is different for every property but going in there
and seeing what you have to work with there are some good things you have to work
with that are not present in some giant total gut rehab. This is not something that will
necessarily take down to the studs. There components of that that will be reused. There
will not be a ton of construction because it is actually already set up as a multi family
property. They will not be changing the structure too much. The unknowns, while there
is always some, Mr. Boecher is very confident that while it is not too much certainly
there are ample funds there to be able to get the project done in the condition with what
they want to have it at the end. Obviously at the end of the project DEI will sit down with
staff showing the cost that they had, insurance, etc. and go through it. It is all open
book. They would like the Commission to have confidence in them and they want to be
good stewards of the public funds that we are talking about here and appreciate the
flexibility that the Commission is demonstrating and the recognition. The risk is on the
front end and DEI does not want to over subsidize it but they also recognize that they
are going out projections for the rents, vacancies, expenses etc.
Ms. Welsh said the other portion is that the Commission would be providing the funds to
Inova who will act as escrow agent for this construction process. There will be a series
of draws against those funds and that the Inova funds are set at $25,000. The City
funds will only be used up to $50,000. If the project comes in under budget, then they
will actually only be borrowing the amount of funds they need to complete the project. It
is not a set $50,000. If it will come in slightly under budget, those savings will be seen in
the City‚Äôs portion of that.
Mr. Eldridge asked if the staff would be approving the draws. Ms. Welsh replied that
staff would trust Inova‚Äôs escrow agents to do that. DEI will need to provide proof that
that the work is done, signed and released from the contractors. Staff is talking about
making sure we have lien waivers so that they can‚Äôt come back and do a mechanics lien
at a later date on the property. Mr. Boyn and Ms. Welsh have discussed this and they
feel comfortable because Inova does this kind of thing frequently and they are set up to
act as escrow agent for construction loans.
Mr. Boyn stated that DEI is going to have a licensed architect lined up to review the
work as it is being done and confirmed to Inova and DEI that the contractor has
performed up to the point they are asking for reimbursement.
Ms. Paolillo asked where is this property. Ms. Welsh replied that 212 Jefferson is about
1 ¬Ω blocks north on Jefferson Street. The reason staff is particularly interested in it is
because the Commission owns 209 North Second Street which is an NSP 3 project and
the properties abut each other in the rear. By stabilizing this property as well as the one
we are investing in, we are hoping that we can build a little momentum just two blocks
north of us here and really start to revitalize that neighborhood.
Ms. Paolillo asked how many units are there. Ms. Welsh replied that 209 North Second
Street will be a six unit building and 212 Jefferson will be either a duplex or three unit

7

building. It is currently designed as a three unit and we are trying to work to figure out
whether it makes sense to leave it that way or go for a duplex.
Mr. Eash asked if this was a loan that they will have to pay back, is it forgivable. Ms.
Welsh said the loan is based on the net operating budget. After month 25, DEI will start
to pay us something back based on the revenues that the property is generating. It is
likely that they will not receive the full $50,000 back, but the intent is that the
Commission will receive a portion of those funds back based on the revenues
generated from the project itself.
Mr. Eldridge stated that the provisions state that DEI will have to hold onto the property
for ten years. Mr. Boyn said that DEI cannot resale the property for two years. If they do
resale it, they will have to pay the Commission back with the monies that were
generated from the sale.
Mr. Boyn said if they sell the property for less, then the City would have to agree to take
whatever the amount is that would be less than the full payoff.
After further discussion, Mr. Eash made a motion to approve the funding and content of
the agreement as presented by Ms. Welsh, seconded by Ms. Paolillo; motion carried.
Mr. David Henke stated that the concern he has had is that he has heard several things
even though the Commission is different than the Council. It is concerning when we
have such an investment in a consolidated area that we must invest more to stabilize
our own investment. Secondly, we always skew the markets. It is always these funds
going in, how do private investors compete with those investors that are getting
subsidized. It is a matter that if $50,000 was to be paid back over the ten years, Mr.
Henke would have no problem with this whatsoever, but as an investor/developer
himself, he has to go to the bank and sign his own business plan and a project that
supports the revenue coming in. He can‚Äôt go through the City because that would tell
him this project does not bear its own weight. It does not have the ROI necessary
without City action; therefore it seems as though sometimes through grants, state funds,
and taxes nonetheless, we are subsidizing at a great cost a surplus of housing.
Mr. Henke stated that he is not sure if Elkhart needs more rental housing. He is a rental
provider, as well as Councilman Osborne, but they are both competing with projects
such as this. Both trying to find stable tenants to stabilize their properties, yet competing
with those that are getting subsidized and forgivable loans. It gets to be concerning. Not
all properties are worth refurbishing, Mr. Henke would suppose. A project, if the market
demand is there, the payback ought to be there without a forgivable loan. Nonetheless,
there is a surplus of housing and a surplus of rental properties which devalues all of us.
c) 2012 Redevelopment Commission Annual Report
Ms. Welsh reported that the Commission received a copy of the annual report. This is
just a summary of the monthly actions taken by the Redevelopment Commission. Ms.
8

Ann Kalman compiles this information from the monthly minutes. This year there were
some additional things that staff needed to include from a law change. The Commission
should notice on page five that the Commission members are listed and their positions.
There is also a line item related to any staff being paid out of TIF which the Commission
approved paying for Ms. Kalman‚Äôs salary budgeted at $10,000 per year. Grants and
loans, but at the end of the year there was only the one $500 grant to Indiana
Landmarks for the Armory assessment.
The TIF budgets are also attached, which meets the statutory requirement to show the
revenues as well as expenditures on an annual basis.
There being no further discussion, Ms. Paolillo made a motion to approve forwarding
the annual report to the Mayor and DLGF, seconded by Mr. Eash; motion carried.
d) 200 North Main ‚Äì Armory Building
Mr. Garrett reported that as the Commission is aware they are now the proud owners of
a property at 200 North Main Street affectionately known as the Elkhart Armory building.
As the Commission probably saw either through their own personal tour or through
photos and videos from the local media, the interior is in a little bit of a disarray, in need
of a little bit of ‚Äúspit and polish‚Äù. Staff is working with Indiana Landmarks to determine
what the fate of that building should be. There is a meeting coming up in about a week
with Indiana Landmarks to continue those discussions. There has been two developers
expressing some level of interest in keeping the building and redeveloping that. With the
discussions with Indiana Landmarks, if the Commission chooses to go in the direction of
keeping the building and working with a developer, it would be important that we clean
out the building so that it shows better. Right now there is a lot of trash and a lot of
warped floors and things that can be removed. Mr. Garrett believes that once we go in
the direction of offering that to the development community it will be important that it
shows as best as possible. Staff would like the Commission to approve them getting a
crew of people in this building to kind of clean it out, bringing dumpsters on site and
taking out the debris. There has been one company giving staff an estimate, there are
two others going through the building this week to get an estimate on what it would take
to clean out the building.
Mr. Garrett is requesting approval of a number not to exceed $10,100 for the clean out
of the building.
Mr. Eash asked if the company who will clean out the building, are they local. Mr.
Garrett replied yes. Two companies are in Elkhart and the other is in Goshen.
Mr. Eldridge said he was wondering that if we are spending $10,000 before we know
the building is worth saving before we hear from Indiana Landmarks.
Mr. Garrett stated that one good thing about getting it cleaned out; obviously it will show
better for the development community to go through it. The second piece is that any
9

money that we spend on the clean out will be less money that we will have to spend on
the demolition because it would easily be two or three forty yard dumpsters full of stuff.
Mr. Eldridge asked Mr. Garrett when he anticipates hearing from Indiana Landmarks.
Mr. Garrett replied that he needs to get back with Mr. Todd Zeiger. They are going to
schedule a meeting as early as this Friday and possibly next week.
Mr. Eash said he thinks it would be a good idea to clean out the building. A developer
would have a small percentage of positive initial impression.
Ms. Paolillo asked about the roof? Mr. Garrett replied that the Commission already
approved $3,250 for patching the roof to keep the snow and the water out during the
winter time. That company has already started working this week.
Mr. Eldridge said if he remembers from a couple of months ago there was a number
that was going to come in at less than $200,000. If it came in over that we are basically
at a demolition point. Is this still the same thought process?
Mr. Garrett replied that the $175,000 number is the number that staff has been using.
That was the estimate from RC Engineers for demolition.
Mr. Eldridge asked if Indiana Landmarks was going to provide a number for what the
basic structure is to rehab. Mr. Garrett replied that they are going to start moving in that
direction with those conversations.
Mr. Eldridge said assuming you come back with anything reasonable, how long are we
going to leave the door open for developers to look at this building? Mr. Eldridge said
his concern is that we will get to a point where we have to start spending money again
on a building that we do not know is worth keeping. Mr. Garrett said his hope and his
expectation is that by the end of the winter and the beginning of spring, we will be at a
point where the Commission would know which direction they would want to take this
project whether it makes sense to continue to keep it and work with the development
community, or it is going to be coming down.
Mr. Eldridge asked if Indiana Landmarks will be scheduled to come to the February
meeting to make a presentation on their findings. Mr. Garrett said that is his hope.
Mr. Eash asked Mr. Eldridge that as a realtor does he think it would be a reasonable
idea with this clean out. Mr. Eldridge replied yes from a realtor hat. The bigger question
is he does not want to keep spending money on something that we are going to tear
down anyway. The discussion in February will be fairly critical.
After further discussion, Mr. Eash made a motion to appropriate $10,100 of Downtown
TIF funds for the clean out of the interior of 200 North Main Street, seconded by Ms.
Paolillo; motion carried.

10

Mr. Dave Osborne stated that he thought it might be wise to be specific of what the
clean up is going to entail so that you can know what you are getting for your $10,000.
Mr. Henke stated that he does not pretend to know the building as well as the
Commission does, but he has had calls talking about the mold which could be a major
factor in the state of Indiana. Also the front fa√ßade is leaning inward that will take some
serious rebinding. Mr. Henke said he has not been the building for a while, but he has
met with someone who has walked that building. Mr. Henke said before the
Commission goes to far, he is not sure of the use of the building. It is a wonderful
historic something for someone who has unbelievably deep pockets. After that the use
that we talk about payback on rental properties, Mr. Henke has no idea what the
Commission would put in this building to get their money back over a 20 year period.
That would be the other consideration. We can make it new, we can sink a lot of dollars
into it, but what do you do with it after that point.
Mr. Boecher stated that the only other thing that he would add is he understands that it
seems like the Commission is getting pecked to death by a duck on this building, but if
they look through any kind of picture book of Elkhart throughout the history you see so
many examples of buildings that were not given the opportunity to see if there is a
reuse. At this time, this building is awful but to Mr. Eldridge‚Äôs point, you can‚Äôt get
somebody to put any kind of number on that building until you can see what you are
dealing with. That is the unfortunate thing. Mr. Boecher does not think there is any way
that the Commission will get a serious developer interested if we have it covered in
debris. Mr. Boecher agrees with the point that you have to say ‚Äúwhen‚Äù at some point,
but he asks the Commission to take this additional step. This building fits as well as
anything out here for what the Commission‚Äôs public role is and the TIF funds that are
generated.
Mr. Eash said he appreciated the comments from Mr. Henke and Mr. Boecher. Both
made very good valid points.
Mr. Eldridge said speaking on behalf of the Commission; they have an open mind on
this project. They have leaned both ways and are not inclined to spend $175,000 to fix
this building up and not have somebody who is willing to spend the $300,000 it is going
to take to make it something nice. At this point, the Commission is waiting on Indiana
Landmarks to tell them what that number is going to be; and based on their report the
Commission will be able to make a much better decision.
Mr. Correll commented that the amount of money that will be spent to take the debris
out, that amount of money will be spent if the building was demolished.
Mr. Eash asked would Indiana Landmarks recommend cleaning out the building. Mr.
Garrett said he does not believe staff has had that discussion with Indiana Landmarks
but they certainly will.

11

Mr. Boyn asked if Indiana Landmarks report tie into whether or not it is a good idea to
clean the building out now or maybe after their report comes in. Will we learn anymore
from the next discussions on when is the best time to spend money for the clean up?
Mr. Garrett replied that he thinks if we go the direction of saving the building and doing a
request for proposals for developers and having developers come in and tour the
building, those types of things, absolutely we are going to need to have it cleaned out so
that it shows as well as possible as Mr. Boecher mentioned so that you can see what
you are getting yourself into as a developer. If the Commission choose to go the
demolition route, then the monies that we spend on clean up that is two or three
dumpster loads that we would have been spending somewhere with a demolition
company anyway.
Mr. Eldridge said he is guessing that the opinion that it is probably if we deferred the
execution of the clean up until after staff has had their conversations with Indiana
Landmarks, so instead of approving the entire $10,100 authorize staff to spend up to
$10,100 after the discussions with Indiana Landmarks if it is relevant to do so at that
time.
Mr. Eash amended his previous motion approving up to $10,100 to clean and remove
debris from 200 North Main Street building if it is determined by staff as a reasonable
course of action after Indiana Landmarks provides its input, seconded by Ms. Paolillo;
motion carried.
Mr. Eash made a motion approving up to $10,100 to clean and remove debris from 200
North Main Street building if it is determined by staff as a reasonable course of action
after Indiana Landmarks provides its input, seconded by Ms. Paolillo; motion carried.
e) 209 North Second Contracts
Ms. Welsh stated that at the last meeting the Commission actually approved staff
working directly with Mr. Eldridge as the representative to negotiate contracts for our
NSP 1 and 3 properties. This one was ready so staff just pushed it through to bring it
before the Commission.
Ms. Welsh said the electrical contract is not in this packet at this point. Staff will
negotiate that one with Mr. Eldridge prior to the next meeting, but bring it to the
Commission‚Äôs attention at that meeting as well. The reason why staff is doing this right
away is because they are running up against those deadlines and they need to get the
contracts in place so that the funds are spent in order to not lose the funds.
Ms. Welsh said the memo the Commission received from Mr. Champaigne was related
to two projects (contracts) at 209 N Second Street, which is the NSP 3 property. The
first one is the general renovation. Staff is working with the State Historic Preservation
officer to see if we can actually replace the windows with vinyl as opposed to having to
get wood windows. This will save a significant amount of money. That is where the
12

alternative bid comes in at the $221,450 as opposed to the $266,700. The base bid
included wood windows.
After reviewing both bids, Staltari is a local contractor but his bid was significantly higher
than the Greentree Environmental who is out of Portage. The difference was well in
excess of the 10% kind of wiggle room staff give to local contractors. Staff recommends
awarding the contract to Greentree Environmental for alternative which is the $221,450.
Ms. Welsh said staff received three bidders for the plumbing and mechanical work. Two
were from South Bend and one from Elkhart. Again the H & H Mechanicals, which is
staff‚Äôs recommendation, is well above that 10% threshold. Staff recommends H & H
Mechanicals at an amount of $50,800.
Mr. Eldridge asked if this building will be worth $315,000, which is what the Commission
is being asked to spend right now on top of what we have already got in it. Ms. Welsh
explained that the project budget is $386,000.
Mr. Eldridge asked how many units are in the building. Ms. Welsh replied six.
Mr. Eldridge said it seems like a pretty heavy burden. Ms. Welsh stated that again her
job is different than many people‚Äôs jobs in the world. Historic preservation is a key
component to using federal dollars. As we researched this building we find that it is one
of the oldest buildings in Elkhart. Actually older than the Havilah Beardsley house. The
funds are federal dollars so they have the historic preservation and lead remediation
and all kinds of additional costs that a private entity would not necessarily be subject to.
Yes the federal government provides the funds but they also provide a lot of additional
expense related to doing the project. As an NSP 3 property, Community Development
did get this property. It was nearly $20,000 in tax delinquent. It was something that went
through multiple sheriff and tax sales, and it wasn‚Äôt going to be saved by anybody but
the City. This is definitely one of those that the market isn‚Äôt going to do this kind of a
project, but what do we gain by being the first one in in this neighborhood particularly,
stabilizing this extremely important local landmark; providing quality affordable housing
in the process. Yes we may have a lot of rental units, but Ms. Welsh stated that she
would not live in most of them and she would choose to live in this house if she needed
a rental unit because it will be of a quality that we would be proud of. DEI will own and
manage it making that tie back to our downtown advocacy group. Reaffirming the
importance of housing as a component in our downtown and a pivotable portion of the
redevelopment plan that we have for the downtown area in general. If we don‚Äôt see the
importance of investing in our near downtown neighborhoods as one of the most
important things that the Redevelopment Commission can do, Ms. Welsh think we have
missed the ball. The Commission has a different role than most other divisions of the
City of Elkhart and that is why we are here. The State of Indiana would not have allowed
the Commission to do these things if they didn‚Äôt see that it was critically important for
redevelopment of downtowns and cities in general. It doesn‚Äôt always make sense on
paper, but when you can go into neighborhoods like State/Division Street and see the

13

difference that the decisions this Commission has made in stabilizing that neighborhood
Ms. Welsh thinks yes it is important. It may not be popular, but it is what we are here for.
Mr. Eash asked what is the difference between the base bid and alternate bid. Ms.
Welsh replied that the base bid included changing the wood windows to vinyl windows.
Mr. Eldridge asked what is the timetable on this project? Ms. Welsh replied that they are
hoping to have the work completed within 120 days.
There being no further discussion, Ms. Paolillo made a motion to approve the Greentree
contract at an amount of $215,600 as presented by Ms. Welsh, seconded by Mr. Eash;
motion carried.
Mr. Eash made a motion to approve the H & H Mechanicals contract at an amount of
$50,800 as presented by Ms. Welsh, seconded by Ms. Paolillo; motion carried.
f) NSP Land Bank Resolution
Ms. Welsh reported that the Commission over the last four years has been acquiring
properties under the NSP 1 and NSP 3 programs for the purpose of land banking. Staff
has been taking these properties, removing a blighted structure. Land banking is a
technique to consolidate properties and put them back on the market more slowly. Over
time the NSP land banks are both set up for 10 years. At that point the City does have
to dispose of the property. Hopefully it won‚Äôt take that long to do it, but under the NSP
rules they do have to be disposed of within ten years.
Staff has been managing the land bank properties. They just decided that it was about
time that they actually formally place them into land bank so that if for reason somebody
was actually interested in buying one of these, they will understand that there are some
infringements on that and how the property can be reused because of the NSP
program.
Ms. Welsh wanted to kind of formalize that so if anybody tried to pull title if they were
interested in a particular property it will show up and they would know that there were
some rules or guidelines associated with that.
Mr. Boyn put together a resolution which amends the resolution that was passed about
a year ago and gets the new guidelines in there. There had to be a very detailed set of
guidelines on how the land bank operates. Seventy-nine properties will be placed in the
land bank. Some of the properties will be transferred to the Parks Department in March
or April of this year. Those are under the floodway restoration properties that the
Commission is working with the Parks Department on. The remainder will be offered for
sale.
Ms. Paolillo made a motion to approve the resolution as presented by Ms. Welsh,
seconded by Mr. Eash; motion carried.
14

g) Donation of Home for NSP
Ms. Welsh said she received a call from Mr. Darcy Chandler, President of Pinnacle RV
Transport. He has a home that they would like to donate to the Commission. It is about
a 1,300 square foot modular construction home. At this point staff is trying to find an
appropriate lot for it to be placed on. It is more of a ranch style house. Staff is working
with Zoning to verify that.
Staff would like the Commission‚Äôs approval to accept the donation. NSP funds will be
used for the site preparation work, such as building the garage, putting a foundation
underneath it and a front porch. This is estimated at about $50,000. Staff has been in
talks with Habitat. They come in with the homeowner ready to go, so we do not have to
market and try and sell the property.
Mr. Eldridge stated that it is a reasonably good idea to accept the donation if Habitat is
willing to work with the Commission.
Mr. Eash asked if once the NSP funds are applied, will the finished product be worth
about $100,000? Ms. Welsh said the lot staff is looking at at this point is 164 South
Shore. She would think a 1,300 square foot home will come in between $75,000 and
$95,000 depending on the finishes. It does come with the appliances. The furnace will
have to changed out because the home was constructed with an oil furnace, as
opposed to natural gas. Air conditioning will be installed also.
Staff Updates
a) Residential Rehab
The Commission received their monthly update from Mr. Jason Champaigne.
b) CDBG and NSP
Ms. Welsh reported that in December staff completed their monitoring visits of
subrecipients for the CDBG program. Staff goes out to the offices and if they have a
housing unit those are inspected as well to be sure that they are in compliance with the
federal rules. Staff will start planning for 2013 in January and February.
NSP 1 officially ends March 13, 2013. All the funds have to be spent so that is why staff
is desperately trying to get these projects completed. Fifty percent of the NSP 3 funds
have to be spent by that same date, which is why it is important to get these contracts
underway.
Ms. Welsh feels that staff will meet both of those deadlines.
c) SoMA

15

Ms. Welsh reported that SoMa is scheduled to meet again in January. This will be the
last general and committee meeting. They are hoping to end up with a draft plan in
March or April.
d) Economic Development Projects
Mr. Garrett stated that we have already covered the hot button topics, the Armory and
Shoppes on Six. There a number of other things in the hopper, but for the most part
they are not activities will be coming before the Commission.
Mr. Eldridge asked if there has been any interest on the Foundry property? Mr. Garrett
said there have been some discussions, but no outside interest. The Commission does
need to start moving in the direction of getting it officially listed.
e) Brownfield Projects
Mr. Correll reported that he met with Mr. Dennis McKinney who is a gentleman who has
spearheaded access to wind and solar power lighting for the Sterling Park area. This
will be paid for out of the Cummins grant.
The City received a $500,000 grant from OCRA for demolition of 700 West Beardsley.
The release of funds is scheduled for the 18th of this month. Staff will go to the Board of
Works and recommend a contractor on the 15th. The contractor will sign shortly
thereafter. Mr. Correll reported that the local bidder was 2.5 times more than the
contract amount.
Mr. Correll reported that the Poplar trees are still growing. He would like to expand the
project to the Roundhouse area.
Mr. Correll will be meeting with the Northside Riverside neighborhood association
tonight.
Mr. Correll is waiting to hear about the two EPA grants. He should hear something in a
couple of months.
Mr. Correll did receive the County supplied phase one on the Armory building.
126 & 130 Elkhart Avenue is the Humidor building, an asbestos survey is in process.
JPR (Wightman Petrie) was awarded the contract. The demolition process will be put
together after the start of the demolition of the Beardsley property.
Mr. Correll is working on getting 1032 East Beardsley demolished and giving the
property to Habitat.

16

The property at 2101 South Main is up for OTA (Order to Take Action) in February. Mr.
Correll is working with the Building Commissioner, Mr. Dennis Mann, on this building.
There has to be some asbestos survey on this building.
Mr. Correll has spoken to EPA Emergency Response last month and mentioned to them
about 1100 West Beardsley building. Mr. Correll will be meeting with them again. They
have the potential of going in and saying if we have a groundwater contamination and it
is significant, they can have an emergency demolition clean up at federal expense.
They will go after the Tecumseh to recoup their monies.
Other Business
a) TIF Invoices
There were no invoices for approval.
Correspondence/Announcements
a) Changes to Redevelopment Commission Law
Ms. Welsh commented that these were the changes related to the reporting
requirements adding the Commissioners names and notice of paid staff.
b) Board of Zoning Appeals ‚Äì Case #13-X-01
Ms. Welsh reported that this is a notice of a BZA case because the Commission is a
property owner within 300 feet of the case property. This is a special exception for a
home daycare at 1101 West Cleveland.
Public Comment
Mr. Henke stated that he find the Commission meetings very informative and appreciate
the work that they do.
Mr. Henke stated that the property at 209 N. 2nd Street went to the sheriff‚Äôs sale a
couple of times and was not picked up, which means the public/market did not see the
investment capability. So the City ends up picking it up. Mr. Henke only find that to be
useful in a couple of ways. It seems as though collectively all of the Commissions,
Council and everyone that serves has to connect the dots. That is why do we let
properties go so far without holding the owner responsible, that it becomes taxpayers
that have to do the clean up and then the City ends up being a landlord and competing
with its own driving market.
On the front end if Mr. Henke lets his properties go to waste, he would assume that
someone would get a hold of him and say here is the minimum standard we work with,
bring it up or be fined, or the City will take over his property at his expense.
17

Mr. Henke realizes that 700 West Beardsley was an exceptional case, but the Armory
was not.
On the other end, Mr. Henke heard Ms. Welsh talk about the Redevelopment
Commission‚Äôs mission and he is not sure he can adhere to it unless; Mr. Henke does
not think it is the Commission‚Äôs job to actually take a dilapidated property that someone
let go and we didn‚Äôt hold the owner accountable to, to pick it up and put it back in
greater shape with greater cost than what the market would demand, then have no
other expectation of that area other than to say we now have an investment and we
have to keep investing to protect our original investment. That is too big to fail.
Mr. Henke said he would say if the Commission is going to put $350,000 in a six unit
apartment building, first it is a novel error financially speaking. However, if then the City
was going to work with the Commission and say once we establish this new minimum
standard of living and now that becomes a 360 for code enforcement and zoning that
we can now clean up since we have invested the set of new standards, that would make
sense. The investment has a larger triple effect throughout that neighborhood. But if it
only stabilizes one house and does not impact the rest of them in a positive way that
was a bunch of money that you will not see come back again and in the long run has no
positive impact on our community.
Mr. Henke hopes that the Commission will talk individually and collectively and help
educate him on the larger picture since he is hardly involved.
Adjournment
There being no further discussion, the meeting was adjourned at 4:32 p.m.

AREA PLAN COMMISSION OF EVANSVILLE
AND VANDERBURGH COUNTY
Regular meeting held at 4:00 P.M. in Room 301
Civic Center Complex - Administration Building
Evansville, Indiana
June 13, 2013
ROLL CALL
Ms. Stevens: I would like to call the June 13, 2013 meeting of the Area Plan
Commission of Evansville and Vanderburgh County to order. Will the secretary please
call the roll?
Members Present:
H. Dan Adams, Marty Amsler, Dewey Colter, Lynn Lowe, Stephen Melcher, Jeffrey
Mueller, Bill Pedtke, Chris Rutledge, Pete Swaim, Stacy Stevens
Members Absent:
K.C. Jain, Roger Lehman, Vernon Stevens
Area Commission Staff Present:
Ron London, Executive Director; Janet Greenwell, Zoning Administrator; Donna
Holderfield, Zoning Enforcement Officer; Dirck Stahl. Counsel
APPROVAL OF MINUTES
Ms. Stevens: Is there a motion to approve the May minutes? (Motion was made and
seconded.) The minutes of the May meeting are approved.
REZONINGS
Ms. Stevens: For rezonings, it takes seven affirmative votes to recommend approval of
a petition or seven negative votes to recommend denial of a petition. In the event that
there are not seven votes, it still goes forward to the City Council or County Commission
with no recommendation.
The Area Plan Commission has established the following guidelines to be followed for
both rezonings and subdivisions. Mr. London will begin each presentation. As each
case is called, the petitioner and the remonstrators who intend to testify will please
stand and be sworn in at the beginning of the process. If your name is not on the

Area Plan Commission
June 13, 2013
Page 2

petition, those who plan to testify need to please fill out the sheets in the back of the
room. All testimony must begin by stating your name and address for the record.
The petitioner or person appearing for the case being heard will have a maximum of 10
minutes for the presentation of evidence, statements, and arguments in support of the
petition. Then there will be a total of 10 minutes for the remonstrators. This testimony
will be followed by a five minute rebuttal period for the petitioner as a summation of the
case. Any request for additional time must be voted on by the Board. A timer will be
used to help enforce the time limits. Both petitioners and remonstrators should organize
their testimony to adhere to these guidelines.
When there is a group of individuals remonstrating against a petition, we strongly
encourage the group to designate a spokesperson. If it is necessary for more than one
remonstrator to speak, the group should meet out in the hall before the Area Plan
Commission discussion of the agenda item, to coordinate the information presented, so
that each speaker addresses a different issue of concern. In order to expedite the
meeting, remonstrators should refrain from repeating the same concerns already
expressed by another speaker about a particular development proposal. The Plan
Commission appreciates the cooperation of all participants with these guidelines.
If the Commissioners have questions about issues that we feel have not been
sufficiently addressed by the applicant, we have the option to request a continuance
until the information needed to sufficiently answer our concerns is available or provided
by the applicant or technical staff.
The city rezonings considered today will be heard at the City Council meeting on
Monday, July 8, 2013 at 5:30 p.m. in Room 301. The county rezoning considered today
will be heard at the County Commission meeting on Tuesday, July 9, 2013 at 5:30 p.m.
in Room 301.
Now let‚Äôs move on to the first petition on the agenda.
Mr. Stahl: Mr. London, on all matters before the Board, do you swear or affirm that the
testimony you will give is true and accurate so help you God? (Mr. London has been
sworn in.)
CITY REZONINGS
Docket No: 2013-13-PC R-2013-7 Petitioner: Robert T. Rodgers
Common Address: (Complete legal on file) 1021 Grove Street
Nature of Case: Petitioner requests change from an M-3 zone to an R-2 zone.
Mr. London: Robert Rodgers is requesting to downzone his residential property
located at 1021 Grove Street from M-3 to R-2. This petition was continued from last
month‚Äôs meeting because there was no representative present. This is a very small
0.06 acre (44‚Äô x 64‚Äô) site located at the southeast corner of Grove and Missouri Streets.

Area Plan Commission
June 13, 2013
Page 3

This house is in a predominantly residential area of older homes on very small lots.
Access to the garage on the rear of the lot is available from Missouri Street. This is a
request to downzone this M-3 zoned site to bring the existing residence into
conformance with zoning code restrictions and to remove the legal nonconforming
status designation and the accompanying legal nonconforming restrictions from the site.
This downzoning to R-2 is consistent with the adjacent residential neighborhood
development and is appropriate to the small size of the lot which makes the provision of
adequate on-site parking for commercial or industrial use of the site difficult. The
Comprehensive Plan designates this area for mixed use which includes residential,
commercial, and industrial development. The site is in an older area of very mixed use,
predominantly industrial to the west of Grove Street and predominantly residential use
at this location along the east side of Grove. The area has been zoned for heavy
industrial use since the 1940‚Äôs. Most of the residences in the surrounding blocks are
also zoned industrial. This downzoning to R-2 is consistent with the Comprehensive
Plan and the existing residential use.
Mr. Stahl: All those who will speak on this petition, raise your right hand. Do you
swear or affirm that the testimony you will give is true and accurate so help you God?
(Ms. Sorgenfrey has been sworn in.)
Ms. Sorgenfrey: My name is Nancy Sorgunfrey. I live at 2015 E. Gum Street. I am
standing in for Robert Rodgers. He had a death in his family.
Ms. Stevens: Did you have anything to add?
Ms. Sorgenfrey: No.
Ms. Stevens: Are there questions for the petitioner‚Äôs representative? (None.) Is there
a motion for approval? (Motion was made and seconded.) Call the roll.
Ayes: Dr. Adams, Mr. Amsler, Mr. Colter, Ms. Lowe, Mr. Melcher, Mr. Mueller, Mr.
Pedtke, Mr. Rutledge, Mr. Swaim, Ms. Stevens
Nays: None
There being 10 affirmative votes, Docket No: R-2013-7 goes forward with a
recommendation for approval.
Ms. Stevens: Before we get to the next one, because we hustled to get going, I forgot
to welcome Ron London. This is his first meeting.
Docket No: 2013-15-PC R-2013-8 Petitioner: Busy Beedz, Inc./Vanessa Fullop
Common Address: (Complete legal on file.) 1021 Lincoln Avenue
Nature of Case: Petitioner requests change from a C-2 zone to an R-2 zone.

Area Plan Commission
June 13, 2013
Page 4

Mr. London: Vanessa Fullop is requesting to rezone her property located at 1021
Lincoln Avenue from C-2 to R-2. The vacant building that recently housed Busy Beedz,
Inc. is on the south side of Lincoln Avenue, between Kentucky Avenue & Highway 41.
This is a request for rezoning to allow sale of the residence on this site. The residence
was rezoned to C-2 by a prior owner to allow establishment of a specialty dress shop on
the first floor with a residential unit on the second floor. Busy Beedz operated the retail
shop from this site in recent years. The site is now vacant. The ‚ÄúBusy Beedz‚Äù sign is
no longer functional and must be removed from the site. The current owner has had the
property for sale for some time, with no interested parties for use as a commercial
business. A potential purchase is pending the downzoning to residential to allow sale of
the site as a residence, with a residential loan. This site is located on Lincoln Avenue,
along the ‚ÄúOlde Towne‚Äù corridor (between Kentucky Avenue and Highway 41), an area
which has experienced a gradual transition from residential to commercial development
over the years, utilizing a common development theme. The majority of the structures
along this ‚ÄúOlde Towne‚Äù corridor were originally residential homes which were
converted for use as retail businesses or offices. This area is designated for mixed
commercial and residential use according to the Comprehensive Plan, and this rezoning
to R-2 which would again allow the residential use of the site would be consistent with
the Plan. This is a request to downzone this site to allow re-establishment of the
residential use as a single-family home.
Mr. Stahl: All those who will speak on this petition, raise your right hand. Do you
swear or affirm that the testimony you will give is true and accurate so help you God?
(Ms. Fullop has been sworn in.)
Ms. Fullop: My name is Vanessa Fullop, 2547 County Road 1700 E. Grayville, IL
62844.
Ms. Stevens: Is there anything you want to add?
Ms. Fullop: No.
Ms. Stevens: Are there any questions? Are there any remonstrators? (None.) Is there
a motion for approval? (Motion was made and seconded.) Call the roll.
Ayes: Mr. Amsler, Mr. Colter, Ms. Lowe, Mr. Melcher, Mr. Mueller, Mr. Pedtke, Mr.
Rutledge, Mr. Swaim, Dr. Adams, Ms. Stevens
Nays: None
There being 10 affirmative votes, Docket No:

COUNTY REZONING
Docket No: 2013-14-PC VC-6-2013 Petitioner: Christian Fellowship Church
Common Address: (Complete legal on file.) 4100 Millersburg Road
Nature of Case: Petitioner requests change from an agricultural zone to a C-1 zone
with a use and development commitment.
Mr. London: Christian Fellowship Church is requesting to rezone a part of their church
property at 4100 Millersburg Road from Agricultural to C-1 with a use and development
commitment. The use and development commitment included as part of this rezoning
ordinance limits use of the C-1 site for sign(s) only. The County zoning code Chapter
17.28.050 requires approval of a special use permit (SU-13) by the Board of Zoning
Appeals for all electronic message boards and/or signs with flashing, moving, rotating or
intermittent lights, or animated messages. Special Use # 13 is permitted with BZA
approval only in commercial or industrial districts. The applicant proposes a new
electronic message sign for the church along the Millersburg Road frontage. This is a
request for C-1 zoning to allow the church to file for the BZA electronic sign special use.
The 20‚Äô x 20‚Äô rezoning site on the submitted survey is the location proposed for the new
sign. The small size of the rezoning area will limit the size of the proposed new sign.
The existing church on this site is located on the north side of Millersburg Road,
between Hedden and Newbury Roads. Access exists on the site as was approved by
Site Review. The proposed electronic signage must not interfere with traffic by reducing
visibility for egress onto Millersburg Road. Staff will address compliance with all code
requirements upon submission of plans for the erection of the new sign on the site.
After approval of the rezoning of the site for the sign, the church must file application for
SU-13 approval for erection of the new electronic sign, to be heard by the Board of
Zoning Appeals.

Mr. Stahl: All those who will speak on this petition, raise your right hand. Do you
swear or affirm that the testimony you will give is true and accurate so help you God?
(Those persons have been sworn in.)
Ms. Owens: My name is Brenda Owens with Sign Crafters, Inc. I am representing
Christian Fellowship Church to get a certain spot rezoned so they can have their new
sign.
Ms. Stevens: Thank you. Are there any questions?
Mr. Amsler: The setback on the sign, is that adequate enough? Because Millersburg
Road will probably be widened at some time, I would assume, in the near future. So is
it set back enough?
Ms. Owens: Yes. The setback on it is according to the setback per the City. But it‚Äôs
basically where the sign is going to be located. Really, what they are wanting people to
see as they are coming in and out from the church, that‚Äôs who they are wanting to be

Area Plan Commission
June 13, 2013
Page 6

able to read the sign, the people entering and exiting the church. So it is going to be far
enough back so it won‚Äôt hinder anyone from Millersburg Road.
Mr. Amsler: Even if that were to become a four-lane road down through there?
Ms. Owens: Then I guess they would probably have to move it back because they just
got through widening it and doing all that work there.
Mr. Stahl: That‚Äôs currently a three-lane road. It‚Äôs two wide lanes with a two-way left
turn lane in the middle because they redid all the curbs and widened the whole thing
right there.
Ms. Owens: So that‚Äôs why they waited so long on getting a sign until all that work was
done.
Ms. Stevens: Other questions?
Mr. Stahl: I have a comment. I would ask, if this goes through, as an administrative
matter, you need to submit a new use and development commitment. I‚Äôll show you how
to fix it on the last page. Nothing substantive. But you won‚Äôt be able to record it in the
format that it‚Äôs in.
Ms. Stevens: Anything else? Are there any remonstrators?
Ms. Robinson: I‚Äôm Christy Robinson. I live at 8110 Brighton Place which is directly
behind the church. I‚Äôm really just needing clarification that we are only talking about a
small portion for this sign, that the whole acreage will not be rezoned commercial. Or
that in the future, that won‚Äôt make it easier to rezone.
Mr. London: What they submitted was just a 20 x 20 foot area. So that‚Äôs all we would
be approving tonight. There‚Äôs nothing else that would be zoned for commercial.
Ms. Robinson: And on that same size, they would have to keep it that size sign and
not increase the height or anything without coming back, is that correct?
Mr. London: They would have to come back to our office and I believe they would
have to come back to the BZA for approval. So they would have to come back in front
of someone.
Ms. Stevens: There is no slippery slope on this one. Good question. Anything else?
Is there a motion for approval? (Motion was made and seconded.) Call the roll.
Ayes: Mr. Colter, Ms. Lowe, Mr. Mueller, Mr. Pedtke, Mr. Rutledge, Mr. Swaim, Dr.
Adams, Mr. Amsler, Ms. Stevens
Nays: None

Abstention: Mr. Melcher
There being 9 affirmative votes and 1 abstention, Docket No: VC-6-2013 goes forward
with a recommendation for approval.
SUBDIVISIONS
Ms. Stevens: The rezoning portion of the meeting is now over and we will now hear
the proposed subdivisions that are on our agenda. As stated earlier, the Area Plan
Commission is the sole authority on subdivisions. State law and our Subdivision
Control Ordinance dictate the issues the Plan Commission can consider when reviewing
a subdivision application. Unlike a rezoning, consideration of a subdivision is limited to
whether it complies with the standards and requirements in the local Subdivision Control
Ordinance. If a subdivision application meets the requirements set forth in the
Subdivision Control Ordinance, the Area Plan Commission must approve the primary
plat. Indiana Courts have indicated that Plan Commissions have no discretion in this
regard, and that our role in reviewing and acting on subdivisions is purely ministerial.
Seven affirmative votes are needed to approve a subdivision plat and conversely, seven
negative votes are required to deny a plat. In the event that there are not seven votes
for or against, this is considered a no action vote and the plat returns to the next APC
meeting for consideration.
The guidelines for testimony on subdivisions will be the same as those explained at the
onset of this meeting. Petitioners and remonstrators should remember that the only
testimonies the APC can consider are facts that prove whether the plat complies with
the specific standards in the Subdivision Control Ordinance. Copies of the Subdivision
Control Ordinance are available in the Area Plan Commission office in Room 312 or on
our website at evansvilleapc.com.
Now let‚Äôs move on to the subdivisions.
1-S-2013 Enclave at Eagle Creek
Section 29 T6S/R11W Perry Township Map #CO-65 Lot(s): 67
Location: Located on Felstead Road, south of W Lloyd Expressway.
Mr. London: The Enclave at Eagle Creek revised plat is a 60-lot residential and
commercial subdivision located on a 22.7-acre site west of Felstead Road and south of
Lloyd Expressway. On February 14, 2013, the Area Plan Commission granted primary plat
approval for the original 66-lot version of this subdivision. The northern 3.82 acres of this
property was rezoned from Ag to C-4 with a Use & Development Commitment by the County
Commissioners on March 12, 2013. This area for commercial development was part of the
original plat and was proposed as 13 smaller lots originally (designed for home sites). The
revised plat now shows this area as 3 lots (presumably for commercial development). The
public streets that were planned to extend through the area have been removed from the plat,
eliminating one of the two public subdivision entrances on Felstead Road. This change in the
plat requires review by the APC. The Subdivision Review Committee reviewed the plat

Area Plan Commission
June 13, 2013
Page 8

revisions on May 14, 2013. The plat shows an eastern subdivision entrance on Felstead

Road at Cliftwood Drive, and a second western access at Stellar Drive near the Eagle
Village Apartments. The subdivision streets extend from these access points into the
site and connect to the internal subdivision road network. If a commercial entrance on
Lot 57 is planned within the INDOT right-of-way line on Felstead Road at the northern
end of the site, this access will require INDOT approval. Sidewalks are required by
Code.
Comments on the revised plat from the County Engineer indicate the following :
-

-

Erosion control measures will be especially important due to the extensive
grading anticipated and steep grades on the site.
Any driveways on Felstead Road within Lot 57 and north of the line marked L5
on the plat will require INDOT approval.
Utility or drainage pipes under any existing roads must be bored instead of open
cut trenching.
Concerns about sight distance stemming from the curvature and grade of
Felstead, and the embankment on the west side of road at the Felstead Road /
Cliftwood Dr. intersection.
Removal of the classified forest designation for Lots 38, 39 and 40.
Determine sidewalk alignment to connect the existing sidewalk along Stellar
Drive with Felstead Road, and meet all ADA sidewalk requirements.

The Evansville MPO comments also addressed the need for sidewalks to connect this
development with Stellar Drive to the west so that the area will have pedestrian
accessibility to the METS USI Bus route on Schutte Road and to the USI campus. Two
of their other recommendations were comments on the original plat, but were only
slightly changed to reflect lot renumbering on the revised plat.
Comments from INDOT require that any connection to Felstead Road (within the INDOT
right-of-way) will need INDOT approval and submittal of a Traffic Impact Study for the
development plan. City water and sewer are available by extension at the site. A letter
of credit is required. The Water and Sewer Department comments state that the existing
water line might need to be relocated for Lots 1-5 (this water line continues through Lot
50). The required easements need to be granted on the plat from the approved utility
plans. The preliminary drainage plan was approved for the revised Enclave at Eagle
Cliff subdivision by the County Drainage Board on April 23, 2013. The required
drainage easements must be shown on the plat prior to recording. If the Enclave at
Eagle Cliff subdivision is approved, primary plat approval should include the conditions
listed in the staff field report.
Mr. Stahl: All those who will speak on this petition, raise your right hand. Do you
swear or affirm that the testimony you will give is true and accurate so help you God?
(Mr. Buck has been sworn in.)

Area Plan Commission

Mr. Buck: My name is Dan Buck. I‚Äôm the developer. 8141 Buck‚Äôs Lane. I think the
staff report pretty well summoned up why I‚Äôm back. We deleted some roads and some
lots so they said I needed to get re-approval.
Ms. Stevens: Thank you. Are there questions for Mr. Buck? Are there any
remonstrators? (None.) Is there a motion for approval with the following conditions:
Prior to recording, revise the plat to: 1. Provide written documentation that all Water
and Sewer Department requirements are met. 2. If INDOT driveway permit approval is
sought, provide documentation that the required traffic impact study has been approved
by both the County Engineer and EMPO. 3. Include any required off-site improvements
resulting from any traffic impact study in the subdivision letter of credit. 4. Provide to
the satisfaction of the County Engineer that the sight distance concerns at the
Cliftwood-Felstead intersection are addressed. 5. Provide documentation from IDNR
that the Classified Forest designation has been removed from the property. Based
upon this documentation, revise the plat by deleting the wording and line work for this
designation. 6. Provide documentation that the Water and Sewer Utility easement
shown on the plat in Lot 50 has been vacated. (Motion was made and seconded.)
Mr. Swaim: I seconded the motion. Do we need to do it again?
Mr. Stahl: Just confirm that you meant to second it with those conditions.
Ayes: Ms. Lowe, Mr. Melcher, Mr. Mueller, Mr. Pedtke, Mr. Rutledge, Mr. Swaim, Dr.
Adams, Mr. Amsler, Mr. Colter, Ms. Stevens
Nays: None
There being 10 affirmative votes, Docket No: 1-S-2013 is approved.
Mr. Stahl: Just to explain why I jumped on that. Our ordinance says that you cannot
add conditions after approval and I wouldn‚Äôt want somebody to come back and say
that‚Äôs what happened.
Docket No: 3-S-2011 Poet Square
Section 4 T5S/R10W Scott Township Map #CO-181 Lots: 28
Location: Located along Peck Road, south of Baseline Road.
Request to remove condition #2 of primary approval.
Mr. London: The Poet Square plat is a 131-lot residential subdivision on a 36.9-acre
site located on the east side of Peck Road between Baseline Road and Old State Road
across from the new North High and Middle Schools. Primary plat approval was granted
by the Area Plan Commission in August, 2011. Since the APC subdivision approval,
two sections of Poet Square have been recorded in the northwestern portion of the
primary plat totaling 55 lots. These two sections access through the residential
subdivisions to the east. The primary plat for Poet square also shows an access to the
west of the subdivision on Peck Road. In the primary subdivision approval, the Area

Area Plan Commission
June 13, 2013
Page 10

Plan Commission placed an access condition on this plat as allowed by State law,
based on comments about the original plat from the County Engineer and the EMPO.
The condition states that ‚ÄúAccess to Peck Road should not be allowed until the roadway
is improved to a standard two-lane facility from Baseline Road to Old State Road.‚Äù The
road was widened south of the North High and Middle School entrance, which is the
southern half of the road segment specified in the condition. The County recently
resurfaced the road north of the school entrance and added an approximate two-foot
rock shoulder and a section of guard rail. However, this portion of Peck Road‚Äôs
pavement has not been widened from its original size.
The applicant now requests to eliminate the condition on the primary plat approval
restricting access to Peck Road until it is widened. The proposed subdivision street to
access Peck Road (Road # 6 on the primary plat) is highlighted in the picture shown on
your screens and will connect to Peck near the southwest corner of the primary plat.
The existing access to the two sections of Poet Square that have been recorded is a
westward extension of the existing Natalie Drive into the site from the Chadwick Place
subdivision adjacent to the east.
The APC members have been provided a copy of the County Engineer‚Äôs comments on
the proposed removal of the access condition. Due to safety concerns about the
inadequate width of Peck Road, the County Engineer is not in favor of allowing access
to Peck until it is widened from North High School to Baseline Road. His conclusion is
that Peck Road cannot accommodate additional traffic at its current width. The recent
resurfacing and guardrail improvements to the narrow portion of the road have not
changed the safety concerns about the width of the pavement. Vanderburgh County
plans to reconstruct this road in the future, but no schedule has been determined for the
project and no work will occur until TIF funds accumulate to be able to pay for the
upgrade.
Evansville MPO‚Äôs comments on the original primary plat agree with the County
Engineer and state the following: Peck Road (north of the North High School entrance)
is currently of substandard geometry. Peck Road narrows to 14 feet at the drainage
culvert just north of the proposed development. Peck Road is functionally classified as a
local road and therefore would not have access to federal aid for needed improvements.
There are currently no plans and no funding for improvements north to Baseline Road.
We would expect approximately 1800 vehicle trips per day from this development (at
buildout).
Access to Peck Road should be allowed only after the roadway is improved to a
standard two-lane facility from Baseline Road to Old State Road. The access limitation
recommended by the County Engineer and the EMPO will result in Poet Square
temporarily having only one access through the Chadwick Place and Kingsmont
Subdivisions to eventually reach Old State Road. The County Engineer indicated that it
could take about 5 years for enough money to build up in the Highway 41 North TIF to
complete the improvements needed to Peck Road, and that assumes all the TIF funds
generated would be dedicated to the Peck Road project over this period. Based on the

Area Plan Commission
June 13, 2013
Page 11

County Engineer and EMPO comments, staff recommends that the condition of
approval and the corresponding plat note on the access restriction to Peck Road remain
on the plat to protect public safety on this narrow road. The subdivision access to Peck
should be installed once Peck is widened to a standard two-lane facility, giving the
development a second access option.
Mr. Stahl: All those who will speak on this petition, raise your right hand. Do you
swear or affirm that the testimony you will give is true and accurate so help you God?
(Mr. Murphy has been sworn in.)
Mr. Murphy: My name is Brian Murphy, 15401 Haiku Road, Evansville. I‚Äôm the
managing partner of New Urban Investments who is the developer of this real estate.
Does anybody have any questions of me before I start my presentation to convince you
all that we should remove the condition upon the property? Okay. This is just a plat of
the subdivision. INAUDIBLE-AWAY FROM MIC‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ This is at Old State Road and this
is looking north up Peck Road. So this is basically a video of traveling north on Peck
Road. You will see the school entrance on the left side. So there‚Äôs the one way in, one
way out of the high school. Still on the high school improvements. Then we are on to
the area where we are assuming is substandard geometry. There is the roadway
guardrails on the right. The video will stop where our entrance and exit will end up
being accessing Peck Road, which is right there. So I think one of the areas probably
everybody has an issue with, there is a bridge as you travel further north that actually
compresses traffic a little bit more which creates a yielding effect between the vehicles
that travel through there. Here is the bridge. You can see the yellow highlighting the
sides of the bridge. I think it is actually approximately 14-15 feet. This is just a bigger
blown up picture. I was anticipating having a laser pointer here. Peck Road obviously
from Google maps, the north complex. Here‚Äôs our site as it relates to the rest. Where
we were at in that previous picture is approximately right here heading north into that
bridge geometry. Here is a video of two vehicles actually crossing through that bridge
area. The bridge way we are referring to is approximately here where this video will be
taking place at. That‚Äôs the narrowest that it gets there. Vehicles somewhat yielding.
The one moving through. I think you saw them both on the bridge where they passed.
So essentially what the claim is is that this road is unsafe for standard two-lane traffic.
But my contention is that it is actually helpful that these measures are on this road, that
it actually slows traffic down. Okay. That it is a calming effect. You will see, I have an
example from another County road. So Mohr Road basically does the same thing, even
to a greater extent because you cannot drive two vehicles through that road. Everybody
know where Mohr Road ends up at? Spring Lake Valley, 142 lot subdivision passed
with no restrictions, no conditions put on it. At buildout, 142 lots. Poet Square 131.
Has the same similar geometry that Mohr Road does. Any questions? This picture
here, this is a design technique utilized by traffic engineers, urban planners, city
planners, that actually, their effect again is to calm traffic. They actually put the yield
point in to force cars to yield as they move through. The idea is not to speed traffic up,
which is what two-lane standard facility geometries do. Wherever you go, sometimes
they say that it doesn‚Äôt increase, it is for traffic congestion. But what ends up
happening, everybody drives on that road and it gets more congested. Well, when what

Area Plan Commission
June 13, 2013
Page 12

used to be a slow, country lane, all of a sudden becomes this wide country highway with
curb, gutter, oversized lanes. High school kids traveling down it, what do they do?
They speed up. So again, both instances those cars were doing something that the
road is making them to do. They are not being told. There is no signage to say stop.
There is no flashing signs. There is no traffic engineer telling them. There are actually
studies that correlate speeds and road widths to increased accidents, increased
fatalities. One of those studies, residential street topology and injury accident frequency
done by an engineer, actually out of Longmont, Colorado. He makes the point that the
safest residential streets are 24 feet or less. You can say, this isn‚Äôt a residential street.
It is either an arterial or a collector. Okay, I‚Äôm moving to traffic counts now. When we
started talking about the kind of traffic counts that are going to be affecting this road.
This is from back in October, a 48-hour period. So I just took both lanes because they
actually put a counter on either end of the road, one southbound and northbound.
Added those together. 1,447 cars. That‚Äôs in 48 hours. Compare that with Mohr Road
from 2008, that data I collected was AADTC. That was only 24 hours but I just doubled
it to come up with the 2,598. Remember, that‚Äôs 2008 data. So I am only going to
assume there is more traffic on that road today than there was in 2008. Just some
general comments on potential case law issues, the denial of the Peck use substantially
devalues the land at Poet Square resulting in a taking without compensation, violation of
Fifth Amendment of the US Constitution Article 1, Sec. 21. And in fact, Indiana Supreme
Court has recognized that ingress and egress to and from a public highway is a public
right and cannot be substantially or materially interfered with without due compensation.
Land owners suffer damage that is particular rather than that suffered by the general
public, a taking may be found to have occurred. The County cannot impose a severe
restriction on real estate which devalues the real estate just because the County has not
accepted the responsibility to improve said public road. The denial of the use of Peck
Road by devaluing Poet Square is also illegal or an exaction, roughly requirements that
provide the party to give up something in favor of the public need. But by public law,
exaction needs to be related both in nature and extent of the impact of the developer.
In this case, the overwhelming impact to Peck Road resulted in the construction of
North High School and subsequent school bus traffic generated as a result thereof, not
the development of the subdivision. Supreme Court has held INAUDIBLE‚Ä¶ by the
government and those interests to be served. In this case, the public interest is that
Peck Road should be improved and prohibiting Poet Square from accessing the public
road does nothing further that interest. Five counties allowed other developments on
less than standards shows unequal treatment and also a violation of the constitution.
So I would encourage the removal of this condition.
Ms. Stevens: Okay, thank you. Very nice presentation. Are there questions for this
petitioner? Are there any remonstrators? (None.)
Dr. Adams: Is this the only access that you can have for this particular development?
Mr. Murphy: No, there is another access that goes to the two other single family
subdivisions.

Area Plan Commission
June 13, 2013
Page 13

Dr. Adams: I see, ??? Court to‚Ä¶
Mr. Murphy: Yes. It moves east and then south and then east and then south. It‚Äôs a
left right left right.
Dr. Adams: Thank you.
Mr. Colter: Mr. Murphy, what has changed since the approval was given with the
conditions previously?
Mr. Murphy: In regard to‚Ä¶
Mr. Colter: Well, you had approval for the subdivision with the ingress and egress
through Chadwick and I‚Äôm wanting to know why now we need to take a relook at this
access to Peck Road.
Mr. Murphy: Probably a good deal of it has come from comments from individuals who
have had a hard time finding the development and also from realtors who say it is hard
to get people back there to show the homes. And also from people who are starting to
buy homes there who use the construction entrance as their primary means of in and
out as it‚Äôs a lot more direct than driving through other neighborhoods.
Dr. Adams: I would imagine the other neighborhood don‚Äôt like it too much either.
Mr. Murphy: When school gets started, I could probably count at least four cars that
will drive through the neighborhood to use the construction entrance. Some of those
people know and use it but others I think their habits are already defined either through
the elementary in and out if that‚Äôs the way they are going, instead of coming that
direction, they are probably purposely going toward the high school or middle school.
Dr. Adams: I was thinking that if you deny access to Peck Road, there are a group of
people that will be going back through these two other neighborhoods.
Mr. Murphy: I think the majority of them still do.
Mr. Pedtke: Can you describe the development of the school and the traffic using Peck
Road now after the school has been built and is being used?
Mr. Murphy: INAUDIBLE-AWAY FROM MIC‚Ä¶. All of that is designed to load,
basically the line up of the buses. They line up the buses right through there. You can‚Äôt
drive anywhere else but there, turn and come back out. Well what happens, then they
improved this down here for the one lane only traffic to head back south out of the high
school, because that‚Äôs all they had to do. Well what happened is, these buses, instead
of turning left, going all the way around the school and coming out this entrance, they
will come down, make a right to Baseline and then come down Peck Road. So the
drivers of those buses don‚Äôt drive back around the school. They actually go to Baseline

Area Plan Commission
June 13, 2013
Page 14

and then come down Peck. I know that that‚Äôs one unintended consequence that
occurred. That‚Äôs based on design that forcing traffic to go down Peck that the school
didn‚Äôt want to begin with. And I‚Äôve been there all times of the day. If you pull up traffic
studies, the speeds are, on average, between 35-55 miles an hour there. It‚Äôs posted 30
mph except when school is in session.
Mr. Pedtke: Help me with the time line. The condition was put on there before the road
was improved by the school for the sections‚Ä¶.
Mr. Murphy: Before the improvements that are there now. So there was no pavement
that you saw from my video. There were no guardrails that you saw per my video. It
was a pretty rough road. I won‚Äôt deny that. At the time it was rough. But where it is now
with the pavement, the markings, the guard rail, and in addition to the effect that that
road itself has on drivers, that narrowing effect, I know there are hundreds of roads in
Evansville that are substandard that literally thousands of cars go down everyday. Just
north of Deaconess, the Jacobsville neighborhood is just chopped full of what is
basically one lane streets with cars parked on both sides and all day long those cars
come and go with no incident.
Mr. Pedtke: But the part I‚Äôm trying to get at, when the condition got put on to the
subdivision, it probably was realistic to expect that when the school goes there, it is
completely expected to locate there, that that Peck Road would have been part of that
improvement. It just kind of smacks of something, not right, that they did those
improvements like that and then they still come down and around on Peck Road with
the buses.
Mr. Swaim: I wonder, has there been any thought to widen Peck at all? I totally
understand the traffic velocity to get them to slow down. But I‚Äôm wondering because the
school is there now, just because of the sheer volume of traffic that is there now that
wasn‚Äôt there before.
Mr. Murphy: That has been a topic of conversation since researching this that goes all
the way back to 2006 or 2009 when an initial plat of what we developed now was a
completely different development. But that was one of the things that was brought up at
that time that Peck Road needed to be improved. And that was long before there was
any conversation of North High School or Middle School ever even being there.
Mr. Stahl: Do you know if two school buses can pass each other on that road?
Mr. Murphy: I believe they have. I‚Äôve seen concrete trucks and other delivery trucks
pass each other on that road. They are going slow. They have to. The road forces that,
which I don‚Äôt think is a bad thing. I think that is something to acknowledge and not say,
well, everything has to be a two-lane geometry of 50 foot wide with a bicycle lane and
six feet of sidewalk and three feet of easement, yeah that would be great but there is
not enough space or easement or County right-of-way to make that happen anywhere.
In addition, we have already granted right-of-way in front of all that property at no cost.

Area Plan Commission
June 13, 2013
Page 15

Mr. Mueller: Two questions. First, did you say that you already got people using the
construction entrance?
Mr. Murphy: They do. Unintended consequence, yes.
Mr. Mueller:
But the ones that aren‚Äôt, they are winding their way through the
subdivision going up and probably coming down to Peck to go through the high school
anyway. That‚Äôs a possibility I guess?
Mr. Murphy: Right. But the way the southbound exit or entrance only coming from Old
State to the high school, it‚Äôs over-engineered. You‚Äôd have to have a monster truck to
jump the curbs. Even is you came out of Peck and headed south out of my
development, you could never turn back into the high school.
Mr. Mueller: Can they do it from the north though? They can get in the high school
from the north, right?
Mr. Murphy: From Baseline Road they can, yes.
Mr. Mueller: That‚Äôs my point. You‚Äôve got people in your subdivision that, if they can‚Äôt
get through to the back, then they are out Old State, up Baseline and coming down
Peck anyway.
Mr. Murphy: Right, they do.
Mr. Mueller: The second question, I know there was some comments about 1,800
vehicles if everything was developed. The big lots that you have, you have four lots
back there. Are those currently zoned to be just R-1?
Mr. Murphy: The way that it is set up right now, and you are referring to the three
bigger ones. I think when you start looking at traditional neighborhood planning, and we
didn‚Äôt approach this as having a master plan with it, but essentially we do. We want it to
be a traditional neighborhood design with new urban principles behind it between
walking, pedestrian-friendly community.
We would like to see, and as the
neighborhood grows, either a shared green space and possibly as you come in around
that entrance, having that be like commercial, retail, a mixed use space and we are
getting a lot of positive response about that from talking to homeowners, people buying
into the community, people planning to buy into the community.
Mr. Mueller: But the current zoning on it right now?
Mr. Murphy: It‚Äôs all R-2, the entire thing is R-2, which was done to accommodate our
subdivision layout.
Mr. Pedtke: If this condition stays on there and you are not allowed to access at that
point, somebody living in the subdivision would have to go through Chadwick, then

Area Plan Commission
June 13, 2013
Page 16

through Kingston, get on Old State and they can go up and down Peck Road as much
as they want.
Mr. Murphy: Yes.
Mr. Mueller: That was my point. They still could get in there anyway. The other point,
I was out there the other day and I got lost.
Mr. Swaim: Since this email came from John Stoll saying that Peck probably needs to
be widened from North to Baseline, but I guess my question is for Jeff or Commissioner
Melcher. Has Stoll asked to widen that yet? Is that in the works at some point?
Mr. Melcher: It‚Äôs supposed to be. There is a long story on this. Basically when the
School Corporation wanted to build out there, they lobbied the Commissioners to use
the TIF funds to do Baseline and 41 and I went no. We were going to use those funds I
thought on Peck Road. Well finally, they wanted to get the permits and the other two
Commissioners decided to go ahead and let them have the permits to do that. That took
all the TIF money. So the School Corporation was told they had to at least improve the
road up to their entrance and that. That‚Äôs where that came. But there isn‚Äôt any money
in the TIF fund right now so it‚Äôs not even on our drawing board right now. But what we
did do, because we passed the resolution or something here that we should go back
and do what we said in 2006 and widen that road, at least we told Duckworth we
needed to go ahead and pave it, do what we can by putting some rock out and stuff to
make that better for the people driving up and down here because of this condition that
was put on that you agreed to at the time.
Mr. Murphy: But that was before any of the improvements that are there now was
done.
Mr. Melcher: I understand. But that was part of what you agreed to knowing that we
wouldn‚Äôt have that money for awhile.
Mr. Murphy: But I was also not aware that the improvements were going to be
asphalted, striped, rocked, and then a guard rail put on. There was never any
conversation that that‚Äôs what was going to happen.
Mr. Melcher: No, we did that because I asked Marsha and Joe if we could do that to try
to help Area Plan and show them that we are concerned about Peck Road. So we
moved it off of some other roads to put it on that road to help to do that for the school
kids anyway. So basically we tried to work with Area Plan. But until we get some more
money and that, that‚Äôs when we‚Äôll be able to do it and I think we gotta replace the
bridge. And that‚Äôs gonna cost some more money.
Mr. London: I just wanted to make sure everybody knew that the zoning on this is an
R-3, not an R-2. Just so everyone is clear.

Area Plan Commission

Ms. Stevens: Other questions?
Mr. Amsler: INAUDIBLE-MIC TURNED OFF If you look at the tires, they‚Äôre almost on
that white line. There is no way that thing can go over the gravel. INAUDIBLE That‚Äôs
not going to do it.
Ms. Stevens: But that really isn‚Äôt the question, is it?
Mr. Amsler: That was one of the things he brought up about the school buses going
side by side and passing each other.
Ms. Stevens: But either then can or they can‚Äôt. That really doesn‚Äôt have anything to do
with, do you anticipate school buses will come and go through that entrance? Is that
why that‚Äôs an issue?
Mr. Murphy: There may at some point be. Right now I have 12 houses there with six
families living there out of 131 lots. The total traffic count there was estimated at 1,800
and we are at ‚Ä¶.
Ms. Stevens: Three hundred and something.
Mr. Pedtke: I think what Stacy is saying is that the school buses can have that trouble
right now.
Mr. Murphy: I mean there are spots on Boonville-New Harmony Road that are just as
perilous right next to the Hornet‚Äôs Nest before you can get to the intersection at
Daylight. We could go all day talking about spots where buses can‚Äôt pass all over the
county. This occurs maybe 45 minutes out of the day.
Ms. Stevens: Right. And those bus drivers know.
Mr. Murphy: There were buses on there before anything was ever done to it, before
there was a school there, before there was ever Poet Square there.
Ms. Stevens: Anything else?
Mr. Colter: Yes, I got back to what I feel is probably more important to myself and to
the community is that we address the health, safety and welfare of all parties
concerned. Yes, I‚Äôve traveled a lot of roads in the County where it‚Äôs tight. BoonvilleNew Harmony is a perfect example, winding and narrow in certain spots. But to
continue to compound that to me is not acceptable. I sit out there and watch the traffic
and drove it several times. Yes, it‚Äôs been widened to accept additional traffic load. But
it‚Äôs just not adequate to me. And I agree with the County Engineer on that condition. I
can also appreciate where a developer is coming from wanting to provide for new
residents and whatever and the County is growing. It‚Äôs ironic that we have been talking
about this for years after years. I come from an environment where impact fees

Area Plan Commission
June 13, 2013
Page 18

addressed this problem as developers get properties, develop them, expand them,
whatever else. That addressed the infrastructure impact. So again I go back to the
health, safety and welfare issue.
Mr. Pedtke: A TIF fee is going to fund it way faster than impact fees are going to be
and that‚Äôs still not working in this situation.
Mr. Murphy: I think there was money in the TIF. It just got put somewhere else. If we
really want to talk about where TIF money goes, if that‚Äôs going to become a
conversation, ‚Ä¶
Mr. Pedtke: It‚Äôs not just this one issue. My point is that we have had several issues
where the orchard was and got rezoned before it was the orchard. It was a requirement
to do something where that S curve is, donate land so it could be straightened out. To
my knowledge it hasn‚Äôt been done. There have been lots of places where we have
made it a requirement of somebody to do something or turned it down and then the
government side doesn‚Äôt come through for it. It‚Äôs just frustrating. I think it‚Äôs got to be
double for us waiting for the Commissioners who end up with a TIF that‚Äôs not
funding‚Ä¶..
Ms. Stevens: Are there any other questions directly for the petitioner?
Mr. Pedtke: Is there any way to encourage more discussion on expediting the
improvement of Peck Road? Would 30 days of discussions help, at least know where
we stand with funding such improvements?
Ms. Stevens: I think that‚Äôs why Mr. Swaim asked Mr. Melcher kind of where things are.
Will that help move it up on the time line any faster?
Mr. Melcher: If you read John Stoll‚Äôs report, it does say it‚Äôd take about five years which
I didn‚Äôt think it‚Äôd take that long but that‚Äôs what he said. He is our engineer. But I don‚Äôt
know. And the TIF funds went to Baseline Road and 41 for the School Corporation.
The County paid for that. They shouldn‚Äôt of but they did.
Mr. Murphy: And a forced sewer project?
Mr. Melcher: I don‚Äôt know about the sewer project.
Mr. Murphy: You didn‚Äôt vote for a forced sewer project on the north side just south of
the interstate?
Mr. Melcher: Well that would probably through the Water Department or something.
Mr. Murphy: I believe it was through the County Engineer‚Äôs office. But it will get turned
over to the Water Department.

Area Plan Commission
June 13, 2013
Page 19

Mr. Melcher: It could be as far as that being planned. But that is not me.
Mr. Pedtke: It was just an opportunity for more discussion if we continue till next month
to give a chance to discuss it and find out where things are better. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs
a possibility or not.
Mr. Melcher: No, but what I can do. I can bring it up to the Commissioners. I know
there is one Commissioner against it already because of the ditches. That‚Äôs gonna cost
money if we‚Äôre gonna pipe them. They are worried somebody‚Äôs gonna go off the side of
the road into the ditch. So the only thing I can do is bring it up at our next
Commissioner meeting which is Tuesday and maybe get John Stoll to get a better
estimate on how much money we got in the TIF and how money it would cost to do that
and we might be able to get a better time line than five years. That‚Äôs about the best I
can do.
Ms. Stevens: Are you amenable to that?
Mr. Melcher: Sure.
Mr. Mueller: One of the other questions I have is, regardless of whether this goes
through or not, we still have an issue of school buses and it seems to me like the School
Board should be addressed on why are the buses running down this road to begin with?
Seems to me there ought to be three buses a day each way, grade, middle and high
school, to pick up whatever kids are on there. And if this road is that bad, the buses
ought to be going through North High School the way it was designed. One of the
problems I have is we are focused on this whole issue of these buses going down this
road that maybe shouldn‚Äôt be on there to begin with. Extend the conversation for 30
days, one of my questions would be, is there any way the School Board could be
convinced to keep the buses off this road and use a wider road into the entrance of
North High School.
Mr. Pedtke: The developer gets told all the time to try to make a turn around within
your subdivision, a loop, so they can get off the busy street, pick up or drop off the kids
and not be on a busy street. Here we‚Äôve got a couple subdivisions that did exactly that.
Mr. Murphy: If the issue is the ditches and everything now, if you drive that and start
where I started that video, go from a runway to that unimproved area of Peck, what is
that doing to the speeds down through there? Like Mr. Mueller brought up before,
whether or not they come out of my access that is already existing and is a constructing
entrance, they are still driving up and down the road.
Mr. Colter: Mr. Murphy, which direction would you project your residents would use
when they exit onto Peck? North to Baseline or south? I ask that as the Commissioners
may look at funding, what would happen if the widening was continued going north
incrementally until you can reach the entrance that he is proposing?

Area Plan Commission
June 13, 2013
Page 20

Mr. Murphy: I‚Äôm sure the majority of the people would probably take the better road but
I can‚Äôt predict which way traffic will go. It seems like the majority of the people head
south towards Old State. But that‚Äôs not when school is in session. When school is in
session, they go towards Baseline because that‚Äôs the only way they can access the
North High and Middle Schools.
Dr. Adams: I guess I‚Äôm a little confused here. We have a bunch of adults who own this
land and the TIF amount is going to increase if people sell this area. We haven‚Äôt got a
bunch of hot rod kids coming out of this thing. I don‚Äôt see the problem. I think this is the
most direct way to get on a road that is acceptable by everyone as a place to drive. I
personally am in favor of this thing. That‚Äôs just my opinion.
Ms. Stevens: Thank you. What is the pleasure of this Commission?
Mr. Pedtke: The reason why I brought up the 30 days, I didn‚Äôt know if there was a
penalty if we voted it down. Is he not allowed to apply again? Or can he apply right
away?
Mr. Stahl: It‚Äôs not the same as zoning.
Ms. Stevens: That‚Äôs a good question. With that in mind, ‚Ä¶
Mr. Murphy: I think to echo Mr. Adams, and that goes back to something that Mr.
Jeffers said when he was here when we first started this process. If you want to build a
TIF, the residential has to be there. If the residential is not there then the Schnucks
doesn‚Äôt get built down the street because they are going to check and see wherever
they can draw the vehicles that come through their store. If they don‚Äôt get that number,
they don‚Äôt build. The residential draws the commercial. Without the commercial, you
don‚Äôt get the strip center, the local this and that. It‚Äôs just the way it works. So you don‚Äôt
get one without the other. It‚Äôs all interconnected in that sense.
Ms. Lowe: We are known as a city where it is hard to do business and people don‚Äôt
really feel encouraged to come here and do business because of the obstacles and
here we are with a business that is trying to succeed and we are standing in its way.
Ms. Stevens: Would you like to make a motion for approval?
Ms. Lowe: Alright, I move approval.
Ms. Stevens: We have a motion and second. Call the roll.
Mr. Pedtke: (During roll call.) I think it‚Äôs not going to be less safe. I think the traffic can
come from the same subdivision, drive up and down Peck Road. I agree with Dr. Adams
and I vote yes.

****** MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG'S REMARKS AS PREPARED FOR THE 2017 STATE OF THE
CITY ADDRESS ******

¬ 
Mayor Pete Buttigieg's Remarks as Prepared for the 2017 State of the City
Address
Thank you Principal Bayingana, Dr. Spells, Imam Sirajuddin, Council President
Scott, and thank you to the Riley High School Jazz Band for that great
performance.
It is a pleasure to be here at one of the great high schools in the South Bend
Community Schools system, and I am thankful for the many good things taking
place in our public schools. From John Adams High School, whose Mock Trial team
again won state and is headed to national competition this May, to Washington
High School where I joined the League of Women Voters last week to talk with
students about voting and civic involvement; from Clay High School which just
put on a terrific performance of a play tackling tough issues to right here at
Riley where two students were honored by the state Chamber of Commerce for
their work with the Bowman Creek Educational Ecosystem; there is a lot going on
in our schools to make us proud.
I want to thank and acknowledge our City Clerk, Kareemah Fowler, our Common
Council members, and all officials and dignitaries attending this evening. And
I want to thank everyone who has joined us tonight for taking time to hear
about just some of the significant developments in the life of our community.
As you probably know, I spent a large portion of the first two months of this
year campaigning for a national leadership position in the Democratic Party.
Many people lately have paid me the nuanced compliment of sharing that they are
glad that I was not elected, so that I could remain here and continue to serve
South Bend. And having had mixed emotions about the prospect of leaving this
job for that one, I feel much the same way. Though I entered that competition
with every intention of wining, now that it is over, I am wholeheartedly
delighted about the chance to continue my second term as mayor.
Every intense experience brings the gift of perspective, and that was certainly
true of the weeks I spent traveling the country, interacting with leaders from
every state in the union. In reflecting on the experience, the biggest thing I
drew from it is a deepening of my convictions about problem-solving at the
local level.
It used to be the case that local government was regarded as a kind of minor
league, with more serious and sophisticated work taking place at the state and
federal level. But the more opportunities I have had to witness how our
national policymaking works, the more convinced I am that political salvation
for our country will come from the local.
It is in cities and towns across America that the most sensitive and important
issues actually play out, from police-community relations to the development of
our infrastructure. In telling South Bend‚Äôs story across the United States, I
had endless reminders of how our work, here in this community on a daily basis,
touches every issue of importance to how people live.
Today, South Bend is on a roll. After a long and challenging transformation, we
are now seeing the strongest growth in a generation when it comes to jobs,
population, and prosperity. We are now more than halfway through what will
certainly go down in history as South Bend‚Äôs turnaround decade, and the best
is yet to come.
Tonight I would like to share some of the most important progress, and suggest
what it will take to rise to the challenges and opportunities ahead. Today all
of us who serve the City, from the newest hourly employee to the mayor, can
draw energy from the importance of our mission: to deliver services that
empower everyone to thrive.
There are three lines of effort that allow us to meet that mission. We make the
basics of life easy by providing for the essentials. We invest in people and
places so that our city is a truly great place to live, work, and visit. And we
offer good government so that the very way we do business embodies the values
that guide us in our daily work: the values of excellence, accountability,
inclusion, innovation, and empowerment.
In service of this mission, we have begun redesigning our budget from the
ground up, using a priority-based framework to make decisions based not on how
we‚Äôve always done things, but on what our residents consider most important.
After a thorough process of collecting internal and external input, last year
the team established six priorities for South Bend: a safe community for
everyone; robust, well-planned infrastructure; a strong, inclusive economy;
thriving public spaces and culture; vibrant, welcoming neighborhoods; and
residents empowered with education, mobility, and technology. Alongside these
community goals, we laid out the necessary internal priorities to ensure that
residents can always count on a well-governed and well administered city.
From now on, our major decisions will be organized around these goals‚Äîthe
central priorities that drive all of our administration‚Äôs work‚Äîand
tonight‚Äôs remarks will be organized around them too.
Safe community for everyone
In operating a government just as in operating a vehicle, safety comes first.
For a family, a country, or a city, all the things we do depend first on our
being able to take safety for granted. This is one reason government exists in
the first place, and we recognize it as our most fundamental obligation.
When it comes to crime and police, we are determined to continue the approaches
that help to explain why South Bend is one of the urban areas in our region
that did not see a sharp increase in gun violence last year. In fact, victims
of criminally assaulted shootings fell from 85 to 81, and the number of fatal
shootings fell significantly from 16 to 11. While homicides went up 14%
nationally in one year, they went down here in South Bend. We believe this is
partly due to the Group Violence Intervention, a partnership that involves
local and federal law enforcement and prosecutors, social services, and
community leaders.
The work of police has never been more important, more sensitive, or more
scrutinized. In our community, we know that it is not only possible but
necessary to be strongly supportive of our men and women in uniform, and
strongly supportive of fairness and racial justice. We are not immune to the
tension that exists in many communities around America between police
departments and some of the neighborhoods they protect, but we have the benefit
of deep relationships between our neighborhoods, activists, and our law
enforcement family.
In the mayor‚Äôs office, we routinely monitor the number of cases that lead to
the use of force, and the number of complaints about officers. Last year the
number of complaints filed and sustained, as well as the overall number of uses
of force, all went down, as did the number of citizen complaints. In the
interest of transparency around these issues, last year South Bend joined
President Obama‚Äôs national Police Data Initiative to ensure the public can
access this information. We have placed information concerning complaints and
training on the city‚Äôs Open Data Portal, and next month we will begin
publishing data on use-of-force incidents as well.
Complaints about the conduct of officers are rare, but they are taken very
seriously, and I want to be sure residents understand how discipline is
handled. The final decisions around major cases of officer discipline are made
by a panel of five appointed citizens who are racially diverse, highly
respected in the community, and have an important and sometimes thankless task.
The Board of Public Safety is one example of a ‚Äúcitizen review board,‚Äù and
there are many different forms of citizen review board around the country.
Among the different models of citizen review board, our version is among the
most powerful, since it makes decisions, not just recommendations. We support
and thank them for their important work.
For every high profile case that reaches the Board of Safety, there are
countless stories of model community policing that best demonstrate our values.
Our police athletic league, which joins officers with local youth to provide
mentorship through sports, has over six hundred participants. Patrol shifts
competed for the ‚Äúflatfoot‚Äù award to see who could perform the most walking
patrols. And in cases ranging from the lifesaving rescue of a severely injured
8 year old boy, to the apprehension of the so-called ‚Äúpillowcase burglar‚Äù
in partnership with other area departments, to making sure all of the
presidential candidate visits went smoothly last Spring, our officers continue
to do extremely important work, mostly out of the spotlight.
So we can have the best possible Department, we have undertaken a number of
reforms, including streamlining the organization chart and a new emphasis on
training. Our newly negotiated four-year contract makes us one of the most
competitively paid departments in the region. But we do face severe challenges
in manpower after a number of retirements and departures. Force strength is
down to 227, a number that is simply not sufficient, and so growing the force
must be a major priority in the coming year. At the same time, this represents
an opportunity to shape the force with new members, new experiences and new
talent. We want anyone who has ever considered a career in law enforcement to
know: South Bend is hiring, and we want the best.
We are also partnering with Mishawaka and the County to deliver a next-
generation 911 center that brings area agencies onto the same system. Dispatch
center employees are now all working side-by-side in a new facility, and we are
in the process of moving toward full integration by this summer. The process
has been challenging but I have appreciated the cooperation of various agencies
to ensure safety and cost-effectiveness.
Meanwhile, our Fire Department reached a major milestone this year when the
Insurance Services Office rated us as a Level 2 Fire Department. This makes us
one of the top fire agencies in the state and places us in the top 2 percent
nationally. The Fire Department has also worked hard to boost recruiting from
inclusive sources of applicants, attracting the highest level of minority and
female applicants ever, while maintaining the highest standards for our hiring
process.
To ensure our residents have the benefit of excellent fire facilities, the City
has begun the process to replace Fire Station 4, located on Olive Street, and
Fire Station 9, located in a historic River Park building and unsuitable for
modern equipment. After a great deal of community listening and creative
problem-solving by Fire Department leadership, I was pleased to announce last
week that we have found an excellent location which does not require
encroachment on any park space.
Many things that affect safety that are beyond the reach of our police and fire
departments. One example is the threat to health from lead paint present in
some older homes, particularly in low-income neighborhoods in our city. In
order to address this, we have been working closely with the County Board of
Health.
In December, City and County officials were made aware that certain areas of
South Bend had unusually high percentages of children who tested with elevated
blood-lead levels between 2005 and 2015. While this is a long-standing issue,
the recent statistics prompted a very healthy increase in visibility. To better
support County efforts, the City has increased funding for lead abatement
through the South Bend Housing Improvement Program grant, pledged $100,000 in
matching funds for the PHA HUD lead abatement grant, and is exploring
possibilities for local legislation that would lead to the testing of homes
prior to sale or rental.
We are working to get the word out that parents cannot simply assume that your
doctor is testing your children for lead. Testing is free for those on
Medicaid, and free at the St Joseph County Health Department for all children
under 7 and all pregnant women. Residents can also request a free environmental
risk assessment from the County Health Department. I want to stress that these
test results are not related to our water supply, which meets or exceeds all
environmental standards.
This issue is a reminder of our responsibility as an administration to support
public health. While the City has no specific officer, staff, or funding for
health, we will continue to actively support other health authorities in
ensuring we live in a safe environment, especially for children. Our city also
took a step in the direction of better health when smoking in our bars and
restaurants came to an end this year, and it is a pleasure to see these
business establishments thrive with clean air.
On another safety and health matter, I would like to take this opportunity to
thank the working group established by my office to help address the issue of
homelessness. The group, which includes representatives from social service
agencies, businesses, city and county government, and residents, is working to
develop a strategic plan for addressing chronic homelessness in South Bend.¬ 
Their recommendations will be delivered, after extensive community engagement,
by July of this year.
In addition, our ability to tackle some of the toughest cases of homelessness
will take a major step forward later this year as the FUSE project, a
collaboration with South Bend Heritage, opens this fall, with 32 units of
permanent supportive housing for homeless individuals.
And the City, in partnership with the regional Continuum of Care, has also
entered the national Mayor‚Äôs Challenge to End Veteran Homelessness last
November, and will continue with this effort until we are able to say that no
person who served our nation in uniform will go without access to shelter.
Unfortunately, many members of our community have come to feel particularly
unsafe or vulnerable as a consequence of the current national political climate
and uncertainty over federal immigration policy. This is one reason I am glad
we are leading the way in our state with the creation of the South Bend
Municipal ID Card. This card allows anyone who can prove who they are to
identify themselves for purposes ranging from routine retail transactions to
interactions with law enforcement, making all of us safer. Best of all, it lets
anyone say they are a card-carrying resident of our city.
Here at the local level, we can combat the climate of increasing fear and
anxiety among residents who live peacefully and work in our community. We want
to make sure that all who live here understand that this is a city that
supports everyone who is here to contribute to our community positively,
regardless of national origin or religion, and I want to emphasize that our law
enforcement officers are not responsible for federal immigration enforcement,
but for keeping the people who live here safe. All of us.\
¬ 
On a foundation of safety rests our second major priority: robust and well-
planned infrastructure.
When people think of infrastructure, they often speak of trains, planes, and
bridges. But much of our vital infrastructure is completely out of sight. Some
have argued that the most important invention ever, besides the wheel, is
sanitation, and if you ever doubt the importance of the humble sewer, consider
what life would be like without it.
Our sewer and wastewater planning continues to be affected by the federal
requirement that we manage our combined sewer overflow, or CSO. The good news
is that fresh analysis has shown that we can deliver the required environmental
improvements for hundreds of millions of dollars less than expected in the
original 2011 agreement‚Äîif the federal government allows us to update the
plan. It is too soon to know how the new federal administration will address
these negotiations, but we will work hard to arrive at a cost-effective answer
that still meets our legal and moral obligations to ensure clean water in our
area.
Meanwhile, it is imperative that we act to provide adequate drinking water
infrastructure for immediate needs and the longer term. Our Utilities team has
done extraordinary work making older pipes and equipment function safely and
effectively, but this cannot continue without new investment. Our public works
team has identified over $88 million in capital needs, which has prompted us to
prepare an adjustment to South Bend‚Äôs unusually low water rates.
After a year of public discussion on this topic, last night, the South Bend
Common Council acted to take this important step. The Council approved a rate
increase that will raise $22.5 Million over 5 years which can be used for
fixing broken down pumps, rehabilitating non-functioning wells, and replacing
broken water mains, valves, and fire hydrants. Supplemented with TIF funding,
this will meet the most urgent and critical of our water infrastructure
needs‚Äîand even after the increase, our water rates will be lower than most
comparable Indiana cities. I thank the Council for taking seriously our shared
responsibility to provide clean, safe drinking water.
Back above ground, we are working to ensure that roads are in good condition
despite increasingly tight funds. At the current level of funding, we are able
to pave every lane-mile of street in the city roughly every one hundred years.
That‚Äôs not good enough, which is why we are closely following House Bill
1002, a road funding bill in the state house to better enable us to fund our
neighborhood roads and streets. After 14 years without any adjustment to the
gas tax, this could deliver needed funds that we can use immediately for
paving, pothole repair, and other vital projects. The legislature is also
considering a measure to index the gas tax to inflation, a common-sense move
that would prevent future funding from getting caught up in politics. I have
crossed party lines to support this Republican-sponsored House bill, and we
hope that it will pass before the session ends in April.
In addition, we are working with TRANSPO to support their efforts to deliver
great transit to the community. Last year, the first city-funded bus shelters
were installed on the West Side along Lincoln Way and Western Avenue, with more
planned for 2017. We are also working with the TRANSPO team to use new
technology for evaluating route adjustments to better connect residents to
jobs, and providing real time information to riders on bus activity in the
network.
Speaking of transportation, we have been presented with a truly game-changing
opportunity with the potential for a faster South Shore Line connection to
Chicago. With double-tracking improvements and a relocation of the train‚Äôs
path to the airport, the vision of a one-and-a-half hour train trip to downtown
Chicago is truly within reach. We are in close contact with South Shore
management to develop a regional partnership with the state that could raise
the necessary funds. South Bend will have to do its part. If we can achieve a
90-minute train ride from here to Chicago, every single neighborhood in our
city will benefit. The potential for increased jobs and population is
tremendous.
Strong Inclusive Economy
Of course, the infrastructure work getting the most attention of all is the
ongoing Smart Streets effort, which brings me to the third major City priority:
a strong, inclusive economy. Smart Streets is as much about economic
development as it is about streets.
The bulk of the road work is now complete, and contractors have until June 1st
to complete all signal and streetscape work. A year ago in this address, I
warned that there would be disruption and, perhaps, a level of grumpiness as
daily commutes were affected by the construction. But the decision to do in one
year what would ordinarily take two or three has paid off, tearing off the
band-aid and ensuring that most of the construction-related inconvenience is
already behind us. I am thankful to the public for their patience during the
heavy construction phase.
While this initiative enjoyed strong support from the downtown business
community and the common council, I am aware that its overall popularity is‚Ä¶
mixed. So I would like to take this opportunity to briefly revisit the reasons
why we undertook this project.
America‚Äôs best downtowns are not bypasses or through-ways, but destinations.
Ensuring complete streets‚Äîwhich means streets with two-way traffic and ample
room for pedestrians and bicyclists‚Äîleads to a more vibrant city because
people are more inclined to spend time on a pedestrian-friendly sidewalk than a
narrow path along a four-lane, one-way highway that serves to evacuate vehicles
from our city at top speed.
We are already seeing many of the economic benefits. For example, the
renovation of the Chase Tower, the restoration of the LaSalle Hotel, the
conversion of the JMS building, the renewed fa√ßade at Main Street Row, and the
new hotel at the former College Football Hall of Fame, are all projects
involving major private investment‚Äîover $63 million total‚Äîfrom investors
who have each publicly said that the Smart Streets project was an important
factor in their decision to invest here.
The project also gained national attention, including the Mayor‚Äôs Challenge
Success award from U.S. Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx, which we
accepted on the city‚Äôs behalf at a ceremony in Washington‚Äîthe first time in
recent memory that our City has been directly recognized by a U.S. Cabinet
Secretary.
By design, traffic calming does mean that vehicles move more slowly in the
central business district. Then again, we live in a city where you can traverse
the entire central business district in five minutes or less. Right now,
according to Google data, you can drive from here at Riley High School on the
South Side to Memorial Hospital on the north end of Downtown, in 13 minutes, up
to 15 minutes in rush hour. It used to be more like 11 or 12 minutes. As the
cost of having a truly great downtown, we can afford those two or three
minutes.
Bringing a new streetscape to the heart of our city has not been simple, with
many issues coming up including a forgotten underground vault in the project
area, and issues with entry to the Colfax Parking Garage during highly attended
shows at the Morris Theater. But we are working through these and believe that
by the time we celebrate completion of the project, very few people will be
able to honestly say they would rather go back to the old way.
The timing of this project helps us capitalize on a major economic resurgence.
Overall, our city has seen 4,499 net new jobs since this administration began
in 2012, with the unemployment rate cut by more than half even as labor force
participation increased by over one thousand in the same period. This
administration has sought from day one to establish that South Bend is open for
business. That‚Äôs why we have simplified and streamlined processes, and
supported growth in every part of the city. From industrial developments near
the airport, to hundreds of new residential units downtown, to the opportunity
for a full-service grocery on the East Bank, since the beginning of last year
the Department of Community Investment has supported over $261 million in
private investment representing up to 651 associated jobs. All this with $34
million in public investment, or about 7 private dollars for every 1 taxpayer
dollar of support.
And there is much more where that came from: with manufacturing facilities in
the Adams Road area, the Marriott Hotel under construction on the former Hall
of Fame site, The Ivy at Berlin Place to open by next year‚Äôs opening day for
the South Bend Cubs, phase two of Innovation Park and Eddy Street, and more, we
can expect the months and years ahead to be filled with more celebrations,
ribbon-cuttings, and most importantly: new jobs.
When it comes to growing the economy, cities can no longer think, in blinkered
terms, only about what happens within their own borders. In a connected and
globalized economy, that mentality is ultimately self-defeating. We need to
understand that our region shares a common economic fate, and this is the
insight of the state‚Äôs Regional Cities program, which compelled us to come
together with other counties and cities in our region. The result was our
region winning a $42 million competitive grant from the State of Indiana, which
we are using for efforts ranging from the Riverfront Parks and Trails to the
reinvention of the Studebaker assembly building.
Still, we recognize that no matter how good the total job counts or the topline
numbers, an economy is not truly strong if it is not truly inclusive. Societies
that experience great inequality perform more poorly than those that are
economically and racially integrated, and we must pay close attention to
inclusion if South Bend is to truly consolidate her comeback. Parts of our
community experience concentrations of generational poverty, and that not
everyone has benefited from or had access to the economic growth around us.
This is one reason we have sought to lead by example when it comes to making
sure there is adequate pay for all in our community. State law prevents cities
in Indiana from establishing any community minimum wage, but the City of South
Bend acted in last year‚Äôs budget to increase the minimum wage paid to City
employees to $10.10, one year ahead of schedule. We urge other employers in our
area to look at wages and join us in this, knowing that economic evidence shows
a stronger economy whenever we do this as a society, and knowing that doing so
will make South Bend a community of choice. We also decided to voluntarily
implement new overtime rules put forth by the Department of Labor even though a
court prevented them from becoming mandatory. In the years to come we will
continue to seek ways to lead by example and do right by workers, evaluating
leave and family policies to ensure we model the kind of economic participation
we would like to see across the region.
We also work to ensure development takes place across neighborhood and
geographic boundaries. That‚Äôs why we are thrilled to see more industrial
development taking place on the West Side. And it‚Äôs why in addition to paving
the way for a future downtown full-service grocery, I was pleased to be present
for the opening last week of a new Martin‚Äôs location on Western Avenue,
building on improvements to streetscapes and parks facilities on the city‚Äôs
West Side. The West Side, and every side, of our city deserves great places to
shop, work, and play, and we will continue to work to make sure that happens.
We must also confront that a legacy of racial injustice continues to result in
inequality across our country, with South Bend no exception. In our community,
racial minorities face poverty rates up to 33 percent. Equality of opportunity
is one reason we became involved with the White House‚Äôs My Brother‚Äôs Keeper
program, an initiative to ensure equality of opportunity for all, including
young men and boys of color. Driven by a community coalition and anchored at
Memorial Hospital, this initiative has three central goals for our young
people: getting a healthy start and entering school ready to learn; keeping
kids on track and offering second chances; and successfully entering the
workforce. We will closely track infant mortality rates, third grade reading
scores, juvenile arrest rates, labor force participation, and disparities in
the unemployment rate to ensure we are making progress toward these goals.
In keeping with the desire to practice what we preach, we are working as a city
to deepen our commitment to working with small businesses as part of our city
Diversity and Inclusion plan, so that being newer, smaller, or owned by a
historically disadvantaged group is no barrier to doing business with the city.
We are partnering with the Latin American Chamber of Commerce to offer small
business support through seminars on how to build small businesses and compete
for contracts, and we will be in contact with the Council about refinements to
our city‚Äôs diversity utilization policy.
We also continue to work to compete for new residents, especially veterans, who
can benefit from the Vets Community Connections program. Staffed by volunteers
and routed through 311, this initiative lets veterans and military families get
key information about how to settle into our community, and we are always
looking for more volunteers who want to take part‚Äîjust call 311.
We continue to work with area employers and labor organizations on Workforce
Development, ensuring that the economic ladder is available to everyone and
that our employers will have access to a superb workforce in order to grow and
succeed here. Through our Pathways partnership with WorkOne, the city has
directed nearly half a million dollars to train workers in some of our most
important industries - healthcare, building trades and manufacturing - and has
placed over 100 local residents into employment.
Thriving Public Spaces and Culture
Wealth alone does not make a City great, nor can a great economy develop in a
city with no distinctive cultural or recreational life. That‚Äôs why another
stated goal is to ensure Thriving Public Spaces and Culture.
In this address one year ago, I promised that we would develop a new way to
manage quality of place, and a year later we are pleased by the successful
establishment of a new department in the City of South Bend: the Department of
Venues, Parks, and Arts. Bringing under one roof the formerly separate teams
from parks and recreation, Morris and the Palais, Century Center, management of
DTSB, and our involvement in arts and cultural activity, we are closer to
unlocking the full potential of a community that already punches above its
weight class when it comes to cultural and recreational life.
The City now has entirely new categories of parks facilities, from South
Bend‚Äôs first dog park on Niles Avenue to the Aerial Adventure Park at Rum
Village. And the new department has set to work immediately using the resources
provided by the Parks Bond to enhance public space everywhere. I want to again
thank the Common Council for supporting this bond, which has enabled a number
of recent improvements. For the first time, we have an air-conditioned
gymnasium at the Martin Luther King, Jr., recreation center. New basketball
courts and pavilions have been installed at Fremont, Kelly Park &amp; Kennedy
Parks on the West Side, while an expanded parking lot will serve Potawatomi
Park on the east side. Needed roof replacements came to Pinhook Pavilion in the
Northwest, and Rum Village Nature Center on the Southwest side. And we have
been able to address dozens of deferred maintenance needs on playgrounds,
restrooms, picnic areas, and public spaces. And as soon as testing confirms the
site is in good condition, we plan this year to begin construction on a $4
million renovation and expansion of the Charles Black Center which, after
temporary closures for construction, will be a truly outstanding facility for a
generation to come.
Soon we will be embarking on an ambitious program of enhancements to the
Riverfront Parks and Trails, aware that the river that gives our city her name
is also one of the most important treasures we possess. The improvements will
include a replacement and upgrade of Howard Park Recreation Center, a new
combination ice skating facility and splash plaza in Howard Park, and upgrades
throughout the riverfront trail system to improve safety, accessibility,
ecological integrity and connectivity. Much of the funding for this vision is
already in hand, but our community will need to come together to find the
resources to make the most ambitious elements of this vision into a reality.
Meanwhile, we are partnering with the University of Notre Dame to use the power
of our river in new ways. A hydroelectric turbine will be installed beneath
Seitz Park to power an estimated 10% of the university‚Äôs electrical needs.
Beginning this October, Seitz Park will be offline for an 18-month construction
project. We thank the public for its patience, which will be rewarded upon
completion when a $1 million commitment from the University will support a
newly redesigned Seitz Park while the turbine demonstrates this region‚Äôs
commitment to sustainability.¬ ¬ 
We are also making sure that our public spaces reflect our values and our
heritage. That‚Äôs why I was pleased, after an abundance of community input and
deliberation by a citizen committee, to unveil the new Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr. Boulevard, renaming one of our most prominent downtown streets after one of
America‚Äôs great leaders whose message is as resonant and timely today as
ever. This also created the opportunity to rename the former Martin Luther King
Jr. Drive for one of our own moral lights, Charles Martin Sr., whose mentorship
and support for youth in our community lifted up generations of South Bend
residents.
And later this year, Leighton Plaza on Main Street will feature a distinctive
new piece of public art: a life-size statue commemorating the historic occasion
when Notre Dame‚Äôs President, Father Ted Hesburgh, stood arm in arm with Dr.
King calling for justice at Soldier Field in 1964. The statue will invite
passersby to join their hands with these two leaders, symbolically
participating in the ongoing struggle for justice and equality.
This year will bring great developments not only in our physical spaces but in
special events as well. The Venues, Parks, and Arts team is currently hard at
work on a new event which we are calling the Best Week Ever.
The Best Week Ever will be a week-long celebration of our Culture, Creativity
&amp; Progress filled with 2-3 signature events each day. It begins Memorial
Day, May 29 and will carry through the following weekend, June 4. Each
signature event‚Äîincluding the West Side Memorial Day Parade, Meet Me on the
Island, Sunburst Races and a special 90s Concert at Four Winds Field‚Äîwill be
peppered with unique experiences created by local businesses, neighborhood
associations, churches and more. We encourage anyone who envisions something
special for the Best Week Ever to visit Bestweekever2017.com for more on how to
participate and get involved.
A great city not only has great shared spaces and activities, but also makes
sure the most immediate areas around us‚Äîthe neighborhoods where we live‚Äîare
vibrant and welcoming, and this is our fifth major priority in the budget.
With strong efforts from the Code Enforcement department and leadership from
the Common Council, we have worked to tear down the barriers to safety and
comfort in every neighborhood. Our Code Enforcement Department is seeing
increased effectiveness and compliance. We also continue to benefit from the
chronic nuisance policy established in 2013‚Äîa successful policy now in danger
due to state legislation that threatens to block cities from enacting these
common-sense neighborhood policies. It is the latest example of state pre-
emption of local government, and we hope that the legislature will return to
the bipartisan principle of local control.
This was also the first year for landlord registration, a policy to ensure that
the city can contact the owners of properties when issues arise. Already we
have had nearly 4,000 properties registered by over 800 owners, and are working
to refine the system for collecting this data.
Of course, the most positive energy in our neighborhoods comes from within the
neighborhoods themselves. Whether it‚Äôs the Local Cup, a pay-it-forward coffee
shop in the NNN, or West Side Wednesdays, which delivered a free family
festival on Western Avenue in December as well as help with future events
coming this summer, we see residents coming together with pride to enhance the
neighborhoods around them.
Right here by Riley High School, the Bowman Creek Restoration Project continues
to harness the talent from local colleges and universities and use it to
empower neighbors in a previously neglected area. Students and volunteers
helped build 9 rain gardens, worked on smart sensors for monitoring the gardens
and creek, and took on other activities to remediate the area.
This year we will be undertaking a thorough review of our neighborhood policies
to ensure they is up to date for the opportunities and challenges ahead. This
includes continuing to find productive uses for vacant lots where collapsing
houses were removed as part of the 1000 Houses in 1,000 Days effort, engaging
more closely with the South Bend Housing Authority, working with the
Neighborhood Resources Council to support neighborhoods, and ensuring that we
have a shared community vision about the role of planning. We must move forward
with plans that are both feasible and ambitious, making sure we are faithful to
the intention of our plans but never allowing ourselves to be trapped by them,
never permitting the perfect to be the enemy of the good.
The sixth of our six major goals is to ensure all residents are empowered with
education, mobility, and technology. We need to look beyond the traditional,
direct, and obvious responsibilities of city government to ensure we are doing
all we can to make sure residents have what they need to thrive.
There is no better example of this than education. The City needs to be an
active partner with the schools in our community, and especially with the South
Bend Community School Corporation. That‚Äôs why we are in communications now
about a new model for framing and formalizing that cooperation: a Schools
Compact that will formalize the commitment of the City and the School
Corporation to support one another in key areas. Our intention is to organize
cooperation around four central components of the educational ecosystem in
South Bend: empowered students, strong schools, career-ready graduates, and an
engaged community.
We will work together with the School Corporation to make sure that students
have the economic and social resources that empower them to succeed in school;
to strengthen our schools with diverse, talented educators and safe
infrastructure; to set rigorous standards and develop new partnerships for
ensuring students graduate on time and prepared for success in careers or
college; and to engage our community in the growth and progress of South Bend
students. I have been in preliminary conversations with our Superintendent, Dr.
Spells, and interested board members, and we hope to present language to the
School Board and the Common Council for consideration before the end of the
year.
Our commitment to youth also inspired the South Bend Youth Task Force, which
selects and empowers a diverse group of students from all schools in our area
to discuss and solve problems that matter to them. They have chosen to sink
their teeth into some of the most challenging issues in our community‚Äîlike
violence among youth‚Äîand sponsor town halls and dialogues in schools and in
the community to help address them. These young people make me proud and give
us great hope for the future leadership of our city.
In addition, we must pay close attention to ensuring children arrive in school
with a good foundation to begin with. The current version of the Indiana
legislature's pre-Kindergarten bill acknowledges that this is an important area
but does not provide the funds for a dramatic change in availability.
Sustainable funded pre-K is good economic sense. It allows more parents to
enter the workforce and is a well-researched investment in the health and
success of children. And so we will not only advocate for more statewide
activity in early childhood, but will continue to explore strategies to make
high-quality pre-K available to every child in South Bend.
Like education, the ability to physically move around our city is one thing
that can make or break a resident‚Äôs ability to thrive. This is one reason why
we have embraced a policy of complete streets in the City, so that those who
rely on bicycles and pedestrian mobility can better take advantage of city
life. Since low-income and minority Americans are more likely to bike for
transport and walk or bike to school, this is also a matter of equity. Being
pedestrian and bike-friendly is important to all of us, and we are now actively
exploring the implementation of a bike share system to enhance transportation
choices in partnership with MACOG.
When it comes to technology as a way to empower residents, we are a city that
recognizes the relationship between technology and equity. To address the
digital divide, we have expanded on downtown Wifi with free connectivity now
available at the Martin Luther King and Charles Black recreation centers,
helping connect over 2,500 users in 2016. Meanwhile, the private South Bend
Code School has done remarkable work in locations ranging from the Robinson
Community Learning Center to the Juvenile Justice Center. Students from 11 to
16 years of age have built over 100 websites and created 24 civic apps aimed at
improving their community.
Meanwhile, our Innovation team has been working with Notre Dame‚Äôs Wireless
Institute to ¬ pursue a major grant from the National Science Foundation to use
our city as a pioneering test bed‚Äîa living laboratory‚Äîfor the latest
wireless technology, creating new economic strength in our city and region.
All of these gains are enabled by the way we do business as an administration,
guided by internal principles that add up to a well-governed and administered
city. We strive to be a great employer with great employees, making sure not
just our compensation but our workplace climate make us an employer of choice.
We cultivate enduring financial strength, continuing to have one of the top
bond ratings in the state, AA, and preparing in advance for the strain that the
2020 fiscal ‚Äúcurb‚Äù will place on our finances. We aim for excellent
services and efficient processes, using the data from our 311 center to drive
better decision-making and using performance data to guide management decisions
through SBStat, a data-driven management program modeled after leading cities
and pioneered by Baltimore.
Keeping it this way means making sure we make the best use of our physical and
technical assets. Behind the scenes, we are working to realign our purchasing
and central services departments to save taxpayer money. And the IT strategic
plan has been largely implemented, with an improved help desk running at one-
third of the cost of the old system, and other updates helping us to save up to
a $1 million a year while delivering better technology to help our employees
serve the public. Also out of the spotlight but extremely important is the
continued work on transparency. Our Department of Law recently passed the
milestone of 10,000 records requests processed in this administration without a
single finding of violation. Meanwhile legal claims have declined each year
since 2013 by a total of more than two-thirds, thanks to enhanced training and
excellent legal work, further saving taxpayer dollars.
We continue to work on both high-tech and old-fashioned ways to interact with
the public. Mayor‚Äôs Night Out allowed over 150 residents to sign up for
direct conversations with me last year, while 311 answered over 150,000 calls
last year alone.
Last but perhaps most importantly, we seek to be an administration that models
our values of Excellence, Accountability, Innovation, Inclusion, and
Empowerment. To highlight the importance of these values, we have begun an
employee recognition program that has already brought forth inspiring stories
of leadership by our employees.
None of this is possible alone, not even for our terrific administration team.
We rely on partnerships at every turn, and will continue to do so in order to
get things done. Whether it‚Äôs our Bowman Creek Educational Ecosystem, with
involvement from Ivy Tech, IU South Bend, and the University of Notre Dame, or
our civic innovation work sponsored by the Bloomberg Philanthropies What Works
Cities program; whether it‚Äôs the vital role played by our local hospitals on
efforts from My Brother‚Äôs Keeper to the Group Violence Intervention; we are
dramatically better off thanks to the nonprofit, philanthropic and educational
institutions that support our city‚Äôs growth. In the business world, we have
partners at every turn on efforts ranging from economic growth in our
industrial areas to the continuous enhancement of Four Winds Field by Andrew
Berlin and the South Bend Cubs. Speaking of Four Winds, one of our most
extraordinary partnerships took a major step forward last year when the Pokagon
Band of Potawatomi Indians were federally recognized. This makes our city the
first and only place in Indiana to have tribal land. And thanks to a generous
agreement with the Tribe, the restoration of their tribal homeland will yield
major benefits to our City, too, as millions of dollars in revenues from the
planned gaming facilities are committed to the enhancement of our economy and
the betterment of our children.
We also collaborate with county, state, and federal government‚Äîand these
partnerships will experience considerable change in the months and years to
come. The County-City relationship will become more important than ever, and we
will build on current collaborations like the Building Department, the 911
Center, and our involvement with the Health Department to explore working
together in new areas like collaborating with our Human Rights Commission to
address discrimination. In particular, I would like to acknowledge the work
that the County Assessor is undertaking to ensure the latest data and
techniques are applied to support truly fair assessments and stabilize property
tax revenue.
Under the Obama administration, the City enjoyed a number of fruitful
partnerships with the White House and other Federal agencies, from My
Brother‚Äôs Keeper to the MetroLab Network of city-university partnerships and
the Let‚Äôs Move effort to combat childhood obesity, for which South Bend was
recognized at the White House by First Lady Michelle Obama. It is too soon to
know all the ways in which the new administration will be different in its
dealings with South Bend, but I will say that the initial budget released by
the administration would have severe implications for all cities, including
South Bend. The proposed elimination of CDBG and HOME funds, to take just one
example, would mean $4 million less going into our City.
Every decision in Washington has implications here at home, however indirectly.
Take the actions that took place just a few hours ago to reverse the previous
administration‚Äôs actions on climate change. This is not a remote issue.
Consider the extreme rainfall event that damaged or destroyed hundreds of homes
in our City and surrounding area in August. Statistically, this was considered
a ‚Äúthousand-year‚Äù rainfall, and it represents three times the biggest
rainfall ever recorded, which was in the 1930s. It seems extremely improbable
that this weather event, which is exactly the kind of extreme weather that
scientists have warned us about for decades, is pure coincidence. South Bend
will be better off if officials in Washington are serious about addressing
issues from climate change to immigration reform. We will monitor these issues
closely, and work with allies like the U.S. Conference of Mayors to ensure the
local perspective is taken seriously in Washington.
Last but not least, I want to emphasize our relationship with the State of
Indiana. Not every decision in the state has benefited our city. I mentioned
earlier our concern with actions that will pre-empt City authority and take
power away from local government. But we are also currently benefiting from
forward-thinking state initiatives like the Regional Cities of Northern Indiana
effort. I know that our delegation of state Representatives and Senators is
working hard to advance the interests of our region. I sat down with our new
governor, Eric Holcomb, last week in his office, and he spoke of his commitment
to progress in our part of the state in areas from economic development to
public health. I let him know that the City of South Bend looks forward to
working with him to benefit our community and the state as a whole.
Tonight I have shared just a select fraction of the activities taking place in
our administration and across our community that should make South Bend proud.
We are not shying away from the challenges we face, but each year we are not
only addressing our greatest challenges but seizing opportunities that would
have been difficult to picture just a few years ago. To continue this momentum
our city will need to be ready to face an uncertain future with continued
fidelity to our values and commitment to our priorities.
Amid all the noise in media and politics, I have never been more convinced that
our city is headed in the right direction because of our shared values:
excellence, innovation, accountability, inclusion, and empowerment. No matter
the unpredictable headwinds and tailwinds of our times, this is a City of
people who know how to support one another. And we know that our City‚Äîbig
enough to matter, small enough to be nimble and original in how we solve
problems‚Äîcan continue to be a place where everyone is empowered to thrive.

AREA PLAN COMMISSION OF EVANSVILLE
AND VANDERBURGH COUNTY
Regular meeting held at 4:00 P.M. in Room 301
Civic Center Complex - Administration Building
Evansville, Indiana
December 12, 2013
ROLL CALL
Ms. Stevens: I would like to call the December 12, 2013 meeting of the Area Plan
Commission of Evansville and Vanderburgh County to order. Will the secretary please
call the roll?
Members Present:
H. Dan Adams, Marty Amsler, Roger Lehman, Lynn Lowe, Stephen Melcher, Jeff
Mueller, Bill Pedtke, Stacy Stevens
Members Absent:
Dewey Colter, K.C. Jain, Chris Rutledge, Vernon Stevens, Pete Swaim
Area Commission Staff Present:
Ronald S. London, Executive Director; Janet Greenwell, Zoning Administrator; Donna
Holderfield, Zoning Enforcement Officer; Dirck Stahl. Counsel
APPROVAL OF MINUTES
Ms. Stevens: Is there a motion to approve the November minutes? (Motion was made
and seconded.) The minutes of the November meeting are approved.
REZONINGS
Ms. Stevens: For rezonings, it takes seven affirmative votes to recommend approval of
a petition or seven negative votes to recommend denial of a petition. In the event that
there are not seven votes, it still goes forward to the City Council or County Commission
with no recommendation.
The Area Plan Commission has established the following guidelines to be followed for
both rezonings and subdivisions. Mr. London will begin each presentation. As each
case is called, the petitioner and the remonstrators who intend to testify will please stand
and be sworn in at the beginning of the process. If your name is not on the petition,

Area Plan Commission
December 12, 2013
Page 2

those who plan to testify need to please fill out the sheets in the back of the room. All
testimony must begin by stating your name and address for the record.
The petitioner or person appearing for the case being heard will have a maximum of 10
minutes for the presentation of evidence, statements, and arguments in support of the
petition. Then there will be a total of 10 minutes for the remonstrators. This testimony
will be followed by a five minute rebuttal period for the petitioner as a summation of the
case. Any request for additional time must be voted on by the Board. A timer will be
used to help enforce the time limits. Both petitioners and remonstrators should organize
their testimony to adhere to these guidelines.
When there is a group of individuals remonstrating against a petition, we strongly
encourage the group to designate a spokesperson. If it is necessary for more than one
remonstrator to speak, the group should meet out in the hall before the Area Plan
Commission discussion of the agenda item, to coordinate the information presented, so
that each speaker addresses a different issue of concern. In order to expedite the
meeting, remonstrators should refrain from repeating the same concerns already
expressed by another speaker about a particular development proposal. The Plan
Commission appreciates the cooperation of all participants with these guidelines.
If the Commissioners have questions about issues that we feel have not been sufficiently
addressed by the applicant, we have the option to request a continuance until the
information needed to sufficiently answer our concerns is available or provided by the
applicant or technical staff.
The city rezonings considered today will be heard at the City Council meeting on
Monday, January 13, 2014 at 5:30 p.m. in Room 301.
Now let‚Äôs move on to the first petition on the agenda.
Mr. Stahl: Mr. London, on all matters before the Board, do you swear or affirm that the
testimony you will give is true and accurate so help you God? (Mr. London has been
sworn in.)
CITY REZONINGS
Docket No: 2013-36-PC R-2013-21 Petitioner: Charles A. Becker, Sr.
Address: (Complete legal on file.) 1917 E. Franklin Street
Nature of Case: Change from a C-1 zone to an R-1 zone.
Mr. London: Charles Becker is requesting to rezone his residence located at 1917 E
Franklin Street from C-1 to R-1. This is a request to downzone a C-1 zoned, 0.16 acre
residential site to bring the existing residence into conformance with zoning code
restrictions and to remove the legal nonconforming status designation and the
accompanying legal nonconforming restrictions from the site. This downzoning to R-1 is
consistent with the existing use and is appropriate to the small size of the lot which

Area Plan Commission
December 12, 2013
Page 3

makes the provision of adequate on-site parking for commercial use of the site difficult.
This residence is in an area designated by the Comprehensive Plan as an area of
commercial strip development along the Weinbach Avenue corridor. A number of the
residences along and adjacent to both sides of this commercial strip are zoned C-1. This
downzoning to R-1 is consistent with the adjacent residential neighborhood and
consistent with the existing residential use.
Mr. Stahl: All those who will speak on this petition raise your right hand. Do you swear
or affirm that the testimony you will give is true and accurate so help you God? (Those
persons have been sworn in.)
Mr. Becker: My name is Charles Becker, Panama City Beach, Florida. I also own the
property at 1917 E. Franklin Street. My wife and I bought that property in 2000. If you
can see, it is labeled as ‚Äúexisting garage‚Äù in the back of the residence. It‚Äôs actually a
large shop. We had a screen printing and embroidery service that we operated out of
that. But the property was zoned commercial when we bought it. We sold that business
in 2006 and the new owners relocated to another facility and we moved to Florida. We
listed the property several times and had signed a purchase contract twice but each time
they were unable to get financing because it was zoned commercial. So that‚Äôs why we
want to rezone it back to residential. It‚Äôs empty right now.
Ms. Stevens: Thank you. Are there questions for the petitioner? Are there any
remonstrators? (None.) Is there a motion for approval? (Motion was made and
seconded.) Call the roll.
Ayes: Dr. Adams, Mr. Amsler, Mr. Lehman, Mrs. Lowe, Mr. Melcher, Mr. Mueller, Mr.
Pedtke, Ms. Stevens
Nays: None

Docket No: 2013-37-PC R-2013-22 Petitioner: Diana Linenburg
Address: (Complete legal on file.) 1151 Mt. Auburn Road
Nature of Case: Change from a C-1 zone to an R-1 zone.
Mr. London: Diana Linenburg is requesting to rezone the vacant lot at 1151 Mount
Auburn Road from C-1 to R-1. This 0.9 acre lot is at the northwest corner of Mount
Auburn and Buchanan Roads. This site was rezoned from R-1 to C-1 in 2002. The
commercial building that previously occupied the site has been razed, and the owner is
requesting to rezone the property back to its original R-1 zoning classification, limiting
future use of the site to residential. This downzoning to R-1 is consistent with the
adjacent uses and is appropriate to the topography of the lot which makes the provision
of adequate on-site parking for commercial use of the site difficult. This lot is in an area
designated by the Comprehensive Plan as an area of residential development along the

Area Plan Commission
December 12, 2013
Page 4

North St Joseph Avenue corridor. The residential area is adjacent to an area of
industrial. This downzoning to R-1 is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and is
consistent with the adjacent residential uses. Staff will review the access prior to
issuance of any new permits on the site.
Mr. Stahl: All those who will speak on this petition raise your right hand. Do you swear
or affirm that the testimony you will give is true and accurate so help you God? (Those
persons have been sworn in.)
Ms. Linenburg: My name is Diana Linenburg, 1201 Mt. Auburn Road. My house and
the property that I own is actually buts up next to this piece of property. It is across the
street from South Central Communications. The Englebrechts have owned it for years.
Once they razed the building they had on it, they had a business then. They no longer
wanted it. It just adds to my green space. It is mostly wooded. So they offered it to me
and I chose to take it. But I have no reason to have it be commercial. I would prefer we
have it residential again.
Ms. Stevens: Okay. Are there any questions? Are there any remonstrators? (None.)
Is there a motion for approval? (Motion was made and seconded.) Call the roll.
Ayes: Mr. Amsler, Mr. Lehman, Mrs. Lowe, Mr. Melcher, Mr. Mueller, Mr. Pedtke, Dr.
Adams, Ms. Stevens
Nays: None
There being 8 affirmative votes, Docket No: R-2013-22 goes forward with a

Ms. Linenburg: I would also like to extend an apology to Ms. Greenwell. I was quite
frustrated in her office the other day and it was inappropriate. So I apologize.
Ms. Stevens: Okay. Thank you. Looks apology was accepted.
Docket No: 2013-38-PC R-2013-23 Petitioner: Mark Cole
Address: (Complete legal on file.) 313 N. Garvin Street
Nature of Case: Change from a C-4 zone to an M-1 zone with a use and development
commitment.
Mr. London: Mark Cole is requesting to change the zoning of his site at 313 N Garvin
Street from C-4 to M-1 with a use and development commitment. This is a 0.24 acre site
on the east side of Garvin Street, mid-block between Franklin and Michigan Streets. This
is a request for rezoning to allow a part of the car repair facilities along Garvin to be
utilized for body work and painting of vehicles. The owner was contacted by staff after
complaints were filed with the Area Plan Commission regarding the painting and body
work activity taking place on the site. There is a use and development commitment
included as part of this rezoning petition that will limit use of the site to auto repair, body

Area Plan Commission
December 12, 2013
Page 5

work, and painting. A copy of the use and development commitment was included with
the staff report. This is a request to rezone one of the buildings on the owner‚Äôs site from
C-4 to M-1 to bring the existing violation on the property into compliance with zoning
laws. If approved for body work and painting, owner must file complete interior plans for
the new use for Site Review approval, and will be required to comply with current
building, safety, and environmental codes. This site is in an older area of very mixed
zonings and uses, predominantly residential with commercial development scattered
along main streets in the area. This site was rezoned from residential to C-4 in 1966.
The most recent permit for this site was in 2002, when it was changed to an auto sales
lot and warehouse, both C-4 uses. The step-up in zoning to M-1 is not consistent with
existing commercial and residential zonings and uses. To date, industrial development
has been limited to those areas south of Franklin Street and east of Canal Street. Site
Review will address compliance with all code requirements upon submission of plans for
the development of the site as an auto body and paint shop. Site Review approval is
required for the new use, and the owner must comply with all building codes, fire codes,
and EPA rules regarding the appropriate venting for the painting activities. By ordinance,
all inoperable vehicles awaiting repair in conjunction with any auto repair facilities must
be screened with an 8-foot solid fence when the vehicles are visible from any residence
or any public street.
Mr. Stahl: All those who will speak on this petition raise your right hand. Do you swear
or affirm that the testimony you will give is true and accurate so help you God? (Those
persons have been sworn in.)
Mr. Cole: Mark Cole, 3508 Stringtown. I bought this property about five years ago and I
had a gentleman approach me about wanting to use that little shop for a little body work
stuff. It‚Äôs a one-man shop, small. There isn‚Äôt anything in there actually for ventilating the
paint out. He does do a little bit of paint. He doesn‚Äôt do a lot of work. I rent it to him for
$400 a month. He is willing to put a paint booth up. I can assure you we will put a paint
booth in it if we get this rezoned. I have painted cars all my life. I don‚Äôt do it anymore. I
own a window tinting and glass business here in town. But the gentleman has a small
shop. He wants to keep it small. There is a lot of property around there. There is an
empty lot next to me. I own all the way over to Michigan Street on that side of the road.
So I have one house directly behind me and the rest is not there. The ventilation with
the EPA, they have strict guidelines that you have to follow. I have been around this
business for a long time. We can put a paint booth in there to take care of the fumes and
problems.
Ms. Stevens: Okay. Thank you. Are there questions for the petitioner? Are there any
remonstrators?
Ms. Cox: My name is Elizabeth Cox, 8911 Telephone Road, Chandler. I own the
property on the corner. I have lots 1, 2, and 3, 8 and 9. It‚Äôs commercial C-4 property
right now. I object because I want to sell the property and I‚Äôm afraid it will devalue the
property. It will limit me who I can sell that to. Just worried about the environmental
aspects of that.

Area Plan Commission
December 12, 2013
Page 6

Mr. Stahl: Which corner is that?
Ms. Cox: The corner of Garvin and Franklin.
Ms. Stevens: Any questions for the remonstrator? Thank you.
Mr. Cole: I realize she owns the lot on the corner. I attempted to purchase the lot and
the price she wanted for the lot was very high. She just has an empty corner there. It
has been empty for a long time. I‚Äôm not sure what was on it and I‚Äôm not sure if it was
EPA cleared as far as what was in the ground. I know she is trying to sell it. I offered her
a price for it and she didn‚Äôt want to accept it. I don‚Äôt know the fact that an M-1 would
devalue her property. I think it may add value if it was changed. There was a lot of old
houses around there. She has a property she wants to sell, it would be worth more
money if people could get something rezoned to put something in there a little bit better.
It‚Äôs been sitting there empty for a long time. I don‚Äôt know how it would affect her property.
She has to come cut the grass. As far as the zoning goes, the M-1 on my little piece of
property with my building shouldn‚Äôt be that big of a deal. All I‚Äôm asking for is a little piece
of pie with that shop there. Just a guy trying to make a living.
Mr. ??: How long ago did you try to buy that corner?
Mr. Cole: As soon as I bought the other property, about five years ago.
Ms. Stevens: Any other questions? Is there a motion for approval? (Motion was made
and seconded.) Call the roll.
Ayes: Mr. Lehman, Mrs. Lowe, Mr. Melcher, Mr. Mueller, Mr. Pedtke, Mr. Amsler, Ms.

There being 7 affirmative votes and 1 abstention, Docket No: R-2013-23 goes forward

anything but body and paint.
Docket No: 2013-39-PC R-2013-24 Petitioner: David J. Nelson d/b/a SILCO, LLC
Address: (Complete legal on file.) 1003 Beverly Avenue
Nature of Case: Change from an R-1 zone to a C-4 zone with a use and development
commitment.
Mr. London: David J Nelson d/b/a SILCO, LLC is requesting to rezone a small 0.2 acre
site at 1003 Beverly Avenue from R-1 to C-4 with a use and development commitment.

Area Plan Commission
December 12, 2013
Page 7

This site is on the east side of Fulton Ave, adjacent north of Pigeon Creek and south of
(unimproved) Beverly Ave. This is a request for rezoning to C-4 to afford Mr. Nelson the
opportunity to file an application for erection of a new cell tower on this site. The C-4
zoning classification allows erection of a cell tower if approved as a Special Use # 15 by
the Board of Zoning Appeals. This small lot is adjacent to additional lots zoned C-4 under
the same ownership, and is not a practical site for residential development. The R-1
zoned sites in close proximity to this lot are all wooded, undeveloped sites. Due to the
topography and the location of the surrounding isolated R-1 zoned areas, it is unlikely
that residential development will occur on these sites. There is a use and development
commitment included as part of this rezoning petition that limits use of the site to a cell
tower. A copy of the commitment was included with the staff report. The Comprehensive
Plan designates this area for commercial development. The rezoning to C-4 is consistent
with the Comprehensive Plan Future Land Use Map. No site plans were submitted with
this application detailing the exact location or height of the proposed cell tower.
However, the site is limited to some degree by the proximity of Pigeon Creek. It is
uncertain how the Owner/Applicant proposes to access this site. The property adjacent
north of this site is under the same ownership as this site, and presumably access is
available to Fulton/Kratzville through the alternate site (the previous site of a bread
store.) Site Review will address access and compliance with all code requirements upon
submission of plans for the construction of a cell tower on this site. If approved for
rezoning to C-4, the owner will next need to apply for Special Use # 15 approval from the
Board of Zoning Appeals to allow the erection of a new cell tower on this site, and may
additionally need to file for variance to relax the height limit for the new tower.
Mr. Stahl: All those who will speak on this petition raise your right hand. Do you swear
or affirm that the testimony you will give is true and accurate so help you God? (Those
persons have been sworn in.)
Mr. Nelson: My name is Dave Nelson. This site is on the corner of Kratzville and
Diamond on the southeast corner. The lot we would like to have rezoned was, at one
time back in the 1930s, maybe a residence was on that lot. It‚Äôs a 50 foot wide lot. The
adjoining lot is zoned correctly and what we are asking for is the lot next to it to be zoned
to be in compliance with that so that AT&T can put up a cell tower. I have a ground
lease to AT&T on this site. It is by far the best use for this ground because most of it is
in Pigeon Creek. The top part of it is above ground and out of the floodplain. AT&T told
me they will go through the necessary permits to put an elevated platform in and a cell
tower here, going through DNR and the Corps of Engineers. They have to go through a
lot of hoops before they can get this done. As far as access, I own this property where
the bread store is. This is an 80 foot wide easement called Beverly Avenue. In 2002,
after I acquired this property, we came before the City Council to try and have that
vacated. I don‚Äôt know if you have had a change to drive out there but it is basically a
road that goes nowhere. It goes into a big pit. The owner of the property at the time was
Greg Kempf and he made the petition and he hired an engineer who made the plea to
have it vacated. But for some reason the City Council voted 9-0 not to vacate it. So we
are going to try that again. I want to get this zoned and I am going to go back and try to
get that vacated so that they will have access. Right now I have an encroachment

Area Plan Commission
December 12, 2013
Page 8

permit from the city to use that easement. That‚Äôs what we will use. It is valid for two
years.
Ms. Stevens: Thank you. Are there questions for Mr. Nelson?
Dr. Adams: When they tried to get that vacation, does that road serve the other
properties to the east of where the bakery used to be?
Mr. Nelson: It‚Äôs really interesting. I also own this lot over here too. But right here, if you
go down a ditch that is about 20 feet, then there is a giant washout or something. On
either side of me there is 20 feet embankments. If the land is ever going to be
developed, all that would have to be filled in. In 2002 when Billy Nicholson, who was a
surveyor out of Mt Vernon, came in and pleaded this case, he estimated that the cost to
build a bridge was somewhere around two million dollars. It would go across property
owned by the Meisler family and they currently use it to store trailers on. I don‚Äôt want to
sound bad. But this is just basically wasteland. There‚Äôs a giant 24 inch storm drain that
comes out of Diamond Avenue and flows into Pigeon Creek. I talked to an engineer. I‚Äôm
looking at possibly trying to fill in my lot and bring it up and make it worth something.
Dr. Adams: How high would the cell tower be?
Mr. Nelson: I don‚Äôt know. AT&T has requested that I first get it zoned. They will have
to follow whatever regulations. They will go through the permitting process.
Ms. Stevens: Thank you. Are there any remonstrators? (None.) Is there a motion for
approval? (Motion was made and seconded.) Call the roll.
Ayes: Mrs. Lowe, Mr. Melcher, Mr. Mueller, Mr. Pedtke, Mr. Amsler, Mr. Lehman, Ms.
Stevens
Nays: None

There being 7 affirmative votes and 1 abstention, Docket No: R-2013-24 goes forward

Docket No: 2013-42-PC R-2013-27 Petitioner: Professional‚Äôs Plaza, LLC
Address: (Complete legal on file.) 1 SE Ninth Street
Nature of Case: Change from a CO-2 zone to a C-2 zone.
Mr. London: Professional‚Äôs Plaza, LLC is requesting to rezone their property at One
Southeast Ninth Street from CO-2 to C-2. This is a 1.73 acre site located at the
northwest corner of Ninth & Locust Streets. This is a request for rezoning to C-2 to allow
more flexibility in the use and development of the old Evansville Vanderburgh County
School Corporation administrative building. The EVSC moved its offices to new quarters

Area Plan Commission
December 12, 2013
Page 9

on the south side of Walnut Street, and their administrative office building within the Civic
Center complex campus area has been vacant since that time. The new owners plan to
remodel and change the use of part of the building to include a restaurant. The existing
CO-2 classification limits commercial use of the site to professional offices. The
Comprehensive Plan Future Land Use Map designates this as an area of institutional
use, with commercial and mixed use in close proximity. The rezoning to C-2 is
consistent with the mixed commercial uses within the surrounding area. The entire
‚ÄúCivic Center‚Äù campus area from Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd (formerly Seventh Street),
east to Heidelbach Avenue, south to Walnut Street, and north to Vine Street (excluding
the existing commercial Curtis Building) was ‚Äúblanket‚Äù zoned by the City in 1965 in
anticipation of the construction of public buildings and uses, all in close proximity to each
other, and all sharing the large, centrally-located parking lot known as the ‚Äúback forty‚Äù.
This is a public parking area available for use by any business and institutional uses.
There is an existing 48-space parking lot on this site with two access drives onto Ninth
Street. The building is immediately across Ninth Street from the ‚Äúback forty‚Äù public
parking lot utilized by the Civic Center complex and surrounding commercial buildings
and uses. Any changes to the existing on-site parking area will require Site Review
approval. No changes will be required to accommodate the change-of-use of the
building. Site Review will address compliance with all code requirements upon
submission of plans for any changes to the current use of the site. This is a request to
rezone the old EVSC administration building to allow more flexibility in the uses allowed
on the site. The building has been sold to a private entity, and it has been indicated that
the new owner would like some flexibility to convert some of the building space for other
uses.
Mr. Stahl: All those who will speak on this petition raise your right hand. Do you swear
or affirm that the testimony you will give is true and accurate so help you God? (Those
persons have been sworn in.)
Ms. Lockyear: My name is Krista Lockyear, here on behalf of the petitioner. The
Professional‚Äôs Plaza, LLC is owned by Scott Danks. I told Scott today that he probably
didn‚Äôt need to be here for this presentation. I think everybody can see what a great use
this will be for this property that is currently vacant right now. Scott is going to remodel
the building as indicated, and it will be professional offices predominantly. But he would
like to put in a coffee house and lunch eatery for convenience for all of us that work here
in the Civic Center. With that, the coffee house will be coffee and lunch in the beginning.
Eventually, he hopes to expand to have it open for dinner three nights a week and
probably also have a small fitness center in the building for his tenants and possibly also
city and county employees. So, exciting use of the property and we would appreciate
your recommendation to approve this rezoning.
Ms. Stevens: Thank you. Are there questions?
Mr. Mueller: I don‚Äôt have a question. But I just want to reiterate the conversation that
Mr. London and I had just so we are on the record about this because I had asked about
the fact that there weren‚Äôt enough parking spaces. We have required other people to

Area Plan Commission
December 12, 2013
Page 10

have an easement. Ron, why don‚Äôt you answer that question, that way we are on the
record. Then in the future, if somebody else says we let them do it, they will understand
why on this particular issue that is the case.
Mr. London: Sure. The back 40 parking lot was built for public use. So this building
would be able to use that as parking spaces if they need additional from what they
already have. They don‚Äôt need any type of shared parking agreements since it is for the
public. That‚Äôs where we were coming from.
Ms. Stevens: So that would apply to anybody around that same back 40?
Mr. London: Yes.
Ms. Stevens: Thank you. Are there any remonstrators? (None.) Is there a motion for
approval? (Motion was made and seconded.) Call the roll.
Ayes: Mr. Melcher, Mr. Mueller, Mr. Pedtke, Mr. Amsler, Mr. Lehman, Mrs. Lowe, Ms.

ORDINANCE CHANGES
Amendment of Section 17.24.040 of Title 17 of the Code of Ordinances of Vanderburgh
County pertaining to gravel parking lots.
Mr. London: What we would like to present here, just to give a little background, I had a
meeting put together with a small committee of the County Surveyor, County Engineer,
City Engineer, Steve, who is one of the Commissioners, and also the EPA. We decided
to bring this up. We have quite a few people coming in for variances for gravel parking
lots. They go in front of the BZA. What we were trying to do with tis ordinance allows
certain uses to be able to use the gravel parking instead of paved parking which is
required for all commercial uses now.
Ms. Stevens:
variance to?

So are these just some of the ones that you almost always gave a

Mr. London: Yes. A lot of it had to do with the mini storage facilities. Then
add to that. I sent out several emails to people and we were trying to think of
that would apply for gravel parking areas. I have sent this out to several
review and comment. I know with that committee we put together, we have

we tried to
other uses
people for
gone back

Area Plan Commission
December 12, 2013
Page 11

and added language, taken language off. This is the final project that we came up with.
I have sent it out to everyone here for their review, and I tried to make any minor
changes that I got back from comments. So this is what we are presenting to you today.
Ms. Stevens: And we are presenting this to vote on it?
Mr. London:
Correct.
We would like this to move forward to the County
Commissioners. And this is for the County only.
Ms. Stevens: Alright.
Mr. Melcher: I was kind of hoping, is this going to be for the County only? It won‚Äôt be
for the City?
Mr. London: No. This is only for the County. If we decide we want to put together
something for the City, we always can.
Mr. Melcher: One of the things that has come up in my tenure of being elected, when I
worked at CAPE, and I didn‚Äôt bring it up with I worked for CAPE, I don‚Äôt work there any
more. We had a fire house on the westside and we used it as a shelter. A lot of our
constituents lived out in that area. So we turned the downstairs into an old office. We
had to have a concrete parking even though we had planned parking on the street and
everywhere else, they kind of forced it on us. So they allowed us to have rock for a
couple times. Finally we decided to close the office instead of putting in a concrete
parking lot because we can‚Äôt afford it. Non-profits don‚Äôt have that much money and they
are taking it away more and more. So that‚Äôs one. But we have also had others. We
have had people that will buy, they own commercial and they will buy the property next
door. They have a rock driveway already. So why make them make it change it into
concrete? We had a problem on Baize Street doing the same thing. A tree-wooded
area. He was trying to hook two buildings together and he was going to have to go
through the State. He had some blacktop and some other things. Some things there was
going to be changed. You just constantly run into these things all the time. They didn‚Äôt
do the project. So they didn‚Äôt hire 15-20 more people. They just passed on it which I
think is a shame we can‚Äôt work, common sense somewhere comes along the line. Also
the thing to is, we are paving so much anymore, it seems like the more and more we
pave, the higher the water table is getting and we are flooding people. So the answer
was, I just said, why don‚Äôt we use 53 rock that once it gets wet, it pretty much hardens,
but it still seeps through. I think that would solve all the water running off into the street.
I think it‚Äôs a win. I‚Äôve been trying to do this ever since we changed it. So I thought now
was the time to do it. I actually thought both City and County were doing this because
we will have more instances in the City than we will County. I‚Äôd rather pass for the
County and get moving for the City next.
Ms. Stevens: Thank you. Any other comments?

Area Plan Commission
December 12, 2013
Page 12

Mr. Mueller: As someone who worked on this too, I want to point out that Evansville is a
center for a lot of mining for southern Indiana, southern Illinois, western Kentucky. We
are going through now some gas and oil. People that in those businesses require large
storage yards and they don‚Äôt need paved yards. We have a lot of equipment people in
this town and again, that type of equipment, when you are talking about trying to pave to
meet the weights of that equipment, you are talking about a really undo cost. What I see
from this ordinance would be to allow those type of people, heavy equipment users, to
be able to have rock parking lots and not have to go through variances or even some of
the requirements they have of paved roads. But try to make it easier for these folks to
locate in there because these are good, tax paying businesses.
Ms. Stevens: Thank you.
Dr. Adams: Let me ask you a couple questions. Number one, is the water absorbed
through pavement a lot more expensive than regular asphalt?
Mr. London: You mean the porous pavement? It is.
Dr. Adams: Again, give me the cutoff point here between what you want to allow to
have gravel versus what you are going to demand people to asphalt? That seemed a
little nebulous to me.
Mr. London: What we had come up with was, and the back story is, the first 50 feet that
a person comes into their property, we are not asking for them to pave. Where that
came from was, whenever you do an erosion control plan. The first 50 feet you have to
put down a number two stone and that is to be able to clean off the material coming from
your site before it gets to the road. So with doing this, that first 50 feet, that is kind of the
process that would give the ability to clean off your tires and also so that rock doesn‚Äôt go
out into the road either. With coming up with the rock, we thought it was a win-win with
allowing the storm water to infiltrate the ground instead of having so much runoff. That‚Äôs
kind of another reason behind it. Then also in talking with the EPA about the green
space and the trees for pat of that requirement, that‚Äôs something they brought up as far
as a pollution control type thing. So that‚Äôs where we came up with the premise of this.
Dr. Adams: I don‚Äôt think you answered my question.
Ms. Stevens: You are talking about what kind of business?
Dr. Adams: Yes, what kind of businesses will fall under this particular scope as
proposed to a CVS?
Mr. London: We have mini storage facilities, cell towers, campgrounds, inventory,
storage and display for commercial sales or leasing or agricultural or construction
equipment, semi trucks and trailers, recreational vehicles or motor homes, manufactured
and modular housing, yard barns. Then we also have for the small businesses, kind of
the combined residential/commercial business where they have a residence but they

Area Plan Commission
December 12, 2013
Page 13

also want to have their commercial facility in their back yard or something to that effect.
It also covers those types of facilities.
Ms. Stevens: I think it is good common sense as well as making it more business
friendly.
Mr. Pedtke: That‚Äôs outlined on page two. It‚Äôs kind of a crawl before you walk. As your
rep to the BZA, this is where we get a lot of requests from. So having the 50 feet of solid
surface in only for certain kinds of uses kind is what we use to provide permission to
have gravel on a permanent basis. Otherwise, it is just a two year temporary. I think it is
a good crawl before you walk and it‚Äôs very limited on the uses. To be able to have to do
50 feet of pavement I think is still some substantial cost and requirement. I would like to
call everyone‚Äôs attention to page three at the top where it talks about the tree buffer
zones. I think that this is pretty well written and gives lots of relief to the residential
properties where they are doing some commercial business. But this says it is going to
require a tree buffer zone basically on all sides of the property. I think that we will
probably have a lot of applicants come to us where not all sides of the property, it‚Äôs
almost wasteful. So I guess what I would just like to do is keep that language there and
maybe provide some language that says unless in the discretion of the Area Plan
director we see that it is not needed.
Ms. Stevens: How do you feel about that?
Mr. Pedtke: I would like somebody else to draft the language exactly to be more
comfortable with it. I just think that not every single situation is going to need trees.
Ms. Stevens: When you say ‚Äúall‚Äù, it is like ‚Äúevery‚Äù.
Mr. London: I like to have black and white whenever I‚Äôm dealing with something
because I don‚Äôt want to feel like I‚Äôve said it‚Äôs okay for this person to do this and the next
person come in‚Ä¶so I think it needs to be black and white. If somebody wants to
eliminate something, they can always go to Board of Zoning Appeals. But I think we
have worked with, and I have talked specifically with a person who was planning on
doing another mini storage facility and they said they would be more than happy to do
the green space so they wouldn‚Äôt have to spend that money for the concrete or asphalt
paving. I think it is a win-win. They are giving a little bit. We are giving a lot.
Ms. Stevens: Other discussion? Any other concerns? Bill, are you okay with that?
Mr. Stahl: I think the question is, what was the point of having a paving requirement in
the first place? And does this thwart that? And I don‚Äôt think it does.
Ms. Stevens: Well we still have a paving requirement‚Ä¶
Mr. Stahl: We do have a paving requirement for the majority of other types of
businesses. But when you are considering whether to amend this or that and to provide

Area Plan Commission
December 12, 2013
Page 14

this or that, I think you have to look at it from a planning and land use standpoint and not
just an administrative ease of administering it because we want to knock out a lot of
petitions for variance from the BZA.
Ms. Stevens: It‚Äôs common sense.
Mr. Stahl: That‚Äôs right. And there are specific reasons and I guess I would point out that
not only do these types of businesses come before the BZA a lot, they almost uniformly
are approved because when you get into the factual situations, there isn‚Äôt really a
problem with the neighbors around them. They are worried about the dust from gravel or
anything like that. When it comes to the front property line, remind me, is this, were they
otherwise required to have an opaque fence. Or is this just, those trees are just there
because of the gravel?
Mr. London:
Yes, the trees are there for the gravel and they are also there for
whenever they do grow to a certain height, it was for that pollution control of dust, kind of
one of those meet in the middle with basically, some people who wouldn‚Äôt want the
gravel.
Mr. Stahl: Right. And that‚Äôs another thing that comes up at BZA meetings where you do
try to protect, for example, if you have a residential neighborhood behind an area that is
going to be gravel, a lot of times they will suggest you put plants and trees there so it‚Äôs a
wind block basically to filter out anything that is going to blow through there. Is that
needed on the front property line though? If the front property line is always going to be
frontage, adjacent to a public street, I guess if you are talking about having it black or
white, which I agree, I don‚Äôt want you to be burdened by any discretion that you don‚Äôt
want to have. I‚Äôm wondering if it should be just be eliminated and just have all property
lines except for the frontage.
Mr. London: I have no problem with that. That was just the language that was crafted
from all the comments from different aspects.
Mr. Lehman: Perhaps it would be better for the developer if we permitted site review
with the developer to select one side that didn‚Äôt require trees, because it may be in a
situation where you are displaying equipment and it‚Äôs not on the frontage and there‚Äôs a
side road that is a lot away but the people can see your equipment from that road. If we
say it is required on three sides, and let site review and the developer agree on which
side it doesn‚Äôt have to be, then that gives them a little more flexibility.
Mr. London: We did put in there for, if they are displaying equipment that the reduction
as far as the spacing goes was reduced in half. So we did try and put something in
there.
Ms. Stevens: Okay.

Mr. London: So that was something that was taken into consideration for if they are
trying to show their product, eliminate a good portion of what would go in that frontage.
Ms. Stevens: In the interest of not getting into another hour, are people comfortable
voting on this, or do you want to continue to talk about it?
Mr. Pedtke: My comment was based on whether we can make it better right now? This
is something that we need and I would say let‚Äôs vote it through. We are crawling before
we walk. We have other uses that we might add to it someday. We may change that
part some day. But I think it is important to keep this moving.
Ms. Stevens: Everybody agree with that? Do we need to do a roll call?
Mr. Stahl: Well, there ought to be a motion and are you moving that it be approved as
is, or are you moving that we eliminate the trees on the front or,
Mrs. Greenwell: You need to vote on whatever is in writing in front of you. Or continue
it so that we can get it in the format that you need. If you want to make changes. It will
hold it up to some degree.
Ms. Stevens: You would have to make the changes and then we would vote on it next
month.
Mrs. Greenwell: Yes, pretty much.
Mr. Stahl: I think you could make some changes. There are some things that we do
change on the fly. Usually they are not major.
Mrs. Greenwell: The only thing I had was that there is a deadline of today, which we
got extended until tomorrow to get it on for first reading in December for County
Commission. If we do make changes, that probably will push it to an extra 2-3 weeks
before it can get to final hearing in the County.
Mr. Pedtke: If a property that an applicant has business in two subdivisions on the other
sides, then I would say you have to do all the sides. But if it is two miles to the next farm
house, ‚Ä¶
Mr. Stahl: They can always get a variance for that.
Mr. Pedtke: I know but we are trying to stop that. That‚Äôs the whole purpose of this. But I
will make the motion to approve it as it is tonight and then hopefully we can see how that
goes and come back and change it then.
Ms. Stevens: Okay, we have a motion and second. Please call the roll.
Mr. Melcher: I just want to thank everybody and I vote yes.

recommendation for approval.
OTHER BUSINESS
Mr. London: We have one last thing on the agenda. This would be under other
business. It is a request to change a condition on a plat. I will go ahead and read this.
Then if anybody has any questions, I will be more than happy to try to answer them.
This is 6-MS-98 Carneal Commercial Replat of Lot 3 request to change a condition.
The Carneal Commercial Replat of Lot 3 is a 2-lot commercial subdivision which split Lot
3 into Lots 3A and 3B. The site is located on the east side of Green River Road south of
Riverside Drive. Primary plat approval was granted by the Area Plan Commission in
1996, and the replat was recorded in 1998. The plat showed that Lot 3A had frontage on
Riverside and Green River Road with its location at that intersection, while Lot 3B only
had frontage on Green River. Lot 3B still has an existing residence as it did at the time
the plat was approved. In granting primary plat approval on the Replat of Lot, the Area
Plan Commission imposed conditions of approval regarding access. The concern was
that access to the new commercial lots not be from Green River Road. Lot 3A was
required to access Riverside Drive. Access for Lot 3B was to be from a new roadway to
function as a frontage road immediately to the east of the site which would connect with
Riverside Drive. The follow-up May 22, 1998 APC approval letter to the representative
for the applicant, Lee McClellan, describing the action taken by the Commission lists the
conditions as follows: 1. The developer must post a letter of credit for the proposed
extension of the road to be located immediately east of the site, covering the cost of
extending this road to at least the driveway for Lot 3B prior to recording the plat; 2.
Construction of this road extension to the driveway for Lot 3B must be complete prior to
any change from residential to commercial use of this lot; and 3. All access to the
proposed replat, other than residential access to Lot 3B must be from interior streets
only.
As a result of these conditions of approval, an access note was added to the recorded
plat which states: Lot 3A shall access Riverside Drive. Lot 3B is currently utilized as
residential use. When Lot 3B is changed to commercial usage, access shall be from the
roadway to be constructed along the east side of said lot. No access to Green River
Road is permitted.
The Carneal family has submitted a letter requesting to modify the conditions of approval
and access note on the plat, and has submitted a Use and Development Commitment to

Area Plan Commission
December 12, 2013
Page 17

further specify the actions that they or a future buyer of the property will take concerning
the access road and the letter of credit.
The request is to modify conditions of approval #1 and #2 to state the following: The
current owner or any future purchaser of the property must install the road to be located
immediately east of the site to at least the driveway for Lot 3B and/or Lot 2 (of Carneal
Commercial Section 1 adjacent to the south) if Lot 2 is to have a separate commercial
access on the road, or post a letter of credit covering the cost of this road prior to any
change from the existing residential use to a commercial use of Lot 3B and/or Lot 2. The
road will need to lie within either dedicated right-of-way or a private ingress/egress
easement. The owner shall comply with this condition unless the lots are sold with the
adjacent, unplatted land to the east and an alternative plan for development of this
overall property that provides satisfactory access from Riverside Drive is filed with and
approved by the Area Plan Commission.
Approval of the modified conditions would effect a corresponding change to the Access
note on the plat so that it would state: When Lot 3B is changed to commercial usage,
access shall be from the roadway to be constructed along the east side of said lot or
from an alternate access approved by the Area Plan Commission. Staff recommends
that the Access note on the Carneal Commercial Replat of Lot 3B plat be changed as
requested. Staff also recommends that approval be conditioned on the modified
condition wording, the recording of the signed and notarized Use and Development
Commitment, and recording of the APC approval letter for the modified conditions to be
cross referenced with the plat.
Ms. Stevens: Okay, so all of that is telling us‚Ä¶.
Mr. London: Basically what it is, they have a letter of credit in place since 1998. What
they would like to do is get a couple conditions removed. Basically what it is saying is, if
someone wants to come in and do a commercial use in what is now a residence that
they live in, that that road would have to be built at that time on the back side of the
property and the commercial would have to access that drive on the back side instead of
accessing Green River Road, which that was the intent all along. So they would like to
go ahead and have that condition removed and I believe we have a representative here.
Mr. Stahl: If I could just add to that, the basic problem here is you have a letter of credit
sitting there for no reason. It is costing these people $400 a year. When it was originally
platted, I think it was intended that there would be some commercial development there.
But as circumstances changed, the family decided to keep it residential. There is no
reason to have a letter of credit sitting there to build a road that the residential property
doesn‚Äôt need. So what we had worked out was, to change that condition, but protect, I
mean, you still would want the road there and the access closed off of Green River if it
was developed as commercial. So putting these conditions on the plat and under
statute, the Plan Commission can require as a condition of approval of the plat the use
and development commitment which sort of repeats the same thing and makes a
commitment that all of this will get buttoned up once it is sold to someone for commercial

Area Plan Commission
December 12, 2013
Page 18

purposes. But in the mean time, it allows the family to stop having to deal with that letter
of credit and incur that expense and to continue using it and refinancing it for residential
purposes which is what it is being used for now.
Ms. Stevens: So do we accept a motion with those conditions?
Mr. Stahl: I think someone needs to move to approve the modified condition and
replace the existing condition with the modified condition.
Ms. Stevens: We have a motion and second. Call the roll.
Ayes: Mr. Pedtke, Dr. Adams, Mr. Amsler, Mr. Lehman, Mrs. Lowe, Mr. Melcher, Mr.
Meuller, Ms. Stevens.
Nays: None
There being 8 affirmative votes, the request is approved.
Meeting adjourned.

THE CITY
===============================================================================
***** REMARKS_AS_PREPARED_FOR_DELIVERY_BY_MAYOR_BUTTIGIEG_AT_2016_STATE_OF_THE
CITY [1] *****

**** Introduction ****
Thank you, Chancellor Allison, for that kind introduction, for all of the
extraordinary work that takes place here at IUSB, and for hosting us this
evening in this remarkable facility. Let‚Äôs also thank our talented quartet
once more for that terrific performance.
And thank you to Council President Scott, and to the entire Common Council for
the work you do. Just two months into the year, this Council is already
demonstrating how difficult issues can be handled in an atmosphere of healthy
debate and mutual respect.
This evening we stand near the midpoint of a decade that I believe will go down
in history as the most transformative period for the City of South Bend in
modern times. It‚Äôs also the beginning of a new four-year term of office for
this administration, Clerk, and Council. It is the right moment to take stock
of where we are; and to chart a course for what must happen in the years ahead
of us in order to accelerate and consolidate South Bend‚Äôs historic comeback.
¬ 
**** Review of 2015 ****
Last year alone was full of extraordinary moments in the life of our city. We
spent the year marking our 150th anniversary. An estimated 60,000 people took
part in the Birthday Weekend in May, many them on hand for the inauguration of
River Lights, which will be a permanent legacy of these celebrations. Built
with donated funds and volunteer labor, River Lights has already developed into
a fixture of our downtown, a charismatic work of public art that attracts
diverse visitors from all walks of life and all neighborhoods in town to enjoy
our river across three of our finest parks, right in the heart of the city.¬ 
Last year also saw the culmination of our ambitious effort to tackle the
problem of vacant and abandoned houses by addressing 1,000 houses in 1,000
days. This initiative grew out of complaints and concerns from residents across
town who had spent so many years living next to collapsing structures that they
had begun to question whether anyone cared about their neighborhoods. The
administration and Council heard them, and set out to address the problem
strategically. I am proud to report that when the clock ran out on 1,000 days,
we had addressed 1,122 properties. And 1,000 houses did not mean 1,000
demolitions. In fact, 433 of these houses were repaired, not torn down, through
a combination of effective code enforcement and strong community partnerships.
Meanwhile, the Group Violence Intervention entered its second year, aiming to
make South Bend a safer city by using proven methods to tackle group- and gang-
related gun violence. Too many times, a violent incident is followed by a
community meeting of residents up in arms, a resolution to do better‚Ä¶ and a
return to doing exactly what we were doing before. But after a painful summer
in 2012, we made sure that this time really was different. Community leaders
sought out the best, most effective approaches from around the country, and
began to apply them.
The results are early and tentative, but they are very promising. We are seeing
changes in the patterns of group- and gang-member involved shooting incidents
in our City, and already we have seen over 30 community members on the path to
contributing to society in a job rather than harming others. The data suggest
that we are already saving lives and have the potential to do much more,
through our ongoing effort and a new, dedicated GVI unit in our Police
Department.
Just as importantly, through this effort we have built a coalition of
foundation leadership, social service providers, neighborhood representatives,
respected pastors, nonprofit stakeholders, police officers and local, county,
and federal law enforcement officials now working in concert toward a simple
goal that everyone shares regardless of background or politics: violence must
stop.¬ 
On the economic front, the banner news of 2015 came just in time for Christmas,
when Governor Pence visited our region to celebrate our success in the
competitive Regional Cities program, earning an award of $42 million from the
Indiana Economic Development Corporation. We have come a long way from the
years when South Bend complained of having little to no state economic
development activity in our city limits.
The Regional Cities program was designed to invite communities to learn how to
collaborate regionally, because there is powerful evidence that neighboring
communities that simply compete against each other are defeating themselves.
This time, we saw communities throughout St. Joseph, Marshall, and Elkhart
Counties‚Äîplaces that used to view each other as competitors‚Äîcome together
and offer a shared economic vision for our future. And as a team, we won.
By teaming up with our neighbors‚Äîwith public, private, and university
leadership‚Äîwe earned funding to support an estimated $700 million in total
investment for projects ranging from the Renaissance District on old Studebaker
grounds, to the Blueways Trail that will deepen our community‚Äôs bond with our
magnificent river and make one of our great parks even greater. In a matter of
weeks, we‚Äôll know for sure whether the Indiana General Assembly will fully
fund this program. Two-thirds of the funding has already been secured; the
remainder is currently hanging in the balance of the legislative process. I
have contacted our legislators and the Speaker of the House to emphasize the
importance of this program to our region, tomorrow I will travel to the
Statehouse to testify in the Ways and Means Committee in favor of full funding.
We are hoping for good news from Indianapolis soon. ¬ 
Last year‚Äôs successes closed out a phenomenal four-year term for the
administration and outgoing Council. Over those four years, we saw unemployment
fall by more than half from 11.7 percent to 5.5 percent, with 2873 net new jobs
created over that period and a steady labor force.¬  We‚Äôve seen nearly a
half-billion dollars in private investment on city-supported projects over that
period. Our neighborhoods improved, while downtown saw a boom in dining and
retail establishments. Meanwhile population estimates suggest that the City
experienced its largest one-year increase in nearly a quarter-century, pointing
the way to further growth before the 2020 Census.
¬ 
**** Mission Statement and Three Lines of Effort ****
Everyone who has had a hand in the last few years‚Äô successes should be proud
of what we have achieved together. But we know that much work remains, and
tonight I would like to focus on the future. Not just the plans and programs,
but the approach and the values that will guide our work.
The mission statement for our administration is straightforward: we deliver
services that empower everyone to thrive.
Behind these eight words‚Äî‚ÄúWe deliver services that empower everyone to
thrive‚Äù‚Äîis a deeply held philosophy about why our city government exists in
the first place.
It is based on the idea of thriving. That can mean different things for
different people, but whatever it means to you, you are better able to thrive
if you live in a city that does its work well. That's why cities were formed,
going back to the first settlements millennia ago: human beings learned that we
have a better chance of thriving when we live in a community.
In our mission statement, the word ‚Äúeveryone‚Äù means everyone. It's not
enough if only some have a chance to thrive here. If prosperity is growing but
some are not able to participate, then we have our work cut out for us.
It's not up to us in city government to single-handedly cause everyone to
thrive. But we can help empower everyone to thrive. We can tear down the
obstacles that affect people's ability to thrive. When you are part of a
community that functions well, you are better empowered to live a life of your
choosing.
And everything we do to make that happen comes down to one word: service. That
is the thing we provide, every day and night, in order to make that these goals
can happen. It is what we do, day and night. Everything we offer, from a police
patrol to raft ride down the East Race, from a snow plow in the winter to an
emergency cooling center in the summer; it‚Äôs a service that exists to empower
everyone to thrive.
To meet this mission, we focus on three lines of effort, and if you work for
the City you've heard me talk about this before. First, we make the basics
easy. Second, we deliver good government. And third, we invest in people and
places.
These three lines of effort have defined our work up to today, and I‚Äôd like
to say more about how they will drive our work on the road ahead.
First, making the basics easy. For us, this means that the things you shouldn't
even have to think about are handled for you by a capable City. You‚Äôre not
empowered to thrive if snow is blocking your ability to get out of your
neighborhood. You‚Äôre not empowered to thrive if there's no one to come to
your rescue in a medical emergency. You‚Äôre not empowered to thrive if there
isn't clean, safe drinking water available on demand. Our goal is that the
basics of life are so easy that residents don't even realize we‚Äôre doing this
work--even though the work is never easy.
We‚Äôve just seen a tragic reminder of what happens when you can‚Äôt take the
basics for granted. Last week, I had the opportunity to spend time with the new
mayor of Flint, Michigan and discuss her efforts to lead a community forward
after it was literally poisoned by unsafe water. What happened in her city is a
reminder of how completely residents rely on cities to provide for basic needs.
It‚Äôs why our water works meets all of the Environmental Protection Agency‚Äôs
standards and regulations and it‚Äôs why our staff performs thousands of tests
to ensure safe drinking water, sourced from the Hilltop and the Saint Joseph
aquifers.
It‚Äôs not just water. It‚Äôs trash pickup, sewer works, and a hundred other
things we just count on getting done. It‚Äôs why we established the 311
service, which took over 142,000 calls last year. With an average wait time
below 20 seconds, 311 has handled everything from traffic signal requests to
animal control issues.
It‚Äôs why the Fire department spends time not only putting out fires but
preventing them. Last year the Fire Department provided hundreds of hours of
public education, installed hundreds of smoke and carbon monoxide alarms to
homeowners, and had contact with thousands of local children to stress the
importance of prevention in their homes and schools.
Going into 2016 and beyond, we will continue to work to make the basics easy so
that residents are empowered to focus on living the life of their choosing.
The infrastructure of our city‚Äîmuch of it unseen‚Äîremains a major area of
focus for this administration, with many improvements to come. As the world‚Äôs
first city to manage our waste water systems in the digital cloud, we will
continue to focus on managing what‚Äôs underground well, especially when it
comes to our federally mandated plan to separate City sewers to comply with the
clean water act. With hundreds of millions of dollars of spending required, we
will be using every tool available to us‚Äîtechnical, legal, and political‚Äîto
minimize the impact this work will have on ratepayers.
Meanwhile, a form of infrastructure we never used to think about‚Äîdigital
infrastructure‚Äîpresents a new challenge but also an opportunity to move South
Bend ahead of the rest. Thanks to a partnership with the leading community
benefactors, we are just weeks away from offering free Wi-Fi downtown through a
wireless mesh that will be expandable and usable in ways we haven‚Äôt even
fully imagined yet. I can‚Äôt wait to cut the ribbon‚Äîor perhaps cut the
Ethernet cable‚Äîon that important project to help accelerate downtown growth
and expand access.
When it comes to the most visible part of our infrastructure‚Äîgood old-
fashioned roads and streets‚Äîwe are closely watching developments in the
General Assembly in Indianapolis. I have crossed party lines to support the
road funding bill recently passed in the House, because I believe it represents
the best chance we‚Äôve had in years to ease our reliance on a shrinking gas
tax and fund our badly needed road improvements for the years to come.
If the first line of effort for meeting our mission is to make the basics easy
for residents, the second is to deliver good government. Good government means
putting residents first always, leading by example, gathering input and
transparently communicating our intentions, decisions, and actions.
It‚Äôs why we use 311 not just as a place residents can call, but as a source
of data for relentless performance improvement. It‚Äôs why we ask the City‚Äôs
new Chief Innovation Officer and Chief Technology Officer not just to fix
computers around the County-City building, but to develop strategies for using
technology to enhance transparency and empower residents. That‚Äôs why we care
so much about the awards South Bend received from the Government Finance
Officers of America for excellence in financial reporting and in budget
presentation‚Äîone of just two cities in Indiana to receive this level of
recognition for the soundness and transparency of our financial reporting.
It‚Äôs not about the books; it‚Äôs about using the books to empower residents
to hold their government accountable.
It‚Äôs why we were among the first to put checkbook-level data on all City
spending online for anyone to see. It‚Äôs what‚Äôs at stake in things like the
legal department‚Äôs handling of requests for information under the Access to
Public Records Act. They delivered 1,788 records last year alone, bringing the
total of this administration to 7,913‚Äîall without one finding of violation by
the Public Access Counselor.
Good government also means fiscal stewardship. Once again last year, the City
maintained our AA bond rating. Only 5 second-class cities in all of Indiana
have bond ratings at least this good‚Äîand the other four are wealthy
Indianapolis suburbs. That bond rating helped our finance team save taxpayers
$5.6 million last year alone by re-financing city bonds.
Meanwhile, our focus on safety has led to a workers‚Äô compensation cost that
is more than a third less than the state average. Making sure our workers are
healthy and safe isn‚Äôt just the right thing to do as an employer‚Äîit‚Äôs
also part of fiscal stewardship. That‚Äôs why last month we opened an employee
wellness clinic, which will not only benefit the City employees and family
members treated there, but all taxpayers, since it will help us to slow the
rise of employee health care costs.
Maybe the simplest way to see what the drive for good government looks like is
to visit the Code Enforcement department‚Äôs offices. In 2012, if you walked
into that office, paper was literally stacked so high that you couldn‚Äôt see
to the other side. Countless thousands of files cluttered the office and took
enormous time to physically search. We are now in the midst of a complete
transformation, and while I could quote you the numbers on what the use of
technology has meant in that department, the impact is best seen by simply
looking around at an office you can actually walk around in without tripping
over files, where hard-working inspectors are finally closing more cases than
we have opened in the last two years.
But we have to do even more to make sure that every resident has access to the
same information that administration officials have so they can participate in
an informed way in public debates. That means even more machine-readable data
on our open data portal, and updating the website to make it easier to navigate
and find city information later this year.
Meanwhile, to make sure the engine of government is in tune, we will continue
to refine our budget practices, including making our budget presentations even
more user-friendly. We will also begin to implement priority-based budgeting, a
new approach that will help use our scarce dollars based on what we most need
to achieve.
I am proud of our continued fiscal strength, but that fiscal strength is the
sum total of a thousand tough decisions, and there will be more ahead. In
particular, a looming fiscal cutoff in 2020 means we need to prepare now‚Äîas
early as the 2017 budget‚Äîby ensuring that our services are efficient and our
spending is prioritized.
This isn‚Äôt like the drastic fiscal cliff that Mayor Luecke‚Äôs administration
faced in 2008, but it is enough of a hit that we need to prepare. We will face
a shortfall currently estimated at nearly $7 million, and I will be working
with Council beginning this year to make sure we are dealing with this issue
well ahead of time to spare future pain.
I‚Äôve spoken of making sure the basics are easy and delivering good
government, two pillars of how we meet our mission to provide services that
empower everyone to thrive. Our third line of effort is to invest in people and
places. If the fundamentals of city government are there to make life here
possible, these investments are about helping make life here great.
Investing in places has continued to accelerate our City‚Äôs comeback. Last
year we saw 907 jobs created through the efforts of our Department of Community
Investment, drawing $164 million in private investment to our City.
And there‚Äôs more where that came from. Every day out my office window, I see
renovation work on the Chase Tower, a $31 million investment that will bring
183 new hotel rooms and 80 apartments to the heart of our city. There is a lot
of work to do, but we are expecting the lights to be on once again in the Chase
Tower in 2017.
That hotel will soon be joined by a five-story, 139-room hotel at the site of
the former College Football Hall of Fame, a Courtyard Marriott to be connected
with the Century Center by underground tunnel. This may sound like more
competition for existing hotels, but the reality is that everyone can gain from
access to new markets, competing for convention business that used to ignore us
because we did not have enough hotel rooms.
This year will see the biggest wave yet in what will eventually be hundreds of
new units of housing downtown. Construction is already underway on the former
LaSalle Hotel, Hoffman Hotel, JMS building, Hill and Colfax site, and former
Transpo Site, and more is forthcoming along the East Bank and River Race areas.
Investing in great places also means ensuring our City‚Äôs corridors are
something to be proud of. The West Side Main Streets corridor plan brought over
five million dollars in city investment to the West Side, with major
streetscape improvements to Lincoln Way West and Western Avenues, corridors
that have needed attention for years. These improvements came after an
extensive process of public engagement, featuring neighborhood stakeholder
committees and over a dozen public meetings. The move had its skeptics, but now
that the results are in, residents and businesses along the corridors are
already asking for more. A new fa√ßade matching grant program leveraged a total
investment of over $465,000 along Western Avenue and Lincoln Way West, with
more applications pending for the year to come.
I will admit that there has been a sacrifice involved: the commute on Lincoln
Way became longer. To get from downtown to the airport just outside the city
limits at rush hour now takes seven minutes, according to the South Bend
Tribune. I believe it used to take six and a half minutes. I also believe the
benefit was worth the cost for a streetscape that is safer for pedestrians and
drivers, and more supportive of small businesses along the way.
Every area where we have implemented Smart Streets, from William and Lafayette
downtown, to Jefferson on the East Side, and Lincoln Way West and Western on
the West Side, has seen skeptics become supporters once they see the results.
But the biggest transformation of all will take place in 2016.
This year will see the majority of the downtown phase of Smart Streets
completed, from Chippewa in the South to Bartlett in the North, as we convert
Michigan, Main, and St. Joseph Streets to a 2-way pattern including center turn
lanes and partial protected bike lanes, and introduce roundabouts in strategic
places to enhance safety and traffic flow.
I want to be very honest with the public about this: there will be disruption
in 2016 as a result of this project. Beginning this spring, traffic will flow
in reduced lanes, and for about three months in late summer, the intersections
of Michigan at Bartlett Street and Marion Streets will close entirely, except
for access to the hospital. This means that commuters will have to temporarily
find new routes and/or deal with an increase in commute time during this
project. Given a choice of spreading this effort over years versus getting it
done quickly, we opted to ‚Äúrip off the band-aid‚Äù as quickly as possible.
The inconvenience will be real and significant. But I am firmly convinced that
the end result will be a better streetscape, a better downtown, and ultimately
a better South Bend.
Investing in people and places also means investing in neighborhoods. We have
continued to support neighborhood quality of life enhancements like curbs and
sidewalks, installing 34,019 feet of new sidewalk and 13,927 feet of new curbs,
and adding 189 ramps to make intersections wheelchair-accessible.
We planted 821 trees last year in the course of our place-making projects as
part of a number of projects to invest in great places around our city, and the
Light Up South Bend program completed its latest phase. Driven by Council
Members Tim Scott and Karen White in partnership with the administration and
Indiana Michigan Power, Light Up South Bend added 70 new lights to the
Southeast Side, building on previous work in LaSalle Park and Keller Park
neighborhood.
And, of course, we are investing in our treasured Parks and Recreation system.
We are now in year three of a five-year master plan, and we‚Äôre deploying
resources from a $5 million parks bond approved last year. Most of the work is
still to come, but already we have upgraded playground equipment at Boland
Park, initiated landscaping improvements at Pinhook, brought new concessions to
Leeper Park‚Äôs Tennis Courts and installed new LED lighting on our river walk.
Major projects ahead include improvements to the Charles Black Center, the
Howard Park Ice Rink, Kelly Playground, Kennedy Park, Fremont Park, and a new
Aerial Adventure Park at Rum Village. Along our river, the former Notre Dame
boathouse will be converted for use by the community, and we will undertake
many less visible but very important investments in maintenance needs like air
conditioners and boilers.
I am thrilled that we will soon be able to deliver these improvements. But the
truth is that there is much more we can and should do, and I will be asking our
Parks and Recreation staff and Board to evaluate the potential for a second
parks bond to carry these investments even further.
Speaking of parks, as you may have seen in the media, there is considerable
community interest in the future of Elbel Golf Course and the surrounding
wetlands. I appreciate the Common Council‚Äôs decision help make sure this
issue gets looked at from all angles. While nothing has been decided yet about
the future, I will say that any resolution will have to meet several goals,
including: maintaining golf at least in the medium term, protecting the nearby
wetlands, accommodating public access, and reducing the drain on City funds.
Moving forward, I expect the process to be exemplary in its inclusion of
diverse community voices and perspectives so we can find the best solution for
the community going forward.
The big picture for our parks and recreation system is this: we have limited
resources but unlimited imagination when it comes to making sure these great
public spaces contribute to active lifestyles and public health, economic
growth, inclusive recreation, preservation of green space, and distinctive
quality of place. Everything we do with parks and recreation will be in
furtherance of these goals, building toward a twofold vision: first, everyone
should be able to enjoy a park near their home, and secondly, the system should
feature unique spaces that the whole City is proud of. I have every aspiration
and expectation that this administration will leave our city‚Äôs network of
parks and public spaces better than we found it.
Not only are we investing in parks, but we are also preparing to reimagine the
way our key assets are managed. The City has an array of resources that enhance
quality of life in the city, including 60 parks and recreation assets,
facilities like the Century Center, the Morris Performing Arts Center and
Palais Royale (which, by the way, just won the prestigious League of American
Theaters 2015 Outstanding Theater Award), and several parking garages‚Äîplus
terrific partner organizations like DTSB.
Now is the right time for us to make sure all these great assets work in
harmony with each other, with a shared vision and better opportunities for
collaboration and specialization across these areas for the benefit of the
City. I will be asking our Parks Superintendent and former DTSB director, Aaron
Perri, to take the lead in ensuring these resources are managed as part of a
holistic vision for the quality of life of our community, and we will keep the
Council updated on any organizational adjustments we feel are needed in order
to make the most of these community treasures.
Crucially, we don‚Äôt only invest in places. We‚Äôre mindful that investing in
people can be just as important, and economic development increasingly means
making sure we have a workforce of residents ready to take advantage of the
economic opportunities to come. That‚Äôs why the SMART workforce program offers
sector-based training to help workers prepare for opportunities, placing 26 of
the 39 initial graduate into new employment already.
Last summer I had the opportunity to tour a vegetable garden with a hundred
4th-graders from Kennedy school. That was different example of investing in
people‚Äîinvesting in our kids. And thanks to the leadership of the St. Joseph
County Health Department and the Reducing Obesity Coalition of St. Joseph
County, working with the City, Schools, and other community partners, we were
recognized by First Lady Michelle Obama as the first city in Indiana to meet
all five goals of the ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Move!‚Äù initiative for healthy kids.
I believe that the future of development in cities will be focus on investing
in people at least as much as we invest in real estate. From workforce
development efforts to new partnerships with our school corporation, we will
continue to seek out ways to do just that during the year and years to come.
¬ 
**** Five core values for the administration ****
These three major areas of focus‚Äîmaking the basics easy, delivering good
government, and investing in people and places‚Äîwill continue to animate
everything we do. Competing priorities will be tested based on how well they
meet one or more of these lines of effort in support of our mission‚Äîto
deliver services that empower everyone to thrive‚Äîbecause that is why we are
here.
But it's not just what we do‚Äîit's how we do business that matters. To guide
the years ahead, I would like to focus on five values that define what kind of
administration‚Äîand community‚Äîwe are.
In all our work, we will be pursuing the values of excellence, accountability,
innovation, inclusion, and empowerment. We will communicate constantly about
this so that by the end of this year, every City employee at every level to be
able to describe what these values mean to them.
Excellence, to us, means setting a goal for everything that this administration
does to be the best in the State of Indiana, and/or in the top 25% of the
country. We will relentlessly measure and evaluate where we stand to see if we
are the best in the state. When we are, we will work to stay that way. When
we‚Äôre not, we will build plans to move in that direction.
I‚Äôve spoken earlier about our City‚Äôs excellence when it comes to financial
management, smart infrastructure, and public places. We have also been
recognized for excellence in the way we do business. Recently we received a
national award from the NewDEAL Network and Governing Magazine for using data
to engage neighborhoods, and just yesterday the National Association of Clean
Water Agencies recognized the City with the Public Service Award and the
Operations and Environmental Performance Award.‚Äîthe only city to receive two
National Environmental Achievement Awards from that organization this year.
Sometimes excellence comes in a dimension that doesn‚Äôt win awards, but
matters hugely to our most vulnerable. When the South Bend Animal Care and
Control increased the live transfer rate for dogs thanks to their good work and
partnerships with volunteers and organizations like Care of South Bend, the
euthanasia rate fell well below the average for open admission shelters. I
don‚Äôt know if there are awards for that sort of thing, but I do know it means
a lot to the four-legged community.
Excellence is why we will spend much of this year updating our performance
management to make sure we are tracking progress, reporting problems, and
celebrating success in our city team.
Next to excellence comes the value of accountability. Accountability means we
put residents first always, offering services at the greatest value to the
taxpayer, with clear and transparent indications of how the government is using
public resources. We want all of our intentions and actions to be clear, and we
expect to be held accountable for the results.¬ 
Accountability means that everyone in this administration must step up and take
ownership of our outcomes and the way we get there. That‚Äôs true for internal
management, and for how we engage the public.
We are also ensuring that accountability is a tool for building confidence in
law enforcement. This trust will grow as we make more data publicly available.
For example, our police chief wants the community to know that instances of the
use of force are down 10% from a year ago, and that 99.97% arrests do not
involve uses of force. To build trust, we need to put the data‚Äîgood, bad, or
indifferent‚Äîout for the community to see, and I look forward later this year
to announcing new tools that will help us to do exactly that.
Not only do residents hold us accountable; they turn to the city‚Äôs law and
code enforcement to hold others accountable when they affect their neighbors‚Äô
ability to thrive. It is a source of pride that last year over 200 vacant and
abandoned homes were ultimately repaired privately, by the owner, as a result
of enforcement action without use of taxpayer funds. At the same time, we have
worked to be reasonable, using tools like cash performance bonds and repair
agreements in code enforcement to work with owners willing and able to make
their properties safe again.
Our legal department has also driven accountability by increasing collection
rates on outstanding fines and fees‚Äînot to be more punitive, but to make sure
these costs do not wind up unfairly falling on the rest of the taxpayers of
this community. By more than doubling EMS collections, the department of law
has helped our Fire Department gather needed funds to keep residents safe. By
tripling code enforcement collections, they have protected neighborhoods from
unsafe buildings. And by more than doubling collections on property damage,
they have made sure that ordinary taxpayers do not bear the burden of harm to
city equipment.
An upcoming landlord registration bill in Council will further enhance
accountability by ensuring that the City has a point of contact for every
property we encounter. This isn‚Äôt just about finding irresponsible landlords;
it‚Äôs about making sure we are able to stay in touch with the majority of
landlords who do the right thing.
And our Human Rights Commission makes sure we have a culture of accountability
when it comes to the city‚Äôs commitment to treating everyone equally. Handling
over 5,000 inquiries last year alone, the Human Rights Commission has done
remarkable work to ensure that everyone can count on being treated equally and
with respect when it comes to public accommodation in our community.
Going forward, we will continue to stress accountability, internally and
externally, with a particular focus on making sure that residents have the
tools to hold us accountable for the quality of service we provide.
The value of innovation means that we deliver better services ever more
efficiently by introducing creative approaches to government operations,
questioning habit and using evidence to continuously improve. When I ask why we
do things a certain way, there‚Äôs only one truly wrong answer: ‚Äúwe do it
this way because we‚Äôve always done it this way.‚Äù
The South Bend Office of Innovation has helped put our City on the national map
when it comes to creative problem-solving. In September, South Bend was one of
two cities featured at the White House to help announce the MetroLab network, a
national collaboration featuring 22 city-university partnerships that advance
the research, development, and deployment of smart solutions to urban problems.
I‚Äôm looking forward to future results from our collaboration with the
University of Notre Dame on this important initiative.
Practicing the value of innovation is a big part of how our Sustainability team
has made our city more environmentally responsible, helping up to 16 city
facilities establish free recycling, and helping to install a rooftop solar
demonstration at Century Center. The team‚Äôs work was even recognized by the
EPA for diverting waste and ensuring recycling at the SB150 celebration
weekend.
Sometimes innovation builds upon itself; after the Council passed an innovative
food truck ordinance, our team created an online tracker that shows on a
dynamic map where the food trucks are actually located. We're working on
another online tool to visualize vacant lots, so residents and potential
investors or nonprofits can find ways to research and evaluate vacant land in
the City.
Innovation isn‚Äôt something we do for its own sake. It helps us serve
residents better‚Äîlike fixes to our trash system that cut missed trash pickups
in half and led to a 75% reduction in solid waste complaints thanks to better
management and use of 311 data. And it saves on the bottom line for taxpayers,
saving $85,000 last year by using cleaner-burning natural gas in our city
fleet, or an innovative energy efficiency contract at Century Center that will
save nearly $8 million over 15 years.
Next, I‚Äôd like to discuss the value of inclusion. That means we ensure the
City administration, both as an employer and as a purchaser, reflects the
community we serve and includes diverse voices in our decision-making and
actions. We often talk about diversity in city government, but there is more to
the story than that. Diversity has to do with who is in the room. Inclusion has
to do with making sure those different voices in the room truly are heard.
We‚Äôve been working on this from day one, and making progress. As an employer,
we have had initiatives like the successful Women‚Äôs Leadership Conference for
networking and idea-sharing among female employees. Departments like our Fire
Department have made attracting a diverse talent pool a priority. The results
are impressive: the latest pool had 512 applicants, including 34% minority and
female applicants. Meanwhile, the Police Department is already underway on
training in Fair and Impartial Policing, Procedural Justice, Reconciliation,
and Implicit Bias.
As a purchaser, we have worked under the Diversity Utilization ordinance to
conduct city-wide training and data collection on the inclusion of women and
minority business enterprises in the city‚Äôs bid and quote process.
These efforts count, but like every diverse city in America that is being
honest with itself right now, we know we can do more. That‚Äôs why this year,
on Dr. King‚Äôs birthday, I signed an executive order establishing the overall
policy for Diversity and Inclusion that will guide me and our leadership team
during my second term. The order makes it the policy of the city to
‚Äúchallenge itself to become a model of equal opportunity, diversity, and
inclusion in its workplace and through its procurement of goods and
services.‚Äù
A more diverse and inclusive environment is not the work of any one person or
one committee‚Äîit is the responsibility of every single member of our
administration, and indeed every member of our community. The executive order
calls on every city department to play a role, and every city policy to come
under consideration, as we establish a proactive plan to be delivered later
this year that will guide our actions in every department over the next four
years and beyond.
The new Diversity and Inclusion Officer will lead this process. We are
interviewing finalists and hope to announce this new city leader shortly.
Having a full-time professional expert at expanding diversity and inclusion
will make us more effective in living up to this value in an administration
that truly reflects the community we serve.
We do this not to check a box or to look good, but because it makes us all
better at our jobs. Research shows that even private companies with diverse
executive teams financially outperform less diversely-led companies. I can see
it in our own work. Having a Department of Law that is a regional model for
diversity and inclusion is, I am convinced, part of why the Corporation Counsel
has delivered such extraordinary results. Having one of the most diverse
mayor‚Äôs office staffs in the state doesn‚Äôt just make us a more inclusive
team, it makes me a better mayor.
Last but certainly not least is empowerment. For us that means ensuring we have
a work environment that enables employees to contribute richly to the
administration and the community, taking pride and ownership in their work.
Many great ideas in City government lately have come up the ranks, not from the
top down, and we aim to continue that.
Some of the most memorable events I‚Äôve attended‚Äîfrom a Veteran‚Äôs Day
event for city employees to a program that saves the lives of un-adopted pets
by coaching juveniles in detention to train them to overcome behavior
issues‚Äîcame from the ranks of our police officers. Our code enforcement
officers have continued to take asbestos certification training, growing their
skill set while saving taxpayer money on contractors. And as we speak, there
are billboards across town celebrating Black History Month thanks to a
partnership that started with an idea from the administrative assistant in my
office.
Empowering employees is one reason the City is in the first of a three-year
plan to elevate the minimum wage we pay our workers to $10.10. In real dollars,
that‚Äôs what the federal minimum wage would be if it just kept up with
inflation since it was introduced in 1968. I know we are not the only local
employer to see this as important. We want to lead by example, and I hope more
employers in the community join us in elevating the standard of living of our
people so that they are empowered to bring their best selves to work every day.
Empowering employees is part of the ‚Äúhow;‚Äù empowering residents is the
‚Äúwhy.‚Äù We thrive when ours is a community of residents empowered to live
the life of their choosing.
That‚Äôs why we continue to pursue a municipal ID program that empowers
everyone who calls South Bend to become a card-carrying member of our City and
use it as a way to say they live here and prove who they are. The Council
authorized the budget for this program, and we are working through logistical
and legal issues to bring it forward soon.
And it‚Äôs why we have answered President Obama‚Äôs call and joined the White
House‚Äôs ‚ÄúMy Brother‚Äôs Keeper‚Äù initiative, setting out to empower young
men and boys of color to live better lives through an emphasis on early
childhood education and neighborhood violence reduction.
We‚Äôre working with some of the most at-risk youth in our community through
the Made program at the Martin Luther King Center, empowering local teens to
make better choices in their lives.
We‚Äôre working to empower residents to continue living in their homes, thanks
to the South Bend Home Improvement Program and Rebuilding Together, which
combined contributed to more than 62 owner-occupied home repairs last year for
low-income and senior residents. Meanwhile South Bend Mutual homes is
empowering low-income residents to take charge of their financial future while
living in a new co-operative housing development, right where vacant and
abandoned housing used to stand on the West Side.
We‚Äôre even using empowerment as a strategy in law enforcement. Our police
don‚Äôt only track investigations and arrests; they track how many positive
contacts there are with members of the community, including 450 contacts made
through community policing, 413 kids served through the Police Athletic League,
and over 1000 participants in Police-sponsored Cinco de Mayo and Dia de los
Reyes events in the last year.
And we will do everything we can to empower our kids to succeed in life, which
is why I am closely following the School Board‚Äôs search for a new
superintendent, and will continue to seek out ways the City can be a supportive
partner to our independent School Corporation.
¬ 
**** Values at work in the community ****
These aren‚Äôt just administration values. They capture something about South
Bend at large. Every day I see some example of how these values play out in our
community. And I see a City that is ready to meet future challenges to live
these values in a meaningful way.
Excellence as I have defined it‚Äîbeing at or near the top in the state or
indeed the country‚Äîhas been on display across this City, last year and every
year. Whether it‚Äôs unique moments like the South Bend Cubs earning the John
H. Johnson Award for being the best club in all of Minor League Baseball, or
annual events like the Fischoff continuing its work as the world‚Äôs leading
chamber music competition; whether it‚Äôs the Community Foundation-led ‚ÄúGive
Local‚Äù campaign raising more nonprofit donations than almost any other
location in the country last May‚Äî$6.7 million in one day‚Äîor the globally
recognized performances of the Toradze Piano studio whose home is right in this
building‚Äîour community is full of people doing extraordinary things that mark
them among the best in the country or even the world.
Our community is full of innovation. A group of young artists taking over an
empty mansion and then the basement of a former power plant to create
distinctive local art‚Äîthat‚Äôs innovation. So is Make South Bend, a local
outpost of the maker movement that creates and markets recreated and assembled
products, or the social enterprise Angels‚Äô Wings, which helps low income
people get to work through ride sharing. It‚Äôs everywhere from the high-tech
startups of Innovation and Ignition Park to the pay-it-forward coffee shop in
the Near Northwest Neighborhood.
The spirit of inclusion is rich in our community, exemplified by the phenomenal
work done at the Taste of Peace, or Martin Luther King Jr. Day. It is lived by
the local interfaith organizations that reach across religious boundaries at a
time when intolerance has grown to a frightening fever-pitch in the national
presidential campaign. It is lived by local faith-based and nonprofit groups
that help immigrant and refugee families live up to their potential as some of
our most productive community members‚Äînot as scapegoats in political theater.
It is lived by those who put stickers in the windows of their businesses at a
time when our state legislature had the whole country wondering if Indiana is a
welcoming place, saying yes, South Bend is an open City.
And when it comes to empowerment‚Äîwell in a way that‚Äôs what South Bend does
best. I‚Äôve seen it for myself. I‚Äôve seen 7th graders from some of our most
at-risk neighborhoods learning to build websites through the South Bend Code
School. I‚Äôve seen low-income residents getting needed loans through a
financial inclusion organization created and staffed by undergraduates, and
I‚Äôve seen a school principal collaborating with professional artists,
volunteers, and kids to completely transform the face of Perley Fine Arts
Academy with a participatory mural. Every day from my desk I see a crane
building a Children‚Äôs Hospital that will empower families to live better
lives because they will no longer have to travel to Chicago or Indianapolis for
specialized pediatric services.
I‚Äôve seen local faith leaders assemble a truckload of water to go to Flint,
Michigan and help with the water crisis; and I‚Äôve seen neighborhood youth
overcome challenges to perform Shakespeare like professional thespians.
Every day, you see these values displayed in our community, by people leading
organizations and people leading ordinary lives.
Not everything in the next year, or the next four years, will come easy. It
will take hard work, focus, discipline, and‚Äîyes‚Äîvigorous and healthy debate
over exactly how we move ahead.
Occasionally we have been questioned for moving too quickly. I understand where
that comes from, and I recognize that sometimes, you have to tap the brakes and
make sure of where we‚Äôre going. But the successes of these recent years show
that we are on the right track.
If we look like we‚Äôre in a hurry, it‚Äôs because there is not a moment to
lose. The future is getting brighter by the day, just like the accelerating
return of sunlight that comes to us every year in February and March.
The first half of this decade proved that South Bend is alive and growing, and
SB150 established once and for all that South Bend is back. Let‚Äôs enter the
second half of this decade confident that every problem before us can be
tackled with the tools in our hands.
Guided by our values, we‚Äôll use those tools expeditiously‚Äîand
wisely‚Äîbecause whatever else South Bend is, above all, South Bend is home.
