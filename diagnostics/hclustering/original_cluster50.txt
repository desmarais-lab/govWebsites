MESSAGE FROM OUR CHIEF

On Friday, April 29, 2016, the Hobart Police Department’s three newest recruits will graduate
from the Northwest Indiana Law Enforcement Academy (NILEA). It is a 15-week program
required of all police officers in the State of Indiana. The Hobart Police Department shares its
facility with NILEA, which is only 1 of 7 accredited academies in the state.
The professional staff of full-time and many part-time instructors make it all possible. This
class will graduate 26 new police officers for Northwest Indiana. Our 3 recruits, Jared Havens,
Michael Trajkovski, and Jason Hayes were hired in the fall and winter of last year and had to
wait until January to begin their academy training. Should you recognize them out working, I
encourage you to shake their hand and thank them for their service.
Now that the academy training is complete, they will undergo a rigid field training program
with seasoned officers to ensure they are comfortable in every aspect of the job. This training
could take a couple months to complete. Havens and Trajkovski came from our Reserve
Officer Program, and they may acclimate a little faster due to their experiences as reserve
officers for us. Hayes had some prior experience from New Chicago, which should help him
along the way, also.

Jared Havens
Michael Trajkovski
Jason Hayes
The Reserve Officer Program is a combination of volunteers that either have an interest in law
enforcement as a career or simply enjoy participating in the program as a hobby. As a group,
they dedicate thousands of hours annually to assisting the Hobart Police Department.
In return for their dedication, we try to provide them with training and guidance to keep them
safe and make their experience enjoyable. From the portion of volunteers that have a career
interest in the field, we get a chance to know them and their work ethic and often hire many of
them as full-time police officers.
Over a dozen of our existing officers began as Reserve Officers. Many others have gone on to
work for other law enforcement agencies as well. The Reserve Officer Program has helped us
maintain our commitment to public service without straining the finances of our community.
We just had a number of reserve candidates complete our pre-basic training, which is required
to becoming a reserve officer. We will swear them in at 4 or so at a time to ensure that we can
adequately train them. It is a regular struggle to keep our reserve staffing near 20 reserve
officers, since they are regularly getting hired full-time by us or other local agencies. Some also
find that they do not have the personal time to dedicate to the training. In 2015, reserve
officers logged over 6,000 hours of service to the community. We are very blessed to have
such a commitment from our volunteers.

Bogus Debts. Bogus Collections
At the FTC, we sue abusive debt collectors and try to do right by people who’ve been harmed by
unlawful practices. But we also try to protect people from being harmed in the first place. That’s exactly
why I’m here: to warn you about debt collectors calling about debts that the FTC knows are bogus.
The bogus debts supposedly are payday loans from these companies: USFastCash, 500FastCash,
OneClickCash, Ameriloan, United Cash Loans, AdvantageCashServices, or StarCashProcessing. The
companies are real, but if you’re hearing from anyone other than those companies, the debts are fake and
you don’t need to pay.
Sometimes, if they can’t collect money owed to them, companies sell lists of those debts to debt
collectors. But, in this case, we know that didn’t happen. The company that processed and serviced loans
from these companies told the FTC that it never sold any customer or account information to debt
collectors. Their lawyer even filed a legal declaration saying that.
Even so, we’ve still heard about abusive calls from debt collectors claiming to be collecting money owed
to the companies listed above – and we already know that’s not true. But we also know that many of the
people who have been called never even had a loan with those lenders in the first place – so the debts
themselves also are bogus.
What to do if you get a call from a debt collector who says you owe money to one of those companies?
You have rights. Ask for a validation notice, which says what you owe and to whom. After you get it,
consider sending a letter saying that you don’t owe the debt. If you’re getting debt collection calls, check
your credit report. If a debt you don’t recognize shows up there, follow the instructions to dispute the
debt. And, as always,report any problems to the FTC ( 1-877-382-4357).

8 Juveniles Arrested

Code Enforcement Section-Sgt. Ron Russo
Hello all,
Well, Spring is here, and things are starting to green up. That means it's the busy season for us here in Code Enforcement Services. Beginning
this week we will start to check our old high grass calls for service from last year in an attempt to get a head start on what will likely be a very
busy grass season. I'd like to remind everyone a few things regarding the procedure we must follow for high grass reports (notice I say must here
- this is governed by IN State Law and Local Ordinance). First, we must confirm a violation exists - a violation is grass, weeds, or noxious
vegetation in excess of 6" upon the property. Then we must post a 5 day notice at the property to the property owner/controller, and send a
copy of the letter via Certified US Mail to the property owner/controller's last known address. After 5 days elapses, we follow up on the 6th day,
to allow for lag times in the US Mail, and to ensure a full 5 days / 120 hours has passed since the notice was posted. At this time, if there is
non-compliance, we will issue a citation and send one of our contracted lawn services to the property to mow the grass. There may be a delay
for them to get there as well, but we try to limit that to 24 to 48 hours.
The reason why I'm informing you all of this is because, as you can tell, this is a very time consuming process, which requires patience on all
parties to be successful. In 2015, 27% of high grass reports we received went unfounded (a 7% increase over 2014); which means the grass was
mowed upon our arrival. That being said, I'd like to stress that, before you call to report the condition of a piece of property, please ensure that:
1. a violation exists, and 2. the violation isn't just the result of the owner/controller not having time to get out there to mow. I understand that
we all have different ideas on what constitutes good property maintenance, and sometimes a piece of property may not be maintained up to a
certain person's standard; however, it could still be well within the law. Also, please understand that everyone keeps different schedules, and not
everyone is able to mow 2 or 3 times a week.
And lastly, as much as I stress patience on occupied homes, I would request early reports on vacant homes. These homes generally end up
maintained by the City of Hobart, and the cost to mow is much less when the grass is between 6-8 inches, than it is when it gets to 1-2 feet high.
Thank you, and happy mowing!

PUBLIC RELATIONS

MESSAGE FROM OUR CHIEF

We have been really hearing some big boomers this year. To the point, we are going to have to
take greater enforcement action to curb this behavior. To the violators, your neighbors do not
enjoy their windows rattling while watching television or the family pets running for cover like
it is some kind of war zone. We are going to come to your house, write you a citation that
could cost you from $100.00 to $2,500.00, and we are going to confiscate your illegal goods.
There are certain days a year that you get a free pass on the legal fireworks, please keep it to the
confines of that time period.
We want to remind everyone to keep it legal with regard to fireworks. While the State of
Indiana’s statutes are very convoluted on the issue of fireworks, it is very rare when someone
possesses or ignites a firework that they did not know or suspect was illegal. The number of
injuries and emergency room visits due to fireworks always start to climb in the month of June.
Keep them legal, in the hands or supervision of responsible adults, and limit them to the
appropriate locations. All of these things are common sense.
Private fireworks ARE NOT PERMITTED at the 4th of July parade or at the City Fireworks
event. The risk of injury with those types of crowds is just too great. When coming or going
from the events, please take your time; it is summertime, and pedestrian traffic will be heavy.
Below I have included some excerpts of the City Ordinance Chapter that covers Fireworks in
the City of Hobart. It also regulates the times permitted for legal use of the consumer
fireworks. This is very important, because whether your firework is legal to use or not, it is
only permitted during these time periods. It is the one area of the regulation that simplifies
enforcement. I have also included the penalty section. Please notice the potential costs of the
city ordinance ticket should you be cited. We hope it encourages compliance; we hope we can
avoid having to take an enforcement action; however, inevitably some choose to be foolish.
CHAPTER 98: FIREWORKS

…CONSUMER FIREWORKS….

(B) Days and hours of use. Consumer fireworks may not be used, ignited or discharged
within the corporate limits of the City of Hobart except during the following times:
(1) Between the hours of 5:00 p.m. and 2 hours after sunset on June 29, June 30, July
1, July 2, July 3, July 5, July 6, July 7, July 8 and July 9;
(2) Between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and twelve midnight on July 4; and
(3) Between the hours of 10:00 a.m. on December 31 and 1:00 a.m. on January 1.
(Ord. 2007-19, § 1)
§ 98.99 PENALTY.
The use, ignition or discharge of consumer fireworks other than during the above time
periods allowed by this section shall constitute an ordinance violation. The first offense
in each calendar year is subject to a minimum fine of $100.00. Subsequent offenses in the
same year as the first offense are subject to fine in an amount not to exceed $2,500.
(Ord. 2007-19, § 2; Ord. 2009-17, §)
The Hobart Police Department wants to encourage you to have a fun and safe holiday and
summer. We encourage you to be respectful and neighborly, and please call us for assistance
when you need us.

Festival Goers Fooled by Faked Tickets and Events
This summer, don't fall for a festival scam. Scammers are tempting would-be festival goers
into buying tickets for events promising all-you-can-eat crabs, live music and other fun. But
in reality, either the ticket or the event itself is fake.
How the Scam Works:
You see a great deal on tickets to a summer festival in your city, usually through a social media link. For a
reasonable entrance fee, the festival offers delicious food such as all-you-can-eat crabs, live music, and/or
craft beer and wine. You click the link, and it takes you to a website to buy tickets. Just enter your credit
card information, and you are set.
Don't do it! Better Business Bureaus across North America have reported fake festival sign-ups. Victims
purchase tickets and show up at the time and location, only to find a crowd of frustrated ticket holders.
Other times, the festival is real, but the tickets are fake.
How to Spot a Fake Festival Scam:
 Do your research before purchasing. Search online for the name of the festival and make sure the
name advertised matches the website. Scammers often use names that sound similar to those of real
festivals.
 Check for (working) contact information: Be sure the festival website has a phone number and
email address.
 Prices too good to be true: There is no way a festival can offer tickets at extremely low prices
without losing money. If the prices are much lower than elsewhere, it's likely a scam.
What Can You Do?
 Pay with a credit card: You can dispute the charges if the business doesn't come through. Be wary
of online sellers that don’t accept credit cards.
 Look for secure sites: The website should begin with https (the extra “s” is for secure) and have a
little lock symbol on the address bar.
Avoid tickets sold on Craigslist and other free online listings: Scammers are skilled at providing
realistic tickets and fake receipts. Check out third-party ticket sites at bbb.org before making purchases.

other scams, check out BBB Scam Stopper (bbb.org/scam). To report a scam, go to BBB Scam Tracker

Scammers Can Fake Caller ID Info
Your phone rings. You recognize the number, but when you pick up, it’s someone else. What’s the deal?
Scammers are using fake caller ID information to trick you into thinking they are someone local, someone
you trust – like a government agency or police department, or a company you do business with – like your
bank or cable provider. The practice is called caller ID spoofing, and scammers don’t care whose phone
number they use. One scammer recently used the phone number of an Federal Trade Commission
employee.
Don’t rely on caller ID to verify who’s calling. It can be nearly impossible to tell whether the caller ID
information is real. Here are a few tips for handling these calls:


If you get a strange call from the government, hang up. If you want to check it out, visit the official
(.gov) website for contact information. Government employees won’t call out of the blue to demand
money or account information.

Don’t give out — or confirm — your personal or financial information to someone who calls.
 Don’t wire money or send money using a reloadable card. In fact, never pay someone who calls out
of the blue, even if the name or number on the caller ID looks legit.
 Feeling pressured to act immediately? Hang up. That’s a sure sign of a scam.

Skimmers Steal Customer Card Info at Stores
Next time you use the self-checkout lane at a store, be sure to take a second look at the machine you use to swipe your
credit or debit card. Scammers are installing "skimmers," devices that collect the data from credit, debit or ATM cards, on
these machines.
How the Scam Works:
You are checking out at the supermarket or another large store, and you decide to use the self-checkout lane. You ring up
your purchases and swipe your credit or debit card to pay the bill. You may not notice anything strange about the
card processor, but scammers have attached a skimmer to some registers. These devices "skim" your card's information off
the magnetic strip.
Skimmers are most commonly installed on ATM card readers. But in the past few months, several big box stores have
found them attached to the payment processors in self-checkout aisles. Be careful when using these lanes and follow the
advice below for spotting a skimmer.
Protect Yourself from a Skimmer:
 Pay with a credit card or cash: You aren't liable for fraudulent charges on your credit card (but be sure to report
them to your bank). But if scammers gain your debit card info, they may be able to drain your account.
 Protect your PIN. Place your hand or a piece of paper over the keypad when entering your number. Some scammers
set up a video camera nearby to record customers entering their PINs.
 Look for signs of skimmers. Tape is often used to attach the skimming devices; if something looks odd, wiggle it to
make sure it doesn't come loose.
 Use chip readers when available: The new credit/debit card processors -- which require you to "dip" a chip card
instead of swipe the magnetic stripe -- are more secure. Check to see that your credit and debit cards have them, and
use them whenever possible.
 Be wary of strange signs. Some con artists attach signs to ATMs or card processors providing alternate instructions,
such as telling users to swipe their card on a separate reader first. If something looks out of place, find a different
machine and report it to the store manager or the police.

MESSAGE FROM OUR CHIEF
CRESSMOOR UPDATE
As an update on the Code Enforcement front, the Board of Public Works & Safety has given
the new ownership of Cressmoor Trailer Park 90 days to iron out legal and physical ownership
of the trailers remaining in the park. The new park management has been in agreement with
the city’s efforts to continue to clean up the blight. Since the city removed 19 trailers, the new
management has also removed more trailers that were not salvageable, and cleaned up
hundreds of yards of refuse.
During this 90 day period, the park management will confirm legal ownership with those
physically possessing the trailers, and give them a list of things to make them safe and to
remain habitable. After the 90 day time table, the building department inspectors will go in to
individual trailers and inspect utilities and ensure that the space is clean and safe to live in.
If there is something lacking, the inspectors will advise them on how to get into compliance.
We want to thank the remaining residents and the new management for working with us to
ensure that each trailer is a clean, safe place to live.
POLICE OFFICERS GET NEEDED TRAINING AND EQUIPMENT
On June 6 & 7, St. Mary’s Medical Center will begin training our police officers in the
dispensing of Naloxone or Narcan. It is dispensed intramuscular or as a nasal spray. The drug
is commonly used to reverse the effects of heroin overdose, although, it can reverse the effects
of any narcotics overdose.
St. Mary’s Medical Center, in partnership with the City of Hobart, Town of New Chicago, and
City of Lake Station will provide the training, the pharmaceutical and dispensary kit, and the
replacement drug after the Narcan use or expiration. The retail costs of a kit, which can only
be dispensed from a pharmacy, can range from $60 - $100 each. Again, the results are priceless
to the victim in need.
I can admit that I had some hesitation with asking officers to distribute medicine to drug users.
The reality is that as police officers, we often render aid to people that may not want it. While
it is common for a victim to recover from one overdose, and then turn around and suffer a
fatal overdose a few weeks later. It is also very common for the person that just overdosed to
come out of the condition fighting mad and physically combative.
The fact is that no one can accurately predict how one’s life will turn out after a saving dose of
Narcan after an overdose. They may go on to cherish the life they have been given, and be
productive members of society. In one’s time of need, it is not time for us to judge; it is our
responsibility to provide help where help is needed.
Narcan has also been used to save officers’ lives when accidently exposed to lethal skin contact
with certain drugs, such as fentynol. In addition to saving the overdose, the police will identify
and track an individual’s progress after the initial encounter. We want to show them the way
to the whole host of services available that help in the treatment to their addictions.
Our community and our police department will be better for its efforts.

H.P.D. BI -WEEKLY NEWSLETTER

We recently had a Hobart resident bring in a letter and check pertaining to this exact type of scam. The
letter, check, and even postal envelope look extremely convincing. We found an article to help look for
tips to prevent becoming the mystery shoppers next victim.

Beware of Mystery Shopper Scams
I confess… I once was a mystery shopper. Decades ago, I shopped at stores to see what they were
charging for certain products and visited restaurant chains to evaluate the food and service. I wrote up a
report, sent it in, and received a check for my work. Nothing I could make a living from, but it helped
fill the gas tank.
Back then, it didn’t occur to me that responding to a mystery or secret shopper ad could set me up for a
scam. Now I know – if you’re looking to make extra money as a mystery shopper, it pays to do some
homework to make sure the job is real.
Recently, we’ve heard about a scam that begins when you get an email offering “secret shopper” jobs
with retailers like Wal-Mart, Kmart, Best Buy or Home Depot. If you click through to the website, it
looks like you’re on a retailer’s site – but you’re not. You’re asked to provide some personal information
to get started, and told you’ll soon get a cashier’s check for around $1,500. You’re instructed to deposit
the check into your account to “activate” your employment, keep $300 of that money as “advance
payment” to cover initial expenses, and wire back the rest.
Problem is, the “job” isn’t real and it’s not associated with any actual stores. You’re dealing with a
scammer. That check is a fake. If you deposit it, you’re on the hook to pay the bank back.
Following these tips can help you avoid a mystery shopping scam:
Do your research.
Most legitimate secret shopper jobs are posted online by reputable marketing research or
merchandising companies. A quick internet search can help you verify the company’s reputation,
legitimacy, or flag any complaints. Scammers like to use the names of well-known companies
like Home Depot or Wal-Mart to gain your trust.
Never wire money to someone you don’t know.
Wiring money is the same as sending cash – once you send it, you can’t get it back.
Never agree to deposit a check from someone you don’t know.
If the check turns out to be fake, it will eventually bounce. And since you are responsible for any
deposited checks to your account, you will owe the bank the money you withdrew.
Never give your personal or financial information out online.
Guard your personal information, and treat it as if it were cash. Refrain from entering your Social
Security, bank account, or credit card numbers online or by phone to someone who gets in touch
with you.
You don’t have to pay to get into the mystery shopper business. We have more advice on finding
legitimate mystery shopping jobs. If you suspect a scam, report it to the FTC.

7 Juveniles Arrested

Code Enforcement Section-Sgt. Ron Russo
Hello all,
Spring has come along and hit Code Enforcement hard this year. Even with the additional help I have, we are still having
a hard time keeping up, as we receive about 15 calls per day regarding high grass around the City. Rest assured, when you
call and leave a message the complaint is being added to the list and someone will be out within 7-10 days (usually
sooner) to confirm the violation and get the necessary corrective actions started.
That being said, for this newsletter I’d like to talk about trash items left out for pick up. Many citizens don’t realize that,
if you are a resident of Hobart, you can purchase a permit for $10.00 from the Public Works building on Sr. 130 that will
allow you to discard unlimited trash at the City facility during the calendar year for which the permit was purchased. With
the new garbage cans, anything left outside of the cans will not be collected on trash day, so you would either have to call
the City (219-942-6121) for a special pick up (charges may apply), or take the items to the City yourself for the one time
yearly $10.00 fee. Also, the City will not pick up any electronics items from the curb; however, there are specific
receptacles at the Public Works where you can deposit electronics like televisions, computers, radios, etc for NO FEE, as
part of the City’s recycling program.
With all the Spring cleaning going on around the City, I am getting a lot of calls about large
amounts of trash at the curb. Hopefully after reading this article we can avoid a visit from my
office for the advisement, so we can concentrate on other things throughout the City.
Thanks,
Sgt. Ronald Russo

MESSAGE FROM OUR CHIEF

Issue #223, Friday February 05, 2016
Police Blotter: 01/18/16 - 01/31/16
Public Relations 219-942-1125 x 1070
www.cityofhobart.org

In this article, I want to touch on our department’s annual report. We do an annual report to
measure accident and crime trends, as well as, prepare statistics for our Uniform Crime Report
that is submitted to FBI.
Our 2015 Annual Report indicates that we had 166 Personal Injury Crashes compared to 141
Personal Injury Crashes in 2014. This increase amounts to a 17% increase in these types of
crashes. In addition, we only had 1 Fatality in a Crash in 2015 compared to 1 Fatality Crash in
2014. These numbers on Injuries and Fatalities are critical to traffic safety, and usually are accurately reported. 2015 did see an overall increase in Crashes with 1,659 total crashes versus
1,634 in 2014. Many area departments saw similar increases in this year’s crash statistics, and
we attribute it to the extremely harsh winter and snow accumulation of early 2015.
While traffic crashes were up slightly, the number of actual citations issued was at 4,728 total
citations in 2015 up 24% from 3,810 in 2014. In addition, Operating While Intoxicated arrest
totals were down nearly 9% at 163 in 2015 from 187 in 2014. We have varying availability of
traffic grants from year to year. As a department, we received approximately $85,000 in grant
funding in 2015 for overtime traffic enforcement.
In 2015, we had an increase in Prowler, Suspicious Persons, and Suspicious Vehicle calls. We
had 2,294 of these types of calls in 2015 up from 1,983 in 2014. This amounts to a 15% increase in these types of calls. These types of calls can fluctuate based simply on the citizens
taking the time to call us. Ironically, these types of calls generally go hand in hand with Burglary calls. However, we were down to 120 Burglaries in 2015 from 148 Burglaries in 2014,
which is a 19% decrease.
In 2015, our calls for Domestic Disputes, Disturbances, and Fights were up slightly. We had
2,294 of these Calls for Service in 2014, while we increased to 2,418 of them in 2015. This is a
5% increase in the number of Domestic Disputes, Disturbances, and Fights. There were 287
reported victims of Assault/Battery compared to the similar 269 reported in 2014. On the note
of Crimes Against a Person, we did have two Homicides but did have any in 2014, which was
closed by the charging of 7 individuals with felony murder and kidnapping of the Lackey brothers in July. Also, we had 5 Rapes reported in 2015, which was the same as reported in 2014.
Robberies went up to only 17 reported in 2015 from 12 reported in 2014.
Shopliftings in our retail districts are always prevalent year in and year out. They did go down
to 510 in 2015 from 681 in 2014. The number of reported shopliftings had been on the rise
over the last 4 years, but finally tapered off last year and dropped 25% this year. Auto Thefts
were down from 63 reported in 2014 to 61 reported in 2015.
Although a reduction in crime in many areas, we did experience a slight increase in the number
of arrests. We had 2,694 Arrests in 2015 up from 2,662 Arrests in 2014. These numbers are
for all crimes including people taken into custody for traffic misdemeanors and felonies.
Patrol Officers responded to 28,710 total Calls for Service, which was up from 27,583 in 2014
and Detectives were assigned 758 cases to investigate in 2015, which was up from 629 cases in
2014.

Our next article will post in the February 19th issue.

Everyone likes a great discount, but be wary of cable discounts!
A steep discount on your monthly cable bill? This may sound like a great way to save money, but it could be the set up for a
scam. Con artists are impersonating cable companies and taking advantage of subscribers' eagerness to save money.
How the Scam Works:
You get a call, and it's someone claiming to be a representative from your cable provider's "loyal rewards" program. The caller
offers you a significant discount on your monthly cable and/or service. For $80 per month, you can get phone, broadband
Internet, and the premium cable channels. This package would typically run subscribers well over $100/month.
Of course there's a catch! You need to pay for six months of the discounted rate upfront. And this "representative" doesn't
take credit cards, only pre-paid debit cards. Using one of these cards is as untraceable as paying in cash.
According to BBB Scam Tracker reports, lately con artists are impersonating Comcast, but they will likely move on to other
cable providers as the scam expands. Also, reports say that scammers frequently have personal information about targets,
such as address, phone number and current level of service, making this con very believable.
Tips to avoid a utility scam:
Cable companies aren't the only utilities that scammers impersonate. Watch out for variations involving electricity, gas and
other bills.
 Prepaid debit cards are a red flag: If a caller specifically asks you to pay by prepaid debit card or wire transfer, this is a
huge warning sign. Your utility company will accept a check, credit card or online banking transfer.
 Don't cave to pressure to pay immediately: If you feel pressured for immediate payment or personal information,
hang up the phone and call the customer service number on your utility bill. This will ensure you are speaking to a real
representative.
 Never allow anyone into your home to check electrical wiring, natural gas pipes or appliances unless you have
scheduled an appointment or reported a problem. Also, ask utility employees for proper identification.

PUBLIC RELATIONS

MESSAGE FROM OUR CHIEF
The role of 21st century policing is quite a bit different than it was 25 years ago when I first
became a police officer. Without our change in approach or evolving, if you will, no one could
say for certain where we would be as a society. Modern police agencies are utilizing education
and prevention so much more to keep crime down and preserve the quality of life in our
communities. Of course, enforcement is still a necessary aspect to ensuring compliance with
our laws; however, years of too much focus or over enforcement have yielded its own set of
complications.
The Hobart Police Department began teaching and outreach in the community schools 23
years ago. To many officers, this type of outreach seemed like a public relations stunt that
would be short lived. Cops teaching children about the dangers of drugs and violence, how
effective could that be? Who would have known that it would only be the first of many steps
into community policing? Well, on Thursday, May 12th, we graduated our 23rd group of
Anti-Drug and Anti-Violence students from the schools. Lt. Jack Grennes has been the
primary instructor for the last 17 years. Due to Jack’s pending retirement, we have introduced
Officer Monte White and Officer Tim Pochron to the Too Good for Drugs and Violence
instruction. Next school year, we will add Officer Michael Jimenez to the group.
The primary goal is to keep kids away from drugs and to find alternatives to violence.
The secondary goal, and just as important, is to see police officers in general as human beings,
people that you can trust, as well as, someone you can turn to in times of trouble.
The programs have been a success and will continue to be one of many forms of community
outreach.
After retirement, Jack will continue to teach vocational education in criminal justice system
careers at the Hobart High School. It is an opportunity to show teens how and why the
criminal justice system works, and give them a chance to explore if it is right for them. The
courses most likely expose a whole different segment of society to these careers, which is
healthy and promotes diversity.
In addition to school based outreach, we have hosted a number of community forums in
Hobart to offer the public the opportunity to present us with problems or concerns, and then
work together to resolve the issue through community problem solving. The intensity of the
issue generally reflected the public turnout at the event.
On Tuesday, May 10th, I will be a panelist in a community forum on “Tearing Down the
Walls/Building Community” hosted by the First Unitarian Church at Augustana Lutheran
Church. By the time of this publication, the event will have occurred. The event is focused on
varying forms of racism and how we can achieve racial justice in our society. While this is a
“hot topic” in society, I look forward to speaking on the many ways that the Hobart Police
Department supervises, trains, and equips its officers to minimize exposure to controversy and
encourage limited physical engagement in enforcing the law.
Our other areas of community policing include our Community Athletic Program (geared
toward teens and pre-teens) and our System to End Repeated Violence (geared toward residents with a history of family violence). There are many more areas of service that we provide
that are true service and not just traffic or criminal enforcement. It is all a part of the evolution
in 21st century policing that ensures that we, as an agency, represent what our citizens want in
services.

Phishing Emails Pose as Dropbox Share Alerts
This convincing phishing con poses as Dropbox and lures victims into clicking on a malware-infected email. If you use this file sharing
service at home or work, check your Dropbox emails carefully before clicking on an infected link.
How the Scam Works:
You receive an email that appears to come from Dropbox. The message looks real. It has the Dropbox logo and colors, and the subject
line seems legitimate. Some variations include: "Drop Box - Pending Documents" or "<Contact Name> used Dropbox to share a file
with you." The body of the message instructs you to click a link and access the shared file. An example is below.

Don't fall for it! The link downloads malware to your device, which scammers use to capture passwords or hunt for sensitive
information on your machine.
How to Spot a Phishing Scam:
Be wary of unexpected emails that contain links or attachments. Do not click on links or open files in unfamiliar emails.
Check the reply email address. One easy way to spot an email scam is to look at the reply email. The address should be on a company
domain, such as jsmith@company.com.
Don't believe what you see. Just because an email looks real, doesn't mean it is. Scammers can fake anything from a company logo to
the "Sent" email address.
Consider how the organization normally contacts you. If an organization normally reaches you by mail, be suspicious if you
suddenly start receiving emails or text messages without ever opting in to the new communications.
Be cautious of generic emails. Scammers try to cast a wide net by including little or no specific information in their fake emails. Be
especially wary of messages you have not subscribed to or companies you have never done business with in the past.

MESSAGE FROM OUR CHIEF
2015 OFFICER OF THE YEAR AWARD
Detective Nicholas Wardrip
The Hobart Police Department wants to take this opportunity to recognize Detective Nick
Wardrip as the 2015 Officer of the Year. Many officers go above and beyond year in and year
out, but it is often times the detectives behind the scenes that get overlooked for their efforts.
Detective Wardrip has been submitted as the Hobart Police Department candidate for District
1 Region Officer of the Year.
Name: Nicholas Wardrip
Rank: Detective
Service: 12 years

On July 17, 2015, Detective Nicholas Wardrip was assigned a death investigation, which
involved the discovery of human skeletal remains, located in a wooded area located at 7030
Grand Boulevard in Hobart. The remains were subsequently identified as Arreon and Antonio
Lackey; the two victims had been reported missing approximately three weeks prior to the
discovery of the remains.
Detective Wardrip compiled and reviewed several reports and video surveillance images that
had been generated by Major Crimes Task Force and other detectives. Detective Wardrip
re-interviewed initial witnesses, conducted several interviews of additional witnesses and
listened to jail phone calls that had been made by two potential suspects, while they were in
custody at the Lake County Jail about 3 weeks prior to the disappearance of Arreon and
Antonio. After analyzing all of his interviews, reports, jail phone calls and surveillance images,
Detective Wardrip was able to develop seven suspects. Detective Wardrip began the daunting
task of conducting search warrants on numerous Facebook and cell phone accounts. Detective
Wardrip eventually conducted a total of 29 search warrants on Facebook accounts and cell
phone accounts, which belonged to the 7 suspects.
Through his investigation, Detective Wardrip began to piece together information he had
gathered from video surveillance images, jail phone calls, Facebook and cell phone account
information, and he was able to develop a plot of how David Johnson III, David Johnson IV,
David Johnson V, Jeri Woods, Aarion Greenwood, Kiontay Cason and Michelle Hughes had
planned to kidnap and murder Arreon and Antonio Lackey.
As a result of his investigation, a total of 84 charges were brought against the 7 suspects and
they are still awaiting trial. Through his actions, Detective Wardrip has demonstrated the true
meaning of tenacity and has exemplified himself as a true leader and his commendable
performance.

Scams Targeting NIPSCO Customers at it Again

Most NIPSCO employees drive clearly marked vehicles that are easy to identify and wear NIPSCO branded
uniforms. Be alert to people who try to pass themselves off as gas company personnel or who claim to offer a
NIPSCO refund. NIPSCO employees NEVER deliver cash refunds, rebates, or collect money at customers'
homes -- all account transactions are handled electronically or through the mail.
Our employees and contractors carry photo identification and will gladly show it upon request. Ask to see it before
allowing anyone who claims to be a utility representative into your home. If you are still unsure after seeing the ID,
please call our 24-Hour Customer Service Center at 1-800-4NIPSCO (1-800-464-7726) to confirm that the person
at your door is one of our employees or contractors. Be sure to report any suspicious activity to the police.
Helpful Reminders to Keep Customers Safe from Scams and Identity Theft
Potential threats or scams can appear in a variety of forms, including phone calls and e-mails. By following some
of these simple tips below, customers can help avoid being the victim of a scam.
Never give personal information, including Social Security numbers and banking information, to unconfirmed
sources. NIPSCO only asks for a Social Security number when a customer is applying for new service.
NIPSCO never asks for customers who are behind on payments to purchase a prepaid debit card to avoid
disconnection. Customers have the following payment options: online, by phone, by mail or in person at one of
NIPSCO’s authorized payment locations.
If you believe you have been the victim of a scam, contact 911 as well as your local banking institution or credit
card company if applicable.
If you are unsure about the legitimacy of any e-mail, phone call, programs or offers claiming to be affiliated with
NIPSCO, please call our 24-Hour Customer Service Center at 1-800-4NIPSCO (1-800-464-7726).

Internet Connected Cars: Scammers Next Target
Is your car connected? Many cars can now connect to the Internet, enabling drivers to play music, use GPS, and access
roadside assistance without their phone. Unfortunately, internet connection comes with a potential drawback. It opens up
your car to the risk of hacking, warns a new Federal Bureau of Investigation alert.
How the Scam Works:
You use the dashboard of your connected car to get GPS directions, connect through apps or stream music. But one recent
study found that scammers can take advantage of security holes in the Wi-Fi connection to gain access to the
car's computer. Once they get in, hackers can steal data or even take control of your vehicle.
Connected car hacking is more of a possibility than an existing issue. But as more people purchase connected cars, con
artists are bound to find ways to use them for scams. This just happened with smartphones a few years ago, so the FBI
wants consumers to be aware of the potential problem and to treat connected cars like other computer devices.
Tips to Keep Your Connected Car Secure:
 Treat your car like a computer. Your connected car is a computer, so use the same common sense you would for
keeping your laptop safe. Be especially cautious when allowing third-party devices to access your car’s computer for
reasons other than vehicle diagnostics and maintenance.
 Respect recalls. If you receive a recall notice for an issue related to your car’s computer system, treat it as seriously as
you would a safety recall and get it taken care of right away. The notification will tell you how to get the problem fixed.
Cyber recalls are regulated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and you can check for all recalls at
recalls.gov/nhtsa.html
 Keep your vehicle's software up-to-date. Manufacturers will do their best to patch security holes. System updates are
annoying but vital for protecting your device. Always make sure you have the latest updates, “bug fixes,” and security
patches, but only download those officially provided by the manufacturer.
 Don't make changes to vehicle software. Making unauthorized changes to the vehicle's software may introduce new
vulnerabilities that could be exploited by scammers.
 Lock your car. Just as you password-protect your smartphone and laptop, be sure to lock your car and know who has
access to it.
 If you suspect your connected car has been hacked... Contact the vehicle manufacturer or dealer. Provide them
with a description of the problem so that they can work with you to resolve any potential cybersecurity concerns.
