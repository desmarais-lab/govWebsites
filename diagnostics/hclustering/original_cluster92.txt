The meeting was called to order at 9:30 a.m.
Minutes:
A motion was made to approve the July 19, 2005 IT Board minutes. The motion was seconded and passed
unanimously.
ISA Report
Mr. Banning, CIO, stated that Premis Consulting Group was hired to review the NG maintenance contract. He
complimented Premis on their ability in getting staff to this point. They facilitated a one hour customer
satisfaction project attended by a focus group. The issues fell into 7 major categories:
Understanding of the customer’s business
Lack of rigor/poor technical homework
Financial value
Communication
Contractual Issues
Structure
Technical
Mr. Banning emphasized the importance of Northrup Grumman and ISA hearing what customers concerns are.
Premis suggested 27 action steps. Mr. Geis will be the BRM assigned to facilitate the recommendations.
Major Ball thanked Premis and the participants in the focus group. He thought the group was energetic and
very vocal. He appreciated the openness of those that participated. It provided the CIO and Project Manager
good input on the current customer impressions of ISA/NG.
Mr. Banning stated in the 30 days the staff will review the recommendations. Issues identified will be forwarded
to the BRMs and on to Project Management and to NG. Meetings are scheduled to work on an action plan.
Ms. Sadler stated this is more than just a challenge. Customer satisfaction is very low.

Meeting Minutes
Mr. Banning stated that the group that attended the workshop represents ‘super users’. They are the individuals
that drive technology. There are six thousand customers which are surveyed on a regular basis. Mr. Banning
stated he understands the results are not up to par and communication needs to improve.
ISA Financial Report
Ms. Patel stated the report describes the financial position of ISA in four areas: 2004 vs. 2005 budget
comparison, Year to Date Revenue Statement, July 2004 vs. July 2005 Contract Comparison, and 2005
Application Maintenance and Support Expenditures.
ISA expenditures for July 2005 totalled $15.9 million or 52%. ISA has collected $14.5 million dollars or 51% of
our projected revenue for YTD July 2005, which includes payments received for the 4th quarter 2004 billings.
Ms. Patel stated the BRMs have been instrumental in relaying to the departments where they stand.
2006 Budget
ISA Expenses are charged back to City and County agencies through chargeback, pass through, and telephone
billing. The ISA budget is in the City-County budget twice, first in the Department/Agency’s budget, and again in
ISA’s budget.
ISA has been able to reduce its budget by restructuring the outsourcing contract, consolidating some internal
functions, and reviewing reductions in our capital expenditures.
Ms. Enders asked if the capital expenditures noted were for infrastructure. Mr. Banning clarified that they were
for security, infrastructure, Justis.Net, property tax system and items such as pc upgrades and licenses.
Mr. Rodman asked that in dollars what is the amount quantified and what significant changes may be in store for
2007 ½ million or 7 million. Mr. Banning stated that ISA has yet to scope the property system’s test,
development, and production environment, voter registration additional desktops, etc. Ms. Sadler stated the
voter registration will not have hardware requirements. They will be paid for by State. Mr. Ricketts asked about
budgeting for a 2-year refresh program. Mr. Banning stated that would be included in the equipment budget.
Mr. Ricketts asked if any reserves have been planned for in the event a major piece of hardware fails or is ISA
just going to wait until something goes wrong. Mr. Banning requested 1 month to research and reply to Mr.
Ricketts.
Major Ball stated that with other agencies adhering to budget cuts he is not happy with ISA’s increase. He
would like ISA to hold down costs as other agencies have. Ms. Patel stated that maintenance agreement
increases forced ISA expenses up and cuts were made in other areas. Mr. Clifford stated moving forward with
standards policies will work toward fixed costs of hardware and software and allow for continuity. He added that
IPD is doing a great job managing their funds.
Civic.Net
Ms. Biddinger presented the Civic.Net update to the Board. She stated they have collected 1.7 million in
revenue which is a 16% increase. They added 2 new services. Two agencies installed the over-the-counter
credit card processing systems: Corporation Counsel and Department of Metropolitan Development.
Corporation Counsel, City Collections, Division, is now accepting credit card payments for Court 13 fines. DMD
is accepting credit card for zoning fines and violations.
Resolution 05-17
Resolution 05-17 to reimburse the Marion County Clerk, the Marion County Treasurer, the Marion County
Justice Agency for expenses incurred related to the Provision of Enhanced Access to Public Records.

Meeting Minutes
A motion was made to approve Resolution 05-17. The motion was seconded and passed unanimously.
Introduction of Northrup Grumman Program Manager
Mr. Grazda introduced Mr. Jeff Clancy as the new Northrup Grumman Program Manager. Mr. Grazda
acknowledges it was a priority with this Board to hire a permanent Program Manager. Mr. Clancy has many
years experience and background in information technology. Mr. Grazda stated he has been on site for 2
months as Director of Public Relations. He reports to Hernan Vera. He intends to facilitate best practices,
adding personnel, and developing methods to improve delivery.
Ms. Enders welcomed Mr. Clancy to the ISA team. Mr. Clifford stated he is glad corporate (NG) is paying
attention to what is happening here in Indianapolis.
Northrup Grumman Update
Mr. Banning discussed the SLRs. The proposed SLRs would reduce the number from 124 to 59 with the overall
dollar value remaining the same. ISA and NG worked together to ensure that the remaining SLRs would cover
all of the critical systems to the level that was expected from day one.
The process would include combining a number of SLRs, clarifying a large number of SLRs, fold a number of
hardware-based SLRs into the application-based SLRs that reside on the hardware, work with NG management
staff to modify a couple of the existing SLRs, delete SLRs that do not make financial sense or are not our
responsibility (i.e. responsibility of SBC), adjust the weights of some of the credits, and sign a letter of
understanding.
July SLR Report
10 SLRs were not reported (8 with credits, 2 without credits)
11 were missed for July
NG will pay credits for 8 SLRs for the month of July ($73,553)
Ms. Sadler stated she has two issues. First is the issue of reducing the SLRs. The second is the credit issue.
She did not believe the board gave the CIO the authority to change the SLRs. She received Mr. Banning’s
memorandum dated July 26 and has reviewed it. When this contract was approved it was recognized as one of
the most advanced IT contracts. It nailed down so specifically the large number of requirements. She had
concern that the people that negotiated that contract, specifically Corporation Counsel and Lewis and Kappes
have not been involved in this reconfiguration of the SLRs. They may be able to provide some explanation for
why there are 125 SLRs. She did not believe the Board gave the CIO the authority to modify the contract when
the contract presented was so specific for a reason. There is a reason why there are 125 SLRs. Those reasons
need to be examined. Ms. Sadler did not agree with the reasons given by NG to lower the dollar amount. NG
should abide by the contract they agreed to. Regarding the Feb-June credit issues she stated these are difficult
financial times. Budgets are being cut. NG entered this contract knowing what the SLRs were. Ms. Sadler
does not agree with the strategy to avoid dispute resolution by simply agreeing to a dollar amount. The Board
gave authority to negotiate that amount. She hoped to receive a recommendation from Mr. Banning.
Mr. Banning stated he would like to avoid the cost of dispute resolution. The 13 points were directly from NG
and were not edited. There are 250 projects for users. The focus group and staff have met with Premis to gain
an understanding of the customer service needs. Mr. Banning would like to focus on those types of issues as
well. NG is our partner. They have proposals to save this enterprise money. Mr. Banning discussed with legal
extensively his recommendation and believes it serves the best interest. Mr. Ricketts stated he would
appreciate Mr. Banning taking the time and effort to gain an insight to the reason for the 125 SLRs. He stated
he appreciates Mr. Banning working hard with NG but to reduce the SLRs from 125 to 50 is not doing a service
to tax payers.

Meeting Minutes
Mr. Clifford asked if Mr. Banning received responses to his 16 page proposal.
Ms Enders stated she supports managing contracts through change management. She was shocked at the
proposal to reduce the SLRs from 125-59 but believes it in a practical, realistic environment will support the
decision of the CIO.
Ms. Sadler was concerned the City of Indianapolis-Marion County would be at risk by reducing the required
SLRs. She offered that she is not unwilling to consider changing those SLRs but why did NG agree to 125
SLRs if they were unattainable. The other vendor involved in the best and final offer negotiations stated they
could not meet the 125 SLRs. Ms. Sadler stated this is more than ‘tweaking the contract’. The SLRs are just an
indication of the service that is supposed to be provided to our users. Our users are unhappy. The Justis
system was down for 18 hours. Ms. Sadler added that we have only been in this contract a few months. NG
has a contractual obligation if they do not produce. She recommended the board request additional details and
push the vendor harder.
Mr. Poulakidas stated he did not believe the City/County were liable. The contract was awarded as a result of a
best and final offer. The selection was based on what each party negotiated. This is after the fact and separate
from the bid process. As for the CIO having the authority to reduce the SLRs according to Municipal Code 281222 and the NG contract section 1.10.4 allows ISA and NG to have discussions as a process of managing their
relations.
Mr. Rodman stated this is a policy making board and why are we not enforcing the penalties that are due per
contract. He expressed how concerned he was about waiving the credits. He stated they should be enforced
for two reasons. If in a contract there should be a penalty then there should be a penalty. Second, these are
tough financial times and to not collect what is due is not being a responsible steward of the taxpayer’s funds.
All that aside, he stated the Board picked Mr. Banning as CIO and should not micro-manage. Mr. Rodman
expected that if a penalty is not truly a penalty when discussion turns to bonuses he would hope that they be
negotiated also.
Mr. Ricketts agreed with Ms. Sadler that the City/County would be vulnerable if the Board agrees to reduce the
125 SLRs. Mr. Ricketts suggested the Board agree to a letter of understanding that legally supersedes what is
in the contract.
Mr. Clifford commented that no document had been drafted. The agreement is between the CIO and NG. He
stated continuing to arbitrate would result in internal and external costs. The original contract was the result of
three separate winners. He believes the consolidation makes sense in a long term partnership. He stated that
we are trying to provide service and move forward.
Ms. Enders stated not taking a hard stance on the $200,000 credit is a hard pill to swallow especially when ISA
is proposing a budget increase. She recommended to go back to drawing board and increase the settlement
through change management documents.
Ms. Sadler requested a very detailed written explanation be provided how that amount was determined and very
specific justification for that be presented.
JUSTIS.NET
Mr. Rutherford and Mr. Renner presented an update on the JUSTIS.NET project. Mr. Renner had presented an
update to the JTAC stakeholders last week. Mr. Renner describes the overall JUSTIS.NET project as 2
separate projects. The infrastructure project. The second is the conversion of .Net in relationship to JTAC. It
has been identified as the module for the State CMS project. Our partners DAI & CA are working with JTAC to
make sure the identical tools are being used so that when completed it will have the same look and feel as the
state-wide system. Another benefit is that as a result of this project direct support from Microsoft has been
made available. This is a huge benefit that everyone will gain from. The test and development site that was set

up off site was done with zero (additional) dollars to the County. Mr. Clifford asked if there are any potential
obstacles and when is the project proposed to go into service. Mr. Thamba stated the production environment
is a challenge but it is robust enough to handle the users. Mr. Banning commented that at the IT Team Mr.
Grigsby addressed some of the risks associated with a .Net environment.
Property System Update
Mr. Rutherford presented the Property System Update to the Board. He stated the following:

12, 2005 and the City of Indianapolis Marion County Server Standards. The motion was seconded and passed
unanimously.
The meeting adjourned at 11:40.
The next IT Board Meeting will be September 20, 2005.

Leading the way in enterprise-wide technology

ISA Report
Operations
ISA teamed with Northrop Grumman, IPD, MCSD, CPI, Brighthouse
Cable Communications, and Best Buy to provide IT services for
evacuees being housed by Red Cross at the Indiana State Fair
Grounds. When the request for help came in from Mayor Bart
Peterson, everyone responded. Thanks to everyone for all of their
help and support.
Northrop Grumman demonstrated several backup and storage
solutions. The current equipment in the Intel Server farm will not be
able to keep up with expected storage demands. Adding additional
storage to older equipment will result in higher maintenance costs. We
are using three different back-up solutions. It would be beneficial to
consolidate these solutions into one platform.
ISA has been developing a spreadsheet listing major infrastructure
costs that are forecasted for the next five years.
Northrop Grumman has established server outage alerts for requesting
customers. The designated representatives will receive an automated
text page when the specified server is down.
The GroupWise 6.5 client rollout is ahead of schedule. All agencies
have been installed except IFD. The final rollout should be complete
9/27.
Operations staff met with Kirk from Cannon IV to discuss how printer
service will work on printers purchased from them under the new “Big
Deal” pricing. We will be working with NG to get them up to speed and
to ensure we have processes and procedures in place to make this a
smooth transition.
Dell Rep Brett Felton presented to our customers an 18 month
roadmap of where technology is going in the PC, laptop, printer, and
server realm. We discussed with IPD an initiative where they will be
adding cameras to light poles. We discussed bringing a partner of Dell
in to talk to both IPD and DPW to see how we may be able to share
and leverage our technology investments.

We are working with several external agencies to provide service for
the new Fusion Center. This project will be funded by Homeland
Security grants. The team would like for the center to be operational
by December.
Northrop Grumman announced a Deputy Program Manager for the
Northrop Grumman City/County engagement, Roger Murphy. Roger is
from Franklin, IN and has an extensive background in Information
Technology.
The Operations team successfully implemented kiosks in the remote
offices for Probation. These kiosks will be used by probationers to
verify that they have completed their visit to the site.
We have continued to work on refining the design of many of our HP
Openview reports that monitor service levels. This tool continues to
increase in productivity.
Northrop Grumman has tested many SPAM solutions. Several have
proven to be effective in our environment. MailFrontier and
Proofpoint appear to be viable solutions. Currently, we are finishing
the trial with Proofpoint. We will be determining which product to
recommend implementing for the enterprise.
ISA has been awarded three Homeland Security grants to provide new
technology. A Fiber Optic Infrastructure will provide self-healing, high
speed, fault tolerant fiber optic rings. These rings will provide for well
managed, secure, encrypted high speed connections for Public Safety
in Marion and Hamilton County. A Cyber-Security installation will
provide various types of network security tools used in a layered
approach to apply a defensive posture around information technology
assets. And, we will be adding the voice network to the SONET ring for
survivability and disaster recovery. This will offer voice backup in the
event of catastrophic failure.
We have been reviewing patch management tools that can deliver
patches to the desktop, servers, routers, and mobile units. This
automation would provide faster service in providing security to the
environment. Additionally, it will free up resources to use in other
areas of implementation and service.
We are working with Indy Parks to provide IT services to their learning
facilities. Northrop Grumman has been working with broadband
providers for solutions to implement internet connectivity for many
different agency requests. These services will be kept separate from
our network and will provide a vehicle for many different application
requirements.

The refining of the Northrop Grumman contracted SLR’s is complete.
And the final outstanding Milestones are being addressed.
Northrop Grumman continues to identify problem areas that result in
the performance of their SLR’s. They have been focusing on the
continuation of improvement in meeting their goals.
Indy Parks Customer Service was successfully moved to their new
location at 601 E 17th St.

spreadsheet reflects ISA’s and Northrop Grumman’s best estimate at
these expenditures. These figures are rough estimates and do not
reflect actual budget submissions for the years indicated. These costs
are considered enterprise costs or upgrades and do not reflect specific

Please note: The YTD August 2004 expenses for ACS totaled $7,541 million. This expense for ACS does not
include the following:
A). The cost for the Business Consultants (currently reclassified as Business Relationship Managers within ISA).
B). Any Pass through charges & New Application Development. (In 2005 no new application dollars budgeted.)
It does however; include the cost for Maintenance and Support. In 2004 the contractual dollars allocated for
Application Development included Maintenance & Support along w/ New Development. This breakdown was
75% for Maintenance and Support and 25% for New Development for 2004. Prior to 2004, the split was more
50% for Maintenance and Support and 50% for New Development.
Based on the chart above there is a contract savings of $654K for year to date 2005, and based on this trend,
we are projecting a contract savings of approximately $981K by the end of calendar year 2005.

CIVICNET HIGHLIGHTS
Reminder: Financial data is reported on a one-month delay. This means that
financials for August 2005 will be detailed in the report distributed in October
2005.

With more than 38,000 transactions logged in August, CivicNet
set a new one-month record for activity. Increases were seen in
every service area, and the total funds collected for the
city/county have topped $2.3 million for the year. In August
alone, the Division of Compliance collected nearly $150,000 in
fees, while various agencies using the Over-the-Counter credit
card service for their walk-in customers collected more than
$75,000 – at no cost to the city/county.
The Treasurer’s Office is testing the new Bulk Search Service
with anticipated deployment in mid-September, which will
alleviate the strain of large customer requests for parcel
information that are currently processed manually. CivicNet is
assisting the office in marketing the service to its existing
customers – a “Coming Soon” notice was developed for
inclusion in invoices mailed in early September, and a letter with
detailed information about using the new online service will be
mailed later in the month.
CivicNet will deliver the Division of Compliance’s Online Craft
License Renewal service to the agency to begin testing in early
September, with deployment scheduled for October. The
CivicNet marketing team has developed a direct mail notification
for all craft contractors that will be mailed last week of October.
All current craft licenses expire at the end of 2005. This project
is expected to save thousands of staff hours each year, eliminate
the manual data-entry process for license renewals and get
licenses into contractors’ hands earlier.
CivicNet is working with the MCSD to develop an online service
that will allow users to deposit money into an inmate’s
commissary account at the Marion County Jail and Jail Annex.
This project is in the requirements-gathering phase.
In August, posters were delivered for the Office of Corporation
Counsel to promote their new OTC service. The marketing staff
also worked with DPW to design and produce a version of their
agency brochure in Spanish. New office signage was delivered
for Citizens Services and the Division of Compliance -consisting of a combined total of seven new posters.

Credit Claim Form
(To be submitted when credits are claimed by
Information Services Agency towards Northrop Grumman)

In accordance with the Contractual Agreement between Northrop Grumman and the City-County (ISA),
Northrop Grumman has been charged credits in the amount(s) stated below:
Section 6.8 (Incentives and Schedules), “Schedule D Specifies certain, Incentives and Credits that may be
imposed in the event of any failure or earn back in respect of the Provider’s actual performance of Services
as measured against the Critical Milestones or the Critical SLR’s. The Parties acknowledge and agree that
the Credits set forth in Schedule D are intended to reflect the diminished value of Services as a result of any
service level failure. City/County and Provider agree that Credits do not constitute penalties or damages,
but rather are intended to equalize the fee for services to a level of fair-market value…,” and;
Section 16.1.2, (Invoices and Reports) "Any credits in accordance section 6.8 of the agreement may be
applied against the provider's invoices with appropriate information attached."
Note: Formula for Credit claims: Total contract value / 12 (monthly contract value) / 630 points (total number of points assigned to SLR’s) = single point value or
($8,826,300 / 12) / 630 = $1168 per point.

Northrop Grumman
Input to the IT Board
Monthly Status Report
September 20, 2005
Northrop Grumman is proud to announce that Roger Murphy has accepted the
offer to become the Deputy Program Manager for the Northrop Grumman
City/County engagement. Roger has a rich Information Technology background
from a senior management standpoint and has held senior Information
Technology leadership positions in outsourcing engagements for major
outsourcing organizations. We are pleased to have Roger as a part of our team.
Northrop Grumman has had several members of the senior management team
visit the site, interact with the staff, and attend meetings with members of the IT
Board. This effort is the Northrop Grumman commitment to understand the
issues and provide immediate corrective action whether that is in the form of
additional resources or specific skills located elsewhere in the company. This
practice will continue on a month to month basis throughout the term of the
agreement.
Continuing through the month of August, the focus has been on improved SLR
performance in the help desk administration area and adding tools to facilitate
the data gathering and reporting process.
The E-Service feature has been added to Siebel. E-Service allows end users to
submit and monitor status of their help desk tickets from their desktops. It is also
the facility that will be used to gather end user satisfaction with I/T services. The
E-Service facility has been extended to a pilot group of users of Indianapolis
Information Technology during the month of August. The result of the pilot will
determine how to proceed with the broader user audience.
A new Siebel reporting tool, “Analytics”, has been implemented. This tool will
allow on the spot reporting of performance to SLR’s. The prior method was to
aggregate the monthly ticket data manually and then report by the 10th of the
month. During the month of August we ran parallel tests with the manual method
of gathering data and Analytics do ensure consistency and integrity of reporting.
Once we have completed our analysis Analytics will be used on a day by day
basis to view help desk performance and make corrections to failing trends
before impacts are seen by the end user.
Northrop Grumman has developed an SLR Dashboard Application. This
application will allow Northrop Grumman and ISA staff to be able to have a day to
day view of all of the SLR performance data. This tool will receive daily
performance data from the Siebel Help Desk tool, the HP Openview tool,

1

mainframe systems statistical information and other data sources. The tool will
perform the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•

At the close of business on each day, all SLR data is extracted into a
single repository.
Intranet-based, graphical display of all SLR performance measurements is
readily available for management and staff review.
Eliminates the need for manual data extraction and formatting.
Allows user to view performance at a high-level or to “drill-down” for more
details.
Browser based - no desktop software to install.
Reports can be printed or exported via Crystal Enterprise.

The SLR dashboard application is currently being tested. Northrop Grumman will
demonstrate the features of this important tool at the October 2005 IT Board
meeting.
Bob Mount from our Siebel Corporate support team has been onsite all month to
address Siebel issues. He has established the contact directory for all
City/County users. He has also assisted in automating the reporting process so
that immediate access to performance data is readily available.
The help desk staff that was added in July and August has helped improve SLR
trends that were previously unfavorable. Expectations are that while some of the
same SLR’s are being missed the gap is closing. The additional staff is giving us
the encouragement that these SLR’s will not be missed during the month of
September 2005.
Northrop Grumman is pleased to announce that an offer has been extended and
accepted by Celina Oblinger. In past months, Celina has assisted the
Indianapolis Help Desk operations in a consulting capacity. Celina comes from
the Northrop Grumman Unocal account. The Unocal account has been using the
Siebel product for over three years. During this time Celina has gained a great
deal of experience with the product, implementing best practices and statistical
reporting. Celina will be joining the Northrop Grumman Indianapolis team on a
full time basis in September.
Northrop Grumman has had Donna Guido, Sr. Project Manager, visit the site to
understand the project workflow process and the project portfolio. Donna has
made some recommendations on a Portfolio Management system that will
facilitate project resource planning and consumption. Donna will also be visiting
the site in September to work with ISA in defining the Service Request and
Project workflow process.
Hewlett Packard OpenView (HP OpenView) is a network-based product that will
sample the health of all network-connected devices and send health reports for
2

technical staff review. This product has now been installed on the City/County
network and is monitoring network and server events on a proactive basis. The
tool is now producing reports for the data center, server and network
components. Rick Altosino from the Northrop Grumman architecture team has
been onsite in Indianapolis to assist in the ongoing operation of this critical tool.
Gerald Mc Garvin from Hewlett Packard Corp. has been onsite assisting Rick.
Gerald will continue to assist to ensure that all expectations are met. These
individuals are analyzing the tool deployment and making recommendations to fill
any reporting gaps that may exist. It is anticipated that this level of expertise will
be onsite in the months to come as the tool matures.
Northrop Grumman has had Billy Edmondson, another corporate resource,
assisting in the asset management area. Billy has been instrumental in
developing procedures for the new assets being installed and keeping those
under control.
Two contract milestones are being deferred. These are the Technology Refresh
Plan, which is dependent on an accurate asset data, and the Technology Plan,
which is dependent on the Information Technology Strategy. NGC is working with
ITSA on these milestones, as plans need to be in place for future technology
deployment. A re-scoping of these plans seems to be the favored approach so
that something of value can be delivered rather than wait.
Northrop Grumman has signed and executed an agreement with Mathews and
Company to perform an end user Information Technology Services satisfaction
survey. Mathews and Company has performed these services on other Northrop
Grumman accounts. Mathews and Company has been onsite August 12 and
performed a workshop. The workshop identified the demographics and the
content of the survey to be utilized. Mathews and Company has delivered the
first set of survey questions for review and comment. This review process will
continue until the question set is solidified. The process going forward will be to
finalize the question set, implement the survey on the internet and push out
emails to the end users reminding them of the survey and soliciting feedback.
The SA3 Applications group completed the DMD Cashier Module
implementation. In addition Northrop Grumman is wrapping up the major
enhancements to the ePAR application. The target date for delivering this
application for user acceptance testing was in early December. This function will
be delivered approximately 3 months early. Northrop Grumman is also
developing the Coroner Case Management System. This project continues to
progress nicely and slightly ahead of schedule. Regular meetings with the client
and ISA BRM have gone very well and everyone seems to be pleased with the
progress and the product.

1 Background
The IT Outsourcing contract between Indianapolis/Marion County and Northrop Grumman
includes 61 Service Level Requirements (SLR). There are several tools utilized to measure
and track Northrop Grumman’s performance, each of which store information in their own
database(s). It was a very tedious and time consuming task to extract and gather the
required information and format it into an easily readable and detailed report.
In addition, it was very difficult to monitor performance on a daily basis. Management needed
to be able to quickly access performance data on a daily basis to identify areas that needed
improvement.
An intranet based, graphical, digital dashboard was suggested. The dashboard application
would extract the required performance data from all of the disparate data sources and store
them in a single repository. It would display a high-level view of the SLR performance data
with the option to “drill down” to the detailed data, if desired.

7 RESOURCES REQUIRED
The following resources are required to develop the proposed solution documented above.
Developers:
This project will require 2 full-time .net/Crystal developers for approximately 40
man-hours each. They are currently in the midst of a major development
project for the Coroner. If they are ahead of schedule, I will pull them off for this
project.
File Access:
The developers will need to have ODBC access to the Siebel database and/or
the Analytics copy of the Siebel database located in Lafayette, Colorado. This
is critical to the success of this project, the current method of manually
exporting data from Siebel to Microsoft Excel is NOT an option. The file is too
large and the process takes too long.
We MUST be able to directly run queries and Crystal against the database,
read-only, in order to extract the required data.
Tools:
Business Objects sells a Siebel Integration Kit that makes the development of
Crystal reports against the Siebel database much quicker and easier. At this
time, the cost of this tool is unknown. This tool is not critical to the success of
the project, it would just speed it up.
HP has an Openview SDK available. This would make the extraction of
information from the HP Openview database easier and quicker. The cost of
this SDK is unknown at this time. We are not sure if we can extract the
information without this tool. It may be critical to the success of the project.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING #1
BETWEEN
INFORMATION SERVICES AGENCY
AND
NORTHROP GRUMMAN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES, INC.
REGARDING ADMINISTRATION OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SERVICES CONTRACT
Acknowledging that the Information Services Agency Indianapolis Marion County (ISA) and Northrop
Grumman Information Technologies Inc, (NG) entered into an contractual relationship for information
technology Services (Original Agreement) on September 1, 2004; and
Acknowledging that both ISA and NG wish to broaden their cooperation within the confines of the
original agreement to improve customers service.
ISA and NG intend to initiate additional administrative changes to facilitate the improvement of
customer services as described below:
Overall Objective
The overall objective of this Letter of Understanding is to streamline Service Level Requirements
(SLR’s) to a more manageable, market driven balance, in accordance with Section 6.8 of the original
agreement. “The Parties acknowledge and agree that the Credits set forth in Schedule D are intended
to reflect the diminished value of the Services as a result of any service level failure. City/County and
Provider agree that Credits do not constitute penalties or damages, but rather are intended to
equalize the fee for services to a level of fair market value net of City/County’s expenses incurred as
a result of Provider’s failure to delivery the Services as bargained.”
The ongoing review of SLR’s, and possible modifications thereof, will occur from time to time when
both parties agree, in accordance section 1.10.2 of the original agreement, “Provider shall meet with
City/County at least quarterly, or more frequently if requested by City/County, to review Provider’s
actual performance against the SLRs and shall recommend remedial actions to resolve any
performance deficiencies,” The documentation of such administrative actions will occur with the use
of a Letter of Understanding (LOU).
Service Level Requirements
Pursuant to section 1.10.4 of the original agreement, “The Parties shall review and discuss the SLRs
and Fees from time to time, but not less frequently than once each Contract Year. Upon mutual
agreement, after any such review, the SLRs and Fees may be adjusted, for the benefit of
City/County,” Both parties hereby agree to modify the SLR’s in accordance with mutually agreed
upon parameters. Attachment A, containing all SLR’s cited in the original agreement, has been
added to this LOU for reference purposes. Attachment B contains the modified SLR’s which have
been mutually agreed upon as being feasible by ISA and NG.
Claiming of Credits
NG Agrees to credit ISA, in accordance with the procedures detailed in the Original Agreement,
Three Hundred Thousand Dollars ($300,000). The mentioned credit is for missed Milestones and
SLR’s accumulated from February, 2005 through and including June, 2005.
Additionally, NG agrees to provide a Deputy Project Manager for up to six (6) months. NG’s price for
the additional Deputy Project Manager is approximately twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) per month.
Also, NG will absorb all costs for transferring SA3 staff to SA1 through December 2005. Additionally,
NG agrees to provide an Asset Manager to the City/County at no additional cost, for the period of
January through August. NG’s price for the mentioned Asset Inventory Manager, including travel, is
estimated at twenty-four

5

Major Marion County Issues
Being Tracked Include:
• The State requires that Microsoft Service Pack 2 be applied to all PC’s
accessing IN SVRS
• The GIS mapping subsystem of IN SVRS is not accurate enough
– Verbal plan is to overlay Marion County mapping on top of the State’s

• Potential magnitude of MC VR address and data conversion
• Ability to eliminate duplicates as required by HAVA
• Development of 3 MOU’s
¾ #1 To provide for the purchase of PC’s with reimbursement by the State
¾ #2 Mitigation of Marion County and State help Desks
¾ #3 Highlight and mitigate the differences between pertinent MC and
State standards, policies and requirements
• After a visit to Hamilton County (a pilot county), Project Sponsors have
concerns about the speed and efficiency of IN SVRS

and noted Tom Creasser was attending for Michael Rodman, Major Meadows for Sheriff Anderson.
Approval of the March 25, 2006 IT Board Minutes
Judge Young moved to approve the April 25, 2006 IT Board Minutes. The motion was seconded by Ms. Enders
and carried unanimously.
ISA Report
Ms. Patel presented the ISA report as submitted.
Ms. Patel stated that DAI and NG had met all of the Service Levels Requirements for SA3 for the month of
March. Ms Patel reported NG missed 6 SLRs within SA1 and SA2 and will be charged $23,000 credit. At this
time, NG is disputing that charge.
Judge Young stated that the Microsoft migration schedule is very tight and will require extensive customer
cooperation in order to move forward. Judge Young suggested providing the customers as much advance
notice as possible. Ms. Patel stated that Mr. Downey is the project manager for the MS Migration
Communications Team and is putting together a communication plan. A website has been created including
frequently asked questions.
Judge Young asked if a replacement has been planned for Tidemark, specifically in relation to the DMD auto
assignment project and the new code. There have been problems with Tidemark which is a legacy program and
potentially could cause problems during the Microsoft migration. Ms. Patel replied that Tidemark will be
upgraded to Accela Automation. DMD has met with the Office of Finance and Management and received
approval to upgrade.
Judge Young asked for clarification on why the helpdesk calls are 500 behind last year and only 70% of the
usage allotted. Ms. Patel explained that ISA increased the number of IMAC’s and volume in helpdesk calls in
anticipation of the Microsoft Migration and other planned projects. Ms. Patel explained that the enterprise will
pay for 76,000 calls which are not project specific.

Information Services Agency – Document: ISA-IT Board Meeting Minutes

Page 1 of 6

Information Technology Board
Meeting Minutes
Judge Young stated the assets reported are ones NG purchased for the enterprise since 2005 and only 53%
have been accounted for. Ms. Patel stated that was correct.
Mr. Clancy stated that the 53% is for the required fields. NG is disputing this penalty via the dispute resolution
process detailed in the contract. Mr. Clancy continued that early last year the IT Board asked NG for
enforcement standards and procedures to ensure when an inventory is complete it would include moves and
replacements. These standards were delivered to ISA on 7/19/2005 never adopted by the IT Board, Standards
Committee or the IT Team. NG has submitted 3 asset management plans and which have not been discussed
or agreed upon by both parties. NG and ISA have not defined what fields are required. Currently 32 fields are
required. The 53% referenced as missing is 53% of the required 32 fields for the 2005 calendar year inventory.
Ms. Patel stated that she disagreed with Mr. Clancy’s stand on the SLR.
Mr. Clancy stated that ISA has commissioned a team to develop a plan beginning with what is available through
Altiris which will serve as a base line of what will be available automatically. The next step will be to determine
what is needed to populate active directory and determine the source of that data. What (if any) data will need
to be entered manually and the source of that data is not yet known. Mr. Clancy stated that ISA and NG never
agreed on a definition of what the inventory fields should be. Judge Young stated that asset management and
inventory control are an SLR. All SLRs were controlled in the original contract and bid on. NG, ISA and the
Board revisited the SLRs and have modified them to be something that NG can meet. Judge Young continued
that it is somewhat disingenuous that there is a contract that spells out what NG is supposed to do. The
contract was agreed on and bid on. At this time there should little negotiation occuring.
Mr. Clancy responded that the contract is silent on what data fields the asset management plan is to include and
what 98% accuracy truly means. The contract does not spell it out. NG has submitted at least three plans and
none have been agreed upon by both parties.
Ms. Patel stated that NG has had 5 project managers on this account. Mr. Richardson (NG project manager)
discussed in October 2005, 34 required fields were going to be tracked and up until March the fields have not
been an issue. Now NG is disputing the number of fields. Mr. Richardson stated to the IT Board that the 34
agreed upon fields would be included in the asset management report. Ms. Patel stated that at this time she
would like to get the team back together to re-evaluate the required fields and see what Altiris can do
automatically or consider conducting a physical inventory.
Ms. Patel stated that it is NG’s responsibility to provide ISA with an inventory. It is ISA’s responsibility to
protect that inventory in order to keep it accurate as possible. That inventory has not been provided. Mr. Ortell
explained that the 53% is a result of review of 1500 line items including five hundred laptops and one thousand
desktops. Of the information provided 804 line items were missing. Mr. Ortell continued that the information
omitted included fields such as type of operating systems and IP address. Mr. Ortell stated that the review did
not take into consideration the accuracy of the information.
Major Meadows asked what the resolution process timeframe is. Ms. Patel responded that a letter from NG’s
contract manager stated that through due diligence the inventory originally provided by ISA was at 17%
accuracy and asked if anyone was notified that was originally disputed. Ms. Patel continued that the inventory
report provided by NG measures only new assets acquired after 2005. The resolution process allows 30 days
to review.
Mr. Clifford asked when the next asset management report would be presented. Ms. Patel stated it would be
available in June and presented at the July IT Board meeting. Mr. Clifford suggested following through with
identification of the issues, the arbitration of the issues and report back to the board. Mr. Clifford stated that
asset management is important to the Office of Finance and Management, who is very interested in resolution.
Mr. Ricketts stated that the township assessors went through a physical inventory 6 or 8 months ago and listed
all assets and asked if anything had been done with that data. Mr. Clancy responded that the information was

Meeting Minutes
updated into the Lex system. Ms. Patel stated that MCSD, IPD, the Courts and many other agencies helped out
providing inventory information.
Financial Report
Ms. Dillon presented the ISA Financial Report as submitted.
Judge Young asked if there were concerns on the collection side that the County is at 1.3 percent and is this an
accounting issue which will be caught up later. Ms. Dillon stated that the 2005 chargeback normally would have
been posted as revenue for 2006. This year the revenue was actually posted as 2005. Additionally, the 2006
County chargeback has not been paid but the Auditor’s Office is working on making payment.
Mr. Clifford stated that the Office of Finance and Management is working with the County Auditor and the
County is a little behind. Ms. Patel responded that it would not cause a cash flow problem.
Mr. Creasser asked if everything has been billed. Ms. Patel explained that the customers have been invoiced
for the months January through March but the percentage on the report reflects the total budget.
CivicNet Report
Mr. Downey stated that a single-month record for transaction volume was set in March, with overall first quarter
statistics showing a 12.3% increase in usage compared to first quarter 2005. The enhancements completed for
the Treasurer’s Office Bulk Property Search Service will provide users with more detailed information on
charged and unpaid amounts for all tax penalties, conservancies, and special/additional assessments for each
property parcel requested. CivicNet and the Division of Compliance also identified an enhancement for the
online permitting services offered. The new enhancements will email notifications to permit holders 30, 15 and 7
days before the permit expiration date. The emails will remind permit holders to file a completion card or an
extension to avoid additional fees. Mr. Downey discussed the marketing strategy initiative with MCSD for the
new Commissary Deposit Project and Animal Care & Control for Canine Crime Stoppers.
Mr. Clifford stated that the growth trend has been incredible and requested CivicNet revenue projections.
Judge Young stated that in looking at usage of the system there were 110,000 transactions that occurred with
75,000 of those from courts. Judge Young continued that with .Net and web-based applications there is
concern that is $250,000-300,000 in revenue the courts could generate. Judge Young requested legal counsel
to research renegotiating the contract.
Resolution 06-10 to Implement the Altiris Suite of Products
Mr. Buchanan presented the approval of the contract amendment which will off-set the licensing, support and
maintenance for the deployment and use of the Novell ZenWorks workstation import/removal product and
services and replace it with the Altiris suite of products. Altiris is a higher quality product. ISA has approved the
outlaying funds similar to ZenWorks. The amendment will give NG what they need for the whole purchase.
Judge Young made a motion to approve Resolution 06-10. The motion was seconded by Ms. Sadler and
carried unanimously.
Resolution 06-11 to Transfer NEC Maintenance Agreement to ISA
Mr. Buchanan and Captain Bee and Mr. Taylor were present. Captain Bee was instrumental in the NEC
agreement and was available to answer questions. Mr. Buchanan explained that this resolution is to move
forward with ISA’s ability to administer this contract. Initial negotiations for the hardware began in 2001 through
a series of addendums and amendments brought all parties to three contract amendments. This resolution will
consolidate the amendments.

Meeting Minutes

Ms. Enders moved for acceptance of Resolution 06-11. Judge Young seconded the motion.
Judge Young commented the agreement is a step in the right direction and congratulated all parties involved.
He continued that as a Board, the enterprise needs to continue to look globally at what is being done.
Mr. Taylor commented that the initial process was a nightmare and expressed appreciation for Mr. Buchanan’s
input at the meeting in which he, NG, and NEC attended. Mr. Buchanan recommended the direction of the
project and IPD agreed to it.
The motion was called and carried unanimously.
Resolution 06-12 amend the Service Agreement between Aerotek and City of Indianapolis and Marion County
Mr. Buchanan presented the service agreement. Mr. Carufel was available to answer questions.
For clarification, Judge Young stated that this is basically an extension to an existing contract and ISA did not
anticipate how long this one person was going to work. The individual is working longer than anticipated. Ms.
Patel stated that the internet web developer will not be replaced at this time
Ms. Enders moved to approve Resolution 06-12. Judge Young seconded the motion and the motion carried
unanimously.
Resolution 06-13 Amend the Contract between ISA and Clawson Communications Inc.
Mr. Buchanan presented Resolution 06-13 which is an extension of an existing contract through 2007. At the
end of the extension the contract will be competed out. Ms. Patel stated that one of the reasons the contract is
not being bid out is due to the Microsoft migration. ISA preferred to maintain a vendor that is familiar with the
environment and is knowledgeable regarding office locations. Ms. Patel responded that the price and terms
were the same.
Judge Young moved to approve Resolution 06-13. Major Meadows seconded the motion and it carried
unanimously.
Judge Young expressed his appreciation for receiving the contracts in time for review prior to the IT Board
meeting.
Microsoft Migration
Mr. Petrecca and Ms. Swatosh presented the Microsoft migration update. Mr. Petrecca stated that moving from
Novell GroupWise to Microsoft Outlook is a major undertaking. A Management Team exists and is working on
assessing the current environment. Meetings have taken place with many of our customers to obtain
information, ideas and guidance on where ISA and Unisys need to go on this project. The project has been
broken out into five phases. In phase one, the team will be concentrating on the vision. Once complete, the
team will move into phase two, planning and design, deciding how to achieve the vision, what steps should be
taken at what point, and who gets deployed first/last. A lab will be set up. Nothing will be put out onto desktops
until tested. Build processes make sure everything has been tested before going live. Finally, the project will
move into deployment and migration of the user accounts from Novell GroupWise to Microsoft Outlook.
Additionally the team will be working on packaging all applications. This will help ease the work of the pc’s,
make easier for everyone. Throughout this process the team will be working on project management and
knowledge transfer. The enterprise has good people locally but does not necessarily have experience. Staff
will be gathering as much knowledge as possible as they move forward.
Information Services Agency – Document: ISA-IT Board Meeting Minutes

Page 4 of 6

Information Technology Board
Meeting Minutes
Ms. Swatosh discussed the process of conducting interviews with customers to obtain information on critical
applications. The team is also gathering information on inventory gathered through Altiris and reviewing those
reports. To better communicate and share deliverables an extranet has been set up. A draft version of a
governance model will be placed on the extranet as well as updates from the project management office,
standards, policies and procedures that should be followed.
Judge Young commented that from an enterprise point of view this is a great project; however the switch over
from GroupWise to Outlook will not be seamless and asked if ISA and Unisys will be working on communicating
to the users how and when to clean up GroupWise accounts. Judge Young recommended educating the users
as soon as possible.
Mr. Petrecca stated that the team is aware that there are users that have thousands of emails in their in-box and
there is a good bit of sensitivity around the issue of email retention. Mr. Petrecca stated that the intent is to
migrate everything that is in GroupWise, how that will be accomplished is being worked out. The team intends
to communicate that effort and identify users that have large email boxes. The goal is to target users that need
that information most.
Ms. Enders requested that the team give users guidelines on how to manage their email. Ms. Patel stated that
ISA has requested guidelines from the Office of Corporation Counsel on what can and cannot be deleted.
Mr. Petrecca stated that policy and standards need to be put in place to establish guidelines by which the
agency may communicate to the enterprise.
Major Meadows commented that one of the signs of a successful project is how successfully bumps are
handled. Major Meadows stated that he believed the project has already encountered bumps and expressed
concern on the method of resolution. Major Meadows stated that he would task the team with doing a better
job. Ms. Swatosh stated that as a result of a couple interview sessions last week follow up will be pursued to
clear up any issues.
SVRS
Mr. Pavey presented the update on the SVRS project. Marion County is concerned with rebuild of the
application. Overall it was very successful. It was determined that the flatbed scanners provided by the State
were not robust enough to handle Marion County. Currently, Marion County is in a blackout period which
means no changes may be made without state board approval. The next build is due in two weeks. The
decision was made to postpone changes until after the primaries. The application is in the sandbox so that the
Voter Registration Office and Election Board can test it.
Progress has been made on the electronic signatures, which are now coming across. The new and improved
polling place locator application is in production thanks to GIS and Mr. Petrecca. Marion County remains
concerned with the overall consistency, reliability and responsiveness of First Tuesday. Mr. Pavey
complimented Ms. Boyd on the excellent job she did coordinating the election.
Ms. Sadler commented that there was a major failure in the system which had a significant impact on Marion
County. Last year Marion County requested explicit information, which was provided on the poll books that
correlated with the precinct splits. The topic was discussed in meetings every 2 weeks. The most recent
information provided indicated the vendor was working on it. With out corresponding labelling on the ballots
and the poll books, the clerks cannot match up the ballots.
Ms. Sadler expressed her thanks to Kyle Walker and the Voter Registration Office. Ms. Sadler stated that she
does not know what the Clerks Office would do without Mr. Walker and his ability to manipulate data. Mr.
Walker was able to provide reports. Ms. Sadler continued that the poll workers would be required to check 2
lists. Ms. Sadler discussed her frustration that the issue did not get resolved and explained that the
Information Services Agency – Document: ISA-IT Board Meeting Minutes

Page 5 of 6

Information Technology Board
Meeting Minutes
‘enhancements’ discussed were not truly enhancements, but items that should have been included from the
beginning. The vendor provided 14 variations of ballots and failed to tell Marion County that a specific version of
Acrobat Reader was required. Marion County was notified on April 11 at 7 pm. Ms. Sadler took the opportunity
to thank Mr. Snodgrass, Mr. Ortell, and Mr. Pearcy for recognizing the importance of the issue and resolving the
problem quickly.
Ms. Sadler stated that there is a shortage of poll workers which may be due to the system problems scaring
away volunteers. Without citizens, Marion County will not be able to get the polls open. Ms. Sadler encouraged
volunteers to call 327-5100 and for City-County employees, who are given the day off, to work the polls.
Mr. Clifford added that it is not necessary to declare a party to vote in the school board election. Citizens need
to ask for a school board ballot.
Imaging Prototype Demonstration
Mr. Nelson, Mr. Thamba and Mr. Wilson presented a document imaging demonstration to the IT Board.
Security is available within the document so non-public information can be hidden.
The prototype will be in production for the courts next week.
The meeting adjourned at 11:02
The next IT Board Meeting will be May 30, 2006.

ISA will work with NG to implement recommended improvements to inventory
process.
ISA met with NG to discuss different ways of looking at the data, how Altiris
and Active Directory can be used to improve our accuracy results. From the
initial meeting most of the fields that are important to the City/County can be
obtained automatically once we have Altiris integrated with Active Directory.
Discussions continue to work with NG & Unisys to define which fields need to
be incorporated into Active Directory that will facilitate asset management.

Risks and Mitigation

The dispute resolution process is moving forward. Joel Buege for ISA and
Kevin Gorman for NG have been selected to participate in the mitigation
process.
Poor inventory completeness and accuracy will cause improper estimates for
software license counts, PCs supported, migrated, etc.
Work through mitigation process. Continue to work with NG to implement
recommended improvements to inventory process.

Synchronized the Siebel development, test and production environments.
Completed revision of LOVs. The project team met several times to go over
portal design. A list of portal design questions was compiled. A proposal has
been received for moving the test and dev environment to a new server. Cost
is approximately $5,700. Created a definitive test plan for UAT. Installed
patch on development Siebel environment.
The web service problem which manifested on April 5 and resolved itself by
April 6 still has an unknown cause. The service request sent to ESRI has
been closed by ESRI since the problem resolved itself. A request for
additional information to help troubleshoot has been made with no response
from ESRI to date.
Performance issues related to running the Test Siebel instance on a virtual
server still need to be resolved. Theses performance issues may be helped
by synchronizing the development and test Siebel environments with the
production environment. However, the ultimate resolution will probably
require moving the test Siebel environment to a different server.

Overall Status

Google Mini is a scaled-down version of the Google search engine dedicated
to searching the IndyGov website. Although just as simple to use for basic
searches as our current search engine Ultraseek, Google Mini can provide
more robust capabilities for our more advanced users. Since searches are
performed in the same fashion, users will not require any additional training.
Perhaps one of the greatest benefits of Google Mini is that it is capable of
searching the entire IndyGov domain rather than just IndyGov.org. This
would include other City/County hosted sites such as Knozone.com,
IndyHomelessConnect.com, IndyFitness.net, etc.

Phase
Overall Status
Deployment /
Green
Testing
The Automated Mapping Engine, (AME), will allow users to create a high
cartographic quality map without the need for desktop GIS software to be
installed. The application has been designed with a non-technical user in
mind and will simplify the process of creating maps. It will only be available to
users on the IndyGov Intranet.
Users will be able to select from a set of predefined datasets to be mapped
on top of a base set of map layers. They will also be able to further refine the
data to be displayed by specifying an attribute filter to be applied, a
geographic region such as a township, council district or neighborhood
organization boundary, and a date range. The user will be able to specify the
size and orientation for the map and then the application will create a PDF
format file of the map in question and ship it to the user.
The AME is being developed and deployed in 2 phases. Functionality
included in Phase I is described above. Phase II will add the following:
•

The ability to save map definitions for repeated use.

•

The ability to subscribe to receive a map based upon a saved
definition on a regular basis via email. This map would of course
contain current data such as all citizen calls to the MAC within the
past month.

•

Reporting capabilities so that a tabular report could be included in
your map subscription.

Project Initiation
Green
This project will involve the creation of a new public internet application
entitled MyNeighborhood. MyNeighborhood is envisioned to become a single
source of information related to a citizen’s surroundings. Preliminary plans
are to consider the following types of items for inclusion:
• Elected Officials
• Trash Collection Day
• Zoning, Flood Zone, and Land Use information.
• Crime Statistics
• School Choices including Charters
• Parks
• Libraries
• Police & Fire Facilities
• Post Offices
• Neighborhood Associations
In addition to listing each of these items for a given address and providing
more detailed information about each subject, later phases of
MyNeighborhood may also include the ability to provide citizens with
directions from their address to the location of interest.
The GIS Team will create this application using a “Portal” approach that will
allow us to utilize a common framework to which we can easily add additional
functionality piece by piece without re-deploying the entire application.

Final preparation for the primary Election. Work with the State and Quest to
bring about improvements in procedures, performance, reports and
equipment before the Fall General Election
Quest successfully implemented a new build over the weekend of May.
Included in this build were the resolution of the bar code reading problems;
also the server and hardware for Reporting Services was upgraded to
provide more computing capacity.
Split ballots were not handled properly in the poll books by Quest. The
problem affected 53 precincts and over 33,000 registered voters. Kyle
Walker worked with Quest to create a separate report of the splits. Poll
workers had to look at both the poll books and the special “split” reports to
make sure the voters received the correct ballots. This made training of poll
workers more difficult and increased the possibility of recounts.
Also, the Marion County project sponsors remain very concerned about the
overall consistency and reliability of First Tuesday due to the time to enter
data, downtime and responsiveness.

Avaya CSRP submitted Lori Kuhn to the Computerworld Honors Foundation
City of Indianapolis, Indiana for Citizen Service Improvement
Avaya nominated Lori for this prestigious award for her innovative use of telecommunications systems
and applications that serve the citizens of Indianapolis. Each year, The Computerworld Honors
Foundation identifies and honors men and women from around the world whose visionary use of
information technology produces and promotes positive social change. These innovators, true

appointments and meeting reminders are both off by one hour.
Juniper Firewall & ISP Replacement
Juniper Firewall engineer is targeted for June 19th. We will have to move all VPN users to the new
Cisco VPN appliance before we switch.
Internet Service Provider (ISP)/Bandwidth Upgrade
Redundant ISP link for increased bandwidth has been delayed pending installation of new firewall.
StoneWare
Discussions were opened with StoneWare as a replacement for ICHAIN. It could also give us
clientless access to home and mapped drives, access to remote desktop control without putting holes
in the firewall, reduce our need for multiple DMZs, reduced need for Citrix, it would greatly facilitate
Disaster Recovery/Business Continuity, provide portal reporting services by agency, and a potential
replacement for the Webevents Calendaring. One other selling point – they are an Indiana company.
Current plan is to have test servers installed by the end of May.
Election Day
Telops was busy: We were successful with the election. We set up an ACD for the election service
center. We installed 8 phones in the Election Board Conference room. We reprogrammed the
callers’ menus for the election with the time driven date changes when specific events occurred. We
recorded all the new polling sites on the IVR (Interactive Voice Recognition). We set up the call
centers at the service center, in voter registration, the MAC and the election board. We installed 8
new modem lines for new equipment that ended up not being certified and available for use from
ES&S. We added 26 ports to the IVR application for 48 hours to handle the excessive calls. And
when it was all over, we put everything back to normal. We are compiling the statistics for the Clerk.
MCSD Phone Update
We have been working on the sheriff’s project and have gotten most of the forwarding, mailboxes and

completed by the end of the year. The lines at MECA, and the jail, plus any remaining lines within the
CCB can move at any time. However, any remote sites will depend on the Metropolitan Police
consolidation plans.
Telops Infrastructure
We received the reforecasted price for the Avaya maintenance with our new equipment. We have
significantly increased the equipment by adding the duplicate core equipment at our DR site.
However, the monthly pricing will decrease by $5000. If we resign our existing contract that is to
expire in April, 2007 and extend it for 48 months from now, we will save approximately $480,000 over
the next 4 years. It is recommended that we do this.
Avaya has approved for ISA to be a beta site for their new ACD call management system. Our
existing CMS (Call Management System) is 4 ½ years old. We believe this would be a good direction
since we would be receiving the newest technology. It would service the Mayor’s Action Center and
all of our other call centers. This would be beneficial if we implement a 311 center.

Application quit working, NG worked through the night to set up another server. The issue ended up

ISA has collected $9 Million dollars or 32.4% of our projected revenue for YTD April 2006, which includes payments received
for the 4th quarter 2005 billings. Quarterly reports have been sent to the Controller’s and Auditor’s Office by Department or
Agency.
The revenue for the County’s December chargeback has historically been posted in the following year’s revenue. For the
December 2005 chargeback, the revenue was posted in FAMIS as 2005 revenue. Therefore, the County’s revenue
percentage will be lower than the expected percent each month.

CIVICNET HIGHLIGHTS

April at a Glance
In April, the Marion County Sherriff’s Department Online
Commissary Deposit neared completion, with the project
entering the testing phase. Also in April, a test plan was drafted
for the Division of Compliance to ensure that the planned
Tidemark upgrade will not affect Web permitting for the office.
Transactions dipped in April compared to March, but still
showed a four percent increase compared to April 2005.
The Marion County Sherriff’s Department and the CivicNet
Quality Assurance Team have completed testing for the new
Online Commissary Deposit for inmates. The application is set
to deploy in early May. Promotional posters and a press release
created by the CivicNet Marketing Team, were delivered to the
MCSD at the end of April. English and Spanish versions of the
posters will be displayed at the jail in high-traffic areas to
promote the new Online Commissary Deposit option.
In addition to the MCSD marketing materials, the CivicNet
marketing team also delivered campaign concepts to Animal
Care and Control for the Canine Crimestoppers Campaign. The
campaign is geared towards school children, the general public
and those participating in dog fighting. Animal Care and
Control is reviewing the concepts and will direct CivicNet on
any needed changes.
The Purchasing Division now has the ability to include free
County Bids available for download from their website.
CivicNet deployed the service for County Bids in early April.
The new service allows free bid proposals to be downloaded
from the Purchasing Division’s Website. The new functionality
will save the Purchasing Division staff time and money, as the
bids will no longer have to be mailed via the U.S. Postal Service.

During April, CivicNet also worked to complete the testing plan
for the upcoming upgrade to Tidemark for the Division of
Compliance. The 35-page document details each step needed in
order to complete an online Web Permit application, as well as
lists the fields that should be updated within Tidemark once a
permit application is submitted. The testing plan will be used in
early to mid-May to test Web Permitting Applications against
the new version of Tidemark.

ISA Report
Ms. Patel presented the ISA report, stating that a physical inventory may need to be complete prior to
Active Directory conversion. The inventory dispute resolution is on-going. The hardware and software
needed for the Microsoft migration has been ordered and will be delivered, inventoried, and installed
in a timely manner. All SA3 Service Level Requirements were met.
The Siebel MAC enhancements are in process and staff is currently working on design and workflow.

Information Technology Board
Meeting Minutes
Ms. Patel stated that Avaya nominated Ms. Kuhn for the prestigious award Computerworld Honors
Foundation City of Indianapolis, Indiana for Citizen Service Improvement. For her innovative use of
telecommunications systems and applications that serve the citizens of Indianapolis. Each year, The
Computerworld Honors Foundation identifies and honors men and women from around the world
whose visionary use of information technology produces and promotes positive social change. These
innovators, true revolutionaries in their respective fields, are nominated by Chairpersons and CEOs of
the world’s leading information-technology companies, like Avaya.
The SA3 Helpdesk call count to date is 460. The referenced number does not include the Microsoft
migration.
Microsoft Migration
Judge Young commented on that he was please with Mr. Grigsby’s appointment. He further stated
that the Migration schedule is tight and asked how the deadline will be met with the delay on the
hardware procurement. Judge Young continued that the customers are not fully happy and requested
Unisys work on improving communication.
Ms. Sadler commented that for the Clerk’s Office the most important project is JUSTIS.Net. Ms.
Sadler asked if DAI would be able to remain on schedule through completion. Mr. Thornsberry stated
that when approached regarding Mr. Grigsby leaving DAI and working for ISA, he requested a
commitment back that Mr. Grigsby would continue with Justis.net. Mr. Grigsby provided a personal
commitment to see the project through.
Judge Young stated that the web service went down and is concerned that ESRI was contacted and
not responsive. Mr. Petrecca clarified that ESRI did respond and required ISA to reproduce the error
in order to identify the problem. ISA has not been able to reproduce the error or determine if ISA is
responsible.
Judge Young asked if the grant deadline was met. Ms. Patel responded that required documents
were submitted on time. Judge Young expressed appreciation to Mr. Maxwell and Mr. Young for
assisting in providing phone lines at juvenile to help with complaints and problems. Judge Young also
thanked Mr. Snodgrass and Ms. Upshaw for the great job they are doing at the helpdesk for the
courts. Judge Young also thanked Mr. Campbell for his assistance on the refresh. Mr. Campbell
identified how to store on-site and discussed providing four refreshes a day which avoided the bulk
rate. Ms. Patel commented that Mr. Campbell did a tremendous job out at Fleet Services.
Dr. Inui asked who the Project Manager on the ‘My Neighborhood’ portal is and if they have contacted
the POLIS center. Mr. Carufel stated that the project is not planned all the way through but
communication with the POLIS center would be pursued.
Judge Young commented that the company being considered for the replacement for ICHAIN,
Stoneware is based in Indianapolis and would be an awesome partner. Ms. Patel stated that the
product is being looked at for functionality. Judge Young stated that under Ms. Patel the enterprise is
receiving new infrastructure, more equipment and it is costing less.

Information Technology Board
Meeting Minutes
Financial Report
Ms. Dillon-Macy presented the ISA Financial Report. Ms. Dillon-Macy stated that the ISA report is
divided into four sections. The first section covers the Budget Comparison of 2005 versus 2006. The
second portion represents revenue collected. The third section reflects 2005 versus 2006 contract
comparison and the fourth section is 2006 application maintenance and support budget.
Mr. Clifford asked if the current trend is expected to continue on the City-side. Ms. Patel stated that
there are some enhancements processes in place minor things 50 hours and that use some of the
hours would be used for the database conversion.
CivicNet Report
Mr. Downey stated that in April, the Marion county Sheriff’s Department Online Commissary Deposit
had neared completion, with the project entering the testing phase. A test plan was drafted for the
Division of Compliance to ensure that the planned Tidemark upgrade will not affect Web permitting for
the office. In addition to the MCSD marketing materials, the CivicNet marketing team also delivered
campaign concepts to Animal Care and Control for the Canine Crimestoppers Campaign.
The Purchasing Division now has the ability to include free County Bids available for download from
their website. CivicNet deployed the service for County Bids in early April. The new service allows
free bid proposals to be downloaded from the Purchasing Division.
Ms. Sadler discussed concern regarding the Canine Crimestoppers Campaign which is a marketing
strategy rather than Enhanced Access to data. The initial discussion included the spending of a
significant portion of the EARC on a marketing campaign rather than enhancement of data. Ms.
Sadler asked what is being produced as far as billboards and marketing. Ms. Lindenbusch explained
that the project ended up being very condensed, approximately 19 hours, and really did not require
assistance.
Email
Mr. Grigsby stated that 1.2.3 Retention was presented to most of the Standards Committee for
approval. The originally policy was titled the acceptable use policy and provided guidelines for email.
The previous versions of the policy were constraining. This version flips the intent around and offers
what is wanted from the user. Mr. Grigsby asked that the document be considered as software, this is
version one. Mr. Grigsby stated that ISA is asking the board to accept 1.2.3 which deals with
retention. Mr. Downey will be distributing a communication plan regarding retention. Mr. Grigsby
stated that the super-users and those with over 750 meg in their mailbox will be focused on first. The
individual or agency can decide what public record is. Three years is a minimum for retention. The
agency may establish internal policy beyond the three year minimum. Major Meadows asked if users
with mailboxes over 750 megabytes have been notified. The information will be given to the agency
heads. ISA and NG will then work with the agencies to determine how to best reduce the size of the
mailboxes and then establish a deadline. Mr. Grigsby stated that a full back-up of GroupWise was
performed this weekend and everything has been captured.
Ms. Sadler stated that recently a legal opinion was given by the State Public Access Counselor about
email retention in particular that it is not the agency that makes the decision on retention. The county
public records commission should be involved and meets once a quarter. Ms. Sadler recommended

having the public records make some decision working with legal counsel because it is a campaign
year and these issues are not individual agencies to make other than court records which come
through the state court administrator.
Mr. Grigsby stated that the ‘version’ format is designed for revision. Mr. Clifford stated that part of the
thought process, ‘what is a public record’ requires more education than currently exists and suggested
including those type of definitions. Mr. Clifford requested Mr. Howell’s assistance. Mr. Clifford
continued that more and more personal email is used as a devise to communicate, since it is easier to
send an email rather than placing a call and would need to be addressed at an appropriate venue.
Mr. Grigsby pointed out that under Behaviors 1.2.4.2 ‘Email was not implemented for Personal use,
but may be tolerated per Agency, or Department Office guidelines’.
Major Ball stated that he appreciates the way the policy is being handled but the policy needs to be
followed-up with training. Most users reading the behavior section of the policy are not going to
understand what that means. In order to make policy stick it needs to be followed-up with training.
Ms. Patel added that the initiatives would be in line with HR policies.
Dr. Inui asked if any attention has been given to redundant storage and establishing a process with
the Microsoft migration before messaging goes out. Dr. Inui asked if there were a policy prohibiting
users from taking home (portable storage) data or if there were guidelines implemented on an agency
level. Dr. Inui stated that the specific concern is security issues and making sure the user base is
knowledgeable.
Judge Young move to adopt 1.2.3 Retention. The motion was second by Major Ball and Mr. Clifford
called for discussion.
Major Ball asked if 1.2.3 Retention has been accepted by the Standards and Policies Committee. He
continued that he did not want to slow down the process but had quite a few questions including how
everybody will achieve 750 megabytes or less, how to involve the public records commission, and
how public records policies could effects retention. Mr. Grigsby replied that those issues will be
addressed regardless and once storage the enterprise will move forward. Major Meadows asked if
legal counsel has looked at the entire policy. Major Meadows was concerned with the use of shall,
will, and asked that if the Board approves the retention part of the document are they not in essence
approving the entire document. Ms. Patel stated that the guidelines from 1999 were still applicable
and that ISA will make sure the Standards Committee and legal counsel are informed before moving
forward.
Ms. Sadler stated that she would be supportive of accepting 1.2.3 Retention given a snap shot was
taken. Ms. Sadler continued that she is uncomfortable with agencies and departments making
decisions because she is not certain that is legal. Ms. Sadler recommended exploring options with
the public records commission. Ms. Patel stated that something needs to be in place in order to move
forward with the migration. Judge Young stated that education becomes critical when a document is
received that is a determined by your agency to be a ‘public record’. The document should
immediately be moved to a public server to facilitate an individual coming to the enterprise and
making a public records request. Judge Young stated that it is critical to engage communication with
the public records committee and do not think the agencies can not be held accountable. Ms. Sadler
stated that the length of time is dictated by the commission and each agency should be
communicating with their legal representative.

Judge Young withdrew his motion and moved to approve 1.2.3 Retention subject to review by
Corporation Counsel and the public records committee. The motion was seconded and carried
unanimously.
Major Ball added that he supports passing the 1.2.3 Retention but commented that this was the first
stab at an enterprise policy which is an important function of this board. Major Ball requested more
time be provided to the Board to review and integrate policy.
Microsoft Migration
Mr. Petrecca presented an update on the Microsoft Migration Project. Additional interviews have
been conducted as well as follow-up interviews with some of the agencies. The first phase of the
project has been completed including envisioning and discovery so that the requirements are
understood. A design workshop was held with the technical staff from NG, ISA and Unisys to discuss
how the migration would take place and what the future state of the enterprise needs to be. A
determination needs to be made on what package applications to be deployed to user desktops and
what information will be put on laptops and desktops. There will be issues and risks including
procuring and installing the hardware within the compressed timeframe. ISA needs to ensure
sufficient resources are on hand and to make use of servers so what is needed is in place. Mr.
Petrecca discussed the challenge of migrating excessively large mailboxes and email appropriately.
Another challenge will be to integrate MECA and determine how to best define needed applications.
The contract with Unisys included packaging 350 application. Once Altiris was deployed applications
identified exceed 350. The number of current applications in the enterprise is in the thousands with
the majority being on 4 or 5 desktops. The next step will be to determine how many applications
warrant automatic deployment versus manual deployment.
Major Meadows stated the importance of including MECA and making sure information is pushed out
to the vehicles and communication continues uninterrupted. Major Meadows asked if the end result
would be enhanced capability.
Ms. Patel discussed that there are two options regarding packaging applications. ISA can request the
vendor package more applications with a cost association or once the applications are identified that
are to be packed, they can be deployed through WISE. Mr. Clifford asked if the types of applications
are specific to a department, such as the grant management tool, and possibly not synchronized or
compatible with Microsoft. Mr. Petrecca responded that in some cases they are widely distributed.
Once a determination can be made that Altiris is reporting accurately and users are using applications
as intended, a solution may be identified.
Mr. Edens stated that 5200 devices have been identified and managed through Altiris. Mr. Clifford
commented that 20% of the users within the enterprise have specialty software on their computers.
Ms. Patel stated that some applications identified are a result of free installation. ISA needs to make
sure required licenses are purchased with justified applications. Mr. Clifford recommended as the
enterprise moves forward with the current a inventory of applications a residing methodology needs to
be incorporated, to keep track and control new purchases to the system. Ms. Patel stated that the
use of Altiris as a management tool will assist in deployment and tracking.
Ms. Swatosh discussed the completion of the remaining hardware and software purchases for the lab.
Unisys has started to package some of the applications that have been identified such as Adobe.
Work is continuing on the base image proof of the concept lab and finalizing the email policy as
discussed. Plans for June include delivering the signed documents for the active directory and

exchange as well as the desktop and design document. Once the design document is final Unisys will
be moving into the next phase of actually building the lab environment.
Dr. Inui asked if consideration has been taken in standardizing the applications as policy. The current
number of applications in the enterprise seems remarkably high. Ms. Patel stated that this type of
decision will be part of the role of the Standards and Policies Committee.
Mr. Eden stated that Altiris will allow for establishing a base line for applications and identify older
versions. Judge Young stated for clarification Altiris will allow a user to come up to standard but will
not allow download and upgrade. The way the enterprise is set up does not allow the user to upgrade
the machine independently.
Data Base Conversion Update
Mr. Thornsberry stated the scope is to assist in upgrading, retiring or converting to .Net all BRM
identified Microsoft Access databases, application front ends users in the ISA infrastructure, and to
establish an ISA Enterprise Wide Source Control Library using Microsoft Visual studio Team
Foundation Server 2005. Mr. Grigsby is technically on the project on an as needed basis. Altiris will
be used, as well as, questionnaire responses. Mr. Thornsberry stated that any application that is
important enough to talk about is important enough to keep. Databases that have not been used in a
couple years will most likely be retired. The communication plan will assist in finding out what is in
the environment and allow users to upgrade themselves through an upgrade class. Currently, there
are far too many applications in the enterprise for one entity to test. DAI staff will help with specific
problems. Microsoft Access database applications will be checked in for future reference with
documentation of the reasons why it was retired. The scope will include verifying accuracy before and
after versions of the Microsoft Access database applications are checked into the source control
library. One to 100% redevelopment assistance for all Line of Business Microsoft Access based
applications that will be converted to .Net 2.0, with ISA approval. Phase one involves submitting the
statement of work to ISA for approval. Mr. Downey has been assigned as the ISA PM on the project.
Mr. Downey discussed NG’s assistance by using access conversion tool to narrow down the actual
size to more a more manageable amount. Mr. Thornsberry stated that ISA has access to a survey
tool, that DAI has already met with BRM’s, and created the questionnaire to be submitted by the 15th
of June. SA3 supports those applications that have been complied for conversion or upgrade.
SVRS
Ms. Sadler continuing to work on the upgrades from problems left over from the spring. Thank ISA
involved in Election Day from a technical prospective it went very well.
Altiris Demonstration
Mr. Edens and Mr. Bosworth updated the Board on the Altiris. Work station management as well as
reporting, applications, and real time data analysis for software hardware. The product comes with
the ability to create custom reports. Patch management will be available, not only the work stations,
but the applications themselves.
Report access is based on security roles and integrated with active directory. There is more flexibility
that has not been available previously. The software portal gives the user the ability to pull down
applications on their own. There will be a process based on security that allows for more versatility.

Dr. Inui how many physical sites are there. Mr. Edens stated that 142 sites each floor in this building
is a ‘site’. Remote sites are 50-70. This tool minimizes the need for action technical person drives to
an outside location. Mr. Edens remotely image.
Could use this to determine training needs if new identify new equipment new applications go up in

process yes.
Thank Mr. all the effort he put forward getting Altiris implementions moving in our environment if he
had not been here helping us do not believe we would not be where we are today with this.
Appreciate this level of technical learning better handle on project information and more about the
tools emerging.
Ms. Patel stated that a Stoneware demonstration is planned for the next IT Board meeting and as far
as the ISA structure, headed the right direction.

The June 16, 2006 IT Board Meeting was called to order at 10:01. Mr. Clifford stated that the purpose of the
meeting is to present an update on contractual issues. Mr. Clifford expressed appreciation for everyone’s
attendance and apologized for the last minute cancellation last week.
Contractual Issues
Ms. Patel stated that meetings have been held with NG corporate and that they are very committed to making
this engagement work. They are going to be addressing performance issues and contractual issues through a
proposal, to be given to the board members next week. The proposal will be discussed at the next regular
board meeting.
Mr. Clifford asked if the CIO is satisfied with the status today. Ms. Patel stated that she was. Dr. Inui asked if
the Board members may expect to see the proposal prior to the June 27, 2006 IT Board Meeting. Ms. Patel
stated that the document would be distributed next week.
Mr. Clifford suggested giving authorization to the CIO to finalize the agreement and bring it back to IT Board at
regular scheduled June 27, 2006 meeting. The motion was made by Judge Young and second Mr. Rodman.
Dr. Inui asked if the proposal would be a supplement to the existing contract. Mr. Howell responded that the
agreement is a result of the two parties not agreeing on interpretation of the existing contract. It won’t be an
amendment. The memorandum of understanding will be a clarification of the contract. The CIO will be
authorized to finalize approval on the Memorandum of Understanding.
The motion passed unanimously.
Mr. Clifford called for comments and congratulated Ms. Patel, Mr. Powell, and Mr. Wright as well as thanked
them for their hard work. Mr. Clifford also acknowledged NG’s willingness to draw attention to the issues and go
forward.
Ms. Sadler stated that for anyone watching at the next meeting, when the Board actually discusses the
proposal, there will be much more comment and that the lack of comment today is not due to lack of thought
and energy put into the situation. Mr. Clifford stated that was a very valid point.
The June 16, 2006 IT Board Meeting adjourned at 10:05. The next IT Board Meeting is scheduled for June 27,
2006.

Distributed archive instructions to departments and agencies on how to
archive their email files. Email archiving in process.
The completion date for the MS Migration project is slipping from December
22, 2006 to March 2, 2007. This slippage is being caused by delays in the
procurement and installation of some key equipment, availability of resources
to complete some key tasks, time lost due to Data Center health issues and
anticipated future Data Center health issues and a re-estimation of the
number of laptops and desktops that can be migrated on a daily basis.
Availability of NG resources for completing ACFs and subsequent packaging
of applications is causing a delay in the completion of the packaging of
applications needed for automated deployment of those applications. This
has the potential to affect the overall project schedule. Additional resources
are being brought in and the schedule is being finessed to minimize the
delay.
There are ongoing issues with the health of the Data Center (electrical & heat
issues). This could lead to down time in the data center if it is not fixed. ISA
working with NG to control the temperature in the data center and fix the
electrical issues.
There is additional hardware that is required for the migration that needs to
be installed before 7/5/06. Delays in receipt of this equipment will mean
Phase IV (Production Build & Test) will be delayed. The hardware has been
ordered. ISA & NG are monitoring the order weekly and will escalate with
the vendor if necessary.

Departments/Agencies need to complete application testing with Microsoft
XP SP2. Applications that are not tested with XP SP2 may not work in that
operating environment and thus may need to be re-written or
upgraded/replaced. This may lead to delays in the migration schedule or
reshuffling of the migration schedule. In order to mitigate this risk, testing the
applications that have not already been tested in a lab environment must be
completed prior to the migration. Appropriate provisions then need to be
made for any applications that do not work correctly under XP SP2.
Add additional resources and continue completing ACFs and packaging
applications until all 350 identified applications have been packaged.

Negotiate details of the contract with the vendor.
Discussed concerns about 3rd draft of project plan with vendor.
Status is yellow because further delay in receiving an acceptable project plan
will cause the contract approval process to run behind and could impact
overall project time line.
The 3rd draft of the project plan is a very good task list (3100 tasks), but it
cannot yet be considered a completed project plan. True up the dates, add
the durations and dependencies and re-sequence as needed. They will then
submit the plan for evaluation. The vendor must be prepared to present the

Met with Building Authority regarding what options we have for cooling the 9th
floor. They indicated that the Data Center should be cool all the time, and
they lowered the temperature down to 68 degrees on two chillers.
Electrical upgrades are in process for servers already delivered for Justis and
other applications. Electrical upgrades necessary for the Microsoft Migration
production environment are still in the quoting process. Building Authority
feels they will not have staff to get electrical work done in time to meet our
schedule. We may have a 3rd party do the installation to keep on schedule.
On 6/6 the data center experienced Air Handler Temperature alarms when
the temperature reached up to 89 degrees. Due to the excessive heat one of
the server racks blew the circuit breaker, taking down E-Directory until the
breaker was reset. E-Dir came back up in under 15 minutes, but ICHAIN’s
LDAP, the GWIA and Internet Proxy all took longer to restore service. Root
cause analysis was performed and it was determined that maintenance was
being performed on the backup chiller when the main chiller failed.

The Automated Mapping Engine (AME), will allow staff to create a high
cartographic quality map without the need for desktop GIS software to be
installed. The application has been designed with a non-technical user in
mind and will simplify the process of creating maps. This application will be
available to users on the IndyGov Intranet only.
Staff will be able to select from a set of predefined datasets to be mapped on
top of a base set of map layers. The user will be able to further refine the
data to be displayed by specifying an attribute filter to be applied, a
geographic region such as a township, council district or neighborhood
organization boundary and a date range. The user will be able to specify the
size and orientation for the map. The application will then create a PDF
format file of the map in question and deliver it to the user.
The AME is being developed and deployed in 2 phases. Functionality
included in Phase I is described above. Phase II will add the following:

ISA will evaluate the Primary Rate Interface’s (PRI) T-1s that bring dial tone
to the voice network. The evaluation will determine how many PRI’s need to
be moved to the Disaster Recovery (DR) site. When the project is complete,
we will schedule a series of DR tests.
Initial estimates of how many PRIs we will move are complete. Movement of
the PRIs will begin within 30 days.
Backhaul of 2nd ISP may push bandwidth limits. Research into the concern
has shown the risk is minimal.
Continue PRI evaluation and start move to Disaster Recovery site.

Continue to work with the State and Quest to bring about improvements in
procedures, performance, reports and equipment before the November
General Election
The 1st summer build was put into the sandbox for the counties to test. The
main purpose of this build was to provide GIS improvements and it should
not have a major impact on Marion County.
The Marion County project sponsors remain very concerned about the
overall consistency and reliability of First Tuesday due to the time to enter
data, downtime and responsiveness.
Two additional risks for the November General Election:
• There will be at least one and as many as three changes in the
Project Sponsor positions by the November Election.
• The Election Board will be using the First Tuesday Election
Management Module for the first time this fall.
Continue to work with the State and Quest to bring about improvements in
procedures, performance, reports and equipment before the Fall General
Election.
There will be two or three additional major builds prior to the November
General Election.

Stoneware/webNetwork is the planned replacement for iChain and the web
events calendar. It is also being evaluated as a supplement to Citrix and the
SecureRemote VPN tools, and includes single sign on and self password
reset functionality.
Reference checks have all been very positive with all references continuing
to find new uses for the webNetworks product and gave positive comments
on stoneware support. Example uses include: A school allowing police and
fire departments access to school security cameras across the internet. A
city has created web applications, reports, graphs, and executive
dashboards.

Enhanced Access

ISA has collected $11 Million dollars or 40% of our projected revenue for YTD May 2006, which includes payments received
for the 4th quarter 2005 billings. Quarterly reports have been sent to the Controller’s and Auditor’s Office by Department or
Agency.
The revenue for the County’s December chargeback has historically been posted in the following year’s revenue. For the
December 2005 chargeback, the revenue was posted in FAMIS as 2005 revenue. Therefore, the County’s revenue
percentage will be lower than the expected percent each month.
The projected revenue does not include the $2 million that will be collected for the UASI grant. The appropriation was
carried over into 2006.

CIVICNET HIGHLIGHTS
CivicNet transactions for May reached a new single-month
record, eclipsing April totals by 17 percent. City and
county revenue collected via CivicNet for the month topped
$450 million – also a new record.
In addition to launching the Commissary Deposit service
for the Marion County Sherriff’s Department, the CivicNet
team released four change requests for testing to the
Division of Compliance. The change requests included
Completion/Inspection Display Changes, Fee Changes for
License Renewals, Permit Research Link, and Right of
Way Permits- Adding Utility Agents. The change requests
will improve functionality and usability of the online
permitting applications provided by the agency.

The CivicNet marketing team also delivered modifications
on the campaign concepts to Animal Care and Control for
the Canine Crimestoppers Campaign. The changes were
accepted by ACCD and the project will be completed by
mid-June. CivicNet will provide ACCD with a CD of
marketing concepts that will be used for various print
materials.
Currently in the planning stages, an upgrade to the
CivicNet Incident Reports will provide more reliable
service to customers by connecting to a new Web service
developed by IPD. The existing application experiences
frequent connectivity issues that impact the availability of
reports to end users.
CivicNet court services will be changed significantly
during the coming months to interface with the new
JUSTIS.Net system. The CivicNet team is coordinating
with court staff, ISA and DAI to define requirements and
develop the scope of work for this large project, which
must be completed prior to the October JUSTIS.Net
cutover.

DRAFT
AMENDMENT NO. 4
TO
CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENT FOR TECHNOLOGY SERVICES
BETWEEN
NORTHROP GRUMMAN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, INC.
AND
THE CONSOLIDATED CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS-MARION
COUNTY INFORMATION SERVICES AGENCY

This Amendment No. 4 ("Amendment") is entered into by and between the City of
Indianapolis and Marion County, Indiana (hereinafter referred to as City/County) and Northrop
Grumman Information Technology, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as Provider):
WHEREAS, on September 1, 2004, City/County and Provider entered into an
Information Technology Service Agreement ("Agreement"), which has been subsequently
amended from time to time; and
WHEREAS, the parties desire to restructure, restate and clarify certain of their rights and
obligations thereunder;
NOW THEREFORE, City/County and Provider agree as follows:
1.

Provider will refund the amount of $660,000 to City/County in cash as soon as

practicable, but in no event later than the later of (i) July 1, 2006, or (ii) four (4) business days
after execution of this Amendment by City/County.

2.

Provider will provide City/County with credits against payments otherwise due

under the Agreement in the amount of $520,000 per month in each of the months of August and
September 2006.
3.

Provider will provide City/County with credits against payments otherwise due

under the Agreement in the amount of $125,000 per month in each of the months of January
through August, 2007.
4.

City/County will incur no additional charges for IMAC's until the number of

IMAC's in a particular calendar year exceeds the number set out in the table in Schedule C to the
Agreement, titled "Basis of Pricing-Volume Projections Provided by City County" for the
applicable calendar year, regardless of how many of such IMAC's derive from a single event.
5.

Subject to City/County approval pursuant to Section 3.2 of the Agreement,

Provider will fill the positions of Web Master, Technical Architect, and SA 1 Manager by
September 1, 2006. Provider will propose candidates for City/County approval pursuant to
Section 3.2 of the Agreement, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. If a written response stating approval or a reasonable basis for objection is not made by
City/County within five (5) business days after submission, the proposed candidate shall be
deemed approved.
6.

Provider will fill the position of Contract Manager (sometimes also referred to as

program manager) by September 1, 2006 and will consult with the Chief Information Officer of
City/County in filling such position.
7.

Provider will provide a Senior Executive Director who will be based in

Indianapolis, and who will report to the Vice President for State and Local Solutions of Provider.
The responsibility of the Senior Executive Director will be to work with City/County and the

-2-

Contract Manager to enhance the long term relationship between Provider and City/County and
their respective management teams. The Senior Executive Director position will continue until
the Chief Information Officer of City/County and the Senior Vice President for State and Local
Solutions of Provider mutually agree that such position should be discontinued.
8.

Provider will designate an Account Manager who shall be assigned to work in

conjunction with the Senior Executive Director to enhance relationships and communications
between the management teams of City/County and Provider.
9.

Provider will appoint an Executive of Interest, who shall be a Vice President level

employee of Provider, and who shall be outside the program management chain of command.
Such Executive of Interest will participate in customer satisfaction meetings with representatives
of City/County in Indianapolis at least quarterly.
10.

(a)

City/County and Provider will prepare a complete inventory of

maintenance agreements as to which Provider is to provide any management or administrative
services pursuant to Section 2.6 of the Agreement. Provider will notify City/County as to which
documents or actions Provider requires from City/County in order to provide such services.
Within a reasonable time thereafter, City/County and Provider will execute such documents,
including assignments, and take such actions as are necessary to enable Provider to perform such
services. Provider will provide sufficient resources and conduct a gap analysis to ensure all
assignments are in place.

Upon execution and delivery of such assignments and other

documents, Provider will thereafter provide such management or administrative services.
(b)

City/County agrees to implement a time stamp system or other control system in

conjunction with Provider to assure the prompt delivery to Provider of invoices, assignments,
and other documentation and information necessary to allow Provider to perform such

-3-

management and administrative services, and to pay invoices on behalf of City/County,
regarding such maintenance agreements. Provider will provide sufficient resources to ensure
that time-stamped invoices from vendors under maintenance agreements are paid within a
commercially reasonable time frame.
11.

Provider agrees to develop, in conjunction with City/County, a process to

standardize work order procedures, formats and content pursuant to Section 7.4 of the
Agreement in order to enable both parties to meet the deadlines contained in such Section 7.4.

JUSTIS.Net Demonstration
Mr. Renner, Mr. Thamba, Mr. Grigsby and Mr. Thornsberry presented the Justis.Net Demonstration.
Mr. Clifford asked if the 5-6 second delay is a hardware issue, slowing down the network connection.
Mr. Grigsby explained the delay is caused by an outside pipe being smaller than the internal pipe
which results in the data slowing down when exiting. Mr. Grigsby explained that, with the firewalls, a
four (4) second delay from the outside is expected. Ms. Enders requested verification that when a
user signs on their pc, with the single sign-on, they are set to pull up JUSTIS.Net.
Information Services Agency – Document: ISA-ITBD Meeting Minutes

Information Technology Board
Meeting Minutes
Judge Young stated that the visual available is exactly what the current Justis looks like. The
transition to Justis.Net will be a seamless transition and users will not have to learn anything new
which is what makes the project so exciting.
Mr. Renner explained that the visual presentation is a 2002 case file. The Supreme Court in acting
Administrative Rule 09 has now said that social security numbers, addresses, personal identifiers
should no longer be viewed by the public. Administrative Rule 9 for records became effective for
records effective January 1, 2005 forward there is no responsibility on the part of the Clerk of the court
to go back and delete that information, delete those identifiers from earlier case files to do so could
bankrupt many courts/Clerk Offices. The example presented was not the best but also not required to
be hidden under law. The courts are taking steps beginning January 1, 2005 to keep personal
identifiers from public view.
Mr. Thamba explained that the Justis.Net web-based application gives the user the opportunity to
decide how to view data without having to reboot. The user has the ability to maneuver from screen
to screen and mode to mode. Mr. Renner discussed the magnitude of the presentation and stated
that what appears to be a simple process, printing screens, would have cost JTAC over $200,000.
DAI demonstrated screen prints as a standard feature.
Mr. Grigsby provided examples of the format that future reports would follow.
Mr. Clifford commented that he previewed the demonstration a couple weeks ago and significant
progress has been made since then. Mr. Clifford congratulated Mr. Grigsby, Mr. Thamba, Mr.
Thornsberry and Mr. Renner on a job well done.
Major Meadows stated that in the 30 years he has been involved in IT including his participation in the
original Justis this is one of the most significant advances. The ability in how DAI was able to deploy
the project sets the bar extremely high for future development. Major Meadows continued that it has
been very difficult not to discuss what was presented due to the significant impact the project will have
on the numerous buildings.
Ms. Sadler stated she echoes what Major Meadows stated and added she is incredibly impressed
with the impact the project will have on the Clerk’s Office employees alone in the way work is done
and what will be able to be done in the future. Ms. Sadler stated that she would like to see future
development and that the $300,000 was well spent.
Mr. Clifford acknowledged Mr. Renner’s resignation from County government and the courts to go
back to the private sector. Mr. Clifford stated that Mr. Renner is extremely well respected by both
parties in the courts and will be greatly missed. He has done a great job being court administrator as
well as assisting in the Justis.Net project.
Resolution 06-08: Microsoft Migration Vendor Selection
Mr. Buchanan presented the Microsoft Migration Vendor Selection. Mr. Buchanan stated that ISA is
requesting approval of contract services with Unisys Corporation. The RFS process was followed
with evaluations, then contract negotiations. Members of the evaluations team included
representative from Indianapolis Police Department, Marion County Sheriff’s Department, Courts ,
Department of Metropolitan Development, Assessors and the Department of Public Works. The start
Information Services Agency – Document: ISA-ITBD Meeting Minutes

Meeting Minutes
date will be two weeks from the conclusion of contract negotiation. During the Best and Final Offer
phase, of negotiations, Unisys offered a best faith effort of 10% MBE/WBE participation in Phase 5 of
the project. Unisys also offered a 50,000 credit, applied at the conclusion of each phase. Another
added benefit reached during the best and final stage of vendor negotiations was the purchasing of
Swimmage, at tool used for image deployment, through Unisys at deep discounts resulting in 85,000
cost savings over the original amount.
Ms. Patel stated she would like to take the opportunity to thank Mr. Thamba, Mr. Menon, Lt. Finch and
his staff for their involvement in the negotiations.
Dr. Inui asked that in the vendor selection process had there been close competitors. Mr. Buchanan
stated that, after the short-list, Haverstick and Unisys were very close. Mr. Buchanan continued that
by the time of vendor presentations, and second round of questions, there clearly was a leader.
Reference checks and due diligence results were positive for both vendors. Dr. Inui stated that
Unisys has a longer government services record than most organizations and that it would not be
unusual for them to be a top contender. Dr. Inui asked if any risks were uncovered during the
negotiations. Mr. Petrecca stated that there are risks and that the intent in choosing Unisys is to
move toward a single image for all enterprise PC’s. The process that Unisys is going to use is highly
automated which is also the main risk concern. .While that is a significant risk, it also is a significant
pay off to be able to complete the work with much less labor than with other vendors. Alternative
vendors proposed a manual process with costs in line with what Unisys proposed; however, the
internal labor costs were considerably higher. The end result would be having all the computers
standardized. Dr. Inui asked who carries the risk in the event the automated tool does not work to the
extent it is believed to. Mr. Buchanan stated the risk would be that of the enterprises but the tool has
a proven record. Dr. Inui asked for a worst case scenario price if the tool does not work optimally.
Ms. Patel stated that the worse case scenario would include 10,000 hours at $100 an hour versus
using the tool.
Ms. Patel stated that Unisys representatives were present and very comfortable with the project. Mr.
Wright stated Unisys has experience great success with the tool. Unisys has done some
programming to improve the overall administration of the product.
Judge Young asked what the opportunity of risk would be. Mr. Wright stated that the chances would
be low. Same amount way development environment, tool used, etc. Ms. Bagnell stated this tool is
not something new Unisys has been using it for a long time.
Judge Young moved to approve Resolution 06-08. The motion was seconded by Major Ball and
carried unanimously.
Resolution 06-09: Amendment to Northrop Grumman Contract
Mr. Buchanan and Mr. Ortell presented the amendment to the Northrop Grumman Contract. Mr.
Buchanan stated that the adaptation of the definition is for clarification so that NG and ISA are on the
same page.
Major Meadows stated that he agrees a definition needs to be adopted and asks the CIO and NG to
revisit the ceiling of 25 IMACS per initiative based on said definition a refresh could be as little as the
addition of 8 or 9 PC’s. This amount in industry is not truly a project. Major Meadows stated that he

Information Services Agency – Document: ISA-ITBD Meeting Minutes

Page 3 of 6

Information Technology Board
Meeting Minutes
concerned very pleased with NG being willing to work with the agencies on some of these issues but
requested consideration be taken to change the contract.
Mr. Ortell explained that the under the ACS contract a 25 IMAC’s per day cap existed as a guideline.
As long as an agency did not exceed 25 IMAC’s per day there was no additional costs. The direction
at the time was to look at each project, determine how much effort would be involved, how much time
would be involved, and at what cost. In the event there were over 25 IMAC’s, the determination
needed was what kind of resources are required as the service manager to complete the installation.
If there were no additional costs to ACS then no additional cost was passed to the customer. The
project could be approached as going to take 4 weeks to get 30 machines installed but if the agency
needs the machines to be installed over the weekend additional resources will have to be brought in,
and overtime paid; therefore, there are additional costs associated with the install. Discussions have
taken place with NG to establish time frames to have a no cost install and that may mean the install
takes three months which would go to the customer for acceptance.
Major Meadows stated that he is very supportive of NG charging fees, should an agency request to
have additional resources brought in, due to various priorities.
Ms. Patel stated that there is a section in the contract that states refresh is part of scope. The only
expense The City-County we could pay is for actual hardware. Ms. Patel stated that this is something
in the contract that ISA and NG need to go back and review.
Dr. Inui stated that the IMAC situation is similar to a fixed resource that has to be allocated to
departments and wonders if it’s not so much the operation definition of an IMAC, as it is deciding on a
process that allocates the technical resource to the department.
Mr. Clifford asked if the Board had enough clarity on the IMAC issue to vote on and stated that all that
is being awarded at the board is defining the IMAC, not changing the process, or the reference to 25
IMACS within the contract.
Judge Young moved to accept Resolution 06-06. Linda seconded the motion.
Major Ball stated that the definition of IMACS is basically the same definition that ACS used.
Mr. Buchanan added that the amendment is just an augmentation of what is already in the contract,
namely, paragraph one and two of the notes section in Schedule C.
The motion carried unanimously.
Major Meadows stated that he still has issues will hear about it on a regular basis encourage to look
into it.

Ms. Enders gave her best wishes for Mr. Soliman and his family and stated she has been impressed
with his work ethic.
Ms. Patel stated that the format of the ISA Report has been changed. Future reports will include
major projects, day-to-day operations performance, supporting detail, as well as a legend of what
green, yellow, and red means. NG has already deployed Altiris to ISA and NG as a pilot roll-out by
April 10. Users should not be impacted by this install. The complete asset inventory is due March 31.
NG has not supplied any improvement data at this point resulting in concerns NG will not make the
98% accuracy rate. The UASI grants are moving forward although there were concerns that the
agreements were not signed but they have since been signed.
Ms. Sadler asked if ISA has concerns that NG will not meet the SLR on asset inventory and asked
what the solution will be moving forward. Ms. Patel stated that ISA will be utilizing Altiris to pull some
of the inventory during the discovery phase through the Microsoft Migration. At that point a physical
inventory will be done if necessary. Altiris will be able to pull inventory that touches the network.
Ms. Patel discussed the install of a SPAM filter tool which has had great results. Of all the email
coming into the City/County, only 24% are considered good e-mails. Ms. Patel expressed thanks to
NG for getting the SPAM filter rolled-out. ISA is working with the MAC, DPW, DMD Compliance , and
ACC to create a customer friendly, easy to use, accurate Web Portal.
Ms. Patel reported that SA3 met 100% of their SLRs.
Dr. Inui stated that he is astonished at e-mail traffic classified as spam and that something is making
the City County a preferred target. Mr. Miller responded that ISA and NG are looking at the results of
a couple users which were high on the spam list. During a 30 day period one specific user received
10,700 spam and 15,000 ‘good’ messages. Mr. Miller discussed how to best address that.
Dr. Inui asked if users are commonly using ‘away from the office’ automated responses. Major
Meadows suggested this is a good opportunity for the BRM’s to work with the agencies to see if
anything can be done to assist them.
Major Meadows stated that SLR #54 has had a downward trend the last three months. Mr. Clancy
responded that NG is watching the service level very close.
Financial Report
Ms. Dillon-Macy presented the ISA Financial Report. Ms. Dillon-Macy stated that the ISA report is
divided into four sections. The first section covers expenditures for February 2006 with a total of $4.9
million. This includes the payments to Northrop Grumman and DAI year-to-date. The second section
includes revenue collected. The third section shows contract comparison and the fourth section
includes the hours and dollars budgeted for the City and County for Application Maintenance and
Support versus the actual for 2006.
Mr. Clifford added that the Office of Finance and Management has been working closely with ISA and
Ms. Patel for the funding on the Microsoft Migration project.

Mr. Soliman presented the CivicNet Report. Mr. Soliman stated that CivicNet finalized the charter for
the Custodial Agency Online Waiver Request Project. This project will ensure that waiver requests
received by the EARC and custodial agencies meet initial qualifying criteria. CivicNet will present the
charter to the EARC during the next committee meeting. CivicNet presented MCSD with the first
prototype for the Marion County Jail Commissary Deposit Project. The MCSD submitted prototype
changes and will work with the CivicNet marketing Team to determine a marketing plan for the new
commissary deposit option.
Mr. White, chairman of the Enhanced Access Review Committee, reported that the committee
approved a project for Marion County Jail commissary Deposit which will allow on-line deposits 24
hours a day, seven days a week.
Mr. Clifford asked legal counsel if Board action were required on this project. Ms. Dreschler stated
that it was not.
Property System Update
Mr. Pavey presented the Property System report and stated that negotiations are underway. Mr.
Ricketts added that negotiations are going very well.
SVRS
Mr. Pavey presented the SVRS report. Back up download of the recent Tuesday will not affect
Marion. Improvements on the way, but will not be in time for the primary.
Ms. Sadler stated that the problems with First Tuesday are not just an Election Day issue. The slow
response time has already become a crucial point for staff waiting while voter registrations are
validated. The customers are waiting depending on how slow the system is running potentially could
be a major inconvenience. The reason Marion County will not be negatively impacted at this time is
because of the lack of volume and the back up planning that has taken place. Ms. Sadler continued
that weekly meetings led by Mr. Pavey are on-going with NG, ISA Election Board, and Voter
Registration to identify problems ahead of time. Hopefully by November, when the volume of
registered voters is such that the office cannot double enter into two systems First Tuesday will be up
and running.
Mr. Clifford asked for new business for discussion.
The March 28, 2006 IT Board Meeting adjourned at 11:12.
The next IT Board Meeting will be April 25, 2006.

Continue assessment phase and begin planning phase of the project.
The contract was approved by Corporation Counsel and executed. The
Unisys team is on site in offices on the third floor of the City County Building.
A kick-off meeting was held on April 17, 2006. Deployment of the Altiris tool
has been completed to all network connected powered-on machines. Initial
interviews have been held with ISA, NG & customer subject matter experts.
A Communications and Training plan has been drafted and work has
commenced on portions of the Communication Plan. This plan will be a living
document and will evolve as the project progresses. An “Elevator Speech”
has been completed and distributed to ISA Staff to begin the communications
process and an intranet web site has been set up.
The overall project and especially the initial assessment phase of the project
are on a very compressed, aggressive schedule. Successful completion of
this project will be dependent on cooperation and participation by ISA, NG
and customers. In order to get the necessary information from the customers
who know it, flexibility in scheduling will be necessary. The complexity of the
City-County organization and the needs of the customers will require close
attention to detail as the project progresses from assessment to planning and
then on to delivery phase.
Complete the assessment phase including the envisioning workshop and
move on to the planning phase of the project.

State/Quest to implement 4/3 build. Complete backlog registration of voters
(Bureau of Motor Vehicles, walk-ins and mail-ins). Upon completion of
registrations, extraction of report files for poll books will occur, and then poll
books will be printed. Preparation for May 2nd Primary Election will continue.
The 4/3 build was mostly successful, from Marion County’s viewpoint. The
build contained over 350 bug fixes, major workflow overhaul and several
other major enhancements. Problems encountered included a couple of
reports that were changed, but no one was notified of the changes. One of
the report changes was the Acknowledgement Notices. After the build, they
no longer fit into our envelopes – solution was to reprint and purchase
different style of envelopes.
The backlog of voter registrations was completed by 5:00 p.m., Sat, 4/8.
Quest produced a PDF file of the Marion County Poll Books and it was ready
for pick up by 1:30 Monday. The file was given to NTS, the printing vendor.
Absentee voting began 4/3, problems encountered by the Election Board
were ES&S related, not First Tuesday.
Problems encountered during the catch up of voter registrations included:
The document scanners were not working properly. The problem was called
into the Quest Help Desk on Monday and discussed several times during the
week, but Quest did not send anyone to VR until Friday afternoon. The
problem is still not entirely fixed. Could be hardware or software related.
Quest was warned about the quality and performance ratings of the scanning
equipment a year ago.
Other problems included changes that were made to two reports during the
4/3 build. VR was not made aware of the changes. One of the report
problems involved changing the acknowledgement notices which caused the
window envelopes to hide the last line of the address – VR had to reprint the
notices and purchase a different style of envelopes to get the notices sent
out.
Marion County project sponsors remain very concerned about the overall
consistency and reliability of First Tuesday due to the time to enter data,
downtime and responsiveness.
VR will continue to work the DOC (Department of Corrections) hopper
(people in prison are not allowed to vote.)
Final preparation for May 2nd Primary Election.
Work will continue with the State and Quest to bring about improvements in
procedures, performance, reports and equipment before the Fall General

Google Mini is a scaled-down version of the Google search engine dedicated
to searching the IndyGov website. Although just as simple to use for basic
searches as our current search engine Ultraseek, Google Mini can provide
much more robust capabilities for more adventurous users. Since searches
are performed in the same fashion, users will not require any additional
training.
Perhaps one of the greatest benefits of Google Mini is that it is capable of
searching the entire IndyGov domain rather than just IndyGov.org. This
would include other City/County hosted sites such as Knozone.com,
IndyHomelessConnect.com, IndyFitness.net, etc.

Phase
Development /
Testing

Overall Status
Green

The Automated Mapping Engine, (AME), will allow users to create a high quality
map without the need for desktop GIS software to be installed. The application
has been designed with a non-technical user in mind and will simplify the process
of creating maps. This application will be available to users on the IndyGov
Intranet only.
Users will be able to select from a set of predefined datasets to be mapped on
top of a base set of map layers. The user will be able to further refine the data to
be displayed by specifying an attribute filter to be applied, a geographic region
such as a township, council district or neighborhood organization boundary and a
date range. The user will be able to specify the size and orientation for the map.
The application will then create a PDF format file of the map in question and ship
it to the user.

The AME is being developed and deployed in 2 phases. Functionality
included in Phase I is described above. Phase II will add the following:
•

The ability to save map definitions for repeated use.

•

The ability to subscribe to receive a map based upon a saved
definition on a regular basis via email. This map would of course
contain current data such as all citizen calls to the MAC within the
past month.

•

Reporting capabilities so that a tabular report could be included in
your map subscription.

Daylight Saving Time
The daylight savings time (DST) conversion was a success. A Novell tool was utilized to convert the meeting
times in GroupWise. NG was able to get all GroupWise mailboxes converted the weekend prior to the DST
switch. There were minor problems with the GWIA (mymail). On the GWIA - users had to change the time zone
setting back to Indiana, then back to Eastern.
Some problems arose with the Blackberries which required a re-initialization of the handheld devices. Some
users did report loss of Blackberry address book information.
Problems were also reported with Web Events scheduling. An additional server has been set up and at this
time it will be kept on “Indiana time”. This software is old and needs to be replaced. At this time we will not
allow dates to be scheduled past the end of 2006 until this software is upgraded.

Symantec Anti Virus
New version deployment is complete.

DPW Traffic Server
The DPW Traffic Application has been installed on the new server and is in production. This application houses
the traffic signal software that maintains the downtown networked signals. The project started initially in October
of 2005. NG delivered the scope document on March 17, 2006. ISA required changes to this document and still
waiting on a response from NG.

Internet Service Provider (ISP)/Bandwidth Upgrade
The installation of the new and backup ISP connection is complete as of April 14th. The redundant link will be
brought into the network environment by end of April. Once the implementation of the redundant connection is
complete, the enterprise will have 2-3 times the bandwidth compared to our previous Internet Service Provider.
Previously our bandwidth was 10M and could go up to 15M and with Time Warner we will have two links of 15M
each. The bandwidth will be split between the City/County site and our Disaster Recovery site. This insures the
availability of Internet access if something would happen to the City County building.

ISA has collected $4 Million dollars or 15.5% of our projected revenue for YTD March 2006, which includes payments
received for the 4th quarter 2005 billings. Quarterly reports have been sent to the Controller’s and Auditor’s Office by
Department or Agency.
The revenue for the County’s December chargeback has historically been posted in the following year’s revenue. For the
December 2005 chargeback, the revenue was posted in FAMIS as 2005 revenue. Therefore, the County’s revenue
percentage will be lower than the expected percent each month.

2007 Budgets
ISA is in the process of gathering information for the 2007 budgets. City departments and county agencies are
currently working on submitting their budget questionnaires. This information is used to identify items that will
need to be included in ISA’s budget, including equipment purchases and software and hardware maintenance.
Enterprise and application maintenance/support needs are also identified.
Once the information is collected, ISA will begin reviewing the needs and preparing the proposed budget for
2007. The proposed budget will be ready in early June for review by the Office of Finance and Management.

CIVICNET HIGHLIGHTS
The CivicNet team continued researching new projects and
improving existing online services during the month of March.
Enhancements were made to the Bulk Property Search Service
and a new enhancement was identified for Division of
Compliance Permitting Applications. A new single-month
record for transaction volume was set in March, with overall first
quarter statistics showing a 12.3% increase in usage compared to
first quarter 2005.
The enhancements completed for the Treasurer’s Office Bulk
Property Search Service will provide users with more detailed
information on charged and unpaid amounts for all taxes,
penalties, conservancies, and special/additional assessments for
each property parcel requested. CivicNet made additions to the
completed report and also posted helpful information on
interpreting the codes returned in the report. A demo of this
service is now available and the Treasurer’s Office will begin
directing companies that bulk property requests to the online
service to ease staff workload.
CivicNet and the Division of Compliance also identified an
enhancement for the online permitting services offered. The new
enhancement will generate email notifications to permit holders
30, 15 and 7 days before the permit expiration date. The emails
will remind permit holders to file a completion card or an
extension for permits to avoid additional fees being levied. The
email reminders will be a great benefit to online permit
applicants. Currently no reminders are sent to permit holders,
regardless of how permit applications are filed.
CivicNet and the Marion County Sherriff’s Department met in
March to begin planning a marketing strategy for the new
Commissary Deposit Project. Posters for the new service will be
created and provided to the Marion County Sherriff’s
Department for display in the lobby and other high-traffic areas.
The posters will be delivered before the deployment date of the
new service.

August 29, 2006 Meeting Minutes
Leading the way in enterprise-wide technology

Mr. Jim Nelson, Service Area III Manager; Mr. Jeff Snodgrass, Desktop Manager; Mr. Edwin Watson, Project
Management Office Manager. Ms. Patel added that Northrop Grumman has filled all key personnel positions.
Information Services Agency Report
Ms. Patel presented the Information Services Agency report and stated that the MS Migration cutover occurred
over the weekend. The enterprise will be migrating from a Novell networking and messaging environment to a
Microsoft networking and messaging environment. This entails replacing Novell GroupWise with Microsoft
Exchange/Outlook, replacing the Novell file servers with Microsoft file servers, upgrading all PCs and laptops to
the current Microsoft operating system and upgrading all PCs and laptops to the current version of Microsoft
Office. Ms. Patel discussed a pilot migration within ISA is scheduled for this week. Staff is conducting a ‘World
Tour’ with customers to explain potential problems that may occur. The first official roll out will be September
11th The Courts decided that the application will be deployed to the Courts on October 2nd as originally
planned; at which time; the courts will begin a battery of testing to ensure the application performs as expected
and that it can be rolled into production on the date to be determined. Ms. Patel continued with discussion on
the State Wide Voters Registration project. The enterprise has no control over the application and has decided
from an operations perspective to replace and upgraded the router. Problems have been identified with the
Time Warner internet connection. Northrop Grumman and Time Warner staff are working together to determine
exactly what the problems are and resolve them. An update should be available in the next week or two. ISA is
working with Sheriff and IPD on the consolidation working with the facilities committee from an IT perspective as
moves are being made. The AVL project is moving forward. RFP responses were received and down selected
to two vendors. Premis Consulting Group will oversee the evaluation of these pilots if board approves additional
appropriations. The Property System Project has been put on hold to allow for discussions to take place to
determine next steps. The asset inventory is going well with a completion of 25 or 30%.
ISA Operations
Ms. Patel presented the ISA Operations report and stated that Northrop Grumman missed four SLRs. During
the month of June, two employees were lost. However, two employees were rehired and speed was regained
quickly. The response rate in July reflects an outage with Siebel. Northrop Grumman was still able to provide
service to the customers. The resource was non-critical and no penalty is accessed the first time missed. Ms.
Patel continued that the email response rate for the month was 97%, Physical Equipment Moves (1-10 Devices)
with 10 days at 90%, and Non-critical Restore within 2 days at 85.71%.
Judge Young discussed Justis.Net the project while not exactly as hoped for on Oct. 2 will be up and running.
The ‘old’ Justis system will not be shut down. As explanation, some of the new problems that have come into
arena include legislature approving three new judges which will require new programming and new courts. Also
not anticipated would be the Indianapolis Police Department and Marion County Sheriffs Department merger
which will require change in programming. Additionally one of the enhancements desired is the ability to link
with the Jail Inmate Management Program which is very important to courts in the way of managing inmate
population and where to move cases. Judge Young stated that some of the risks reported on the Microsoft
Migration project were listed last month in particular agencies signing off on SP2 testing. Judge Young asked if
the problem is the agencies are dragging their feet and if this is something ISA is able to work around. Mr.
Petrecca, Project Manager, ISA stated that the major group that has not completed the SP2 testing is the
Department of Metropolitan Development (DMD). The Department has not been able to complete testing due to
incompatibility of the Tidemark application with XP SP2. Tidemark was upgraded this weekend allowing DMD to
complete the XP SP2 testing. The Department of Metropolitan Development is not scheduled to migrate until
later in the year.
Judge Young discussed the IPD Camera Project and the concern that the enterprise has 90 days from the date
money is released (July 24) to spend the funds. Public Safety (9/11) already presented their portion to Council.
Judge Young asked for an explanation on the difference between the two grants. Mr. Laudick, Project Manager,
ISA responded that the buffer zone grant the buffer zone grant requires money to be used within the first 90

days and has one year to spend. The Liberty Shield grant money has to be spent and invoiced by October 31,
2006 to buy the servers for the cameras, and infrastructure in place to bill that back to the State. The concern
Judge Young expressed is that if the deadline is missed time and effort were wasted.
Mr. David Grigsby, CTO, ISA stated that the risk was discussed between ISA and IPD. The agencies felt there
was enough corporate time to take the risk. Mr. Buchanan stated that the bulk of money from the Liberty Shield
grant will be used to purchase hardware.
Judge Young stated that Northrop Grumman has done a great job stepping although he was concern by items
that do not have credit points attached. Not having credit points on services may seem insignificant but not to
the people that use system. The report reflects service levels being missed three months in a row.
Major Meadows comment that the MCSD had an issue the past couple months in which NG stepped up to the
plate, resolved the issue, and changed processes as needed. Major Meadows took the opportunity to thank
Northrop Grumman for stepping up with the plate.
CivicNet Report
Mr. Doug Downey, Project Manager, ISA, stated the CivicNet report stands as submitted.
Judge Young stated that he understood there may be some difficultly between CivicNet and the enterprise when
the switch to Justis.Net takes place and asked if that is being addressed proactively. Mr. Doug Downey, Project
Manager, ISA stated that developers are on-site working on the interface to Justis.Net.
Justis.Net Update
Mr. Thornsberry, Project Manager, DAI, presented the Justis.Net Update. The project is in Phase 2. Mr.
Thornsberry stated staff worked over the weekend and continued that the entire team is involved in Unit Testing.
The testing is not 100%. Mr. Thornsberry explained that at some point in time changes to Justis.Net need to be
put on hold. Recent events in the courts, Public Safety, and the consolidation has required a third of the team to
continue work on these updates. The team is making good progress. Mr. Thornsberry continued that the team
is working on refining web Services and working with CivicNet in-house on their interface with Justis.
Eventually, a specific person will be working with CivicNet to help get through the learning curve. Mr.
Thornsberry continued that some network issues have been discovered and Northrop Grumman is involving
Cisco to resolve them. At this time it is not impacting the enterprise but in the future it will. The production
equipment is up and running. Next steps include: complete online unit testing, batch testing, interface testing,
conversion of the reports, and implement new security and user acceptance testing.
Dr. Inui asked for the literal definition of ‘in tandem’ as reference in the Justis.Net project. Mr. Thornsberry
explained that resources are not available to run parallel systems. The old system will continue to be used in all
the courts with the new system being available for testing to ensure success. Full deployment will occur once a
date is chosen. At that time the old Justis system will be shut down. Dr. Inui asked if the system is open
architecture. Mr. Grigsby CTO, ISA stated that didn’t change business process as far as how the programs
work, but that the architecture was changed to a n-tier model to support future functionality.
Dr. Inui stated that change is anticipated and the potential of a more robust system is exciting however concern
was expressed regarding skilled staff to program and maintain the .NET environment. Mr. Thornsberry
responded that DAI has integrated three .NET developers who have been teaching DAI programmers. Staff has
been going to training on their own and will continue going forward. Once Justis.Net is in production the support
team will be available to keep the system going and an enhancement team will provide upgrades. Dr. Inui
asked if creating new interfaces causes a slow down. Mr. Thornsberry responded that right now creating new
interfaces slows down productivity however it will not in the future.

Microsoft Migration Update
Mr. Rick Petrecca, Project Manager, ISA, and Ms. Marianne Swatosh, Project Manager, Unisys, presented the
Microsoft Migration Update. Mr. Sean Fahey, Project Manager, NG was available for question. Mr. Petrecca
acknowledged Mr. Doug Downey, ISA, and Mr. Marv Thornsberry, DAI, Project Managers for the access
conversion sub-project. Mr. Petrecca stated that 4 of the 5 phases are complete. All servers are in production.
The cut-over to the gateway occurred this weekend. Monday evening the first pilot took place and went well.
Forty-six more pilot migrations are planned with the anticipation of migrating 70 users per day. Mr. Petrecca
continued that the memory upgrade has been completed and 97% of the applications have been packaged. ISA
has been actively been working with MECA to make sure the agency is worked into the migration.
Mr. Thornsberry discussed the access database conversion and the collecting of information. The discovery
was made that Altiris was not capturing all the databases accurately. Over 300 databases were not found by
Altiris. Mr. Thornsberry stated that possibly the initial scan was not properly done. The tool is relatively new to
the infrastructure resulting in the problem not being immediately identified. Another week is needed to figure out
why Altiris did not find those databases.
Mr. Petrecca continued an update on the ‘Fire Drill’ held on August 11 as an opportunity to anticipate common
scenarios that would require recovery to those servers and recovery was made in less time than anticipated.
The Fire Drill served as testament of the ability of the contractual partners setting set up and documenting the
process as well as working together for the environment. Administrative training documentation for the
migration process has been put together along with the final migration schedule. As staff hosts communication
meetings and learns of agency black out dates the migration schedule will change.
Dr. Inui asked about the status of the large mailboxes that have not been mitigated. Mr. Petrecca responded
that as part of the Road Show staff is making sure the right people are migrated along with the right machines.
A list of users with large mailboxes for that agency is included. Two informational meeting were attended last
week, and staff is working with a number of users that are over the limit. The overall number is not diminishing
as quickly as hoped but the high end users are getting lower and lower. The preference is to communicate the
message administratively and make adjustments if necessary rather than to take a strong stance. Ms. Marianne
Swatosh added that classes are being offered to help users who are uncomfortable with archiving. Educating
the users has been very productive. Dr. Inui stated hands on instruction along with education is a very good
idea.
Information Services Agency Financial Report
Mr. Jason Buchanan, Chief Financial Officer, ISA, stated that the ISA Financial Report stands as submitted.
2007 Information Services Agency Budget Presentation

Mr. Buchanan presented the 2007 ISA Budget and was available to answer questions. Judge Young asked how
the numbers were arrived at, whether a zero based or actual IT needs platform, was used for the budget
establishment. Mr. Buchanan stated that some items were not included in the final budget request. Judge
Young suggested the agency will not receive what it has not asked for. Ms. Patel stated that certain items were
asked for but not included. Judge Young then stated that the Office of Admin and Finance can tell the agency
what is good for the budget, but the City-County Council is the official funding office. Ms. Patel stated that she
anticipates going back and requesting additional appropriations for certain projects at another time. Judge
Young commented that, from the courts point of view, the Council does not know what is needed unless they
are told. Taking appropriation requests before the Council also provides a forum to inform the public an
opportunities that will not be moved forward upon. Ms. Sadler asked what projects would not be included? Ms.
Patel responded that additional appropriations will be requested for the property system replacement, the
Accela upgrade, and an upgrade to the voice mail system. Ms. Sadler stated Ms. Patel’s position is a tough

one, with the Chairman of this Board being the City Controller, and further stated that ISA should at the very
least tell the committee what was requested. Along with this information ISA should state what was approved
and explain the impact, particularly with the property system. The committee has no way of knowing what is not
being funding and the ramifications thereof, unless told.
Resolution #06-19 to Authorize Retention of Gottlieb & Wertz for Customization of Case Management
System
Mr. Jason Buchanan presented Resolution #06-19 along with Ms. Vicki Ursulskis, Public Defender’s Office. ISA
responded to the Marion County Public Defender Agency (MCDA) request to develop a Litigation Case
management System to enable the MCDA to understand and manage workload and (2) to provide information
for management, the public, and other governmental units.
Judge Young stated that at the end of the day it is important that the Public Defender have a case management
system as employees are working with pencils and paper. Judge Young continued that he has concern that the
IT Board has tried to drive the enterprise as a whole toward a Microsoft environment with a dot net platform.
The Public Defenders Office has constraints as far as the budget is concerned but Judge Young would prefer as
a board and enterprise projects stay within the .net platform whenever possible and not let an opportunity
getting away from the enterprise. If the Public Defender Agency’s budget is constrained, the Board needs to
look at funding the request and repay ourselves out of subsequent funds. Judge Young continued that he is not
against the approval of the case management system but moving to Quest is incorrect decision based on the
initiatives worked on over the last 6-8 months.
Ms. Patel stated that additional costs would not be charged back to the Public Defender.
Major Meadows asked if the vote today includes selecting from the three options presented today. The vote
today approves the application. Ms. Sadler asked for the Board and Public Defender Office preference
regarding housing the data and stated although java based and not .net overall the project would be 80% on
integration. Ms. Sadler asked if that percent would change if housed outside of ISA. The data is about client
privilege still want integration populate
Mr. Grigsby that there where three options on the table:
1. Use the Juvenile AS400 as a host
2. Let the vendor host it on their AS400
3. ISA Host it the vendors application
Mr. Grigsby stated option #3 provides a solution that speaks to the long term needs and reporting, while keeping
the data confidential, but adds an extra cost not in the budget.
Mr. Grigsby stated that option #3 was the most palatable as far as technology integration into future systems.
Ms. Ursulskis, Public Defender Office, explained that the systems ability to pick up stuff from Justis beginning
with the time of arrest however it is not critical. It is more critical that there be no integration from the Public
Defender’s system. Should client-privileged information be leaked the individual involved would be before the
Disciplinary Commission. Ms. Ursulskis stated that the agency does not, can not, and will not integrate with
anyone. The agency is subject to client privilege to that extent. The system needs to be a stand alone tower.
The agency is a 12 year agency that has no computer system what-so-ever to conduct daily business. Ms.
Ursulskis stated that she believes they are the only County Agency that does not have a computer system.
Judge Young stated that with an ability to integrate it becomes more difficult more complex the management
system is as they develop and do more the future more and more concerned may bring. Judge Young stated
that the enterprise has the technology to adequately protect the Public Defenders Office information and does

not want to do make a decision that would prevent integration to something down the road that has not been
anticipated. Judge Young stated that with Quest using the SQL servers inside ISA would bring the agency 80%
of the way. Judge Young continued that the Public Defender’s need is so great and so dramatic the Board
needs to act today. Major Ron Meadows, MCSD, asked why the project did not go out for bid and was the
urgency why the process was bypassed. Mr. Buchanan stated that was an internal decision. Ms. Ursulskis
stated that the agency identified the need and identified much of the process was simple and did not want to go
out and bid the job. The agency wanted to find out what the needs are, what the capabilities were, and identify
a particular vendor that has a product that meets the need. The agency looked at the product, went through the
screens, looked at the data being selected and with a few exceptions the core of what is needed is there.
Dr. Inui discussed the importance of import and export possibilities and suggested in a timely manner at
reasonable cost provide for integration of inbound/outbound that would help with work and clients. Maintenance
inventories data recovery when data is locked memory and so on. Not questioning need for security and or
rights of the clients within legal/justice system. Dr. Inui commented that he did not believe adequate information
was at hand today about the technical aspects of data exchange or crisis of a,b,c. Additionally, the Board would
not be doing work in the usual way if not given a presentation from someone that has walked through all the
information. Ms. Sadler responded that the criminal justice community has been crisis mode the last couple of
months. Much effort has been given in several years to get pay increases for public defenders, increase staffing
and it is incumbent upon the IT Board to take part in the very quick steps. Ms. Sadler continued that an
executive order recently was given to open night court. Agencies are acting in an unusual way because
progress needs to be made. The Public Defenders Office is much a critical part of that as much as any agency
here and it is unbelievable the agency can move as many cases as they do given their technology. In answer to
why the Board needs to act today, because the criminal justice community is in crisis mode. Ms. Sadler stated
she believed the project has had technical reviews, ISA has been very involved Mr. Thornsberry, Mr. Grigsby,
and Ms. Patel have looked at this completely.
Ms. Sadler moved to approve Resolution #06-19. Seconded by Judge Young.
Ms. Patel explained ISA would prefer the project be internally hosted. The application licensing expense stays
the same internal or external and maintenance goes down if ISA houses the application. ISA has reviewed the
numbers.
Major Ron Meadows asked Ms. Ursulskis if the Public Defenders Office is willing to work with ISA. Ms.
Ursulskis stated absolutely and commented that the request is for development and housing. The Public
Defenders Office has not come to a final solution beyond that.
Major Meadows stated that the resolution is titled as a request to develop not customize.
Dr. Inui stated that he understands the urgency of the Board acting on the request but would like additional
information on the housing or hosting from a work force, programmer, hardware, maintenance, and software
point of view.
The motion was called and carried. Dr. Inui abstained.
Amendment No. 3 to the Premis Consulting Group Professional Services Agreement
Mr. Jason Buchanan presented Amendment No. 3 to the Premis Consulting Group Professional Services
Agreement. Mr. Andy Laudick, Project Manager, ISA was available for questions. ISA has requested changes
to the Scope of Work (SOW) that are essential towards completion of the AVL Project for RFP evaluations. The
new not to exceed potion of the AVL section of the most recent Scope of worked shall be increased by
$26,450.00.

• Updated migration schedule to account for pilot issues and user
changes.
• Continue with the “Road Show” informing agency and department
managers of the key points regarding the migration.
• Completed migration of over 164 computers and 275 user accounts
of the Crime Lab, Juvenile Court, Mayor’s office, and ISA.
• Experienced some difficulties as expected during this migration. ISA
has documented the issues and is working with all of its partners to
develop solutions.
• Adjusting schedule to accommodate a longer pilot period.
• Held “Pre-flight” Meetings for Agency Points of Contact for the
Migration (as identified in the Road Show)
• Published migration instructions and communications to the end-user

• Automated scripts for the migration are not completed. Additional
resources are needed to complete this process. Without these
additional resources the level of manual intervention required is not
sustainable over the life of the project.
• Problems with pilot migrations need to be resolved to proceed with

The implementation has been delayed until the weekend of 9/22-24.
Training will be offered 9/25-29. The deployment date is now 3 days
before the absentee ballots requested-to-date must be mailed out
per state law.
• Poll Books – The data extract process is scheduled for
implementation 10/13. The poll books have to be delivered to the
warehouse by 10/24 and the lead time for printing the poll books is
10 days, so the data extract functionality needs to be in place and
working properly by 10/13. If the data extract is not ready by 1013,
as a contingency Marion County will be required to use the First
Tuesday poll book format and extract.
• The Marion County project sponsors remain very concerned about
the overall consistency and reliability of First Tuesday due to the time
to enter data, downtime and responsiveness.
• Two additional risks for the November General Election: 1) There
have been three changes in the four Project Sponsor positions since
the primary election 2) The Election Board will be using the First

Siebel was implemented two years ago as a CRM application for the Mayor’s

This project is to identify changes that need to be made and enact a plan to
accomplish them.
No planned items.
The BRM met with the Project Manager to discuss a focused approach to
working with the customer to gain a better understanding of the goals of the
MAC, as an agency, so the technology can support that mission. A list of
preliminary questions was created as well as initial tasks, matching those
tasks up with an end result the customer will understand.
Managing customer expectations will be extremely important for all parties.
The perception of progress by one group vs. another needs to be unified.
The MAC IT Team (ISA/NG) will meet to discuss the preliminary list of

Overall Status

The Automated Mapping Engine, (AME), will allow users to create a high
cartographic quality map without the need for desktop GIS software to be
installed. The application has been designed with a non-technical user in
mind and will simplify the process of creating maps. This application will be
available to users on the IndyGov Intranet only.
Users will be able to select from a set of predefined datasets to be mapped
on top of a base set of map layers. The user will be able to further refine the
data to be displayed by specifying an attribute filter to be applied, a
geographic region such as a township, council district or neighborhood
organization boundary and a date range. The user will be able to specify the
size and orientation for the map. The application will then create a PDF
format file of the map in question and ship it to the user.
AME Phase I is available for use at the following intranet address:
http://arcgissvr.indygov.org/MapEngine/MapWizard/
The AME is being developed and deployed in 2 phases. Functionality
included in Phase I is described above. Phase II will add the following:
•

The ability to save map definitions for repeated use.

•

The ability to subscribe to receive a map based upon a saved
definition on a regular basis via email. This map would of course
contain current data such as all citizen calls to the MAC within the
past month.

•

Reporting capabilities so that a tabular report could be included in
your map subscription.

•
•

•

Complete resolution of identified issues and continue testing.
Continue working with users to identify strengths and shortcomings
of the application and to continue expanding its utilization.
Modified map templates and available layers based upon user
feedback.
Resolved all Phase I issues and deployed fixes to production.

Description

This project will involve the creation of a new public internet application
entitled MyNeighborhood. MyNeighborhood is envisioned to become a single
source of information related to a citizen’s surroundings. Preliminary plans
are to consider the following types of items for inclusion:
• Elected Officials
• Trash Collection Day
• Zoning, Flood Zone, and Land Use information.
• Crime Statistics
• School Choices including Charters
• Parks
• Libraries
• Police & Fire Facilities
• Post Offices
• Neighborhood Associations
• Etc
In addition to listing each of these items for a given address and providing
more detailed information about each subject, later phases of
MyNeighborhood may also include the ability to provide citizens with
directions from their address to the location of interest.
The GIS Team will be creating this application using a “Portal” approach that
will allow us to utilize a common framework to which we can easily add
additional functionality piece by piece without re-deploying the entire
application.
This application is closely tied another report item, “GIS Web-Services
Migration and Development” as all of the actual processes employed by
MyNeighborhood are performed by these web-services.

Meeting with DPW to discuss Indianapolis business requirements.
In-depth demo to cover licensing and cashiering.
Meeting with Betsy Higgins of Accela to begin the process to finalize

Worked with DMD & DPW and made a decision to postpone
Accela’s visit to better prepare. Accela will now be making two visits:
one to meet with DMD & one to meet with DPW separately. The
DMD meeting will occur first, likely mid-October. A date for the DPW
visit has not been set.
Worked with Health & Hospital and Accela as a “middleman” to put
the two organizations in touch to discuss a possible migration of
Health & Hospital to Accela Automation.
The purchase of Accela Automation has not officially made it into the
2007 budget. This purchase is required to meet the Cmte. Goals set
forth by the Mayor’s Office.
The scope of this project could potentially touch a large portion of the
enterprise. A well-communicated phased approach will be key to
successful implementation.
Health & Hospital has recently decided to do additional research into
the Accela Automation product as a possible replacement to their
BEHOT product. Their late interest and participation could impact
the City-County implementation schedule within DMD.

The ISA GIS Team utilizes several web-services to provide specific GIS
functionality to various applications within the enterprise. The most prominent
example of this is the AddressValidator. Non-GIS applications are able to
send an address string to the service and receive a validated and possibly
corrected string back. This ensures that the calling application stores a good
address within it’s own database and alleviates the long-term problems
associated with bad addresses.
The 2 primary goals of this project are:
1. Migrate 6 existing web-services to the ESRI 9.2 platform and
enhance them to work together more effectively.
2. Create several new services that will be used by both the
MyNeighborhood Portal and future enterprise initiatives.
Existing GIS Web-Services to be migrated:
• Geocode
• AddressValidator
• ActivityLogger
• FindNearest

CIVICNET HIGHLIGHTS

August at a Glance
City-County services available through CivicNet continue
to grow in demand, with August totals surpassing the
previous single-month performance record.

Transactions.............................. 43,867

The CivicNet team focused a significant portion of its
efforts on the JUSTIS.NET project during August. On
August 7, CivicNet developers began collaborating with
DAI to determine the scope of work required to re-write
CivicNet applications, which will interface to JUSTIS.Net
via newly-created Web services. Many online services
depend on a smooth execution of the project, including
access to court information, traffic ticket payments and
limited criminal history searches. CivicNet staff worked
closely with the JUSTIS team onsite at the city-county
building to develop requirements needed to build the new
interfaces.

Subscribers................................. 2,979

The CivicNet team worked with IPD to finalize the project
charter and prototype created for the Accident Report
service. The rewritten application will to connect to a new
data source and will also include a Report Status field on
the initial search results screen, which will provide users
with up-to-date information on report availability. IPD
Citizen Services receives numerous requests each day
asking for report status.

IPD- Accident Reports.........Development

CivicNet and IPD also collaborated on the Incident Report
service which is also being rewritten in order to connect to
a new data source. CivicNet is coordinating with IPD and
the MCSD, along with other jurisdictions (such as
Speedway and Lawrence) which must review and sign
inter-agency agreements in order to have incident reports
included in the online service.

Statutory Funds Collected.... $529,725

In late August, the Division of Compliance released an
upgrade to Tidemark. During the upgrade, all CivicNet
permitting applications were unavailable. Once the
upgrade was complete, CivicNet completed several tests in
production. One outstanding issue identified during testing
was addressed and permitting applications are now
interfaced with an upgraded version of Tidemark.

Enhanced Access

ISA has collected $17 Million dollars or 61% of our projected revenue for YTD August 2006, which includes payments
received for the 4th quarter 2005 billings. Quarterly reports have been sent to the Controller’s and Auditor’s Office by
Department or Agency.
The revenue for the County’s December chargeback has historically been posted in the following year’s revenue. For the
December 2005 chargeback, the revenue was posted in FAMIS as 2005 revenue. Therefore, the County’s revenue
percentage will be lower than the expected percent each month.

Monitor migration with on-site resources
Provide clear migration instructions to end-users
Engage a champion from each agency/department
 Work with champion to ensure validation of users,
machines and the relationship between the two. Need
this in advance of migration for proper planning.
Keep all scheduling information in one place
Keep Helpdesk and Desktop personnel informed on all
issues and their resolutions
Stagger rollouts of migrations to prevent bottlenecks

September 22, 2006

Risks & Concerns
1.

Issue: Automated scripts not complete/scripting resource not on site.
Risk: This requires considerable manual intervention to complete and verify migrations. The level of manual
intervention required is not sustainable.
Mitigation: Unisys has been asked to provide appropriate resources to finish automating the processes.

2.

Issue: Mailbox size issues.
Risk: If email size limit policy is not enforced for each migrated mailbox, it will cause failure for the migration of that
user
Mitigation: ISA is working with customers to enforce the email size limit policy.

3.

Issue: Misidentification of machines and users for a particular agency.
Risk: This could result in machines being migrated when their users are not or vice-versa.
Mitigation: ISA, working with our customers, need to ensure that all desktops and laptops that are to be migrated are
identified and accounted for in the project plan and associated with the correct department/agency and user.

4.

Issue: Additional machines that need to be migrated may exist that have not yet been identified.
Risk: This could result in machines not being migrated when needed by their users.
Mitigation: ISA, working with our customers, need to ensure that all desktops and laptops that are to be migrated are
identified and accounted for in the project plan.

5.

Issue: Data Center Health.
Risk: This could lead to down time in the data center if it is not fixed.
Mitigation: ISA working with NG to improve various aspects of the data center (i.e. temperature, electrical etc.)

6.

Issue: Departments/Agencies need to complete application testing with Microsoft XP SP2.
Risk: Need to test applications prior to the migration to validate that they work with XP SP2.
Mitigation: Test the applications that have not already been tested in a lab environment prior to the migration.

Challenges
Obstacles
• 7 JUSTIS Programmer/Analysts, 3 . Net Developers, absolutely must preserve
JUSTIS support until .Net and preserve JUSTIS knowledge post .Net
• Since April 1, 2005 when JUSTIS.Net project was initiated DAI’s 7 JUSTIS
Programmer/Analysts have responded to 1,072 calls for help from current
JUSTIS users. This has equated to 3.5 sometimes 4 full-time equivalents not
being available to help on JUSTIS.Net
• Several of these calls have required numerous program changes. Each set
has meant JUSTIS.Net cannot become code complete and has required a
new extract of code to .Net and retesting of everything already tested
• Currently adding 4 new court rooms which is requiring changes to 20+
programs. This will require another extract of code to .Net and retesting
of everything
• Unprecedented Continuous Public Information Requests (Queries)

Challenges
Obstacles
• Visual Studio – Size and Complexity of Project creating unique
bugs and issues with the Microsoft Development Tools
Microsoft and DAI working together to try and resolve a couple of
Visual Studio problems

•Dev & Test Network and Environment
Scheduled December 31, 2005 not completed until March 31, 2006
(financing and resource issues)
Also encountered serious environment issues until August 1, 2006

• Lead Developer intermittent April 18, 2006 – May 30, 2006
• Key Man took ISA CTO position May 18, 2006

Need to freeze JUSTIS enabling us to reduce support to 1 person or less and
increase Testing team from 2 to 4.5

…Issues /Risks
•

Must assist CivicNet they are not JUSTIS experts
(Old technology screen scraping will not work)

•

User Acceptance Testing (UAT) to start October 2nd will require a
dedicated person from the DAI development team

•

Need Formal Documented Change Control to increase visibility
and track future scope impacts

•

Justice Community needs to be prepared for scheduled down time

•

Support calls will continue

•

Continued program changes could impact timeline further

•

Only 3.5 of 7 JUSTIS Programmer/Analysts dedicated to JUSTIS .Net

…Where are we
•

Due to the awareness of recent problems with the deployment of other critical
applications effecting the public, we must ensure UAT is very thorough and the
same types of problems do not effect the deployment of JUSTIS .Net

•

With this in mind, if we stay with current resources and are able to truly freeze
JUSTIS, with the current projected path and impacts….

The November 15, 2005, IT Board Meeting was called to order at 9:30 a.m.
Minutes:
A motion was made to approve the October 18, 2005 IT Board minutes. The motion was seconded and passed
unanimously.
Mr. Clifford introduced Judge Young as a new IT Board member replacing Judge Miller.
ISA Report
Mr. Banning stated the ISA Report stands as submitted. He discussed the SLR Report as follows:
•
•
•

4 SLR were not reported (3 with credits, 1 without credits)
6 SLRs were missed for October (6 with credits, 0 without credits)
NG will not pay any credits for month of October (no SLRs were missed 2 months consecutively)

Mr. Clifford asked why all the SLRs were not reported. Mr. Clancy explained 4 of the SLRs were not reported
because the reporting mechanism is not in place. The Board requested SLRs not reported be identified in red
for future reports.
Ms. Sadler asked if the Board has an agreement that items not reported will not be held against the credit under
the contract. Mr. Clancy clarified that in the implementation of HP Openview, which NG began in July, not all of
the applications have reporting mechanisms. Ms. Sadler did not realize there was an arrangement for us to not
receive credits based on that. Ms. Sadler pointed out SLRs were reported in September and not reported now
does not mean that the City-Count does not receive credit. Mr. Clifford stated that he did not believe any IT
Board action was taken to eliminate reporting SLRs. Ms. Sadler stated that she does not want this to be
another reporting incident.
Mr. Banning agreed to send the IT Board members a year-to-date report to see the trend.

Ms. Patel explained not every SLR has a credit associated with it. Ms. Sadler stated this fact is not apparent
from the report. Ms. Sadler requested a revised report and a dollar amount of credits that has accumulated. Mr.

Meeting Minutes
Clancy reported an issue exists with going back to the beginning of the year because the SLRs are not one for
one.
ISA Financial Report
Ms. Patel stated the ISA Financial Report stands as submitted. The equipment for test and development for the
Justis.Net project has been ordered.
Major Meadows asked how the agency would handle the pass thru charges that have not been invoiced for the
year. Ms. Patel responded that the departments and agencies have purchase orders in place. The invoices
should be to the departments/agencies by the end of the week. Mr. Clancy clarified the invoices will be for
break fix parts only.
Northrup Grumman Update
Mr. Clancy reported on recent NG staffing changes including a QA/QC Manager, Contract Manager and a SA2
Manager. The asset management first delivery was on time. Mr. Ricketts suggested that all assessor offices be
provided data relative to the township and that data has been provided. Mr. Ricketts commented that the quick
response is appreciated but the Lawrence Township Assessors Office still has not located some of the
equipment identified on the inventory. Mr. Clifford requested that equipment that is no longer a part of the
City/County asset inventory be report to the Office of Finance and Management.
Pictometry Agreement
Mr. Soliman explained that Pictometry is a software that provides complete aerial photography used in City
County agencies including public safety and the township assessor offices. Currently there are over 600 users.
The current contract expires in March of 2006. ISA is requesting to extend the service agreement with
Pictometry International Corp. to March of 2008. Major Meadows, representing Public Safety, requested a list of
the 600 users and statistics regarding those users. Major Meadows stated that he is not aware of any Public
Safety employee that actively uses Pictometry. Major Meadows is looking for information that verifies the
software being used as intended. A list of all the users would not provide information regarding how active any
particular user is. Mr. Carufel offered that ISA has some web survey software which resulted in 21 pages of
comments many from Public Safety employees. He continued that the Crime Lab, Prosecutors Office, MECA,
Arson, Assessors Offices, Weights and Measures all use Pictometry. Major Meadows stated he is requesting
more than just comments he would like statistics on how many of licenses are being used.
Mr. Clifford asked if the contract were put out for competitive bid. Mr. Carufel responded that Pictometry
International Corp. is the sole provider in the country. Judge Young requested a copy of the current contract to
clarify ‘early termination’ prior to taking action on this item.
A motion was made to table the amendment to the December IT Board Meeting. The motion was seconded and
carried unanimously.
Resolution #05-19 Authorizing Credit Card Usage by ISA for Domain Names
Mr. Poulakidas discussed a charge card for ISA for the purpose of registering or renewing domain names for the
City of Indianapolis and Marion County. Mr. Clifford stated that charge cards available in City County
government are very restrictive due to the risk involved. Judge Young asked if it is available to activate the card
specifically for this purpose. Mr. Clifford replied ISA has a creditable CFO and the IT Board will monitor its use.
Ms. Sadler requested the limit be the lowest available.
A motion was made to approve ISA to have a charge card for the purpose of registering and renewing domain
names. The motion was seconded and carried unanimously.

Information Services Agency – Document: ISA-ITBD Meeting Minutes

Information Technology Board
Meeting Minutes
Judge Young requested a report at year-end showing the usage.
Microsoft Enterprise Enrollment: Terms/Conditions
Ms. Patel discussed the Microsoft Enterprise agreement which includes licenses and programs designed for
customers with over 250 desktops. As an enterprise agreement customer ISA will be able to license Microsoft
enterprise software products at a discounted price. The Microsoft Enterprise Agreement will include for all
users: Windows Exp Operating System, Word, Excel, Access, Power Point, Infopath, Publisher and Outlook
Exchange this includes client access license with assurance. Some of the benefits include reducing the
incompatibility issues between the City and County and internal and external customers. It will also eliminate
the cost for third party applications which should result in reduced support costs. Ms. Patel explained that Board
approval is not needed for the terms and conditions but will be necessary for the actual Microsoft Enrolment.
There is no financial obligation at this time. The agreement has already been approved by council and a legal
review has been completed. The enrolment has not been submitted yet. Ms. Patel explained that the total
financial obligation is based on either the number of devices or the headcount which is estimated to be 1.3
million, plus migration. There will be a savings on licenses. Ms. Sadler asked if SP2 is part of the migration.
Mr. Clancy explained NG’s migration plan going from Novell to Microsoft will require analysing 15 different items
and the effect of SP2. Specific concern will be on antiquated applications and how NG is going to upgrade
them. Ms. Sadler asked how is NG going to handle the SP2 migration and also, is there is a plan to migrate
those applications that do not run on SP2, in light of moving the entire enterprise.
Mr. Rindler of Microsoft Corporation reported that the enterprise agreement will include SP2. Also included in
the enterprise agreement are downgrade rights. For legacy applications (applications that cannot run with the
latest version) or those applications in which the vendor is not certified with the latest version there will be
downgrades available. As Microsoft rolls out upgrades to applications, the enterprise will be included in any
new versions. City County Government would own the rights for the length of agreement, including licenses and
upgrades. Ms. Enders asked if the enrolment were by position/person or headcount. Ms. Patel stated that at
this time, the enrolment will be based on headcount.
Judge Young discussed the Novell license expiration at the end of June. ISA is hopeful to get the migration
done by then. If the migration is not complete by the end of June is there a mechanism to roll the 1.3 million or
can ISA contract this until the end of the year. Mr. Clifford explained that the Office of Finance and
Management is in the process of cutting about 3 ½ million dollars out of the County budget for 2005. Ms. Patel
is working with Office of Finance and Management to work through budget conversions to help out the County.
Ms. Patel responded that it will be available to purchase at the agreed price should the headcount increase.
Property System Update
Ms. Barrick reported the Property System project is in the process of a technical review.
Mr. Ricketts stated that he is a member of the property system steering committee for the state. The state-wide
rule was written in 1998 using a totally different system. Mr. Ricketts reported the State has reduced the
amount of information required. Mr. Clifford asked if the financing has been secured. Mr. Ricketts responded
that the financing is being discussed. Ms. Barrick reported the technical review is being conducted by NG and
should be complete in the next two weeks. A secondary performance review has not started yet. Mr. Clifford
asked when the Best and Final Offer is negotiated what is the contractual obligation with the vendor as far as
the appropriations. Mr. Ricketts responded that as negotiations progress if the financing is not secured the deal
will not go forward. Mr. Ricketts further stated that the committee is working to identify different revenue sources
and, with innovative financing, the committee will be able to reach an agreement with the vendor. Mr. Clifford
stated that the committee is looking at licensing a product which updates and makes changes to the system.
Mr. Ricketts explained the system has worked very well in the past 15 years in which there has been a
controlled source code and the application development has been done in-house. Now that there is a more
finite rule from the state there would not be any advantage doing application development in-house when in fact
it may negate the agreement in place. Mr. Clifford stated that the new rule, mandated by the department of local
Information Services Agency – Document: ISA-ITBD Meeting Minutes

Meeting Minutes
government, will require an integrated system that will work for Treasurer, Auditor, County Assessor and the
township assessors. Mr. Ricketts stated that the definition of integrated system does not require one vendor for
all three users. The system will have to be an interface between multiple vendors. All parties will have to have
the same reporting system. Mr. Rodman asked who is going to support the system. Mr. Ricketts responded the
vendor will support the software any auxiliary items will have to be supported in-house.
SVRS Update
Ms. Barrick stated that the system has had full functionality since October. The steering committee has been
meeting daily. Ms. Sadler stated that the implementation itself is going well there are many hurdles with the
program itself.
JUSTIS.NET
The Justis.Net demonstration was presented as an addendum item.
The meeting adjourned at 10:25.
The next IT Board Meeting date has been changed from December 20 to December 13, 2005 at 9:30 in Room
260.

ISA Report
December 2005

Operations

Microsoft Migration – ISA has decided to write a Request for Service (RFS) for a 3rd party
contractor to manage at least the higher end support requirements for the Microsoft
migration. ISA plans on presenting cost estimates to the board in January. ISA hopes to
have the RFS out in the next day or two.
Access Database Conversions – in order to try and pull ahead on items that could be
roadblocks for the Microsoft migration ISA has started an assessment of currently used
Access Databases. Many are Access 97 and will need to be converted to more current
technology. A recent count of server based Access databases showed over 20,000
databases. ISA has 70-75 “paid for”/developed applications. If ISA can afford to migrate
from Access – our general direction will be to .Net. Oracle would be the primary with MS
SQL as secondary preferred databases.
XP SP2 – is progressing. IPD feels comfortable rolling out XP SP2 on the new deployments.
Probation’s new PCs also have SP2 installed. Lots of issues yet to be resolved, but it is
moving forward.
Internet Bandwidth – in evaluating vendors for a redundant Internet connection ISA found
the available vendor technology has changed. After reviewing our current ISP contract ISA
found that agreement is on a month to month basis. This gives the potential opportunity to
replace the current Internet provider – buying more bandwidth at less cost.
Opteman Update– Opteman is a 100M metropolitan area fiber Ethernet connection offering
from SBC. ISA priced offerings from other vendors and found the SBC offering to still be the
best option. ISA ordered 8 additional circuits. Savings over the 48 months remaining on the
contract is estimated at $129K as compared to the DS1 or DS3 connections currently in place
at these locations.

Leading the way in enterprise-wide technology

ISA is exploring other communication options, like DSL, for replacing DS1s in the future.
Cyber Security - Met with end users to discuss planned technology ISA will be implementing
with the UASI Grants for Cyber Security. ISA will start ordering these products as soon as
funds are approved.
Voice Redundancy – Avaya proposal is in and being processed through the approval
process. A number of phone system features are being expanded. ISA will get training on
new capabilities after the first of the year. There are a number of things clients will like and
will help improve efficiency. It should be relatively low cost to give clients in house video
conferencing and may have IP Soft Phone management capability for Blackberries. This is
also a UASI Grant.
GroupWise – Space issues that brought down the servers were related to backup jobs
running while GroupWise clean up was running. Fixes have been applied and ISA believes
the issue is resolved. As part of the research ISA also contacted largest GroupWise users
about reducing their space requirements. Webmail issues continued to plague us as well.
Numerous calls to Novell were unable to resolve the issue. NG was able to determine that
particular emails were causing the servers to go down. This repeatable example was used
by Novell to develop a “fix”. The Novell “fix” was installed 12/6.
Fusion Center – has been delayed. ISA expects it to move forward first quarter next year.
PC Refresh - Met with Dell to review PC refresh options for the enterprise. Dell will be
reviewing the information and strategic direction ISA provided to give more specific
recommendations. The CFO will be reviewing the financial aspects to see which makes the
most sense in our environment.
A number of issues have come up with NG on charging for installs of over 25 PCs. This is
part of the contract, but some clients were unaware. NG is changing the procedure to give
the client an installation cost before the PCs are ordered. ISA is also preparing a
presentation to discuss contract issues for end users.
Justis Outage – have not seen the RCA, but CA Datacom feels it will only be resolved by
upgrading to version 11. DAI & NG feel that an upgrade to v11 will take a lot of effort. We
plan on putting info together to present to our clients. It may be best to live with the current
situation until the migration to Justis.NET.
Blacklist – The enterprise has been blacklisted twice. This means that e-mail was blocked
to people we regularly send to. ISA believes it was an automated “out of office” reply to
SPAM by an end user. An investigation is ongoing.

Please note: The YTD November 2004 expenses for ACS totaled $10,263 million. This expense for ACS does not include
the following:
A). The cost for the Business Consultants (currently reclassified as Business Relationship Managers within ISA).
B). Any Pass through charges & New Application Development. (In 2005 no new application dollars budgeted.)
It does however; include the cost for Maintenance and Support. In 2004 the contractual dollars allocated for Application
Development included Maintenance & Support along w/ New Development. This breakdown was 75% for Maintenance and
Support and 25% for New Development for 2004. Prior to 2004, the split was more 50% for Maintenance and Support and
50% for New Development.
Based on the chart above there is a contract savings of $1.3 million for year to date 2005.

NGC IT Board Report-November 2005
Prepared for: IT Board
Date submitted: 12/13/2005

Prepared by: Jeff Clancy-NG Program Manager
Reporting period: November, 2005

Summary of Accomplishments for NGC-December 2005 (All Service Areas)
Accomplishments
This Month:

1.
2.
3.

Installed Brighthouse DSL for DPR – Rhodius Park for public internet access.
Installed single mode fiber for IPD helicopter live video feed for Emergency Management.
Resolved SLR reporting issue related to Unix and Intel response times

4.

Joe Campbell, new SA2 Manager, joined our staff on Monday, November 28th. Joe is
responsible for the help desk, break / fix and install, moves and changes (IMAC) areas.

5.

Indianapolis Fleet Services faced their first mandatory password reset this week. NG and
ISA had staff onsite at both Riverside and Belmont sites to assist users with this task. Initial
reports are that the users had very few problems with correctly resetting their Novell and
Active Directory/Domain passwords per the written instructions provided to them.

6.

Coroner development – delivered for UAT on 11/28

7.

Installed server with redundant power supplies and RAID configuration for Fleet Services
data application located on their site. This will replace a non-fault tolerant server that the
application resides on. This is an on going process to bring Fleet within ISA standards.

8.

The Network team applied a Firmware update to the problematic switch at 604 N. Sherman.
This is the switch that we suspect caused the “Tree or Server not found” problems earlier in
the year. The Desktop Team has moved some of the workstations off of the temporary
switch and back to the patched switch for testing. At this time we have not experienced the
“Tree or Server not found” error on any of the workstations that were moved back to the
original switch. The Desktop Team will continue to work closely with the Network team to
monitor the situation and continue to move connections back to the patched switch.

9.

Configured, tested and installed the replacement 7200 router that had a hardware failure on
the DS3 to the State after having to replace an additional failed component.

10. Installed new SQL enterprise server Hardware/software and database
11. On Friday, 11/4, we set up the Treasurer's PCs and printers on the 1st floor of the CCB for

them to be able to receive property tax payments during this week. We also loaned them one
of our loaner printers for the week.
12. Images were built with Windows XP Service Pack 2 for both IPD and Probation. Customers

are in the process of testing their applications to ensure functionality with XP SP2.
13. Field Engineers attended a two-hour training and Q/A session with Cilena Oblinger, Siebel

Summary of Accomplishments for NGC-December 2005 (All Service Areas)
Accomplishments
This Month:

14. Worked to resolve several problems in the Treasurer’s Bookkeeping application. This

application was written by TechPG, a local 3rd party vendor, and was still “under warranty”
because there were some bugs/issues in the original deployment. The customer was
experiencing several problems and was very frustrated with the application’s performance. In
fact, they were considering “getting rid of it and starting all over”. We contacted ISA (Deb
Barrick, Dan Pavey, Bob Geis and Adonna White) and discussed the customer’s situation.
As is always our view, when there is an application down, our priority is to fix it, get it back up
and running.

15. The Probation Lease Refresh Project was completed this week. NG installed and/or

delivered 106 machines (96 workstations and 10 laptops). Displaced workstations are being
stored on the 4th floor east wing, and are ready for the re-deployment and disposal projects to
begin. LEX has been updated accordingly with the correct Inventory information for this
project, including the displaced equipment.
16. As promised last month, I am attaching the SLR history from July, 2005 to current. I will ask

Roger Murphy to discuss significant trends.

Executive Summary
Pictometry is a digital oblique aerial imaging system. It provides 3 – 12 views of all
locations within Marion County. The Information Services Agency (ISA) contracts with a
vendor (Pictometry International Corp.) to provide this service to users across City/County
departments and agencies.
The purpose of this document is to present and analyze usage statistics of this software to
determine the return on investment and establish business justification for the
procurement of subsequent software license renewals. The following image illustrates the
software interface displaying a sample Pictometry image:

Scope of Service
Background
The current 2 years license agreement will expire on March 2006. The cost of this
contract was $238,880. The proposed renewal (March 2006 – March 2008) provides
unlimited users licenses at the reduced cost of $203,200. The rights to use the 2004 data
will be terminated at the end of the existing agreement. The new 2006 agreement still
does not offer ownership of the data, however; it provides us with a "Perpetual Use
License" for the 2004 product.

[TYPE DOCUMENT SHORT TITLE]

DECEMBER 8, 2005

Also, the proposed renewal will include traditional “straight down” orthophotography
without increasing cost.

Specifications
Under the new 2006 agreement the vendor will provide two products:
1. 2006 Pictometry Oblique Photos – As with the current Pictometry license, the
2006 license would include both “Community” and the more detailed
“Neighborhood” oblique images:
a. Community:

1.2 - 2.5 foot pixels.

b. Neighborhood:

0.4 - 0.6 foot pixels.

2. 2006 Pictometry Orthophotography - would include 2 levels of resolutions:
a. 1 foot pixels
b. 6-inch pixels.
Also, it provides a post-sampled 1-meter pixel mosaic for backdrop purposes
(as a key map).
The existing 2004 IMAGIS Orthophotography provides a resolution of 6-inch pixel size

Analysis
The Pictometry software platform does not provide tracking tools to assess the volume of
usage. The original estimation of 600+ users was based upon the list of those users who
submitted security requests to receive access to Pictometry. This user list was later
revised downward to 400 after ISA was able to obtain a list of those users who had
actually installed the application. Then the list was reduced again to 349 after removing
users who are no longer employed.
After verifying user information, ISA prepared an online survey to solicit users’ input. The
survey was launched on Tuesday November 29, 2005 and closed on Monday December
5.


The survey was sent to 349 users, 172 responses were received.

Orthophotography Uses:
In addition to the oblique photography usage mentioned above, there are a variety of uses
for traditional 2-D photography.
Within the City / County enterprise the orthophotography is most commonly used as a
backdrop for the other available layers. More importantly though the photography allows
these additional uses:
• The photography is a source for planimetric updates. Existing layers such as
buildings, roads, streams, fences, sidewalks, etc are compared to the photos and updated
based upon changes that are clearly visible.
•
DPW utilizes the photography to verify solid waste pickup locations and to search for
new homes that are receiving service but are not being billed. This was done for the first
time in 2004 and resulted in a $270,000 increase in annual revenues.
• DMD staff that deal with the public (including zoning inspectors, planners, hearing
officers and people involved in the courts) will use the archived photos to determine the
time frame that a feature appeared. For instance, a property owner might be cited for an
un-permitted outbuilding and claim that it has been there long enough to be grandfathered.
The photo archive helps to prove or disprove such claims.
• DMD staff also use the latest vintage photography to create land use plans.
Determining existing and historical land use are important aspects of the planning
process.
• Current and historical aerial photos are used by the assessors to provide field staff
with comparative measurements of improvements and natural features, (pavement, lakes,
etc), verification of an improvements existence during a particular tax year, and verification
of legal descriptions.

Summary
The survey results indicate significant time savings per staff person on an annual basis. Based on a
sample of 172 users who responded to the survey, 104 users (~ 60%) reported time savings of
approximately 5,500 man hours per year. If we apply the same percentage to the entire users’
population (349) then the projected time savings are approximately 11,052 hours per year. Using
an average hourly wage of $10 / hour per employee as a conservative estimate, the projected cost
savings will be $110,520 per year.2
This does not take into consideration all other indirect benefits and time savings from using spatial data
derived from orthophotography. Also, it does not measure the value of improving the quality of service
to citizens from using cutting-edge technology.
Based on this analysis ISA feels that the Pictometry product adds a significant business value to
City/County and recommends the renewal of the Pictometry agreement to continue to provide the
same quality of service to its existing and prospective customers.

The annual cost for the proposed Pictometry contract is $101,600

Project Analysis Worksheet Instructions
Introduction. The purpose of Project Analysis Worksheet (PAW) is to help City County Agencies
and the Information Services Agency (ISA) improve the decision-making process with information
technology (IT) projects over $50,000. It is proposed that agencies requesting IT services or a
project over $50,000 submit a PAW. The PAW will be one of the initiating documents of ISA’s
Continuous Customer Service Improvement (CCSI) initiative being developed by ISA’s Program
Management Office.
ISA’s Business Relationship Management and Project Management staff will assist agencies with
the submission of the PAW, which will be one section of ISA’s new project management process
being developed following the Project Management Institute’s PMBOK standards, recognized
world-wide as the leading project management standards for IT projects. Agencies may request a
waiver for submitting a PAW.

phase, the objectives serve as a foundation for development of project performance
measures known as measures of success.
3. Core Business Activity Impacted – Core Business Activities are agency defined crossfunctional processes that produce the agency's primary products and services, or support
their production. List the Core Business Activities impacted by the project and identify the
impact.
4. Constraints – Constraints are items that by their nature restrict choice. Identify constraints
that will influence the selection of a solution to resolve the business problem. Constraints
can include but are not limited to: time, funding, personnel, facilities, and, management
limitations.
C. Preliminary Project Description - A preliminary description of the project approach. The
approach is the overall strategy for solving the business problem. The Preliminary Project
Description is derived from the Project Description Statement and Section B, Project Purpose.
This description establishes the framework for identification of potential solutions. This
section does not describe a specific solution. Solutions are identified, analyzed, compared, and
selected in subsequent parts of this document. Expand the size of the box provided if needed.
D. Solution(s) Analysis Part I – Describe each potentially viable solution, and evaluate the
solution against the decision criteria. Duplicate the Evaluation Process (D.1 thru D.2.e and
including the question after 2.e) for each solution being considered. Provide a Solution
Identifier for each solution (ie: A, B, …or 1, 2...) and a brief title in Short Solution Title to
easily identify each solution. Only one solution may be considered.
1. Description of Solution – In the box provide a brief description of the solution being
considered. The description should include enough detail to provide a clear understanding
of what the solution will do and differentiate it from the other solutions being considered.
Also, describe how this solution will resolve the business problem defined in Section B.
2. Decision Criteria - The decision criteria below are recommended for evaluation of each
potential solution. Additional criteria may be added when needed. It is essential that all
solutions be evaluated against the same set of criteria.
a) Business Process Impact – Describe how the potential solution will impact the current
business processes and what degree of organizational change and stakeholder resistance
is anticipated.
b) Technical Feasibility - Describe any special considerations such as technical experience
required for project team members. Also, describe the level of technical complexity
associated with the solution.
c) Maturity of Solution - Describe the level of technical maturity for the potential solution.
The description should address how technically proven the potential solution is, for
example: Is the solution a recent innovation? Has it fully matured? Is it nearing
obsolescence? Are service and expertise readily available to support the potential
technical solution?
d) Resources Estimate – Estimate all the resources required to implement the solution.
Resources include personnel, facilities, customer support, equipment, and any other
resources needed to implement the solution.

e) Constraints Impact – Describe how well the solution fits within the identified
constraints in Section B. Specifically address any time or schedule constraints.
Answer YES or NO to the question: Based upon decision criteria 2.a-2.e, is the
potential solution a viable solution? If YES, continue to Section E (Solution Analysis –
Part II). If NO, discard solution.
E. Solution(s) Analysis Part II – ONLY if a potential solution remains viable after analysis of
the criteria in D.2.a–e above, perform a Cost Benefit Analysis for the solution and calculate
Return on Investment. ISA Project Management Guideline provides additional detail on Cost
Benefit Analysis and Return on Investment. Duplicate the Solution(s) Analysis Part II (E.1
thru E.2) for each viable solution. Remember to enter in the unique Solution Identifier and brief
title in Short Solution Title for each solution.
1. Cost Benefit Analysis Summary– Present a summary of Cost Benefit Analysis for this
solution. See the ISA Project Management Guideline for instructions on Cost Benefit
Analysis.
2. Return on Investment (ROI) Summary – Present a summary of the estimated value of the
solution in terms of an investment. There are several ways to calculate Return on
Investment (ROI) any are acceptable but the same method must be used for all solutions
analyzed. See the ISA Project Management Guideline provides instructions on Return on
Investment Calculations.
F. Comparison of Solutions – Enter the unique Solution Identifier in boxes that are shaded.
Based on the analysis performed, rate how each solution measured up against the decision
criteria used for the analysis. A recommended rating scale is: 1 = Very Poor, 2 = Poor, 3 =
Fair, 4 = Good, 5 = Very Good. If a decision criterion is more important than others, weights
may be assigned to each criterion to reflect the level of importance. Once the ratings for all the
solutions are complete, compare and contrast the analysis and ratings for each of the solutions
to the others. Identify the solution that best satisfies the previously reviewed criteria.
Summarize the results and identify the solution that best satisfies the decision criteria. Many
methods may be used, but the weighted matrix evaluation table is recommended. See Project
Initiation (Section 2) of the Project Management Guideline to provide additional detail on
comparing solutions using the weighted matrix evaluation table.
G. Preliminary Recommendation – Describe the recommended solution and provide a summary
of the rationale for selecting it.
1. Recommended Solution – Specify the solution selected based on the analysis. Use the
description previously provided in Section D of this document. Enter in the unique
Solution Identifier and Title of the recommended solution in the appropriate areas.
2. Recommended Solution Justification – Explain how and why the solution was chosen over
the other solutions considered if more than one solution is being considered.
H. Decision - Document the decision of the project sponsors or designated agency manager
regarding the recommended solution. If the solution is accepted, a project proposal is
developed.

Action Items
Award of Information Technology Outsourcing Contract for Service Area 3 (Resolution
04-12 and Resolution 04-22)
Mr. Mockert briefly discussed the proposals received and the process involved in
narrowing down the 12 proposals. Following the evaluation team’s review of proposals
eight proposers were invited to make presentations. After the presentations,
negotiations were conducted with three firms. The evaluation team determined it was in
the best interest of the City-County to split the services under Service Area 3 between
two firms, Northrop Grumman and Daniels and Associates.
Mr. Mockert expressed his appreciation for all those that participated in the RFP process
and acknowledged the many hours of review that it required.
Mr. Clifford moved to approve Resolution 04-21 and Resolution 04-22. Motion was
seconded by Ms. Womacks and passed unanimously.
Due to other pressing issues, Sheriff Anderson left the meeting immediately following the
vote.
Increased Bandwidth for Public Safety Remote Networks (Resolution 04-23)
Mr. Vargo and Mr. Turner were present to discuss the increased bandwidth for Public
Safety.
Major Ball advised his fellow board members of current conditions regarding turn-around
time in electronic submission of reports for public safety officers. He has received
complaints from all the districts.
Lieutenant Finch, IPD, added their IT employees are writing new applications just to get
them to run on the old bandwidth. Further, Lt. Finch stated, it may take as long as 6-8
minutes just to open old applications.
Mr. Ricketts acknowledged SBC’s efforts to make the contract very lean and
competitive. He believed the current contract is 50% below the initial offer.
Mr. Mockert added it is his intent to continue to encourage ISA to be the driving force for
competitiveness.
Mr. Clifford motioned to approve Resolution 04-23. Motion was seconded by Ms.
Womacks and passed unanimously.
Ms. Enders complimented staff on the presentations stating it was well put together.
N-frame Contract (Resolution 04-24)

Mr. Mockert discussed continuing service with the current provider, N-frame
(formerly One-Call Communications) for Internet connectivity.

Ms. Enders moved to approve Resolution 04-24. Ms. Womacks seconded the
motion.
Ms. Sadler asked if this was a competitive price considering it was not bid.
Mr. Mockert believed the price to be competitive; ISA has received good service
from this vendor.
For clarification, the Internet service agreement was not re-bid. Mr. Soliman
added he reviewed providers a few years ago and N-frame seems to be
consistent with other providers available. Mr. Soliman did not anticipate a
substantial increase in cost with the current provider. In response to Mr. Ricketts’
concerns Mr. Soliman did not believe there to be any significant that decreases in
cost for this service during the length of the contract.
Mr. Clifford asked if in seeking out vendors ISA uses quotes, puts out RFP’s has
a formalized policy, or are they driven by state law. He continued he would like
to see ISA formulate policy to bring before the board.
Judge Payne added that he would like to see consistency on terms
(monthly/annual/not to exceed).
The second was withdrawn.
Ms. Enders moved to Table Resolution 04-24 to the October IT Board meeting.
Ms. Womacks seconded the motion. Motion passed unanimously.
Discussion Items
Information Technology Outsourcing Contract for Service Area 3
Mr. Vrtiak was present to update the board on activities of the transition team onsite. He reported interviews with senior management positions have taken place,
and Human Resource Benefits Open House is scheduled for current ACS
employees. Interviews for all positions to be transferred with offers being made
the week following. Northrup Grumman will fill any vacancies outstanding.
Mr. Vrtiak noted he is aware of the situation and has discussed possibilities with
individuals it may affect.
Ms. Womacks asked if recommendations were being taken from customers. Mr.
Vrtiak requested recommendations be made to Mr. Mockert and ISA first.

ISA Organizational Reengineering
Mr. Mockert discussed his desire to have people moved into the new roles being
created. He plans to move forward as if he has the authority to make the
necessary changes.
Mr. Ricketts explained there might have been some misunderstanding. The
‘interim’ title should not prevent him from moving forward. The board is asking to
be kept apprised. He also requested he be copied on role definitions submitted
to the job class board.
Mr. Ricketts requested CIO Status be added to next month’s agenda. He also
requested an Executive Session be held prior to next month’s IT Board meeting.

Marion County, CA and JTAC resources have
been working together to create a revised
comprehensive project schedule. We are hopeful
this can be published in the near future.
At the request of JTAC we are reviewing system
design documents and the current version of the
CMS application for compliance with the original
Statement of Work Contract and subsequent
Change Requests.
Review of recently created change request design documents to make sure the meet Marion
County requirements for system gaps in functionality identified by Marion County personnel.
Donna Edgar and DAI personnel familiar with financial processes have been diligently
reviewing the financial processes built into the new system for completeness and ease of use.
JTAC has asked Marion County to help them run through a “UAT Qualification” exercise. This
is intended to make sure the system doesn’t have any additional unknown major gaps in
functionality along with validating the configuration of the system administration tables and
lookup lists prior to a releasing the system for full User Acceptance Testing (UAT.)
Marion County has committed ongoing resources to assist JTAC and CA with creating test
scripts for the system that will be used during User Acceptance testing.

as well as Rosalie Hinton of DMD, to develop new cases
in the Tidemark System to allow tracking of nuisance
abatement activities as well as drug house eviction
activities.
The new ‘NUI’ – Nuisance Abatement and ‘DRG’ –
Drug Eviction cases were rolled in to production on
October 1st opening another door of automated
information sharing between the Prosecutor’s Office,
DMD, H&H and the City Prosecutor’s Office. With this
new addition of information, DMD and H&H inspectors
will be aware of nuisance and drug activities in advance
when responding to complaint and violation properties,
allowing them to coordinate with the Community
Prosecution Division and Public Safety when needed.
Another win-win situation for all parties involved!

Major Technical
Project Updates
The following projects were
addressed during the month and
their current status is presented.
Improved Infrastructure and Processes
•

The ACS Communications group completed the
move of the Public Defender offices from the
Juvenile Center located at 25th and Keystone to their
new offices at 2511 E 46th Street. The project
included the procurement and installation of new
network equipment, including router and switches,
installation of voice and data cabling throughout the
facility and implementation of a new high-speed
DS1 circuit. The move provides more room for the
Public Defender staff and enables increased
efficiency.

•

Additionally, the ACS Communications group
completed the project for moving of the Drug
Diversion Treatment Court from the City/County
Building into their new offices at 251 E. Ohio Street.
New voice and data cabling was installed along with
a new switch. The new switch was connected to the
existing high-speed data network already in place at
the building.

Page 1

Deletion of the circuits results in combined
yearly savings of over $4,300.00.

Mainframe Support Efforts
•

•

The ACS Production Control team has updated all
batch jobs that execute and create data files used for
the creation of microfiche media. This effort was
undertaken to reduce the amount of time it takes to
identify data files and transmit those data files to
CD-COM for processing. Since its inception, data
files are now being sent prior to the start of the
business day, thus improving the turnaround time
required to get the finished microfiche product back
to the City/County customers.

•

Server Improvement Efforts
The ACS Systems group implemented updated
procedures to reduce the need to recycle the
Network Printing Facility (NPF) when printers
became inoperable due to hardware or
communications errors. These individual errors are
troublesome because often all of the printers in the
enterprise had to be brought down as a result of
isolated printing issues.
The new practices include a proactive hourly review
of the NPF print queues, immediate problem
determination and resolution steps should a problem
be recognized, and trouble ticket logging should
more experienced support be required.

•

•

As part of our ongoing project to reduce the costs
associated with delivering data communication
connectivity to remote locations as well as to
remove obsolete technology from the City/County
enterprise two more legacy mainframe data circuits
have been deleted and converted to newer cost
effective technology.
The first was the analog 9.6kb/s circuit to Indiana
State Police that was previously used to provide
IDACS connectivity to the mainframe. This line
became available for deletion because of the States
conversion to the client server based OMNIXX
connection to IDACS.
The second was the analog 9.6kb/s circuit to the
Speedway Police Department. This deletion
was made possible because of conversion from
old 3270 data equipment (dumb terminals) to
TN3270 processes on personal computer
workstations and updated printing processes on
network printers.

Monthly Highlights and Statistics
September 2004

The ACS Server team installed the latest Novell and
HP ProLiant Support to all Novell servers in
September. This included the implementation of
operating system updates and HP ProLiant hardware
updates, which will help resolve administration and
support issues for NetWare 6.0, necessary for
maintaining the stability of the City/County
infrastructure.

Storage Management Improvement Efforts

Since the process was implemented, calls to the
ACS helpdesk relating to printer problems appear to
be in the decline.
•

The ACS Systems team along with the Production
Control staff made significant improvements to the
internal processes currently utilized to automatically
generate mainframe terminal ID’s. To ensure report
accuracy, additional checkpoints as well as
streamlined recovery procedures have been added in
the event that terminal ID definition tables become
corrupt.

The past month has been extremely busy for the
ACS Storage Management team, which had moved
1.6 TB (Terabytes) from a SAN environment that
was at the end of any expansion or growth capacity
to the new EMC Clarion CX500 SAN. The
successful implementation of the CX500, which has
8.2TB of usable SAN storage, will allow future
growth and expansion. The storage was divided into
two sections with 3.5 TB of slower ATA drives for
archiving IPD's new imaging file system that is
currently in development. The remaining 4.7 TB that
is allocated for file and database growth for all
City/County departmental storage needs. This new
storage system has the potential for GroupWise
clustering for fault tolerance which implemented
along with other existing technologies can now
share a common storage environment that can
provide a greater ROI compared to unused attached
server storage.

Mid-Range Improvement Efforts
•

Prior to each election, the ACS Mid-Range/Web
Team works with the Election Board to understand
the unique technical needs of each election as it
pertains to the distribution of the election results.
Not only are the election results posted on the City’s
own website, but we also distribute those results to
the local TV stations and also to the Indy Star and
Associated Press. In order to minimize the risk of
any problems that might come under the spotlight of

Page 2

public scrutiny and to help insure success in
publishing the results correctly and in a timely
fashion, preparation and testing before the election is
key. This process has now begun for the general
election in November. One problem that was
resolved this month was the secure file transfer of
ballot information between the Election Board and
their vendor, ESS.
•

The ACS Midrange group developed automation
improvements in startup and shutdown scripts on
our Unix-based web servers that will reduce the risk
of human error during system restarts. Reduction of
human errors during this task will reduce undue
downtime, enhancing availability of the servers.

Monthly Statistics from
the Help Desk
During the month of September,
5,129 calls were presented to the
Help Desk of which 4,016 were
handled by the daytime Help Desk
and 859 were received by our after-hours operation. 254
calls were terminated before the Help Desk had a chance
to answer the call. The average time to answer a
customer’s call was 18 seconds, and 92.4% of prime time
calls were answered in less than 60 seconds
Of those calls, 575 turned out to be technical problems.
ACS closed 587 problem calls during the month and
achieved a first call resolution of 89.7%. This means that
89.7% of those who called with a problem had their issue
resolved by the time they hung up the phone.
ACS processed 671 security requests during the month.
213 involved changes to security profiles, there were 260
deletions of various access rights and 198 new access
rights were granted. ACS also closed 196 service
requests during the month.
ACS technicians completed 565 desktop moves, adds,
changes, or installations during September. For the
month of September, 109 new desktops computers and
laptops were setup and delivered to various customers
throughout the enterprise. Included in this number were
46 machines replaced in the Prosecutor’s office to meet
the requirements for the new state-wide case
management system.
ACS has completed the project to install 200 desktop
computers for the Indianapolis Police Department
throughout the various sites.

Monthly Highlights and Statistics
September 2004

September was a quiet month for disposals; with only 64
items being disposed of for the month. ACS did not
make any disposal runs this month, but do expect a large
run to occur in October.

ACS Customer of the Month
September: Our congratulations go to
September’s Customer of the Month, Lance
Lewis with DPW-Operations. Mr. Lewis
received an upgrade to Windows XP on his
PC
from
ACS
technician
Carol
Hauersperger. Carol and ACS received the following
ratings: (Scale of 1 to 3 with 3 being the highest)
Did you get the assistance you needed? 3
Was it delivered in a timely manner? 3
Was the service friendly and helpful? 3
Mr. Lewis has been contacted about being named
"Customer of the Month" for September and will be
receiving lunch for two for his valuable feedback.

Customer Service Cards Results
ACS technicians distributed 587 customer satisfaction
feedback cards during the month of September. 91 or
15.5% of them were actually completed and returned.
This is an increase in participation from August. The
returned results continue to indicate a high level of
customer satisfaction for the assistance received a 2.96
on a scale of 1 to 3. Timely service rated a 2.91 and our
technicians were deemed friendly and helpful judging
from our perfect 3.00 score.

Looking Ahead to October
The Customer Support area is planning the following
activities:
In preparation for the upgrade of FRMS to version 7.4.1,
ACS technicians have been visiting every firehouse to
upgrade PC’s to version 9.2 of Oracle and install the new
FRMS client. Also, PC’s with Windows XP licenses but
running Windows 98 are being upgraded to Windows XP
with SP1. This project is expected to be completed in
October.
A recent major update to the Microsoft Windows XP
operating system has been released in the form of
Service Pack 2. This update makes sweeping changes to
security, functionality, and major components of
Windows XP. Due to these changes, there are many
known compatibility issues with this update. ACS has a
project underway to test this update and its impact on the
Page 3

to the recommended patch level of 1.3.31. Also, we
will be raising the maximum Apache connection
limit to 1024. The limit currently is set to 256
concurrent connections. This will be done to
accommodate increased demand for iReports
election results.

Indianapolis/Marion County enterprise. The current
version of Novell ZenWorks that is implemented is not
compatible with SP2. The Windows SP2 team is
working with the LAN team to determine a rough
estimate of when the compatible version of Zen will be
implemented.
The Technical Services area identifies the following
planned activities:

•

Network Communications
•

•

Mainframe activities
There are two identified security weaknesses in
Cisco IOS software which require updating of the
IOS versions in use on the routers in the Enterprise
network. The Communications Group will be
surveying and updating firmware on a scheduled
basis across the network during the remainder of the
year.
IPD has approached ISA and requested additional
bandwidth to their remote districts (IPD North,
South, East, West, and Downtown). ACS performed
utilization studies and generated usage graphs
confirming the high utilization for these sites. In
response, ACS has been working with multiple
vendors to implement cost effective scalable
solutions rather than deploy existing WAN
technologies (Frame Relay, ATM, etc.).
Scalable 10/100/100 Ethernet-based Metropolitan
Area Networking (MAN) solutions from SBC and
Time Warner were evaluated in conjunction with
identification of new specifications for Customer
Premise Equipment (CPE).
A final recommendation to select SBC to provide
the services was submitted to ISA and the IT Board,
and was approved. Contract negotiations between
the City Legal and SBC Legal departments are
underway. Once complete, we will move forward
with equipment procurement and coordination of
these connections.

Mid-range group
•

•

In preparation for the general election, the Midrange
group will migrate iReports from imcwsl01 to
imcwsl02 so as to improve security architecture.

Numerous software and firmware upgrades to the
storage infrastructure components are being planned
that will maintain the currency of the City’s storage
assets. These upgrades will resolve a couple of
minor issues that we are currently experiencing with
the monitoring ability of our storage control station,
ECC.

Business Travel

Source:

The newest laptops are powerful, light, and thin enough
to fit easily into the slenderest of carry-on baggage. This
makes them a great accessory for flying or any other
mode of travel, but also easier to lose. Here are our top
seven security tips to help you secure your laptop.

http://www.microsoft.com/athome/security/onthego/ontheroad.
mspx

1) Protect your information - If you keep a lot of
personal or financial information on your computer
consider investing in an operating system that includes
file protection. Windows XP Professional has the tools to
protect your information through a process called
encryption.
2) Disguise your laptop - Carrying your laptop in an
expensive laptop bag may be asking for trouble. Instead,
conceal your computer in a laptop backpack or another
inconspicuous case that doesn't appear to be storing a
laptop.
3) Be vigilant at the security checkpoint - Everyone
knows that security checkpoints at airports are a
necessary hassle these days. Laptop thieves will take
advantage if you are flustered by the commotion or in a
hurry to catch your flight. When you go through security,
keep an eye on your laptop as it travels through the
scanner. Thousands of laptops are stolen at airports each
year, and even more are simply left behind.
4) Store it under the seat in front of you - Because
we're in an enclosed space, we tend to be lax about
securing our belongings on airplanes. Don't be. When
you're not using your laptop on a plane, store it
underneath the seat in front of you, instead of the
overhead bin where strangers will have easier access to
it.
5) Watch for over-the-shoulder snoops - There's so
much in today's news about how hackers can digitally
sneak into your personal files, we sometimes forget
about the old fashioned method of snooping. When
you're using your laptop in a public place, be on the look
out for thieves attempting to look over your shoulder as
you enter sensitive information, such as a password.
6) Protect your laptop with a strong password - If you
travel with your laptop frequently, you should secure it
with a strong password. Check your computer's Help and
Support service to learn how to add or change your
system password.
7) Back up before you go - Always back up your
information before you take your laptop on a trip. You
can't always avoid the financial loss of your equipment,
but you can avoid losing all your information in the
process.

CIVICNET HIGHLIGHTS
Reminder: Financial data is now being reported on a one-month delay. This
means that financials for September 2004 will be detailed in the report
distributed in November.

The last quarter of the year is promising to be just as strong as
the rest of 2004 for eCommerce activities on CivicNet. Total
transactions for this year have already surpassed totals from all
of 2003 by nearly 8 percent – with three months still to go.
Project highlights for September included completion of agency
testing for online inspection requests for sewer permits, which
will be launched in early October. Notices will be sent to all
current CivicNet permitting customers and links will be available
on CivicNet with information on the new service enhancements
and the associated $1.00 price increase. The next permit type to
be upgraded for online inspections and completion cards is rightof-way, which is in the final stages of development.

Project Highlights

Inspection Requests: Sewer Completed
The Division of Compliance will begin testing online general
contractor license renewals in early October. Deployment is
scheduled for October 18, in time for the 2004 license renewal
period. Reminder postcards were developed by the CivicNet
marketing team and will be mailed to all general contractors by
the mid-October. Posters were created for display in the agency
lobby to notify customers of the new service, and a link to the
information will be provided from the CivicNet permitting page.
CivicNet will coordinate additional links from the IndyGov
services page and the Department of Metropolitan Development
homepage.
The Purchasing Division is completed testing on the bid package
application. This service will be deployed early October with
links to the information on the CivicNet and the City
Controller’s homepages. This service will allow interested
parties to download bid package specifications that are free of
charge, and will replace the current system of faxing, copying
and mailing the multiple requests for bid package information.
CivicNet is working with City of Speedway schools and the
school districts of Franklin, Decatur, Lawrence, Warren and
Wayne for connectivity to the Juvenile Justice Information
Sharing System (JJISS). The participating schools will provide
student information for the juvenile court system, Family and
Social Services Administration (FSSA), and police reports. In
return, each school district will receive reciprocal access to other
entities’ information relating to their students.

REPORT TO THE IT BOARD
Review Committee
November 2004
Greg Jordan (Treasurer) chaired the Review Committee, with additional voting
members in attendance: Andy Swenson (DMD), Terry Nelson (representing Auditor
Womacks), Kathy Price (Township Assessors), and Chuck White (Controller).
Also in attendance were Laura Lindenbusch and Arleen Acton from CivicNet, Nadeen
Biddinger and Ahmed Soliman from ISA, Paul Belch from the Office of Corporation
Counsel, Cindy Land from the Marion County Treasurer’s Office and Major Ron
Meadows from the Marion County Sheriff’s Office.
Treasurer’s Report: Mr. Jordan provided the financial report through 11/04/2004,
showing a balance of $408,752.90. Mr. Jordan indicated the increase in revenue
reflects Enhanced Access Fees deposited by the Marion County Recorder.
New Business:
CivicNet had 1 Service Request and 3 Waivers of Subscriptions for the Committee’s
consideration.
1. Major Ron Meadows came to answer any questions concerning Service Request
#23-A. The Sheriff’s Department is requesting the ability to offer online the real
estate sold reports for the Sheriff’s Sale. They sell approximately 600 properties a
month. This process is currently a manual process and would help with the large
volume of requests for this information.
The pricing schedule recommended is $10.00 for the Agency fee, $2.00 for the
Enhanced Access Fee. There would be an additional $1.26 instant access fee for
credit card users.
Mr. Swenson moved we approve the request, and was seconded by Mr. Jordan. The
motion was approved unanimously.
2. Mr. Jordan brought up the issue of disbursing revenue in the Enhanced Access fund
to the agency that generated the revenue. Paul Belch was asked to review and
clarify the ordinance concerning that distribution.
3. There was also discussion about the Revenue Sharing funds when the $50,000
revenue threshold was exceeded on a monthly basis. Mr. Jordan is concerned
about having to identify which agency has generated the revenue if we don’t
determine that soon. The revenue sharing began March of 2003. Mr. Jordan asked
if CivicNet could provide us reports to obtain that information and Ms. Lindenbusch
confirmed they could. Mr. Jordan is going to discuss with Shirley Mizen in the
Auditor’s office about creating a Sub-fund to keep track of the revenue sharing funds
versus the other revenue.

Report to the IT Board
Review Committee
November 2004
Page 2

4. The Department of Local Government Finance previously submitted a waiver of
subscription and Enhanced Access Fees. Paul Ricketts asked that temporary
access be granted until the next meeting of the Review Committee. The application
requested the following CivicNet Services for the assessment, legal and
administrative staff in the central office:
They requested access to property information searches, owner reports, parcel
histories, and monthly real estate lists. The purpose listed was to access
information to permit research and to provide general answers to queries from
taxpayers and other units of government.
Mr. Jordan had requested this information and has not received any feed back. The
Committee still has concerns with the request and suggested Ms. Price contact the
DLGF to clarify what they are requesting when they refer to monthly real estate lists
and advise them of our limiting the number of staff for access. Also, the reference to
provide general answers to queries from taxpayers is not the intended purpose of
having access.
The Committee agreed to approve the status quo until the December meeting until
we can get clarification.
5. The BMV has requested a fourth sign-on to CivicNet for Criminal and Civil Court
searches and IPD and MCSD reports.
The Committee asked Ms. Acton to verify the current volume of the three that had
been previously approved and find out where the users reside. Are they in different
offices or buildings? The standing policy is limiting the use to three. This request is
tabled until additional information is provided.
6. American Financial Credit Services (AFCSA) has requested access to CivicNet to
view property records. AFCS currently represents the Marion County Treasurer in
the collection of delinquent personal property taxes.
Mr. White moved we approve the request limiting the approval to the expiration of
the Treasurer’s contract with AFCS and that it only be used for searches attributable
to the research for the Treasurer; and was seconded by Mr. Swenson. The motion
was approved unanimously.
The next meeting is scheduled for December 9th.

October/November ISA Activities:
Reorganization: Since September, ISA has been focusing on reorganization plans.
These plans included preliminary discussions with staff to explain new roles and
responsibilities as well as a different organization chart to support the changes. One of
the activities included presenting eleven new job descriptions to the Marion County Job
Classification and Compensation Board for approval. The Board approved the job
descriptions on October 14, 2004, and the positions were posted to ISA and ACS
employees for consideration.
All ISA employees and ACS employees were given the first opportunity to apply for
positions in the new organization, and sometimes applied for more than one position.
Interviews with internal staff and ACS have been conducted for the Deputy Director
positions and most of the other positions in the new organization chart.
The intention is to have successful candidates begin transitioning into new roles by
December 1st unless he or she is currently an ACS employee, in which case transition
will occur January 1st.
Some letters offering positions have already been sent and accepted. A joint orientation
meeting between ISA, Northrop Grumman (and subcontractors) and their new staff, and
DAI and their new staff, will occur on November 19th.
Following this effort, open positions will be posted on the County’s Human Resources
Board and on the internet.
Planning: Activities include participation in the pre-RFP activities related to the search
for a replacement Property System and management of a few development projects
sub-contracted through ACS to outside vendors to ensure completion or near-completion
by the end of this year.
Ahmed, Dave, Bruce and Dan assisted in the preparation and release of a Request for
Qualifications to approximately twenty vendors who did not respond to the RFP earlier
this year, in an attempt to qualify them for future development projects. These RFQ
responses will be qualified by the end of the year.
GIS: The GIS Team supported the Polling Place Locator through the General Election.
It’s capacities were taxed by the heavy use and had a number of usage issues during
peak times.
The GIS Retreat was held on November 4th at the Eagle Creek Hide-away. A review of
accomplished projects was given and mapped against the GIS Strategic Plan. Planning
for 2005 projects was also conducted at the retreat.

Telecommunications: The Telecommunications Team worked without one of their four
members who is on maternity leave and gave birth to twin girls. They installed new
phone equipment for Fire Prevention at the Julia Carson Building, Public Defender at the
new off-site location for juvenile. They also provided the telephone setup for the election
and supported the phone bank.
Internet: The Internet Team is methodically working through all the Agencies and
Departments to implement the Content Management standardization for all the sites and
pages. They created email distribution lists (e-newsletters) for INTF! (IN Task Force -1)
and completed an evaluation of E-Newsletter list management products.
Other: The IT Team has been transformed into the Information Technology Steering
Committee (ITSC) consisting of five members from the City and five from the County
representing different functional areas. These members, all non-ISA and from the user
community, represent people with strategic vision for their offices and a good technical
knowledge to make recommendations on standards and prioritization with an enterprise
focus.
Transition Activities:
The ISA Transition Team is working daily with the Northrop Grumman Transition Team
to align activities The NG Team consists of people led by Tom Tierney, plus their
Program Manager, George Vrtiak. The ISA Team consists of eight members led by
Nadeen Biddinger, plus the CIO.
The transition activities are documented in their deliverables and are in progress with
regular weekly communications between the two teams. The ISA role is to assist,
facilitate, monitor, and at times manage the transition process with Northrop, ensuring it
goes smoothly and is successful.
Weekly meetings are ongoing with management of ISA and NG. Bi-weekly meetings are
scheduled with Northrop Grumman Corporate staff to make sure transition activities are
on target and there are no impediments.
NG has completed their first round of interviews with offers extended and acceptances.
DAI already secured the employees who will transition from ACS to their company. If
there are further roles to fill, NG will begin looking at other applicants from outside the
ACS staff
The Transition Plan has been approved and distributed to all Board members. Other
deliverables are scheduled at various intervals during the transition and will be reviewed
by appropriate ISA staff.

MEMORANDUM
To:

IT Board

From:

Greg Jordan, Chair
Enhanced Access Review Committee

Date:

16 August 2004

The Enhanced Access Review Committee is charged by the IT Board with making pricing
recommendations for online applications defined under Indiana's Enhanced Access statue. The
Enhanced Access statute allows for pricing access based on marketing criteria in order to provide
revenue for the establishment, maintenance and enhancement of those online systems. Current
appointed members are Andy Swenson, Chuck White, Marty Womacks, Greg Jordan, and Kathy
Price.
Over the past 5 months, the Enhanced Access Review Committee has reviewed a request made
by the Marion County Bail Agents Association to consider a fixed or reduced price to Court
Records in order to entice their members to use the CivicNet services for court records on a
frequent basis.
The Committee first considered whether or not they might be able to recommend the requested
pricing change solely for these applicants. Paul Belcher, counsel for the Review Committee and
the IT Board, provided the Committee with the opinion that Indiana law requires uniform pricing
of access to all users of a given data set. It seems, therefore, that the IT Board cannot offer a
preferential pricing policy for any particular group not specifically mentioned in State enhanced
access laws (e.g., the media and the university community).
At the committee's request, CivicNet tested several pricing schemes and did marketing studies to
test their clients' possible reaction to the new pricing. In their analysis of the Court Records
service, CivicNet determined that a decrease in price would not appreciably increase the demand
for this service. The anticipated additional use of this service cannot be expected to make up for
the losses caused by the price decrease.
The changes requested by the applicants would not only lead to a revenue loss, but would require
significant changes in accounting and systems programming. In the CivicNet model, revenues
pay for the costs of these service changes. There are no funds currently budgeted by the Clerk
for these expenditures.
The use of tax revenue might be appropriate if the administrative costs of providing walk-in
service could be substantially decreased by the use of online service. (Note: The use of the term
“walk-in” also includes taxpayers that request public information via telephone.) CivicNet staff

interviewed the Courts and Deputy Clerks about how much time they actually spent providing
this information to the public in person. CivicNet learned that the court staff is currently able to
adequately provide service to walk-in customers. The modest walk-in reductions predicted by
the marketing studies would not allow for a significant reduction in court staff.
Finally, changing the pricing method for enhanced access transactions would result in the need
for CivicNet to make programming and billing changes. The Committee felt that it is
inappropriate to ask CivicNet to expend the resources to make these changes in light of a
statewide case management system (JTAC) that will be implemented for court records in the
near future. There is uncertainty as to what impact this implementation will have on CivicNet
applications but it is likely that it will be necessary to change the current billing method. That
would result in a duplication of 2 substantive and significant programming changes in a short
period of time.
In summary, the Review Committee finds:
1. That the proposed change would significantly reduce revenue to the CivicNet project
without providing significant benefits to either the community through increased real use
of the system or to the custodial agency through a reduced demand for walk-in services.
2. That the reduced revenue from the proposed change would result in a reduction of the
valuable services the Clerk of the Courts receives from CivicNet including the
implementation and marketing of new applications and current systems improvements.
3. That the proposed change would require systems accounting and programming changes,
which, without increased revenue, have no identified source of funding.
4. That the implementation of a new statewide system may obviate any work done to
accommodate the proposed change and waste those efforts.
Therefore, the Review Committee recommends this request be denied at this time.

RESOLUTION #04-24
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY BOARD
Board Resolution to approve an Amendment to the Internet Services Agreement
between nFrame , Inc. and City of Indianapolis and Marion County.
WHEREAS, the Information Services Agency and nFrame entered into an agreement

with no additional increase in cost, and
WHEREAS, nFrame has pledged to provide the City/County these services at the Bestin-Class pricing available;
WHEREAS, nFrame has performed satisfactorily the services required under the
Original Agreement and the Information Services Agency requests additional bandwidth;
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, the Information Technology Board

PREMIS - Statement of Work (SOW): City of Indianapolis/Marion County

Organizational & Vendor Transition Assistance

2 Project Overview
2.1 Our Understanding
Current
Situation:

The city of Indianapolis/Marion County was the first large city to outsource nearly
all of its IT operations in 1995. Some of the original objectives of the contract
were to substantially lower costs, improve functionality and service, and provide
increased access to technology. Since 1995, public sector outsourcing has
matured significantly.
The City/County has since developed and posted an RFP, received and evaluated
responses from service providers, conducted a selection process, and signed an
outsourcing agreement with Northrop Grumman.
None of the original team that managed the transition to outsourcing in 1995 is
with the City/County in 2004. While the City/County ramps ups its staff to
prepare for the new outsourcing model, Premis Consulting is making an offer to
assist with the transition phase of this initiative.

2.2 Objectives and Benefits
Objectives:

The objective of this engagement is for Premis to assist the City/County with the
transition phase of its IT outsourcing initiative.
Premis Consulting Group will work in conjunction with the City/County team to
successfully and smoothly transition the IT service areas from the existing vendor
to Northrop Grumman.
Premis will facilitate and manage the transition efforts to ensure the Northrop
Grumman is provided with the correct and timely information and tools needs as
well as provide for and meet their contractual obligations to the City/County.

Benefits:

We believe that Premis Consulting Group is well-suited to assist the City/County
derive the best value for its technology investment as it moves into and through
the transition phase with Northrop Grumman.
1. Premis associates have first hand experience managing the critically
important transition phase of an outsourcing engagement from both the client
and vendor perspective.
2. Premis associates have been chief information officers of cities that have
selected and managed outsourcing contracts.
3. Premis associates have worked in outsourcing sales and service delivery
for major outsourcing vendors.
We are unique in that we have direct experience and understand every aspect of
selling and delivering outsourcing services to local government.
We are a neutral, unbiased organization. Premis Consulting Group does
not perform outsourcing delivery services nor does it hold or maintain
contracts with any hardware or software service providers.

2.3 The Premis Sourcing Methodology
Overview:
A Phased
Methodology

The Premis Sourcing Methodology is divided into three phases with multiple
modules and action steps within each. We have developed a “soup-to-nuts”
approach that provides value to organizations at any point along the sourcing
continuum -- from understanding whether it’s a viable option to outsource as part
of the Sourcing Strategy phase to improving the relationship with a current
vendor as part of the Governance phase.

Each module makes extensive use of tools we have developed to break down
complex issues: from ROI calculators to satisfaction surveys for IT operations.
We have a full list of templates for developing RFPs, service level agreement
“starter” kits, and price benchmarks to evaluate vendor responses.
On the following page we have provided a drill-down into the tasks associated
with the Outsourcing Implementation phase, specifically, the “Transition and
Implementation” module and the preparing ISA for the “Organizational Alignment”
module.
The Drilldown:
With A
Modular
Approach

There are four modules in the Outsourcing Implementation phase. A flowchart
describing the steps within each module follows.
1. Develop the RFP: Premis assists the client to design and draft the Request
for Proposal (RFP).

Benefit
Statement:

Premis provides the structure, tools and expertise from RFP development through
contract implementation. The modularity of the Premis phased approach enables
our clients to leverage the appropriate component(s) at any point in the sourcing
lifecycle to provide the most value.

Summary:

The value Premis brings is that we have sat at your side of the table, as well as
the vendor’s side, which gives us a unique perspective of what can be
accomplished and what the likely pitfalls are of a complex transition. We have
communication plans and methods that have been used in several transitions in
the public sector that help mitigate the thorny issues unique to local government.
That experience, the methods, and the tools we have created as we have worked
through this process personally are at the disposal of our clients.

3 Project Description
3.1 Scope of this Engagement
Description:

Premis Consulting Group will facilitate and manage the important Transition
period, approximately 90 days, from the existing vendor to the Northrop
Grumman. As per the City/County timeline, the contract implementation date
(i.e. The “go-live” date) is January 1st, 2005. Premis understands that all
transition signoffs must be completed by this date.
The inclusive approach Premis details below will ensure the following:
1. That the Transition requirements requested in the RFP by the City/County
are accounted for;
2. That the purposed transition approach provided by Northrop Grumman in its
response is followed;
3. And that the contractual transition obligations between the City/County and
Northrop Grumman are met to create a mutually beneficial start to a
successful outsourcing relationship.
4. That the City/County is organizationally prepared to manage the new
outsourcing structure.

Premis
Exclusives
During
Transition:

1. A customized transition Roadmap for monitoring progress, avoiding pitfalls
and ensuring a seamless transition between service providers.
2. A detailed communication plan that encompasses the ISA transformation and
the transition to Northrop Grumman and DAI for stakeholders of ISA.
3. Successful methods for soliciting early feedback from the customer base
which gives the City/County the information it needs to make decisions and
implement changes ASAP.
4. Techniques for integrating a service provider into the City/County culture.

3.2 Awareness & Orientation
Definition:

Before any of the City/County work begins for this project, Premis will conduct a
brief planning session to finalize and document our understanding of the project’s
priorities and expected outcomes by the City/County and Northrop Grumman.
During this planning session all project objectives, process, and procedures will be
reviewed to ensure consensus is gained by both the City/County and Premis. A
completed project plan is an outcome from this meeting.

and best practice management. Premis delivers a focused set of consulting services requiring the
participation of seasoned people who are experts in identifying and implementing distinctive solutions
for our clients. We do this through the delivery of qualified findings and recommendations based on
the analysis of our client’s people, processes and tools.

Our mission at Premis is to be an industry leader and topic authority for our clients, establishing
Premis as the principal source for advice in managing our client’s information technology business.

data—both quantitatively and qualitatively. Premis’ core service lines are as follows:

market price estimation models.
We are confident The Premis Process will help you achieve organizational excellence in less
time with more success.

7.4 Premis People
Premis Consulting Group was founded because we realized that while there were infinite sources for
technology strategy and management advice, there was a lack of practical, real-world experience and
tools in the consulting community when it came to doing the work. Our background as IT executives is
our most valuable asset, but our experiences as consultants, working with firms you most likely do
business with, give our clients insight into not only the newest ideas but also the tactics that consulting
firms use to sell, price and manage their services. This combination sets Premis apart.
Premis is not an outsourcer, nor do we develop or manufacture systems. While we can recommend
solutions and manage a procurement process, we do not endorse vendors.
THANK YOU for the opportunity to work with you!!!

delivery teams in outsourced solutions.
Prior to being a founding member of Premis Consulting Group, Joel held the
position of Managing Consultant and Program Management Practice Lead with
Compass America. Compass is a leading international performance improvement

Bio #2:

Beth Malloy is an expert in IT performance improvement and best practice
management.

Beth Malloy

Prior to the founding of Premis Consulting Group, she was Chief Information
Officer for the City of Chicago. Ms. Malloy was responsible for implementing a
turn-around strategy for city government and leading the City’s “Silicon Prairie”
economic development effort.
She spearheaded a citywide transformation project, resulting in streamlined
parking management processes, tax collection systems, and improved financial
management through the use of ERP. Revenue collections increased 35% as a
result of some of these projects. She created a web strategy, resulting in online
payment capability and GIS information on the city’s website. During her tenure,
Chicago won two consecutive “Best of the Web” awards from Government
Technology Magazine.
Ms. Malloy led the restructuring of the technology organization, successfully
outsourcing distributed IT, datacenter and application development services,
leading to the largest client satisfaction improvement the Gartner Group, a
technology research firm, has ever recorded. Under her leadership, Chicago
created the concept and implemented 311, the nation’s first municipal integrated
call center and work-order system. The goals of the project included not only
providing faster and better service to constituents, but also reducing the use of
the 911 line for non-emergency requests. In the first month of implementation,
calls to 911 dropped 25%, and service fulfillment times improved 20%. In the
four years since its inception, it has become the accepted standard across the
nation’s largest cities, including New York, Houston, Dallas, and Baltimore. In
2003, it won the prestigious Institute for Government Innovation Award at
Harvard University’s John F. Kennedy School of Government.
Ms. Malloy speaks on topics ranging from using e-government to the political
challenges of business improvement.
She has been a regular speaker at
Northwestern University’s Kellogg Graduate School of Management and the Illinois
Institute of Technology, as well as featured at the Gartner Group’s annual
Symposium. She has consulted and spoken with local governments and public
companies worldwide. Her work has been featured in Computerworld, Information
Week, and Government Technology magazines.
In 2000, Ms. Malloy was selected from a nationwide field of executives rated for
their leadership and management capabilities by Computerworld magazine and
featured as one of its “Premier 100 Technology Leaders”. She was named one of
Crain’s Chicago Business’ “Most Influential Technology Stars” in 1998. She is a
board member of the IT Resource Center, a non-profit company that provides
low-cost technology consulting to other non-profits. She founded and co-chaired
the Mayor’s Council of Technology Advisors, a public / private task force whose
charter includes providing broadband connectivity to every institution, business,
and home in Chicago.
After her work at the City, Ms. Malloy went on to serve as a Director at the
Gartner Group. Earlier in her career, she worked in executive sales and consulting
management at IBM. She has a degree in Computer Science and Math from

Governance Group - The Governance Group will consist of a representative sample of the major
departments within the city: Mayor’s Office, Public Works, Public Safety, Administration and Finance,
Community Investment, Parks and Information Technologies. This group will meet regularly to direct
the actions outlined in this plan and recommend policies, procedures and standards for all information
technology efforts. Additionally, this group will be responsible for prioritizing all information
technology projects based on the administration’s goals and efforts.
Best-of-Breed - Established industry-leading devices, software or systems, in which a vendor has
established a sizable market share due to superior technology or customer acceptance (such as
Microsoft Active Directory for directory services and Cisco networking infrastructure devices).
Mission Critical Systems - Systems that are essential for the City of South Bend to function effectively.
Public safety systems, such as police and fire dispatch and water works distribution, as well as critical
city services systems, such as the 311 line and telephone service, must be restored immediately in case
of disaster.
Ideal State - the optimum level of technology provided by December 31st, 2016, as dictated within this
document.
Information Technologies Service Management Catalog (ITSM) - A catalog of all technology services
offered by an IT department. ITSM Catalogs include the procedures for requesting services and list
department protocols, the service level agreement and any costs associated with the service. The
catalog is usually in the form of a piece of software but can also be published on a website/intranet or
a paper manual.
Service Level Agreement (SLA) – Documents that define the level of service and response times for
different service requests. For example, if a mission critical system is down, there may be a SLA that IT
will respond to the request in 15 minutes. A non-mission critical system may have an SLA of 2 hours to
respond. SLAs will transparently let employees know when their request will be processed and
resolved.
Good Government – to provide timely, effective and efficient government services to the Citizens of
South Bend; one of Mayor Pete Buttigieg’s tenants for providing the best services to citizens in the
most efficient and timely manner possible.

1- DEFINITIONS
Data Management – How the City of South Bend captures, stores, shares, disseminates, replicates and
reports the data collected. Prior to this document, the City has not focused on collecting and managing
data.
Best Practices – the best way to consistently and effectively execute a task. Often times, industries or
organizations develop their own best practices.
Change Management Procedure – A process to minimize service downtime by ensuring that requests
for changes are recorded and then evaluated, authorized, prioritized, planned, tested, implemented,
documented and reviewed in a controlled and consistent manner.
Open Data Platform – a publicly accessible portal that centralizes data collected by disparate city
departments. This allows departments to access and analyze data more effectively, generates datadriven solutions, increases transparency and allows private developers to develop innovative ways of
handling municipal problems.
Hardware – physical machines (computers, servers, printers, peripherals).
Software – programs that run on hardware (Microsoft Office).
Naviline ERP System/Platform – Short for Enterprise Resource Planning, ERP Systems use an
integrated suite of software modules that support the basic internal business processes of a company
or organization. It provides an integrated, real-time view of its core business processes.
SCADA – Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) is the centralized computer controlled
industrial control system that monitors and controls all water and wastewater processes. SCADA
systems often consist of Remote terminal units (RTUs), Programmable logic controllers (PLCs),
telemetry systems that connect RTUs and PLCs with the control center, a Human Machine Interface
(HMI) and Historian software which accumulates time-stamped data used to populate trends.
GIS – Geographic Information Systems (GIS) integrates hardware, software, and data for capturing,
managing, analyzing, and displaying all forms of geographically referenced information. GIS systems
allow users to view, understand, question, interpret, and visualize data in many ways that reveal
relationships, patterns, and trends in the form of maps, globes, reports, and charts. A GIS system helps
answer questions and solve problems by looking at data in a way that is quickly understood and easily
shared.

2 - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
2 - Executive Summary
THE NEED FOR A STRATEGIC PLAN
The Strategic Plan for the City of South Bend’s Information Technology Department aims to effectively
communicate the City’s technology direction, priorities and policies. As the city continues to improve, a
strategy for the development of technology will lessen duplicated efforts and improve efficiency.
Furthermore, this plan demonstrates the Information Technology Department’s ongoing effort to
implement strategies that further the goals of Mayor Pete Buttigieg’s administration.

PROCESS
A committee was formed and met several times in April and May of 2013. The committee consisted of
representatives from all major departments within the city government along with Mike Bieganski,
retired CTO for Bosch, and Dan Rousseve, Vice President of Technology at Teacher’s Credit Union.
These working sessions helped define the role of technology efforts within the city’s overall vision. This
document is largely the outcome of those discussions. As a result, this document will serve as a
blueprint for the Information Technology Department’s direction through December 31st, 2016.

TECHNOLOGY VISION
The Plan’s vision can be grouped into four categories: information technology services, strategic
partnerships, governmental systems integration and community engagement. For a visual graphic of
these four categories, refer to page 7.
1. Developing strong information technology services within the entire organization is critical to
support the business functions of the City of South Bend.
•

The establishment of governance will ensure technology efforts are prioritized and aligned
with the city’s business needs.

•

An emphasis on technology training for information technologies staff and the general
workforce is required. This investment will easily be repaid as technology is more fully utilized.

•

The development of formalized standards, procedures and policies will allow employees to
understand Information Technologies’ role within the city.

•

The establishment of a tactical path will enable the department to focus on prioritized items,
helping the city to realize the strategic target.

•

Provide mission critical systems effectively and securely.

Page 3

Final

2 - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
2. Strategic partnerships with vendors allow IT staff to focus on prioritized projects, while vendors and
partners deliver other necessary services.
•

Cloud-based Services (SaaS), such as Office 365, and Platform as a Service (PaaS), similar to the
City’s implementation of Cisco IP Telephony Services, are constantly becoming more attractive
and will play an expanding role in our strategy.

•

The establishment and maintenance of vendor relationships is needed as technology continues
to change at a rapid rate.

•

When a solution does not exist commercially, custom application development can help bridge
gaps to fill needs.

3. Interdepartmental and intergovernmental system integration is needed to provide more accessible
data.
•

Remove duplicated data collection.

•

Continue to develop our Open Data Platform to transparently share data across departmental
lines.

•

Share data symbiotically with St. Joseph County to eliminate duplication

4. Engage the community by looking for opportunities in the local school systems, universities, private
companies and nonprofit organizations. These community partnerships can help accomplish tasks
and deliver value-added services.

STRATEGY
The steps to realize the ideal state will be accomplished by implementing a formal Governance Group,
strengthening organizational aptitude, establishing policies, procedures and standards, developing an
effective data management strategy and centralizing resources. For a flow chart of data management,
refer to page 17.
•

Governance – A Governance Group will be created with the responsibility of aligning technology
resources with the city’s business values. The Governance Group will meet regularly to prioritize
projects, recommend policies and review progress of this plan. A Chief Information Officer (CIO)
position will be created to help guide the Governance Group and assist in the execution of this
plan.

Page 4

Final

2 - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

Strengthen Organizational aptitude – A concerted effort to build organizational aptitude with a
foundation of technical knowledge among all of South Bend’s employees must be undertaken.
Advanced technical training for the Information Technologies Department staff as well as a clear
understanding of software and basic technology tools (i.e., Microsoft Office, ArcGIS, etc.) by the
general workforce is an essential element of improving organizational aptitude.

•

Policies, Procedures and Standards – Formalizing Information Technologies’ policies, procedures
and standards are critical. This effort will cumulate with the creation of an Information
Technologies Service Management (ITSM) Catalog, which will allow users to identify available
information technology services and streamline the process of requesting those services. This
effort will provide Service Level Agreements for the delivery of service requests.

•

Data Management – An effective data management strategy is required to define how we capture,
store, publish, aggregate, analyze and consume data. Such a strategy will increase transparency
and accessibility for South Bend citizens. This strategy will be a holistic approach to all data
including public safety, SCADA and GIS.

•

Centralization of Resources – Many applications and hardware touch multiple departments, such
as database administration and design, networking infrastructure and backups. These activities
should be centralized to eliminate duplication and more efficiently utilize resources.

Page 5

Final

3 - VISION
3 - Vision
To build and maintain a technology platform that allows employees at all levels to quickly, proactively
and efficiently identify and resolve problems by using intelligent, data-driven decision-making
principles, process improvement and technology. The administration’s major platforms of good
government, making the basics easy and promoting local job growth will be the driving force behind
project prioritization and technology decision-making.

ADDRESS PROBLEMS EFFECTIVELY & IMPROVE RESPONSE TO CITIZENS
In the constant pursuit of more accurate and timely responses to citizens’ needs, technology can lead
the way. As South Bend strives to be the “smartest city in the Rustbelt,” the city must continue to
respond to current problems and proactively address looming challenges. Each decision requires
internal discourse on how it affects the community as well as South Bend’s continuing efforts to entice
investment.

PLANNING HORIZON
With the target date of December 31st, 2016, this document sets forth the plan to coincide with the
final budget of Mayor Pete Buttigieg’s first term. It is expected that a new plan will be created following
this Strategic Plan’s conclusion.

COURSE CORRECTIONS TO THE STRATEGIC PLAN
The Strategic Plan must remain flexible and in line with the administration’s goals. Any correction or
modification to the Strategic Plan will occur within the Governance group’s normal meetings. The
Governance group should review the progress made on this plan and make recommendations on
project prioritization and resource allocation yearly, if not more frequently.

TECHNOLOGY VISION
The Technology Vision for the City of South Bend can be grouped into four categories: information
technology services, strategic partnerships, governmental systems integration and community
engagement.

DEVELOP STRONG INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SERVICES
Developing strong Information Technology services within the entire organization is critical to support
the business functions of the City of South Bend.
Capacity
As the City’s use of technology continues to expand, network infrastructure and systems must have the
capacity to accommodate current systems as well as the flexibility and excess capacity to shoulder
future needs.
Reporting
Departments must be able to run reports and process other paperwork without the intervention of the
Information Technologies Department. Departmental ownership of simple processes, such as
reporting, will free up Information Technologies staff to accomplish more.
Transparent and Open Data
As the City continues to increase transparency and provide accessible information to the public, the
publishing of data will be done publicly as a default. Clearly, some sensitive data must be kept internal,

Page 7

Final

3 - VISION
but data collection must be done with the mindset of providing public information. This approach is
furthered by the development of South Bend’s Open Data Platform, which will serve as a central
location for both public and internal data.
The Open Data Platform will enable departments to access aggregated data, allowing better analysis of
problems and data-based solutions. Data will be removed from internal silos, which makes the data
widely accessible and eliminates duplicated, inefficient collections by disparate departments. The
platform will allow proactive decision-making based on concrete evidence. Furthermore, vendors and
private designers can easily access the data, opening the door for innovative solution-making by
outside actors.
Investing in Current Systems
As new technologies arise and the Information Technologies Department purchases new systems,
current systems must not be forgotten. Systems already in place require constant upkeep and
upgrades, and will fail to perform as expected without continued investment.
Centralization of Information Technology Resources
Currently, many disparate offices throughout the city have differing levels of Information Technology
functions, many of which are somewhat independent of the central Information Technologies
Department. At times, this creates duplicated efforts and wasted resources. Better collaboration is
needed and more control of operations must be allocated to central Information Technologies. All
major expenditures and IT decisions should be run through established governance procedures.
Data Management
To better collect, store, manage and analyze data, a data management strategy is needed. With a
centralized storage plan, single point of data entry and strong data architecture, the City of South Bend
could better capture and analyze data.
Build Organizational Aptitude
In order to build organizational aptitude and better utilize technology, The City of South Bend, as an
organization, must cultivate a culture that views technology as a tool, rather than an obstacle.
Technology has the power to improve processes, create data-based decision-making and improve
services to citizens. To do so, we must invest in human capital. After determining where skills are
lacking, training must not only be completed, but taken seriously. When training sessions are not
attended fully or done haphazardly, the IT department spends valuable resources answering questions
and troubleshooting. For employees to utilize these tools and not overuse the IT department, training

Page 8

Final

3 - VISION
is paramount. At the same time, the Information Technologies Department will continue to provide city
employees with the proper tools to do their jobs effectively.
Access to Systems
As technology continues to develop, access to information and data remotely will enable city
employees in the field to better do their jobs. From police officers accessing information at a traffic
stop to Code Enforcement geocoding the location of abandoned houses, greater access to systems will
increase efficiency. The Information Technologies Department must continue to implement innovative
technologies to make mobile access to data secure, intuitive and efficient.
Leverage Technology
Technology should improve the City of South Bend’s regular business efficiency, enabling employees to
do their jobs easier and more effectively. To do so, the city must leverage technology to fulfill basic
needs in the most efficient way. From investing in training to devising better protocols, greater levels of
efficiency are clearly obtainable. Lastly, the establishment of a tactical plan that prioritizes projects will
allow resources to tackle the most pressing challenges.

STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS
With current strategic partnerships, vendors offer needed services that cannot be provided efficiently
by core Information Technologies staff. These relationships are essential to the functioning of the
department and the city as a whole. Today, Cloud-based Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions, such as
Office 365 and Platform as a Service (PaaS), will play an expanded role in South Bend’s technology
functions. Custom application development by private developers will also play an essential role, often
bridging gaps and filling needs. Establishing new partnerships and maintaining current ones will allow
the city to adapt quickly to its constantly changing needs and technology’s new innovations.
External Partnerships and Community Engagement
The community should be seen as one of the city’s biggest resources. Members of our community have
the capacity to help solve a myriad of problems, and community engagement is the only way to utilize
them.
Many resources in our community remain untapped. Our community is full of innovative people, some
of whom are already using data to help the city solve problems and improve quality of life. With a set
of common goals and a focus on community outreach, these resources can be more fully utilized.
Notre Dame’s investment of $100M a year towards research can be leveraged to analyze some of South
Bend’s problems, such as dealing with vacant and abandoned homes, enticing businesses to invest in

Page 9

3 - VISION
South Bend and spurring economic growth. Many startups have already helped the city, such as
EmNet. With many colleges nearby, the expertise of students can also be leveraged through internship
programs. Joining with the South Bend Community School Corporation, the City could potentially
receive reduced prices on technology purchases as well.

SYSTEMS INTEGRATION AND CENTRALIZATION
Currently, many systems duplicate efforts and fail to share information. Interdepartmental sharing, as
well as sharing symbiotically with St. Joseph County, can provide data in a more timely and effective
manner. Some systems simply need to be integrated with others, while others require consolidation. In
the end, these efforts will reduce duplication and free up resources.

TECHNOLOGY AS THE SOLUTION
Technology has the capacity to fix problems, save the city money and create more effective
government. Locally, the use of EmNet to handle sewage flow has saved the city $100M alone. From
advanced technologies such as EmNet, to simpler technologies sold by vendors, South Bend should
continue to look for technological solutions.

3 - VISION
When it comes to mission critical systems, technology services will be delivered using best-in-breed
solutions. With continued investment in industry-accepted best-in-class hardware and software,
mission critical systems will be supported with a proficient staff and reliable infrastructure. Strategic
partnerships and innovative solution providers will also play a significant role, keeping South Bend on
the cutting edge of technology. Some strategic partners will even provide services as a commodity,
such as VoIP Telephony services. As recent history has shown with projects like CSOnet and enFocus,
partnerships often create innovative solutions to some of South Bend's most specific and troubling
problems. The utility these partnerships provide to the city cannot be understated.

Page 11

At the broadest level, the Strategic Plan can be grouped into 5 focus areas: governance; strengthening
our organizational aptitude; establishing policies, procedures and standards; data management; and
centralization.

GOVERNANCE
A Governance Group will be created to ensure that the Information Technology Department’s
resources and effort are allocated in a manner that furthers the city’s goals. This group will be
responsible for the implementation of this plan and any mid-course corrections. The Governance
Group will meet regularly to prioritize projects, recommend policies and standards, and review
progress of this plan.

STRENGTHEN ORGANIZATIONAL APTITUDE
A concerted effort to build a foundation of technical knowledge must be undertaken. Sadly, technical
knowledge is lacking throughout our organization. Without departmental ownership of systems and
technical proficiency, this plan cannot be realized. All departments, including the Information
Technologies Department, must increase training efforts and boost understanding of systems. Lastly, as
new technologies garner attention and resources, existing systems must be preserved through

Page 12

Final

4 – STRATEGY
continued investment. Outlined below are the three steps needed to increase city employee technical
understanding. A technology assessment of each employee and department should be completed to
benchmark current skills. This information will help prioritize and target areas needed for
improvement.

Improve Information
Techology Skills

Departmental Ownership

Investment in Existing
Systems

1. Both skills and staffing levels must be increased within the Information Technology Department to
support current and future development. More staff would enable the department to pursue more
developmental projects while continuing to maintain current technologies. Additional training
among staff, especially in Naviline will increase the IT department’s capacity to execute the
Strategic Plan.
2. Departmental ownership of software, processes and training is critical. Too often departments rely
on Information Technologies to troubleshoot, pulling staff away from important projects. To
increase the capacity of Information Technologies, departments must learn to thoroughly
document, manage and assess their processes. As new software packages are implemented or
technology processes are altered to increase the organizations capabilities and efficiency,
departments must attend these crucial training sessions.

Page 13

Final

4 – STRATEGY
3. A better understanding of current systems will add productivity as well. Unfortunately, many
systems have yet to be fully utilized. For example, Naviline, Laserfiche, eForms Software, Office 365
and Outlook require further training to increase productivity and efficiency.

POLICIES, PROCEDURES AND STANDARDS
The Information Technologies Department along with the Governance Group will recommend the
establishment of formal policies, procedures and standards that make processes repeatable and
efficient. Ensuring that policies, procedures and standards are maintained allows our organization to

Procedures
Creating effective procedures will establish best practices and repeatability. Documenting and
formalizing best practices should be done wherever possible to perpetuate accepted processes.
1. Establish an Information Technology Service Management (ITSM) Catalog, which identifies current
Information Technology Services. The catalog will explain the process of requesting services and
publicize service level agreements.
2. Develop a business continuity and disaster recovery procedure. Mission critical systems must be
identified and protected. In the event of a disaster, a plan must be in place to recover these
essential systems in a timely manner and restore services. Systems that are defined as non-mission
critical will also have an appropriate protection and recovery strategy.
3. Creation of a procedure for effective implementation of new systems. To enable systems to
cohesively become a part of the organization’s everyday processes, a procedure must be created.

Standards
With the approval of the Governance Group, the Information Technologies Department will maintain a
portfolio of standards to ensure systems co-exist and function correctly. Below is a sample list of
processes and technologies that require standards, which will be published at a later date. The
Governance Group reserves the right to amend this list at any time.
•

Database standards

DATA MANAGEMENT
As the city continues to pursue data-based solutions, a data management strategy is needed.

Data Entry

Analyze

Storage

Publish

Replicate

`

1. Effectively capturing data is the first step. Data that is not collected cannot be reported, so an
emphasis on complete data capture is crucial.
2. Once data is identified it must be stored. In order to store data efficiently and avoid duplication, a
storage strategy will be created.
3. With many systems that hold different yet related sets of data, replication is often necessary.
Replicating data into and out of disparate systems will create consistency among data sources
allowing for better analysis.
4. Publishing data in human and machine readable formats will allow city departments to share
frequently requested data. When made widely accessible and consumable, data will enable
vendors to build applications, departments to create innovative, data-based solutions and citizens
to access data. Increased transparency and interdepartmental sharing is an essential part of good,
accessible government.

Page 17

Final

4 – STRATEGY
5. Improved analysis of data will enable the city to pin point problems using concrete data. Better
analysis of data will help create better, data-driven solutions to pressing issues in South Bend.

CENTRALIZATION STRATEGY
Currently, many processes are duplicated by different departments, creating inefficiencies and wasted
resources. To eliminate these duplications, many functions must be centralized. After defining
responsibilities with service level agreements, departments will be able to better manage their
technologies and contact the appropriate group or department for assistance.

5 – Tactical Path
GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE
The Governance Committee will prioritize projects and recommend the creation of policies, procedures
and standards. With a focus on realizing the goals of this plan, the governance group will align
technology development with the goals of the administration.
Creation of Policies, Procedures and Standards
The creation, review and modification of policies, procedures and standards must be completed as
quickly as possible.
Portfolio Management
As soon as possible the Governance Group will convene a meeting to prioritize projects. All
departments with technology needs will be invited to this meeting. An independent and experienced
3rd party will moderate this discussion.

DEVELOP ORGANIZATIONAL APTITUDE
Employee understanding of technology as it relates to their job functions must be improved. This plan
cannot be realized without training and development across the entire organization, not just within the
Information Technology Department. To achieve the goals set forth in this plan, assessments will be
done to determine current skills and develop training plans.
Information Technologies Training
Within the Information Technologies Department, further training and skill development is constantly
needed. Currently, the department primarily needs a better understanding of the Naviline ERP System.
Creation of Departmental Technology Officers
In an effort to create departmental ownership and bolster organizational aptitude, each department
will be assigned a Technology Officer. Technology Officers will report to the Director of Information
Technologies. Examples of responsibilities include Tier 1 help desk support, on-board training, and
administration of employee training plans.

PROJECTS
The list of projects below is a representative example of projects that must be completed. Actual
identification of projects will be a shared responsibility for all departments including Information

5 – TACTICAL PATH
Technologies. To prevent biased prioritization, the City will bring in a third party arbiter with
technological knowledge to help assess the City’s priorities.
Open Data Initiative
The development on an Open Data Portal began in 2013 in an effort to provide data to Code for
America and IBM. After researching various means to provide accessible data, an open data platform
fully met the needs of the previously mentioned vendors and additionally provided greater
governmental transparency to citizens. The Open Data Platform allows the City to publish, consume
and analyze data like never before, even providing the capabilities to make visualizations, maps and
charts that allow for better analysis. With the platform in place, data can be shared publicly and
privately. The public can view and download information freely. Private developers can access data to
create new, innovative applications. At the same time, this project presents challenges in determining
what data must remain internal, ultimately requiring the creation of data collection and dissemination
protocols.
Upgrade or Replace Current ERP System
The current Naviline ERP System must be upgraded or replaced. The importance of this system as well
as the challenges of replacing it cannot be understated. The City of South Bend must fully commit to
this project. This project will require the most proficient staff from many key departments to be fully
immersed on this project for many months or years to help complete the replacement. Although
replacing the ERP system is a giant and risky endeavor, the outcome will provide additional capabilities
that the city desperately needs.
In order to replace the ERP system, a needs assessment must first be conducted to analyze which
system will more closely meet our current and future needs. At this juncture, the next ERP System
must offer more robust user reporting, mobile access, an SQL database backend, and a more intuitive
user interface. Information Technologies has included funding for the needs assessment in the 2014
proposed budget. Implementation of the new system would begin in early 2015 with a 2-4 year
implementation schedule depending on many factors including the vendor and product selected.
Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Plan
The creation of a Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Plan is needed to ensure mission critical
systems are protected at the highest reasonable level and that they can be restored as quickly as
possible in the event of a disaster. Mission critical systems must be identified. After combining many
essential technologies and locations to better protect them, the Information Technologies Department
will also develop a recovery plan that outlines processes to restore mission critical systems in the event
of a disaster.

5 – TACTICAL PATH
Establish Integration to St. Joseph County for critical data
The City of South Bend and St. Joseph County duplicate many processes, creating inefficiencies and
wasted resources. Establishing integration with St. Joseph County will help several departments be
more efficient. Ideally, the City of South Bend and St. Joseph County can integrate data collection and
freely share data. This will enable the City to access warrant information, property ownership records,
assessed valuations, zoning information, commissioner sales, tax sale information and other data.
PSAP Consolidation
Indiana law requires the consolidation of Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) centers to no more than
two locations per county by the end of 2014. Currently St. Joseph County, Mishawaka, Clay Fire and
South Bend all have PSAP locations, necessitating immediate consolidation.
Mobile Field Connectivity
Increasingly, departments need to access internal resources while in the field. The city must continue
to secure private data while making mobile access intuitive and efficient. Resolving this challenge will
increase efficiencies in all departments where considerable time is spent in the field.
Vacant and Abandoned Housing
Data collection of vacant and abandoned houses has yet to be formalized. Continuing to develop tools
and procedures for an effective Vacant and Abandoned Housing Strategy is necessary to meet the
Mayor’s goal of dealing with 1,000 houses in 1,000 days.
Land Management Cleanup, Policies and Procedures
The city currently lacks an effective land management strategy. A successful plan will create protocols
to geocode addresses, remove duplicate entries and generate more accurate information. Technology
also can be used to provide landowner information and create a field for the state tax ID. Additionally,
the amount of incorrect information can be reduced by ensuring an address validation feature is
enabled, and the number of personnel with access to enter data is controlled. An authoritative
database would allow the City to more easily share data between systems such as Naviline and GIS,
improving reporting and route optimization.
“Future-proof” the Networking Infrastructure
As the City constantly demands more of its network, the Information Technologies Department must
assess the current capacity of networking infrastructure and plan for the future. An examination of the
network must confirm the infrastructure has the capacity to fulfill current needs but is also robust and
flexible enough to deliver services in the future. Some of these steps include closing fiber loops for
redundancy, improving the backbone of the network to 10GB to assure available bandwidth, increasing

Page 21

Final

5 – TACTICAL PATH
internet connection speeds, reviewing the network hardware and infrastructure for capacity, and
completing a security audit. This examination will ensure the network and systems can withstand the
burden of current needs and remain flexible enough to accommodate tomorrow’s demands.
GIS Strategic Implementation
An enterprise level GIS Strategic Implementation will address many issues including governance,
database design, data integrity, data maintenance, software, training and infrastructure. Strategically
investing in our current GIS environment will give decision makers access to more complete data.

GOVERNANCE GROUP
The Governance Committee will meet regularly to discuss project prioritization, further develop
policies, procedures and standards, and alter the strategic plan when necessary. Prioritization of
projects will be determined by several factors including impact, efficiencies, return on investment, risk
mitigation, internal resources and the availability of outside expertise. The Governance Group bears
the responsibility of achieving the goals of the Strategic Plan.
The Governance Group will allocate resources and budgets for projects, and should require
performance measures to determine project success.
An initial project portfolio management discussion involving every department and moderated by a
disinterested third party should be held as soon as possible. In an effort to remove bias, the
disinterested third party will help prioritize the most important projects.

CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER (CIO)
The Chief Information Officer's (CIO) role is to provide vision and leadership for developing and
implementing information technology initiatives. Under the framework of the Governance Group, the
Chief Information Officer directs the planning and implementation of enterprise IT systems in support

Appendix C – Potential Project Descriptions
Below is a brief description of potential projects mentioned on page 23. The Governance Group will
determine the actual projects and prioritization.

OPEN DATA PORTAL
In 2013 the City of South Bend became the first city in the state of Indiana to create and Open Data
Portal. This portal is a publicly accessible portal that centralizes data collected by disparate city
departments. This allows departments to access and analyze data more effectively, generates datadriven solutions, increases transparency and can even allow private developers to develop innovative
ways of handling municipal problems.

PSAP CONSOLIDATION
Indiana law requires the consolidation of Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) centers to no more than
two locations per county by the end of 2014. Currently St. Joseph County, Mishawaka, Clay Fire and
South Bend all have PSAP locations, necessitating immediate consolidation.

ERP REPLACEMENT
The current Naviline ERP System must be upgraded or replaced. The importance of this system as well
as the challenges of replacing it cannot be understated. The City of South Bend must fully commit to
this project. This project will require the most proficient staff from many key departments to be fully
immersed on this project for many months or years to help complete the replacement. Although
replacing the ERP system is a giant and risky endeavor, the outcome will provide additional capabilities
that the city desperately needs.
In order to replace the ERP system, a needs assessment must first be conducted to analyze which
system will more closely meet our current and future needs. At this juncture, the next ERP System
must offer more robust user reporting, mobile access, an SQL database backend, and a more intuitive
user interface. Information Technologies has included funding for the needs assessment in the 2014

Department will also develop a recovery plan that outlines processes to restore mission critical systems
in the event of a disaster.

NETWORK ASSESSMENT
As the City constantly demands more of its network, the Information Technologies Department must
assess the current capacity of networking infrastructure and plan for the future. An examination of the
network must confirm that the current infrastructure has the capacity to fulfill current needs but is also
robust and flexible enough to deliver services in the future. Some of these steps include closing fiber
loops for redundancy, improving the backbone of the network to 10GB to assure available bandwidth,
increasing internet connection speeds, reviewing the network hardware and infrastructure for capacity,
and completing a security audit. This examination will ensure our network and systems can withstand
the burden of our current needs and remain flexible enough to accommodate tomorrow’s demands.

GIS STRATEGIC IMPLEMENTATION
An enterprise level GIS Strategic Implementation will address many issues including governance,
database design, data integrity, data maintenance, software, training and infrastructure. Strategically
investing in our current GIS environment will give decision makers access to more complete data.

BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE SOFTWARE
Business intelligence tools are designed to retrieve, analyze and report data for business intelligence.
An enterprise level tool of this nature will help decisions within the City of South Bend become more
based upon a data-driven decision model.

INTEGRATION POINTS WITH ST. JOSEPH COUNTY
The City of South Bend and St. Joseph County duplicate many processes, creating inefficiencies and
wasted resources. Establishing integrated systems with St. Joseph County will help several departments
be more efficient. Ideally, the City of South Bend and St. Joseph County can integrate data collection
and freely share data. This will enable the City to access warrant information, property ownership

records, assessed valuations, zoning information, commissioner sales, tax sale information and other
data.

MOBILE FIELD CONNECTIVITY
Increasingly, departments need to access internal resources while in the field. As mobile access is
created, the city must continue to secure private data while making access intuitive and efficient.
Resolving this challenge will increase efficiencies in all departments where considerable time is spent in
the field.

Mr. Rodman moved to approve the January 24, 2006 minutes. The motion was seconded and carried
unanimously.
Approval of the February 1, 2006 Minutes
Mr. Ricketts moved to approve the February 1, 2006 minutes. The motion was seconded by Mr.
Rodman and carried unanimously.
ISA Update
Microsoft Migration
Ms. Patel presented the Microsoft migration update. ISA recently completed vendor presentations by
the two top scored vendors. ISA has reviewed NG’s Rough Order Magnitude (ROM) estimate for the
migration. ISA has identified issues and concerns with the ROM. The proposal from NG is critical in
evaluating the total cost for this project.
Asset Inventory
Ms. Patel stated that the asset inventory provided by NG has been reviewed. ISA recommended that
NG replace the current asset inventory tool, LEX, with a more robust tool that captures assets
attached to our network. Altiris was selected because it has the ability to perform patch management,

Meeting Minutes
application deployment and Altiris has an asset management suite. NG will not be assessed a
penalty at this time because they have not missed the SLR two times in a row.
IMACs
Ms. Patel explained to the Board that the NG contract did not provide a definition for IMAC. A
mutually agreed upon description will be incorporated into the contract as an amendment at the March
28, 2006, IT Board Meeting. Based on projections, NG will finish out the year with 7,000 IMACs.
ISA and NG will be looking at how to address the unused IMACs.
Avaya Mobility Suite
Avaya conducted a demonstration for various customers to showcase mobile solutions. The most
promising option includes the ability to extend desk calls to your cellular provider and maintains the
integrity of the call. This will improve productivity for many customers that are mobile and this may
eliminate the need for a desk phone. When the enterprise moves to Microsoft exchange this will allow
our customers to interface voicemail with email. ISA will have to upgrade the current voicemail system
in order for this option to be available to our clients.
Judge Young commented that the Avaya Mobility Suite is the wave of future. In the courts alone,
substantial money will be saved and the enterprise could reduce the need for desk phones. The
courts would like to see staff out in the field and not at their desk.
Judge Young asked if the migration delay is due to concerns with the contract, the scope of work, or
the difference in contract interpretation. Ms. Patel responded it was the difference in contract
interpretation. Judge Young asked if the difference is going to hold up selecting a provider and if so
will the delay result in a penalty for NG. Ms. Patel stated it is critical. Ms. Patel stated that currently
the contract does not include SLRs that have credits associted with projects.
Judge Young asked how important the customer satisfaction survey SLR is. NG is not being given
the tool needed to receive 100% participation. If it is determined by the Board to not be important
then they should not be penalized and the lesser response should be accepted. Ms. Enders stated
that NG has the tools but mandating participation would result in a negative connotation and
dissatisfaction with ISA and the IT Board. Ms. Enders stated that she preferred a softer incentive.
Ms. Enders continued that she thought the issue was not if NG had performed the survey or not but
rather that the response results were not satisfactory. Ms. Patel clarified that the SLR required a six
month timeframe and one month was included.
Judge Young stated that the enterprise has a number of SLRs in which penalties are attached. He
continued to ask what about SLRs with no penalty, no incentive, are they so important it constitutes
material breach of the contract if they are not met and the contract should be terminated. Mr. Clifford
suggested the Board members discuss the theory of what was set up as service level requirements,
which SLRs have penalties attached, and what the level of service is expected as part of the contract.
Mr. Clifford recommended that Premis Consulting, ISA staff and Board members be included in the
meeting.
Mr. Rodman stated that he has contacted the Helpdesk in the last 30 days and has been very
satisfied with the assistance and response received but in looking at the numbers (page 6) the

Information Services Agency – Document: ISA-ITBD Meeting Minutes

Page 2 of 6

Information Technology Board
Meeting Minutes
percentage has dropped from over 94 to 90. The 90 percent range is getting close to falling below
the SLR and the call abandon rate has gone up in the past 30-days.
Financial Report
Ms. Dillon-Macy presented the ISA Financial Report. First Ms. Dillon-Macy reported on the budget
comparison of January 2005 versus January 2006. Ms. Dillon-Macy stated ISA has collected 1.9
million dollars of 6.6 percent of ISA’s projected revenue for YTD January 2006, which includes
payments received from the 4th quarter 2005 billings. The projected revenue does not include the 2
million that will be collected for the UASI grant. The third section covers January 2005 versus
January 2006 Contract Comparison. Based on the January charge for SA3 Manager and DBAs, the
total contract amount will increase by $136K.
Judge Young stated that personnel and fringes monthly total should be under 10% and asked if there
were pay outs in the month of January. Ms. Dillon-Macy replied that there were a couple ‘buy outs’ in
January. For clarification Mr. Clifford asked if ‘buy-out’ refers to people that left ISA and had to be
paid out vacation and requested ISA contact the Office of Finance and Management for wage control
concerns.
NG Update
Mr. Clancy presented the NG update.
SP2
Mr. Campbell updated the Board on SP2 progress. Mr. Campbell stated progress is being made. NG
has increased the number of machines that are SP2 compliant. Judge Young questioned that SP2
appears to be moving forward but with the Microsoft migration necessitating the SP2 roll-out there is
redundancy. Judge Young asked if the SP2 roll-out efforts should be diverted for the Microsoft
Migration vendor to handle. Ms. Patel responded that ISA/NG are looking at Altiris which will utilize
those resources elsewhere. Judge Young suggested taking the SP2 roll-out away from NG and relying
on the migration vendor with the understanding there will be some delay.
Mr. Clancy stated that when NG is working directly for a customer on an install, SP2 is installed at that
time. There are a number of machines that need replaced. Judge Young commented that NG is not
technically performing an independent SP2 roll-out but rather moving forward by installing SP2 as
they are hitting service calls.
Mr. Miller stated that all the applications are being evaluated for compliancy. ISA and NG are
considering different scenarios for deployment.
IMACs
Judge Young commented on the 9,900 IMACs in the NG contract. The enterprise did not come close
to using all the IMACs last year and it does not look like the enterprise will come close to hitting the
total this year. Judge Young expressed concern with the intent per the contract to cover mass rollouts but agencies having to pay as roll-outs occur.

Information Services Agency – Document: ISA-ITBD Meeting Minutes

Page 3 of 6

Information Technology Board
Meeting Minutes
Mr. Clancy stated that on page 2 of the NG report a definition is provided for IMACS in a way that NG
has not been counting them in the past. Ms. Enders commented she had concerns with the IMAC
definition. Dr. Inui asked if the IMACs are rooted in time and is that where the units came from. Dr.
Inui continued that many industries use standards that are directly related to personnel time. If that is
where the industry standard is then that makes sense. Mr. Ricketts asked if in the beginning of the
contract PC installs were one IMAC or three. Mr. Ortell responded that IMACs were not counted at all
until December and since that time they were counted as three. Mr. Clifford asked if there are sufficient
IMACs budgeted in the contract. Ms. Patel responded that there were. Major Meadows asked if
IMACS were counting that way then why are agencies being charged. Ms. Patel responded those
decisions were made earlier to charge the customers. Refresh is part of scope and the only
cost associated is for hardware, but still counts towards IMAC numbers.
CivicNet Report
Mr. Soliman presented the CivicNet Report and stated that CivicNet made extensive changes to the
Animal Care and Control Division Online Donation service, which are scheduled to be deployed in late
January. CivicNet reported an increase of 5,000 transactions per month which is an increase of 18%
over January of last year. The rest of the CivicNet report stands as submitted in the IT Board Packet.
Mr. Soliman stated that the biggest growth in on-line transactions were in Justis 1 and Justis 2 of court
records.
Maintenance Renewal GIS Maintenance
Mr. Carufel presented the annual maintenance renewal for GIS. Mr. Carufel explained that in the
90’s the software required on a user’s desk was cumbersome to use and required tremendous
training effort. With advances in the web-mapping technology the intranet data viewer allows lower
level tech-users to use the web-mapping tool.
Ms. Ender asked if 2002 were the point in which there was a move to better technology. Mr. Carufel
stated that there was not an actual move in 2002. The technology was paid for but it would not
continue to be developed and a few people still use the older products.
Dr. Inui asked if the townships have their own GIS applications as a stand alone. Mr. Carufel stated
that the townships maintain their own parcel lines but use the same background data. Judge Young
clarified that with the maintenance agreement the enterprise receives the upgrades and support for 25
or 30 programs. Judge Young asked if a check has been made with users to see that they are
actually using these programs. Mr. Carufel stated that the software is licensed from a central
repository and all are being used; however, the agency does not necessarily know who is using them.
Resolution 06-03 Renew Maintenance Agreement for GIS Software Support
Judge Young moved to approve Resolution 06-03. Ms. Enders seconded resolution and it passed
unanimously.
Resolution 06-04 to Purchase Justis.net Project Production Phase Equipment
Ms. Patel stated production has been moving forward and the financing has already been approved.

Information Services Agency – Document: ISA-ITBD Meeting Minutes

Meeting Minutes
Dr. Inui asked if there have been any significant problems. Ms. Patel responded that there have not.
Ms. Enders moved to approve Resolution 06-04. Judge Young seconded motion and it passed
unanimously.
Resolution 06-05 to approve Services Contract with Premis Consulting Group
Mr. Buchanan presented the Premis Statement of Work
Ms. Enders requested that the Board is not a client and the contract should read ISA leadership. Ms.
Enders did not anticipate Premis Consulting providing any management assistance to the Board. Mr.
Clifford stated the language in the contract was per his request. Mr. Clifford would like for the Board
to participate in a retreat with the assistance of Premise Consulting. Premis Consulting helped
develop the RFP and negotiate the contract. Mr. Clifford stated that he could like them involved.
Ms. Enders asked for clarification regarding the assitance Premis would be providing for the board
retreat. Ms. Enders stated that in the material received the statement of work needs a clearly stated
scope. Ms. Enders requested the statement of work be more specific and requested solution
development is included. Ms. Enders asked for clarification under section 5.1 City County involvement
’form a task force key managers stating ½ a week is required is that 4 hours per week per project or 4
hours per week in total. Ms. Malloy replied that the intent is for 4 hours per project. Ms. Enders
requested that all three be put into one statement of work and requested those changes be incorporated
into the agreement.
Mr. Inui requested details on the retreat. Mr. Clifford stated that he would like to bring the board
together to discuss how ISA is designed to operate under the new contract with NG, to put in place
how the agency was redesigned to fit together with the RFP, and to hear back from the firm that
helped design the organization on how ISA/NG should be working. Mr. Clifford stated he would like to
identify where ISA and NG may better focus efforts in going forward. Dr. Inui commented that the
interaction with the Board, ISA and the major contractors sounds useful.
Ms. Enders stated that it is important for the Board to see the deliverable that will result from these
projects. It sounds like this is what is desired to achieve rather than what will be achieved. Ms.
Enders stated that it is important that specific definable deliverables be in that document, more clearly
stated deliverables.
Judge Young commented that Ms. Patel in her vision identified three agencies that were going to
contract with the same vendor. In consolidating, the vendor was able to provide a better rate. Ms.
Patel and Premis Consulting should be commended.
Ms. Enders stated that in order to move forward in she needs definable deliverables and details so
that a person that knows nothing about IT is able to understand what work is to be accomplished.
Mr. Clifford suggested Ms. Malloy take comments of board members in consideration and put together
a deliverable schedule that is more specific of the work that is going forward.
Motion to approve as amended. Seconded and carried unanimously.
Resolution 06-06 to Proceed with Microsoft Enterprise Enrollment
Information Services Agency – Document: ISA-ITBD Meeting Minutes

Page 5 of 6

Information Technology Board
Meeting Minutes
Mr. Buchanan presented the Microsoft Enterprise Enrollment.
Dr. Inui asked who is responsible for fixing incapability or changes in the operating characteristics
post migration with SP2. Ms. Patel stated that is addressed as part of the SA3 contract. Ms. Patel
stated that 500 PCs have been identified with potential compatibility issues; however, ISA is
comfortable that the number is close.
Dr. Inui asked what was involved in ‘home use’. Mr. Buchanan stated that the employees will be able
to benefit from the same licenses at home as at work. Mr. Rindler explained that under the enterprise
agreement every employee will be able to run office professional at home. Dr. Inui stated his concern
about taking information developed at work home, and in so doing compromising its security and
possibly transmitting viruses to the City/County. ISA should give thought to developing policies
regarding what data employees are permitted to transfer between home and work.
Mr. Clifford recommended that ISA set a standard very quickly and requested that Ms. Patel report
back.
Judge Young moved to approve Resoltuion 06-06 . The motion was seconded and passed
unanimously.
Property Tax System Update
Mr. Pavey presented the update on the Property System and stated that the report stands as
submitted. Mr. Ricketts commented that the process has been long and tedious. The goal has been
to identify a satisfactory solution for everyone. Currently, there are two platforms or systems in which
the needs are a little different. The committee is still continuing to discuss one property system that
will unite the two applications. Mr. Ricketts continued that the system needs to be up and running to
meet the treasurers trending. The process to get the standards together was lengthy. Mr. Clifford
asked if state-wide the delay is preferred. Mr. Ricketts responded that there are as many for the delay
as against. Mr. Clifford stated that with House Bill 1001 more attention is being focused on what can
and cannot be met. Mr Ricketts stated that through the years there have always been standards in
reporting but never penalties.
State Wide Voter Registration
Mr. Pavey updated the Board on the SVRS initiative and stated that the ISA/Quest helpdesk issue has
been resolved. Marion County remains very concerned with the overall performance, reliability and
responsiveness. A process for a back-up system has been authorized. Mr. Pavey stated that ISA
continues to be involved with the related committees and project sponsors. At this time the electronic
signatures are not available from the BMV.
Mr. Clifford requested the IT Board meet as early as next week to appoint a CIO and consider a
recommendation for the vendor for the Microsoft migration. .
The meeting adjourned at 11:13.
The next IT Board meeting will be March 9, 2006.

Microsoft Migration
Ms. Patel reported that negotiations are on-going with Unisys Corporation and should be finalized for the March
28, 2006 IT Board Meeting. Ms. Patel stated that a proposal has been received from NG.
Mr. Clifford asked if the contract was ready to be finalized. Ms. Patel replied that it was not. Judge Young
clarified that initially a portion of the contract was to come before the Board for approval; however, it is in the
best interest at this time to consider the whole contract. Judge Young stated that NG is going forward on SP2
but the Microsoft Migration will bring the enterprise to SP2, a duplication of effort. Judge Young suggested NG
not go forward with the mass implementation of SP2 and use resources elsewhere. Ms. Patel stated the SP2
installation needs to be discussed. Judge Young made a motion to table the Microsoft Migration contract. The
motion was seconded by Major Meadows and carried unanimously.
Dr. Inui stated that if the installations that are on-going with individual workstations turn up incompatibilities. NG
should be urged to go forward. Ms. Patel stated that will continue.
The March 9, 1006 IT Board Meeting adjourned at 9:07.

Mr. Clifford stated that attached to the agenda is resolution 06-06. Mr. Clifford asked for discussion or
comments.
Ms. Sadler moved to approve Resolution 06-07 Mr. Rodman seconded the motion. The motion passed
unanimously
Ms. Patel offered thanks to the Board for the nomination, their confidence and support. Ms. Patel stated that
she has watched, worked and lead ISA through challenging times with many great successes and lessons
learned. The first goal is to organize and formalize strategic initiatives to present to the Board. Ms. Patel stated
that will give direction and focus to ISA that is now lacking. Second, Ms. Patel stated that ISA will focus on
Standards and Policies that will go before the board for consideration and approval. Ms. Patel continued that
the IT Team will review and approve the standards before they are brought before the IT Board. Some of the
initiatives include Acceptable Use Policy, Bandwidth, Security, E-mail policy and retention which will be critical
with the Microsoft migration. Another short term goal is to hire a Chief Technology Officer that can assist with
standards and has a strong technical background to compliment Ms. Patel’s business skills. In the short term
Ms. Patel suggested relying on a core group of people for technical advice while the position is vacant. Ms.
Patel emphasized that ISA is a customer service agency with over 52 departments to support. Good
communication and building strong relationships with our customers is important to our success. Currently, ISA
participates in monthly IT Team meetings, customer workshop groups, and the Criminal and Juvenile Justice
Technology Committee. Also the BRMs are critical in building customer relationships. Ms. Patel stated that ISA
is has talented and dedicated employees that she looks forward to continuing to work with and our ISA partners.
Mr. Clifford offered congratulations and stated that the next IT Board meeting will be March 28, 2006. Ms. Patel
stated the contract with Unisys will be on the agenda.
The meeting adjourned at 9:07.

ISA Report: New Format
This month several changes have been made to the ISA Report. This month’s report is
organized into 3 major sections: major projects, day-to-day operations performance, and
supporting detail. The NG operations report has been included as part of the regular ISA
Operations report.
Projects are business initiatives or major technology implementations (i.e. Microsoft
Migration) that have a beginning and an end. Projects are described in terms of what phase
is being performed: Project Definition, Feasibility, Requirements, Selection/Contracting,
Development, Testing and Implementation. Listed are activities planned for this period,
accomplishments since last month, and planned activities for the next period. Any risks that
have been identified and related mitigation tactics are listed, as well as an overall status,
green, yellow, or red.
The Operations section describes day-to-day activities and current status updates. It
includes NG performance, application, web and GIS support. The detailed SLR report is
found at the end of the ISA Report section.

Unisys has been selected by the evaluation team. Unisys was highly

Unisys references were very positive about their experience. The Board
approved starting final negotiations with Unisys. We expect a final Scope of
Work from Unisys by March 17. Our current plan is to have the Microsoft
Migration contract ready for Board approval March 28. This will delay the
commencement of work by 2 weeks to April 15th.
On March 7th, NG submitted a new rough-order-of-magnitude proposal for the
migration. We are reviewing it and are documenting our questions and
concerns. NG does not expect to finalize a scope of work until after the
assessment phase of the Unisys project. Unisys will be using automation tools
that it believes will require about 7000 fewer NG assistance hours than
estimated by other bidders.

Altiris
The time schedule is very tight to get this tool installed and begin application
builds that are needed for the Microsoft Migration. If Altiris is not up and
running by mid April it will delay the Microsoft Migration until it is up and ready
to go. We could potentially incur additional costs from Unisys to configure
Altiris.
ISA is reviewing the amendment, which was delivered to ISA on March 17,
2006, to replace Zen Works with Altiris. We will present the amendment to the
board for approval in April 06. NG knows of the priority that is placed on this.
NG staff has been trained. NG has brought in an Altiris expert to assist with
the deployment.
Novell Licensing
Our Novell license agreement ends in June. We do not plan on renewing the
license. We are creating a plan to evaluate the applications that will likely not
be able to be moved off of Novell within one year. A final determination will not
made until after the assessment phase of the Microsoft Migration project.

Install new servers. Connect both sites to SONET ring, enabling Disaster
Recovery (DR).
This project consists of upgrading the core phone servers. Enterprise
Survivability Servers (ESS) were installed at our DR site. The ESS servers
are connected to the main core network via the SONET ring and are
successfully passing traffic back and forth. We have replaced 21 remote
telephone servers with media gateway cabinets. This will allow for complete
redundancy in the event the core servers at the CCB are not functional.
None

Planned for next period

We have 9 sites left to convert to media gateway servers. These upgrades
should be complete by March 18th. The rest of our IP network was already in
place. After the remote sites are complete, we will modify a carrier cabinet
for dual service which will allow the back-up site to run the telephone service
in the CCB if the core is down. This should be complete by month end.
Once all sites are completed, we will evaluate the Primary Rate Interface’s
(PRI) T-1s that bring dial tone to the voice network. These PRIs connect the
CCB network to the outside world. The evaluation will determine how many
PRI’s need to be moved to the DR site. When the project is complete, we
will schedule a series of DR tests.

From the ISA technology viewpoint, we have had several successes such as
testing the Mayors Action Center’s ability to use the Voter Registration PCs
on Election Day. The Polling Place Locator is in final test mode.
The overall status of this project is green because of the preparation and
readiness of Marion County; however, Voter Registration users remain very
concerned about the overall performance and reliability of First Tuesday due
to the time to enter data, downtime and responsiveness.
Finish revisions to Memo of Understanding (MOU). Continue to support

project IMAC’s for February totals 1076.
Symantec Anti Virus
New version deployment will be fully implemented throughout the enterprise by end of March 2006.
Internet Service Provider (ISP)/Bandwidth Upgrade
Installation of new and backup ISP connections is scheduled for April 6. We will then require a few

A Microsoft CMS patch crashed the CMS application. The production servers had to be restored from
tape during the regular business day. To get our websites up and running ASAP, the development
server was temporarily installed in production for the duration of the restore process for the production
servers.
Proxy Server Outages
The Proxy Servers continue to have problems. Patches from Novell have fixed some problems and
caused other problems. We hope to have both the Proxy Servers replaced through the UASI Grant
and replace the current web filtering tool.

Disaster Recovery
On March 4, 2006 Northrop Grumman began performing a Disaster Recovery exercise utilizing our
SunGard hot site in Wood Dale, Illinois, the SunGard hot site in Carlstadt, New Jersey and the
SunGard cold site on Kentucky Avenue in Indianapolis. During this 48 hour test window various
hardware components of the City/County computing environment were exercised.
The three main goals of this test were: establish connectivity between the three facilities ensuring
access to the data being restored in New Jersey and Illinois, validate the updated backup
methodologies put into production in the fourth quarter of 2005 and have City/County customers view
the restored data. In addition to these process related goals, we augmented this test team with
various members of the NG team to facilitate cross training in the event of a true disaster.
Using the new tape methodologies and updated vendor hardware we were successfully able to
restore data for the Marion County Sheriff Department VAX system, an Oracle database server,
several Novell cluster volumes, home directories for the financial customers, several GroupWise post
offices and an eDirectory sever.
Overall the test went very well and we have received positive feed back from those who were involved
in the test. Several of the goals were accomplished within our targeted time frame, while others
presented a challenge for the recovery team. The results of this test are being compiled and when
completed NG will provide a thorough analysis and recommendations to improve current processes.
DPW Traffic Application
The DPW Traffic Application has been installed and is in production. The project started initially in
October of 2005. NG delivered the scope document on March 17, 2006, still pending Customer and
ISA approval. This application houses the traffic signal software that maintains the downtown
networked signals.
Police Department Refresh
The NG IMAC Team has completed all phases of the IPD Workstation Refresh Project and the project
is now completed.
Customer Satisfaction
The NG/ISA Help Desk sent out 4359 Customer Satisfaction Surveys and received 30 responses or
6.8%. The results show that 97% of the respondents are satisfied with the service that they are
receiving from the Help Desk. The results stated last month were obtained through manually sending
out emails to individuals. After the success of this survey tool in January, we have moved the survey
tool into production on February 20th and incorporated it into the automated Siebel Survey. We
expect to see consistent response to this survey tool.

Enhanced Access

ISA has collected $3 Million dollars or 11% of our projected revenue for YTD February 2006, which includes payments
th
received for the 4 quarter 2005 billings. Quarterly reports have been sent to the Controller’s and Auditor’s Office by
Department or Agency.
The revenue for the County’s December chargeback has historically been posted in the following year’s revenue. For the
December 2005 chargeback, the revenue was posted in FAMIS as 2005 revenue. Therefore, the County’s revenue
percentage will be lower than the expected percent each month.

February at a Glance
For a short month, February was full of activity for CivicNet.
Charters were finalized for two new projects and a large
application change request was pushed to test for the Division of
Compliance. Although CivicNet usage activity was down from
January, transaction totals were 10% above February 2005.
CivicNet finalized the charter for the Custodial Agency Online
Waiver Request Project. This project will ensure that waiver
requests received by the EARC and custodial agencies meet
initial qualifying criteria. CivicNet will present the charter to the
EARC during the next committee meeting.
CivicNet presented MCSD with the first prototype for the
Marion County Jail Commissary Deposit Project. The MCSD
submitted prototype changes and will work with the CivicNet
Marketing Team to determine a marketing plan for the new
commissary deposit option.
In early February, CivicNet and the Purchasing Division began
researching the addition of free county bid packages to the
current Bid Download Application. The enhancement to include
county bids would save in mailing and printing costs. Since the
bids are free-of-charge, handled on a time-and-materials basis if
agreement if the Purchasing Division decides to move forward
with the project.
CivicNet and the Division of Compliance began testing the
validation changes for the Division of Compliance in midFebruary. The changes involve the license validation of license
holders who enter the permit application to be checked against
license status within the Web Licensing system. CivicNet also
met with the Division of Compliance and ISA to discuss the
upcoming Tidemark Database upgrade. CivicNet will work
closely with both ISA and DOC to ensure no CivicNet services
are interrupted for web permit and license applicants.
In early February, CivicNet and ISA began planning the merger
of CivicNet applications with the Indygov Website. Both ISA
and CivicNet Web developers and designers met to discuss the
information that will be transferred over to the Indygov website
and issues that might affect the merger.

The meeting was called to order at 9:30 a.m.
Minutes
A motion was made to approve the June 21, 2005 IT Board minutes. The motion was seconded and passed
unanimously.
Information Services Agency (ISA) Report
Mr. Banning requested the ISA Report be accepted as submitted. As the new CIO, he discussed his preliminary
observations of challenges with communication within ISA, between ISA and Northrup Grumman (NG), and
within NG. Mr. Banning stressed in his interview with the IT Board his effort to improve communication. The
number one reason large projects fail is due to lack of communication. He believes the NG staff turnovers,
specifically at the top level, have contributed to communication problems. In the prior contract (SCT/ACS),
project management and business consulting staff functions were under the contractor. With the current
contract those positions are within ISA, and this created a learning curve for ISA. The users have been
accustomed to having the contractor perform those functions. The NG contract has significant well documented
service level requirements (SLRs) to meet as well as milestones. He commented that it is quite a task for ISA,
especially with the size of the transition, to manage over 125 SLRs and the many milestone documents due.
Mr. Banning presented a slide discussing the compliance advances and challenges that he has seen during his
four week tenure:
Compliance Advances
Good faith effort to provide deliverables
More NG staff added with plans to add more by end of July
Server consolidation plan delivered
Improvements in Prosecutor’s Office desktop support
HP Openview
Disaster Recovery

Information Services Agency – Document: ISA-ITBD Meeting Minutes

Information Technology Board
Meeting Minutes
Challenges
Compliance is labor intensive
Siebel Help Desk Software
Communications Plan
Image Management
User-Based security requests
Desktop Support
SLRs and Milestones.
In general, too much time is spent on both the ISA and NG side working on compliance reporting. The Siebel
software continues to present challenges, and contributes to the excessive amount of time spent on reporting,
although improvements have been made and more are coming. The Communications plan is a milestone for
NG, and a good plan is key to any outsourcing projects such as this one.
Service Level Requirements (SLR) top three deliverables and challenges were presented:
Top Three Deliverables
Mainframe Production Systems 100% Availability
Production Intel critical applications 99.9% Availability
First call Resolution 81.7%
Top Three Challenges
User ID Privilege Changes within 2 business hours 7.38%
Emergency Disable User Account 40%
Severity 3- normal resolve in 12 hours 44.3%
Ms. Sadler asked why the first two items listed under “challenges” were so difficult. It was clarified that the
emergency disable must occur within 30 minutes. Mr. Tierney responded that NG analyzed the performance
last month. In looking at the statistics it was decided two additional people would be added to handle these
specific things. NG is already seeing much improved results.
Milestone top three deliverables and challenges were discussed:
Top Three Deliverables
Good faith effort to deliver by 7/1 due date
Retaining consultant to do satisfaction surveying in next 90 days
Many of six milestones still due are in process
Top Three Challenges
Deliverables developed by onsite staff lack best practices
Milestone development (in house) takes staff away from improving SLR attainment
Most 7/1 milestones delivered past draft due date which rushed review process
Six milestones are still due, and three were signed today. Quality has been an issue with the milestone
documents.
Thirty day goals are:
Improve Siebel reporting process
Spend fewer hours on reports
Improve SLRs and Milestones
Try to have NG Program Manager hired
Contract Credit Strategy
Mr. Tierney updated the Board on the Program Manager (PM) progress. He stated 2 candidates have been
interviewed by NG. ISA staff interviewed the same two candidates. Mr. Banning has requested an interview
Information Services Agency – Document: ISA-ITBD Meeting Minutes

Page 2 of 7

Information Technology Board
Meeting Minutes
opportunity be given to the IT Team members. Major Meadows asked for a date by which the permanent
Program Manager would be hired. Mr. Banning stated that he requested more people be involved in the
interview process, including the management team and the IT Team. He believed by next week discussions
and recommendations could be made. He stated the PM could be on board by the next meeting. Ms. Sadler
stated that timeframe was unacceptable, since ISA is eight months into the contract and without a permanent
PM. Mr. Banning stated the delay should fall on his shoulders; he wanted to ensure due diligence. For
historical information, Mr. Clifford stated that NG originally had an accepted PM. Sixty days into the contract
ISA requested that the PM be removed, and Mr. Tierney became the interim PM. The permanent PM decision
was deferred until a permanent CIO was in place to ensure the two individuals can work together. Mr. Grazda,
Mr. Tierney, and Mr. Vera of NG have been working with Mr Banning in the absence of a permanent PM. He
believes NG has put forth a good faith effort to meet ISA needs.
Ms. Enders asked if August 1, 2005 is a realistic date for having a Program Manager hired. Mr. Banning and
Mr. Tierney stated that it would be. Mr. Ricketts asked if the delay was caused from lack of being able to get
staff together. Mr. Banning replied it has been a matter of scheduling. Mr. Clifford continued that the Program
Manager is an employee of NG not of the City-County. Mr. Poulakidas stated the contract delegates authority to
ISA not the IT Board regarding the PM decision. Mr. Ricketts wanted to clarify that Mr. Banning will be the
person to work with, but if the PM feels the need to speak with individual board members he wanted that to be
open.
Mr. Banning discussed the contract credit strategy. In the event NG does not deliver services per the contract a
credit may be applied to monthly payments. There is a general process in place to implement credits; however,
because of the good faith effort so far any discussion of issuing credits is recommended to be delayed until the
next board meeting.
Mr. Meadows stated he is not sure he agrees with that recommendation but will accept judgement of the CIO.
His concern is that in thirty days, with a new Program Manager, NG will request an additional month for
compliance. Mr. Banning stated he expects to receive a different response next month. He has been speaking
with NG upper management at every opportunity regarding credits and the pressure to implement those credits.
He believes NG understands the seriousness of the situation.
Mr. Rodman asked if ‘credits’ is in reference to the penalties. Mr. Buege stated the contract officially refers to
them as credits. Judge Miller asked what specific plan was in place to implement the existing credits/penalties.
Mr. Banning said a plan was not in place yet, and commented that it was important to remember that the
contract called for bonuses as well as penalties.
Ms. Sadler asked at what point in the contract credits could be enforced, and if it includes a provision for
retroactive penalties. She stated her preference is that the enterprise never be in a position to enforce
penalties; however, for the IT Board to not enforce contractual language on behalf of the taxpayers of
Indianapolis and Marion County is to not do its duty. Mr. Clifford stated the IT Board is not foregoing anything;
all options are open.
Mr. Rodman stated that a dollar today compared to a dollar in March is not really the same thing, and that
opportunity costs of investment are potentially being lost.
Ms Sadler asked why an SLR would not reported. Mr. Buege responded that some tools are not fully
implemented. Mr. Tierney replied that one of the tools, HP Openview was implemented in early July and that
preliminary data is just now available; therefore data on approximately twenty five additional SLRs will be
available next month.
Mr. Ricketts asked if it was known going into the contract that NG couldn’t report until July. Mr. Tierney
responded that the contract language by the letter says NG is to report January 1st. However, it was agreed that
this tool be implemented in July. Mr. Ricketts asked if the reporting could have been done manually, or if
existing tools could have been used. Mr. Banning replied that several types of reporting, for example how fast
Information Services Agency – Document: ISA-ITBD Meeting Minutes

Page 3 of 7

Information Technology Board
Meeting Minutes
an electronic signal takes to be received end-to-end, cannot be reported manually. Ms. Malloy stated that there
were no existing tools for these particular SLRs.
Mr. Clifford asked the number of new SLRs in this contract compared to the previous contract. Ms. Biddinger
stated the previous contract had only 20-25 SLRs and this contract has 125. Mr. Buege clarified that the
reason for increasing the number of SLRs and putting the contract out to bid was with the intent of improving
service. Mr. Clifford asked what the service levels were relative to a year ago when there were only 25 SLRs.
Ms. Biddinger replied that comparison is difficult. The bar has risen; it is harder to meet some of those that were
being met a year ago.
Mr. Beuge discussed the Siebel tool. It is more robust than previous tool used. Some of the challenge is not
just training staff but there is more information required to open a ticket compared to the previous tools.
It was determined that NG does not agree with the SLR numbers presented. Mr. Ricketts moved that by the
next meeting ISA and NG get together and resolve any discrepancies, coming up with an accurate report they
both agree on. The motion was seconded. Mr. Clifford commented that the difference between 56/60 is
immaterial; however, they ought to agree. He also commented that there is always going to be tension where
ISA should be pushing for NG to meet their SLRs. The motion passed unanimously.
A slide showing “YTD Summary of NG Contract Performance” relative to milestones was discussed. Mr. Beuge
stated there were twenty-four Milestones due by July 1. He pointed out that a similar slide last month showed
$85,000 in credits but that this month showed $70,000. He clarified that the figure was adjusted July 1 to
account for duplication and change control. Five milestones have been delivered today. Six have not yet been
delivered. Three of those six are in process. Mr. Tierney offered that four milestones were accepted this
morning.
Ms. Enders asked if submission of the milestones is in conflict with NG meeting SLRs. Mr. Banning replied that
it is a resource issue. He stated it is a concern to ISA that so many resources must be devoted to the contract
compliance effort. It is difficult to decide where to put resources – SLRs are operational and milestones are
more big picture. Mr. Buege commented that NG has been asked to bring in more resources for milestone
work.
Ms. Sadler asked if the quality of milestone documents is what ISA requires and if not what percentage does not
meet the expectation. Mr. Beuge estimated approximately 60% does not meet ISA quality expectations. Mr.
Buege explained the milestone timeframe and review process. The draft and final review period is two weeks.
ISA has one week; NG has a week to make those changes.
Slides detailing “Action Items due in the last period” and an “NG Improvement Plan – Overall” were reviewed.
Discussion of manual versus automated reporting, the drawbacks of the reporting tools, and the amount of time
needed to produce the reports ensued. Mr. Ortell clarified the problem is not with the collection of data. It is the
problem of the reporting itself. Ms. Sadler questioned the accuracy of the reporting, given its largely manual
nature. Mr. Banning responded that there are some questions, and committed that by the next Board meeting
every effort possible will be put into making the reports as accurate as possible. Mr. Ricketts asked if the Board
would receive 100% reporting next month. Mr. Banning did not guarantee 100% but committed that the reports
presented would be accurate.
The last slide regarding “Progress on NG Improvement Plan” was presented. Items include improving Siebel
reporting in order to reduce labor and mistakes, working on Root Cause Analysis quality and its connection to
improved SLR attainment, and reviewing the six remaining milestones. The slide also detailed the combined
SLR and Milestone penalties.
Ms. Sadler noted that credits banked on a previous screen were $130,000 for Milestones and that this slide
reflected $367,000 for a total of a half of a million dollars. Mr. Clifford requested Mr. Poulakidas outline for the
next board meeting the process for using the credits.

Meeting Minutes
Mr. Ricketts inquired as to whether NG agreed with numbers, and Mr. Tierney offered he would like the
opportunity to conduct a thorough analysis.
Discussion continued regarding the amount of the credits to date compared to the entire contract, and regarding
the ten percent cap called for by the contract. Ms. Sadler clarified NG has exceeded the penalty of what can be
collected because of failure to perform.
Mr. Clifford commented that he wanted to make sure that the Board was not ‘shooting the messengers’. The
Board first found out about the SLR situation in April, and hadn’t moved forward in light of the CIO search. Mr.
Clifford suggested the Board give Mr. Banning until the next board meeting, August 16, to propose how to
enforce the terms and conditions of the contract that the Board negotiated.
Ms. Sadler stated she did not want to wait a month for this recommendation, and suggested having a special
discussion in one week for Mr. Banning to present his recommendation. She commented that the subject was
too important to try and fit into a regular meeting. Mr. Rodman seconded.
Discussion continued regarding making sure that all participants were clear about what is to be expected at the
meeting, especially representatives from NG. It was also discussed that some areas are more important than
others, and Board members would like a breakdown with more specifics regarding the SLRs.
Mr. Ricketts amended the motion by asking that the CIO via email, in a week’s time, contact the Board members
with a plan regarding the credits, and then the Board could decide via e-mail whether another Board meeting
needs to be held, which would then be a week out. He commented that the Board needed time to look at the
plan before meeting or making decisions. The Board set potential meeting date at August 1st. Ms. Enders
stated the plan should address penalty usage and a Program Manager should be identified. Mr. Banning
suggested analysis from NG on what their thoughts were on why they were having so many challenges.
The amended motion was seconded, and passed unanimously.
Mr. Meadows asked Mr. Banning ISA’s status on filling vacant positions, specifically the BRMs. Mr. Banning
responded the positions would be posted on Friday.

Financial Report
Ms. Patel presented ISA Financial Report, including the budget comparison for 2004 versus 2005. The budget
stands at 46% year-to-date. Revenues collected are at 48% collected year-to-date. Mr. Clifford asked if Ms.
Patel thought the budget was adequate and she replied that she believed that it was.
CivicNet Report
Ms. Biddinger stated that the report stood as presented, and commented that it provides good information on
increased revenue and increased service.
Justis.Net Update
Mr. Rutherford presented the Justis.Net Update. He pointed out that dates in red were presented last month,
and that the dates in black are current dates now established for this project. The “End of Phase 6” target date
has moved up. He noted that the project plan slide is a high level overview of the tasks and how they link to
other tasks. The test and development environment needs to be complete before moving into Phase Three.
Approving Dell as a server standard was taken to IT Team, but there has been a delay there. It will be taken to
the next IT Team meeting. Additionally, some of the date changes were due to an original calculation in
calendar days rather than business days.

Information Technology Board
Meeting Minutes
Ms. Sadler asked why the IT Team could not approve the Server standards at their last meeting. She asked
how that decision impacts this project and she requested a brief description of why the project is going off-site.
Mr. Banning responded that the infrastructure personnel for NG had not had sufficient time to do performance
on the Dell servers which delayed the acceptance.
Mr. Thornsberry explained that the test and development environment set up within the City County Building is
not related to the off-site effort. Moving off-site is temporary, and will allow the project to move forward. Dell
servers are not currently used in the enterprise. They are being considered as a method for saving money
through competition. NG asked for some time to verify they could support Dell. The temporary site is a downsized test and development site, which was promised to be up and running on July 15th and was actually up on
July 11th. Discussion continued regarding DAI’s augmentation of .net staff, and the timeframe for downloading
data. The code conversion is from Ideal to VB.Net.
Ms. Sadler commented that she wanted to make sure the Board understands the test and develop work being
done outside the City County Building is temporary. She requested that Mr. Banning ensure that the City
County environment is done on time, since several other pending projects will be depending on it.
Property System Update
Mr. Rutherford presented the update on the Property System. He stated the RFP was released on June 21st.
The bidders conference was held on July 1st. Questions from bidders have been received. The proposal
submission deadline was changed to July 25th. After the proposals and costs have been assessed, and issues
and impacts on infrastructures identified, a return on investment will be put together. A presentation similar to
the Justis.Net project that relays information such as the cost of staying with the current system compared to
moving to the new system will be given.
Ms. Enders commented that the IT Board Packet is much improved, and that she was pleased to see a project
plan in the Justis.net report.
Enhanced Access Review
Mr. Chuck White discussed that the current contract for Enhanced Access is over at the end of the year. A
subcommittee met to decide if an RFP was appropriate. The committee met in May. The conclusion was that
an RFI was needed to get additional information from potential vendors. The current vendor was to have been
notified by the end of June should a decision be made to not renew the contract. A sixty day extension was
requested and granted to make that notification.
Mr. White stated that the current contract allows a three year extension but no shorter period of time. He
commented that the committee considered putting out an RFP but was concerned about the amount of time
needed, and that it was also discussed to put more of the services under the umbrella of ISA. Similarly, the
timeframe makes this difficult to do. The committee’s recommendation is to authorize the committee to
negotiate a one to three year extension of the contract with modified terms and revenue sharing.
Ms. Sadler thanked Mr. White for his participation in this effort. She commented there was some discussion
about trying to request a one year renewal with the vendor, but that request was denied. She also commented
that the committee’s debate was that a three year renewal was too long but that there was not sufficient time to
prepare an RFP.
Mr. Clifford stated the terms and conditions under the requested one year renewal would have remained the
same as they are currently. The recommendation being discussed by the Board authorizes the Enhanced
Access Review Committee to modify the terms and conditions which might entice CivicNet to go with the shorter
period of time.

Meeting Minutes
Ms. Sadler offered to support this recommendation because of the issues faced but that on a personal level she
loathes to continue to renew contracts with vendors without competitive bidding.
Ms. Enders asked for clarification of what ‘certain members’ referenced. Mr. White explained due to availability
a sub-committee was formed. The negotiations were with the subcommittee, with the support of legal counsel
and ISA.
A motion was made and seconded to accept the Enhanced Access Review Committee’s recommendation. It
passed unanimously.
The meeting adjourned at 11:40.
The next scheduled IT Board Meeting will be August 16, 2005.

Operations
The Operations Team continued the project of analyzing the 125 service level
requirements in the Northrop contract, identifying duplicates, clarifying some that
needed further definition, and refining the list for future reporting purposes.
Milestone documents furnished by NG were reviewed, and the Disaster
Recovery Milestone was returned to Northrop for additional refinement.
The planned communication line between the City/County Building and the
Indiana State Police for IDACS connectivity is almost complete and the State has
only a few more tasks before the line will go live. An MOU is being signed with
the State, and one has already been signed with SBC regarding support and
problem escalation on this communication line.
A collective team with NG worked on a new method of doing Root Cause
Analysis, which will be the starting point of moving the environment towards an
ITIL Problem Management foundation.
Telephone Operations completed the circuits for the Community Corrections
move. They also are working with SBC to improve response to timely quotations
for upgrade to OptEMan circuits at six locations.
Asset Management and HP Openview meetings were prevalent on calendars as
processes are being reviewed and defined for reporting purposes.
Northrop Grumman announced the permanent Program Manager for the
Northrop Grumman City/County engagement, Jeff Clancy. Jeff is from
Indianapolis and has a rich Information Technology background from a senior
management standpoint. He has held senior Information Technology leadership
positions in both the Public and Private sector.
Through the month of July NG focus has been on improved SLR performance
and tool improvements to facilitate the data gathering and reporting process.

The E-Service feature was added to Siebel. E-Service allows end users to
submit and monitor status of their help desk tickets from their desktops. It is also
the facility that will be used to gather end user satisfaction with I/T services. The
E-Service facility will be extended to a pilot group of users during the month of
August. The result of the pilot will determine how to proceed with the broader
user audience.
A new Siebel reporting tool, “Analytics”, was implemented. This tool will allow on
the spot reporting of performance to SLR’s. The prior method was a manual
process. Analytics will allow ISA and Northrop Grumman to view performance on
a day by day basis and make corrections to failing trends before month end. The
tool will also be fully automated so that the manual effort that was spent in prior
months can now be put to use analyzing trends and improving service based on
the analysis.
A combined Siebel development team/ISA/Northorp Grumman meeting has been
taking place weekly to address and fix the issues that have been impediments in
the past with the tool and reported on the RCA in June. Eight of the 15 reported
issues have been addressed and closed. The meetings will continue until the
remaining issues are resolved to the satisfaction of the City/County. Bob Mount
from our Siebel Corporate support team has been onsite all month to address
these issues and will remain onsite to ensure satisfactory resolution going
forward.
Northrop Grumman added additional help desk staff during the month of July.
The SLR trends that were unfavorable have improved due to the additional
staffing. While some of the same SLR’s are still being missed, the gap is closing
and with the additional staff NG believes these SLR’s will not be missed during
the month of August 2005.
For some of the missed SLR’s, performance has improved as follows:
Password Reset from 99.2% to 99.32%
Privilege Changes from 7.59% to 37.5%
Disable User Account from 57.14% to 66.67%
Terminate User Account from 68.97% to 97.59%
Severity 3 problem resolution from 64.63% to 80.51%
Severity 4 problem resolution from 73.87% to 85.42%
In addition, the Northrop Grumman Director of Help Desk Services visited
Indianapolis. He recommended some organizational and process changes to
improve service going forward. Northrop brought two experts from other accounts
to review the Indy processes. Both were well versed in Help Desk operations
using the Siebel tool. Both assisted in improving operational effectiveness and
will continue to visit the site and assist in the future.

Northrop Grumman added three Project Managers to the engagement. The
Project Managers organized all the infrastructure projects and ISA has prioritized
them. Currently there are 54 active projects, and 64 projects that are inactive.
Northrop Grumman brought a Sr. Project Manager to Indianapolis to understand
the project workflow process and the project portfolio. She made
recommendations on a Portfolio Management system to facilitate project
resource planning and consumption. This expert will also be visiting the site in
August to assist with the project workflow process.
Hewlett Packard OpenView (HP OpenView) is a network-based product that will
sample the health of all network-connected devices and send health reports for
technical staff review. The product is installed on the City/County network and is
monitoring network and server events on a proactive basis. The tool is producing
reports for the data center, server and network components.
Northrop Grumman has had another corporate resource assisting in the asset
management area. He has been instrumental in developing procedures for the
new assets being installed and keeping those under control. The prime concern
is the legacy assets which were less accurate than anticipated at the start of the
engagement. An asset policy has been developed for the asset management
area. The policy will be reviewed with ISA and presented to the City/County for
approval. Once adopted, enforcement procedures will be put in place to ensure
all IT assets can be tracked, managed and disposed in an organized manner.
The SA1 team is in the process of planning the implementation of several new
tools to greatly assist the end users. One is a tool to allow end users to reset
their own passwords without help desk intervention. The other tool is a Spam
filtering tool. Over 75% of the email coming into the City/County is classified as
Spam. Once the filter is implemented, unwanted email will be controlled at the
end user level.
SA1 performance to Service levels continues to be steady. There were some first
time SLR misses in the Intel server availability area and the Network Availability
area. Both are currently being investigated. Since this is the first month that the
HP Openview reported these areas, NG is analyzing both the data being
reported to HP Openview as well as the infrastructure for the root cause.
Northrop Grumman has put great emphasis on completing the contract
milestones. During the past month the following milestones were completed and
accepted:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

Operations Standards and Procedures
Disaster Recovery Test
Change Mangement
Purchasing report
Contractor usage report

The following milestones have been developed and are now in the ISA review
process:

Two contract milestones are being deferred. These are the Technology Refresh
Plan, which is dependent on an accurate asset data, and the Technology Plan,
which is dependent on the Information Technology Strategy. NG is working with
ISA on these milestones, as plans need to be in place for future technology
deployment. A re-scoping of these plans seems to be the favored approach so
that something of value can be delivered rather than wait.
Another corporate resource from Northrop Grumman visited the site and
conducted a Change Management workshop. The purpose was to facilitate the
Change Management process improving the level of rigor to ensure quality and
consistency. Best Practices are now being applied and added to the Change
Management process to obtain this level of assurance going forward.
Northrop Grumman added another resource to assist with milestone quality, a
Technical Writer, who has been reviewing and editing recent milestone
documents for quality and accuracy. She will continue to assist going forward.
Northrop Grumman signed and executed an agreement with Mathews and
Company to perform an end user Information Technology Services satisfaction
survey. This organization performed similar services on other Northrop Grumman
accounts. Mathews and Company will be onsite August 12 to perform a
workshop. The workshop will identify the demographics and the content of the
survey to be utilized. The survey will then be developed, reviewed, implemented
on the Internet, analyzed and reported. It is anticipated this effort will be
completed by the end of September with action planning workshops to be held in
October to facilitate improvements.
The Northrop Grumman Application Services group met 100% of the established
Service Level Requirements (SLR) in all measurable areas. There was no data
to report in the Customer Satisfaction area.

Northrop Grumman Input to the IT Board
Monthly Status Report
August 16, 2005

Northrop Grumman is proud to announce that Jeff Clancy has been approved by
the City/County and has accepted the offer to become the permanent Program
Manager for the Northrop Grumman City/County engagement. Jeff has a rich
Information Technology background from a senior management standpoint and
has held senior Information Technology leadership positions in both the Public
and Private sector.
Through the month of July the focus has been on improved SLR performance
and tool improvements to facilitate the data gathering and reporting process.
The E-Service feature has been added to Siebel. E-Service allows end users to
submit and monitor status of their help desk tickets from their desktops. It is also
the facility that will be used to gather end user satisfaction with I/T services. The
E-Service facility will be extended to a pilot group of users of Indianapolis
Information Technology during the month of August. The result of the pilot will
determine how to proceed with the broader user audience.
A new Siebel reporting tool, “Analytics”, was implemented during July. This tool
will allow on the spot reporting of performance to SLR’s. The prior method was to
aggregate the monthly ticket data manually and then report by the 10th of the
month. During the month of August we will be running parallel tests with the
manual method of gathering data and Analytics do ensure consistency and
integrity of reporting. Once completed Analytics will be able to be used on a day
by day basis to view performance and make corrections to failing trends before
month end.
A combined Siebel development team/ISA/Northorp Grumman meeting has been
taking place weekly to address and fix the issues that have been impediments in
the past with the tool and reported on the RCA in June. Eight of the 15 reported
issues have been addressed and closed. The meetings will continue until the
remaining issues are resolved to the satisfaction of the City/County. Bob Mount
from our Siebel Corporate support team has been onsite all month to address
these issues and will remain onsite to ensure satisfactory resolution going
forward.
Northrop Grumman has added two additional help desk analysts. One during the
month of July and the other on August 1, 2005.. The SLR trends that were
unfavorable have improved due to the additional staffing. Expectations are that
while some of the same SLR’s are being missed the gap is closing and with the

additional staff we are encouraged that these SLR’s will not be missed during the
month of August 2005.
The SLR’s that were being missed, performance has improved as follows:
Password Reset from 99.2% to 99.32%
Privilege Changes from 7.59% to 37.5%
Disable User Account from 57.14% to 66.67%
Terminate User Account from 68.97% to 97.59%
Severity 3 problem resolution from 64.63% to 80.51%
Severity 4 problem resolution from 73.87% to 85.42%
In addition we have had Fred Wright, Northrop Grumman Director of Help Desk
Services, visit the site. He has recommended some organizational and process
changes that will improve service going forward. Northrop has also brought in
Tonya Stewart from our Peace Corp account and Beth Hill from the Northrop
Unocal account. Both are well versed in Help Desk operations using the Siebel
tool. Both have assisted in providing recommendations which will improve
operational effectiveness. Both will continue to visit the site and assist in the
future.
Northrop Grumman has added three Project Managers to the engagement. The
Project Managers have organized all the projects and have had them scored and
prioritized by ISA. As a result Northrop will apply resources to the highest priority
projects. Currently there are 54 active projects, 64 projects that are inactive and
2 that need to be scored. Northrop Grumman has had Donna Guido, Sr. Project
Manager, visit the site to understand the project workflow process and the project
portfolio. Donna has made some recommendations on a Portfolio Management
system that will facilitate project resource planning and consumption. Donna will
also be visiting the site in August to assist with the project workflow process.
Hewlett Packard OpenView (HP OpenView) is a network-based product that will
sample the health of all network-connected devices and send health reports for
technical staff review. This product has now been installed on the City/County
network and is monitoring network and server events on a proactive basis. The
tool is now producing reports for the data center, server and network
components. Rick Altosino from the Northrop Grumman architecture team has
been onsite in Indianapolis to assist in the installation and ongoing operation of
this critical tool. Gerald Mc Garvin from Hewlett Packard Corp. has been onsite
assisting Rick. Gerald will continue to assist to ensure that all expectations are
met with the implementation of this important tool.
Northrop Grumman has had Billy Edmondson, another corporate resource,
assisting in the asset management area. Billy has been instrumental in
developing procedures for the new assets being installed and keeping those
under control. The large concern is the legacy assets which were less accurate

than anticipated at the start of the engagement. Northrop Grumman has had one
of the Project Managers develop a project plan that consists of an asset policy,
enforcement procedures and a physical inventory. The Asset Policy has been
developed by the Asset Management team. The policy will be reviewed with the
I/T Board for consideration. Once adopted enforcement procedures will be put in
place to ensure that all I/T assets will be known by the ISA organization going
forward so that assets can be tracked, managed and disposed in an organized
manner. Once the enforcement is in place then an physical inventory will be
completed to ensure the installed assets are accounted for in the system.
The SA1 team is in the process of planning the implementation of several new
tools that will greatly assist the end users. One is a tool that was piloted back in
May and was approved going forward. That tool will allow end users to reset their
own passwords without help desk intervention. The other tool that is now being
planned is a Spam filtering tool. Over 75% of the email coming into the
City/County is classified as Spam. Once the filter is implemented unwanted email
will be controlled at the end user level.
SA1 performance to Service levels continues to be steady. There were some first
time SLR misses in the Intel server availability area and the Network Availability
area. Both are currently being investigated. Since this is the first month that we
have had the HP Openview reporting these areas so we are analyzing both the
data being reported to HP Openview as well as the infrastructure for the root
cause.
Northrop Grumman has put great emphasis on completing the contract

which is dependent on the Information Technology Strategy. NGC is working with
ISA on these milestones, as plans need to be in place for future technology
deployment. A re-scoping of these plans seems to be the favored approach so
that something of value can be delivered rather than wait.
John Cochran from Northrop Grumman visited the site and conducted a Change
Management workshop. The purpose was to facilitate the Change Management
process improving the level of rigor to ensure quality and consistency. Best
Practices are now being applied and added to the Change Management process
to obtain this level of assurance going forward.
Northrop Grumman has added another resource to assist with milestone quality.
Paula Grey, Technical Writer, has been reviewing and editing recent milestone
documents for quality and accuracy. She will continue to assist going forward.
Northrop Grumman has signed and executed an agreement with Mathews and
Company to perform an end user Information Technology Services satisfaction

Please note: The YTD July 2004 expenses for ACS totaled $6,541 million. This expense for ACS does not
include the following:
A). The cost for the Business Consultants (currently reclassified as Business Relationship Managers within ISA).
B). Any Pass through charges & New Application Development. (In 2005 no new application dollars budgeted.)
It does however, include the cost for Maintenance and Support. In 2004 the contractual dollars allocated for
Application Development included Maintenance & Support along w/ New Development. This breakdown was
75% for Maintenance and Support and 25% for New Development for 2004. Prior to 2004, the split was more
50% for Maintenance and Support and 50% for New Development.
Based on the chart above there is a contract savings of $554K for year to date 2005, and based on this trend,
we are projecting a contract savings of approximately $949K by the end of calendar year 2005.

The chart above shows the hours and dollars budgeted for the City and County for Application Maintenance and
Support. We currently should be at 58% for both the City and County budget at the end of July 2005. We need
to monitor and prioritize our projects and enhancements so that funding is still available for support through out
this year. Based on current spending trends, the County will exceed its budget for application maintenance &
support by $125K.
Definition:
Application Support – Bug or performance tuning of an existing application.
Maintenance – Enhancement of an existing system.

Summary
 Overall increase of 1.7% from 2005
 For 2006, ISA has been able to reduce its

budget by restructuring the outsourcing
contract, consolidating some internal
functions, and reviewing reductions in our
capital expenditures
 We anticipate these changes to allow us to
continue operations during these
challenging fiscal times but understand
that in future years, significant capital
expenditures may be required

CIVICNET HIGHLIGHTS
Reminder: Financial data is reported on a one-month delay. This means that
financials for July 2005 will be detailed in the report distributed in September
2005.

In July, the Division of Compliance deployed the property owner
permitting service. This service is now available for
homeowners and property owners. Customers will have access
to the online permitting service 24/7, and the agency will benefit
from reduced traffic as well as lower costs for office materials
and printing.
Two agencies installed the over-the-counter (OTC) credit card
processing system: Corporation Counsel and Department of
Metropolitan Development. Corporation Counsel, City
Collections Division, is now accepting credit card payments for
Court 13 fines. DMD is accepting credit card for zoning fines
and violations. Both agencies responded to citizen requests to
have the convenience of using credit cards to pay fines.
CivicNet is well underway with development for the Treasurer’s
Office Bulk Search service with anticipated deployment before
the fall taxing season. This will assist the agency with large
customer requests for information that are currently processed
manually. With budget constraints, the Treasurer’s Office is
looking for creative ways to increase customer service while not
increasing costs.
CivicNet is working very closely with the Division of
Compliance to provide online Craft License Renewals by
October 1. Reminder letters will be developed by the CivicNet
marketing team and mailed to all craft contractors the last week
of October. This project is expected to save thousands of staff
hours each year, eliminate the manual data-entry process for
license renewals and get licenses into contractor’s hands earlier.
Another project that is starting development is the Online Pet
Adoption service for the Animal Care and Control Division. The
goal is to provide an additional, convenient avenue for pet
adoption and increase the number of pets that find homes.
Marketing online services is an important part of the support
CivicNet provides the city/county. In July, posters were
designed for the Office of Corporation Counsel to promote their
new OTC service. An extensive survey was conducted for the
Treasurer’s Office for the new bulk property service. New office
signage has been ordered for Citizens Services and the Division
of Compliance.

Enhanced Access Review Committee
Meeting Minutes
August 11, 2005
Room 224 - 2:00 P.M.
In Attendance: Chuck White, representing the Controller’s Office; Cindy Land,
representing the Marion County Treasurer; Marty Womacks, the Marion County
Auditor; Andy Swenson, representing the Department of Metropolitan
Development; Nadeen Biddinger and Ahmed Soliman from the Information
Services Agency; Kathy Price, representing the Township Assessors; Andy
Fraizer, representing the Mayor’s Office; Laura Lindenbusch and Arleen Acton
from CivicNet; and Kostas Poulakidas from the Office of Corporation Counsel
Chuck White called the meeting to order at 2:00 p.m.
Approval of Minutes Andy Fraizer moved to approve the minutes of June 23 and
June 28, 2005 as distributed. Motion was seconded by Marty Womacks and
unanimously approved.
Service Request No. 30 – Division of Compliance Arleen Acton introduced Steve
Spencer and Cathy Clemons from the Division of Compliance. The request was
to put Craftsmen License renewals online, and is a duplicate of a previous
request for the General Contractor’s license renewal. They each expire in
offsetting years and the fee proposed will be the same as for the GC License
renewal. Steve explained craft people are Heating and Cooling, etc. and they
must show proper certification to obtain the license.
Motion was made by Andy Fraizer to approve the request, seconded by Kathy
Price. Motion was unanimously approved.
Service Request No. 29 – Treasurer’s Office Arleen explained the service is
proposed to alleviate some of the stress felt during tax time by providing date in
an automated fashion in bulk format and retaining the $1 per record fee that is
now being charged. Turnaround will be 1-2 business days.
Laura Lindenbusch said CivicNet is currently charging $3 for the one-on-one
property searches and this will entitle users to a break in price. It will be offered
to subscription users only, primarily title companies. The $3 report gives more
property information than the proposed inquiry.
CivicNet’s market research and an online survey indicated this would be a
reasonable fee. Laura distributed a copy of the survey results.
Marty Womacks moved to approve this service request, seconded by Andy
Fraizer, and the motion was unanimously approved.

Waiver Requests:
Bartholomew County Court Services – Marty Womacks moved for approval,
subject to custodial approval from the County Clerk. Motion was seconded by
Kathy Price and unanimously approved.
State Public Defender – Cindy Land moved to deny as they currently have
access to the information they are requesting online via remote access. Motion
was seconded by Marty Womacks and unanimously approved.
Two requests from the Indiana Army National Guard – Arleen explained the
requests came as a result of a sign posted in one of the courts suggesting all
military establishments request waiver of fees to obtain limited criminal history
searches on CivicNet. There could be up to 24 total requests for this information.
After discussion, Cindy Land moved for approval, subject to custodial approval of
the Clerk’s Office, and limited to three users per account. Motion was seconded
by Marty Womacks, and unanimously approved.
Vermillion County State’s Attorney, Danville, Illinois - this last minute request
was considered and Cindy Land moved for denial, seconded by Marty Womacks,
and unanimously approved.
CivicNet Report – Laura Lindenbusch reported transactions for July were about
20% lower than June, perhaps because of vacations. They just launched the
Property Owner Permits for home building projects, but they have no activity to
report to date.
Chuck White asked if CivicNet is able to provide information about what
applications cost the City/County and the time involved. He said we are trying to
evaluate what it would take if there is a need to prioritize work. Laura indicated
they track their hours and could provide this information.
Treasurer’s Report – Cindy distributed a report indicating as of August 11, 2005
there is $466,280.94 in the Enhanced Access Fund
Distribution of 2003-2004 Enhanced Access Funds agencies provided reports relative to their activities.

Cindy reported several

The Recorder’s Office did not report activity for the last two years, so they now
have provided information through August 2004. Clerk and Treasurer provided
reports through the end of 2004.
There is insufficient funds appropriated this year in the Enhanced Access Fund
because of an earlier expenditure of $45,500 and there is a current balance of

2

$54,500. In order to pay all of the requests, there would need to be an additional
appropriation.
After some discussion, the Treasurer was directed to request a report from the
Recorder for the remainder of the funds and activities through 2004, and to
provide a report of revenue collected through June 30, 2005 as well. This would
show an accounting trail up to date to ensure tracking would be timely in the
future.
Motion was made by Marty Womacks to distribute funds to the Treasurer and
Clerk, for a total of $4,608.00 as reported. Motion was seconded by Andy
Swenson and unanimously approved. This recommendation will be presented to
the IT Board for approval.
Motion was made by Marty Womacks to defer the Recorder’s request until further
information is provided to the Committee. Motion was seconded by Andy
Swenson and unanimously approved. Cindy Land will contact the Recorder and
request additional information.
CivicNet Contract Negotiation Committee Participants include Kostas
Poulakidas, Cindy Land, Ahmed Soliman and Nadeen Biddinger. They met
earlier in the week and identified general areas where they want to create a
better agreement, and areas for negotiation.
The committee will begin discussions with CivicNet on the 16th.
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 3:30 P.M.
Respectfully submitted,
Nadeen Biddinger

Information Technology Board
Leading the way in enterprise-wide technology

Northrop Grumman Update
1. SLRs
•

The proposed SLRs would reduce the number from 124 to 59 with the overall dollar
value remaining the same. ISA and NG worked together to ensure that the remaining
SLRs would cover all of the critical systems to the level that was expected from day
one.

2. The Process:
•

Combined a number of SLRs that were duplicated between Service Area 1 and 2, such
as problem call resolution (sev1-4), security requests, and disaster recovery.

•

Clarified a large number of SLRs so that all parties understood what was expected,
and how they would be reported each month. An example is we defined “Urgent” for
two SLRs that would remain in Service Area 2.

•

Folded a number of hardware-based SLRs into the application-based SLRs that reside
on the hardware. We have built our environment with redundancy so that if a drive
failed the customers would not see a drop in service. We decided that the applications
that are used by the customers are what need to stay running at all times.

•

Worked with the NG Management staff to modify a couple of the existing SLRs.
Example we lowered the Severity 3 & 4 resolution from a 98% to a 90%, in return NG
has agreed to raise the First Call Resolution from 75% to 80%.

•

Deleted SLRs that do not make financial sense in our current economic situation.
Desktop backups and restores are an example that would cost the enterprise over a
million dollars to implement.

•

Deleted SLRs that are actually the responsibility of SBC, not NG.

•

Adjusted the weights of some credits. Mission critical credits were increased; some
individual-level credits were decreased. The total monthly value of credit points did
not change.

•

ISA and NG will sign a Letter of Understanding (LOU) agreeing to these SLR changes.

JUSTIS.NET CURRENT NOTES
• Notes from Project Plan

– Finalize Hardware & Software Requirements
Was 67 days, but at the July IT Team Meeting the Server Standards were not
approved as planned, which slips the approval to the next IT Team Meeting and
correspondingly to the next IT BOARD Meeting which is August 16th. The
Establish Financing task can't complete until this is done, so it was extended as
well to the August 16th Date. Slip incurred was 14 calendar days
– Setup Hardware & Software
Jim Flynn identified a date error concerning this task. The time needed to be 55
business days vs. 55 calendar days that had been reflected on all previous plans
– corrected per his email request 7/15/2005.

–Phase 1 - Convert Code and Data
6/22/2005 The Court & Clerk request DAI to investigate starting sooner by going
offsite, DAI concluded it was possible and they could complete Phase I by the
end of this year, if DAI could have the offsite Development and Test up and
running by 7/15/2005. Don Banning, CIO, approved the offsite 6/29/2005. DAI
completed the creation of the offsite Dev and Test 7/11/2005. DAI is
performing this effort at no additional cost to the City/County.

• The GIS mapping subsystem of IN SVRS is not accurate enough
– Verbal plan is to overlay Marion County mapping on top of the State’s

• Potential magnitude of MC VR address and data conversion

Printer Standard
Revision
August 12, 2005

Revised Hewlett-Packard Printer Pricing
Addition of Dell Printers to Standard
Background
The Standards and Policies Sub-committee of the IT Team has reviewed the existing
Printer Standard and solicited current information from leading printer providers to
determine what revisions are necessary to our printer standard. The process and results
have been reviewed by the Purchasing Department, accepted by the Standards Committee
and approved by the IT Team. We are now ready to implement the new standard.
Proposed Standard
Establish Hewlett-Packard and Dell Printers as a dual standard for the enterprise.
Establish Cannon IV using Hewlett-Packard “Big Deal” Pricing as the primary source for
Hewlett-Packard printers.
Establish Dell as the source for Dell printers and toner
Implementation
The net result of this revision is that the cost of Hewlett-Packard printers will drop by an
average of approximately five per cent across the entire product line.
The addition of Dell as a standard will bring competition to the printer arena and
significantly drive down costs for the enterprise.

RESOLUTION #05-15
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY BOARD
Resolution to Adopt Printer Standards for the City of Indianapolis/Marion County

Whereas, the Standards and Policy Committee conducted discussion, evaluation, and review
of current printer deployment and determined standardization is necessary to increase
efficiencies, and
Whereas, the adoption of a uniform printer standard will facilitate configuration and
installation while allowing for improvement in operations and retain optimum flexibility and
service, and
Whereas, implementing and following these standards will ensure the printing needs of the
City/County are met, and will allow for the highest degree of stability in the selection and
implementation of existing applications and future innovations.

NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, the Information Technology Board authorizes the
Chief Information Officer to adopt Uniform Standards for Printers for all existing and any
future facilities operated by City of Indianapolis Departments and Marion County Agencies
and Courts.

2. Intel File Server Hardware Standards:
Enterprise file server specifications and recommendations will change as
the industry changes, just as will the configurations for workstations. The
configurations below refer to MINIMUM specifications and include a known
level of reliability and performance from a manufacturer.
Enterprise file servers will be rack mounted and centrally located within the
9th floor data center for security, control, management, power and
consolidation.
The server will have the minimum fault tolerance and management built into
the system.
a)
b)
c)
d)
e)

Hot swappable drives
Redundant fans
Redundant power supply
Remote access capability to recycle power
1 Gb Primary connection Copper

Remote file servers that are installed will be approved on a case-by-case
basis as determined by the reliability of the communications connection to

3. How many servers are required to implement the application effectively
4. Who will need physical or remote access to the server?
5. Will the server function as an Internal or Public access server?
6. Who will maintain the operating system?
Database
The consolidation of the application schema will be placed into a common
database unless the application involves heavy activity and resource usage
in which a separate database instance will be considered.
The application will be installed separate from the database server when
applicable.
1. What platform does the database need to be installed on Unix or
Windows?
2. If Oracle what version of Oracle?
3. Does the implementation require multiple databases?

5

4. If the implementation is Oracle based, does it need its own database or
can the application scheme be shared along with other schema in a
common database?
5. Who will setup the database?
6. Does the vendor provide any database recommendations from the
application compatibility standpoint?
7. What is the volume of daily activity on the database?
8. What are the storage requirements for the database?
9. How many total users will be setup for the database/application?
10. How many concurrent users will be involved?
7. Will the database platform be Oracle or MS SQL Server and what
version?
11. How will user authentication be implemented? Will it be an application
level authentication or database authentication?
12. Does each user have their own individual login to the database or will
they use a common sign-on?
13. Who will support the application/database security?
14. Does the application have a User Admin screen or does the security
have to be setup on the database side?
15. What type of front-end the database supports? Will it be a thin client or
a thick client?
16. Does the database require an application web server?
17. Database implementation per user or processor?
Application
1. Is the application code proprietary?
2. Will the application need accessibility for Internal or Public users?
3. Who will maintain the application?
4. How will user authentication be implemented?
5. Web based or Client?
6. Does the application require a dedicated operating system?
7. Is the application vendor open to allow custom integration with the
system?
8. Method of deploying the application to the desktop. City standard is
Novell ZenWorks application launcher?
9. What desktop operating systems is the application certified to work on?
10. Any concerns with patching the Operating system that the application
resides on?
