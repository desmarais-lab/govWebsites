History of The Elwood Fire Department
In 1892, one of the first efforts of Elwood&#8217;s new administration was the
organization of a fire department. The first firehouse, located in the 1400
block of Main Street, was purchased for $3000. Elwood ordered one horse drawn
hose wagon and one hand drawn hook and ladder wagon. Three years later, in
1895, a second horse drawn hook and ladder wagon was purchased. Elwood&#8217;s
first appointed fire chief was Patrick O&#8217;Brian.
In 1892, the city sought to moderize the Fire Department by purchasing a
Gamewell Alarm System. This system of alarm boxes located throughout the city
was a vital part of the fire service for many years. This system was still
maintained and in service until the Department moved into the new Municipal
Building in 2003.
In 1900, the Elwood Fire Department moved to the Elwood City Building located
at 16th and Main Streets. In 1918, the city purchased a Type A, 4-cylinder
Brockway Hose and Ladder truck. That same year the last run was made by the
horse drawn fire wagons to a fire at the Opera House. The City auctioned off
the horses and wagons in 1918.
The first snorkel fire truck in the State of Indiana was delivered to Elwood in
1961.
In the 118 year history of the Elwood Fire Department, only 2 men have lost
their lives in the line of duty. They were Pick Lear in 1955 and Theodore
&#8220;Pete&#8221; Wilson in 1962. Both men sustained heart attacks while
fighting fires.
In April of 2003 the Elwood Fire Department moved into the new Elwood Municipal
Building at 1505 South B Street. The new building provided the department with
better facilities and more space. A third ambulance was added and the
department currently makes approximately 1600 runs a year.
The first Chief was Patrick O&#8217;Brien in 1892. The Chief who served the
longest term which ran from January 1, 1992 to August 31, 2011 was Milton
Gough.
Brad Compton became Chief September 1, 2011.
