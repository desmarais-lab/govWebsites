Narratives
Summary of Distribution and Uses of NSP Funds:
Project 1 - Acquisition/Rehabilitation - $1,357,893.99
Dollar Housing Program - Eligible Use B: Acquisition and Rehabilitation (LMMH) - Budget $0 - Activity cancelled
Acquisition and Rehabilitation - Eligible Use B: Acquisition and Rehabilitation (LMMH, 25% Setaside) - Budget $1,357,893.99 - Many of the
abandoned or foreclosed properties in University Park are in good condition and can be renovated and marketed to new homeowners at or
below 50% of AMI as a parallel effort with the dollar house initiative. This additional investment will encourage current property owners to
improve their homes and it will attract other stable families to buy in the neighborhood. Just like the dollar houses, the properties will be
selected based on the quality of location, construction features, other renovation nearby, and marketability of each house. These properties
will be fully upgraded to the same standards as the recently renovated NSP houses elsewhere in Gary. Under this program, either the City or
a single developer will be responsible to fully renovate and sell those houses designated for households at or below 50% of median. Based
on past experience, this is sufficient to fund the rehab and sale of up to ten to twelve houses of the type common to the western part of
University Park. An initial survey of the area has identified many small houses that should be high priority for rehab and sale instead of
demolition. It is expected that the houses will be renovated and sold in phases that will begin as the dollar house effort starts and will continue
into 2013 and beyond.
Project 2 - Demolition - Eligible Use D: Demolition (LMMA) - Budget $1,115,357.70 - The City of Gary received approval on January 22, 2013
of its request for a waiver from the Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Department of H.U.D. to increase the allocation of demolition funding from
ten percent (10%) of the grant to up to fifty-three (53%) of the grant to address the higher than usual amounts of abandonment in a few blocks
of the east and west sides of the University Park footprint and to address the demolition of the former Sheraton Hotel and parking garage.
There are a few blocks in this area that have a higher than usual amount of abandonment. This reflects less desirable design or construction
features in the tract houses. Nevertheless, no single significant part of the core neighborhood is severely distressed, so a targeted program of
demolition with careful treatment of the vacant lots should greatly stabilize the overall neighborhood. In terms of rental property, the
neighborhood is already a place of choice for stable renters and higher quality units should enhance the market.
Until recently, there have been few abandoned houses in University Park, and the community has a good tree canopy and a relatively low
number of open lots. However, matters are changing quickly and it is critical to now remove certain vacant houses and to have a solid plan for
the re-use of the properties. Therefore, there will be assigned staff to work with the Redevelopment Department to create a seamless process
of identification and notification of abandoned houses and a proactive plan for giving priority to demolitions where the adjacent owners are
willing to take responsibil

Summary of Distribution and Uses of NSP Funds:
ity. As a result of this effort, 55 houses will be removed in University Park over the next two years. A cleaner, better-maintained neighborhood
will restore confidence among the current residents and will encourage renting or owning by new residents.
There may be the opportunity for simultaneous demolitions in conjunction with other programs and institutions at some sites. If so, the total for
both areas could be 55 demolitions funded by NSP3 and 20 by other sponsors. The first priority for clearance will be sites adjacent to dollar
houses and other investment sites. The second priority will be abandoned houses adjacent to those property owners who are willing to take
responsibility for the cleared lot. The third priority will be given to distressed properties on otherwise stable blocks with the belief that early
intervention can be the most cost effective.
The fourth priority will be given to the demolition of the old Sheraton Hotel and its adjoining parking garage which has created an impediment
to redevelopment of the city's downtown area. The goal of demolishing these structures and the subsequent redevelopment of the area into
green space is to stimulate redevelopment and revitalization in the surrounding area while eliminating blight.
The fifth priority will be given to the demolition of property addresses on both sides of Ridge Road between Tyler Street and Van Buren Street.

Project 3 - Administration - Budget $244,607.31 - This activity represents less than 10% of the total NSP Grant and will be utilized for
administration of all related fiscal systems and production of required reports. Management of program components, monitoring and
evaluation of program and subgrantees.

How Fund Use Addresses Market Conditions:

Ensuring Continued Affordability:

Definition of Blighted Structure:
Definition of "Blighted Structure" according to the State of Indiana Code, the Interim Study Committee and Legislative Findings:
-Any premises that, because of physical condition, use, or occupancy, constitutes a public nuisance or attractive nuisance;
-Any dwelling that, because it is dilapidated, unsanitary, unsafe, or vermin infested or lacks the facilities or equipment required by housing
codes, is
unfit for human habitation;
-Any structure that is a fire hazard or is otherwise dangerous to the safety of persons or property;
-Any structure from which the utilities, plumbing, heating, sewerage, or similar services or facilities have been disconnected, destroyed,
removed, or
rendered ineffective so that the property is unfit for its intended use;
-Any vacant or unimproved land in a predominantly built-up neighborhood that, by reason of neglect or lack of maintenance, has become a
place for.
accumulation of trash and debris or a haven for rodents or other vermin;
-Any property that has tax delinquencies that exceed the value of the property;
-Any property with code violations that affect health or safety that is not substantially rehabilitated within one year after receiving a notice to

Definition of Affordable Rents:

Housing Rehabilitation/New Construction Standards:
The City of Gary Housing Standards for Rehabilitation Program as funded from HOME and CDBG will apply to NSP funds:
• Code/Health & Safety Repairs- Our first priority is to eliminate and remove any and all pre-existing City of Gary code violations, Health
and Safety hazards and bring the property to code. All projects will correct any pre-existing code deficiencies and/or health and safety repair
needs. This is inclusive of construction deficiencies which were completed without City permits. (room additions, garage conversions, patio
additions, etc.) All units will brought up to code and rehabilitation must obtain the permits necessary through the City of Gary Building
Department, or the property must be demolished as part of the rehab project.
• Lead Based Paint Hazards- As part of the Housing Rehabilitation under this NSP, a lead based paint test and a risk assessment are
required on all rehabilitation projects. This is done to identify the existence and scope of any lead based paint hazards in the property. The
"Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention in Federally Owned and Federally Assisted Housing" found at 24 CFR Part 35 will apply.
• Termite Repairs- The program requires a termite inspection report be prepared for every home by a licensed inspector. The report must
identify any termite or dry rot damaged wood members in the property, as well as whether there are any active termite infestations in the
property. The program requires that any termite or dry rot damaged wood be replaced or repaired due to health and safety risks posed to the
structure of the property. Fumigation or other treatments recommended must eliminate any active termite infestations and are required under
this program.
• General Property Improvements Upon- The Completion of the cost for rehabilitation of all code deficiencies has been completed, health
and safety items, lead based paint hazard and termite repairs are totaled, then any additional program funding may be used to address
general property improvements. General property improvements may include a wide range of items such as painting, replacement of fixtures,
cabinets, flooring, etc. The General property improvements MAY NOT include items that are a type or quality which exceeds the standards for
similar properties in the area or that exceed the basic standard of "decent, safe and sanitary housing". The acceptable standards are found in
24 CFR 983.101.

Vicinity Hiring:
The City of Gary will make every effort to hire employees who reside in the NSP3 target areas, and will require contractors to make every
attempt to do the same. In doing so, the City will coordinate these vicinity hiring provisions with its Section 3 program requirements.

Through Mayor Freeman-Wilson’s Department of Commerce, the NEW DAY/NEW JOBS: Construction
Series leverages the resources of the City of Gary, the Northwestern Indiana Building and Construction
Trades Council, Work One, and corporate partners and works with the Indiana Plan for Equal
Employment to recommend and administer instructional program hours that would serve as a platform
to help Gary residents obtain construction jobs and maintain construction jobs long enough to advance
to a self-sufficient wage and enjoy the value of work.
The main target audience for all training and job placement activities would include: City of Gary
residents who are unemployed, underemployed, dislocated workers, individuals on public assistance, atrisk youth, ex-offenders, veterans, and/or individuals with limited English proficiency.
NEW DAY/NEW JOBS: Construction Series’ purpose is to connect unemployed or under employed Gary,
Indiana residents to construction jobs though collaborative workforce development efforts and strong
partnerships with the economic development, business, education, and government sectors in the
Northwest Indiana region. Specifically, the City of Gary’s Department of Commerce, the Northwestern
Indiana Building and Construction Trades Council, Work One and the Indiana Plan for Equal Employment
partnership has developed a strategy to provide employment and training opportunities to residents of
Gary, Indiana to fill hundreds of available jobs across eight building trade categories on active and future
constructions sites throughout the region. Through the partnership, we highlight our relationship with
the Northwestern Indiana Building and Construction Trades Council and are working to secure a historic
amount of new union memberships for workers who live in the City of Gary. The ideal impact on the
City of Gary would be the development of a highly skilled workforce for NIPSCO, BP, US Steel and other
regional employers, as well as provide a path to a career in the building trades for residents of the City
of Gary.
THE PROGRAM
The City of Gary Department of Commerce seeks to connect residents of the City of Gary with high
paying union scale jobs through an exciting partnership with the Indiana Plan for Equal Employment, the
Northwestern Indiana Building and Construction Trades Council and Work One. Specifically, successful
completion of the of the Indiana Plan pre-apprenticeship training program may allow an individual to
secure work on an active union construction site for up to one year. Clearly, a renewed spirit of
cooperation with the Northwestern Indiana Building and Construction Trades Council and many regional
employers is the key to a last impact on the City of Gary and the region.
First, the City of Gary seeks to identify skilled workers who are union members in good standing. Those
workers will be vetted, recorded and recommended to a large construction project team immediately.
Second, the City of Gary is leading the effort to recruit, educate and prepare eligible participants for
entry into the construction trades and apprenticeship programs through the Indiana Plan program.


Workers who demonstrate significant levels of skills and experience in the various building
trades may be immediately certified by the Indiana Plan, vetted, recorded and recommended to
a large construction project team.





Workers who demonstrate the basic skills and simply need enhancement in the areas of reading
and math will be required to complete ALL Indiana Plan requirements and curriculum. Upon
graduation from the Indiana Plan program, the candidate will be certified by the Indiana Plan,
vetted, recorded and recommended to a large construction project team.
Workers who demonstrate the basic skills, education, and an intense desire to work, who may
be ex-offenders or have other social barriers, will be forwarded to the Work One staff. Once the
individual meets the basic requirements of the Indiana Plan program, the candidate will be
certified by the Indiana Plan, vetted, recorded and recommended to a large construction project
team.

B. Approval of August Minutes and Review of Meeting: L. DuBose asked committee
members to review minutes from previous meeting for approval.
August Meeting Recap: - L. DuBose
Items discussed at previous meeting include:
• Project’s mission statement
• Commitment from Partnership and Participation Forms
• Toxic Hazards Questionnaire
• National CARE Workshop 2008 – Gary Co-Host (November 18-20, 2008 in
Chicago, IL)
C. Mission Statement: The revised mission statement for the Gary CARE Partnership Project
was distributed to committee members.
D. Toxics / Hazards Feedback Questionnaire Results – Dr. L. Chary
Dr. Chary presented a visual presentation of the questionnaire results from previous meeting. A
total of eleven (11) responses were collected as of September 7, 2008. The most popular results
are as follows:
• The most important toxics to which Gary is exposed were identified as air pollution,
lead, and hazardous waste.
• Residents come in contact with toxins from the air, land, and homes.
• The most exposed are “everyone” and children.
• Who, What, and Where Exposures to toxics –
o Who: Children/infants; elderly; everyone
o What: Secondhand smoke
o Where: Homes, workplace, public places
Discussion followed. Dr. Chary stated that our goal is to link what we know with the identified
toxics. M. Mulligan mentioned that IUN Environmental Justice Resource Center has issue papers

on environmental issues that can be used as resources for our assessment. D. Carey stated that
our focus is to collect the concerns of partners around the table.
Dr. Chary asked committee member to comment on the results of the questionnaire. L. DuBose
recorded comments on chart and are as follows:
• Perceived ideas about / awareness of the environmental hazards are important
• Air pollution / lead advocacy / mold are most important
• Air pollution – not much attention placed on topic
• Hazards in the home (lead and mold) and inside mills – can be worse than outside
environment
• List of hazards identified by Partnership is adequate
• Statistics on identified hazards are needed
• Develop realistic goals and discussing second-hand smoke are important
These interactive activities will be conducted at each meeting in addition to sharing information
on the list of identified toxics. All presentations will be sent out electronically to members to
review prior to monthly meetings to promote more involvement and discussion.
E. Let’s Talk About Air Pollution Presentation: Dr. Chary made a presentation on Air
Pollution which included (websites to access additional information are also included for radon
and air pollution):
• Particulate Matter
• Ozone (O3)
• Secondhand Smoke
• Air Toxics
• Radon (http://www.epa.gov/radon/pubs/citguide.html)
• Air Pollution Sources (4) Questions to Think About
o http://www.epa.gov/air/toxicair/ There is a button there to click on for the guide
to toxics in the air.
o http://www.epa.gov/air/toxicair/community/guide.html
Toxics presentations during meetings are good venues to receive information; however, it will be
helpful for discussion to receive the information prior to meeting date for better interaction.
F. Partnership Commitment / MOU: L. DuBose asked partners to sign the signature page as
a committed partner and identify an alternative to represent their agency. Those present who had
not signed the form previously signed the form.
G. National CARE Workshop 2008: M. Millard discussed the National CARE Workshop
which will be held on November 17 - 20, 2008 in Chicago at Hotel Sax. Information to include
the workshop agenda was distributed to committee members. Gary will co-host the event.
Registration is available online and transportation will be provided.
H. Next Meeting: The next CARE Partnership Project meeting is scheduled for Tuesday,
October 14, 2008 from 10:30a to noon. The stipend process will be discussed.
Thanks to EPA and the Gary Community Health Foundation for refreshments and
accommodations. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 p.m.

OZONE ALERT
PLEASE POST
EFFECTIVE: Wednesday, July 27, 2011
The Evansville Environmental Protection Agency and the Vanderburgh County Health Department have issued an
OZONE ALERT for Wednesday, July 27, 2011 because ambient concentrations of ozone may reach or exceed the
level of the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone.
The current ozone NAAQS was set by the U.S. EPA in 2008 at an eight-hour average of 76 parts per billion (ppb).
Eight-hour ozone levels between 76 to 95 ppb are considered to be unhealthy for sensitive groups such as children and
active adults, and people with respiratory diseases like asthma on the Air Quality Index (AQI) scale.

Air Quality Index

Ozone 8-hr average

Good
Moderate
Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups
Unhealthy
Very Unhealthy

0-59 ppb
60-75 ppb
76-95 ppb
96-115 ppb
116-374 ppb

Within a few hours or days, exposure to higher levels of ozone can cause lung and throat irritation, shortness of breath,
increase the frequency of asthma attacks and aggravate respiratory diseases such as asthma, emphysema and bronchitis.
Children, active adults, and people with respiratory diseases should limit prolonged outdoor exertion especially between
12:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. when ozone levels are highest.
NO OPEN BURNING is allowed during Ozone Alerts. The use of gas and charcoal grills is permitted, but we
encourage postponing grilling until air quality improves.
To do your share to protect air quality and reduce pollution levels:
 USE PUBLIC TRANSIT – RIDE METS FREE ON OZONE ALERT DAYS!
 CONSERVE ENERGY of all kinds – turn off lights, reduce air conditioner use, etc.
 Limit your driving. Avoid unnecessary vehicle idling.
 Park and go inside instead of using drive-through windows, especially if there are long lines.
 Postpone fueling your vehicle until after 6:00 p.m. Don‟t „top-off‟ your tank when filling up.
 Consider using electric or manually operated lawn equipment. If you use gasoline-powered lawn and
garden equipment, stop working at 10:00 a.m. and / or postpone work until after 6:00 p.m.
 Limit the use of solvents, parts cleaning fluids, paint thinners and chemicals. Replace lids when finished.
 Postpone painting or use water-based paints instead of oil-based paints.

***** Groundbreaking Takes Place for Huntingburg Railroad Overpass Project
