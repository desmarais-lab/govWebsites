1.0 Authority. Pursuant to authority granted under “Ordinance of the City of Evansville,
Indiana Concerning Trees” Creating a Tree Advisory Board, and approved by the
Common Council of the City of Evansville, Indiana, on the 1st day of May, 2001,
having had the advice and assistance of the Tree Advisory Board, established in
said Ordinance, hereby promulgates the following as the Arboricultural
Specifications and Standards of Practice for the City of Evansville, Indiana,
hereinafter called the Arboricultural Specifications Manual.
2.0 Policy
2.1 All work on public trees shall comply with the “Ordinance of the City of Evansville,
Indiana Concerning Trees” of the City of Evansville, Indiana, and this
Arboricultural Specifications Manual.
2.2 The Arboricultural Specifications Manual shall be adhered to at all times, but it may
be amended at any time that experience, new research, or laws indicate that
improved methods or circumstances make it advisable, and only then with the
advice and assistance of the Tree Advisory Board, all as provided for in the
above said Ordinance.
2.3 The Arboricultural Specifications Manual, the standard for work performed on or with
trees on a daily basis, shall be updated by the Tree Advisory Board as needed.
The Tree Advisory Board shall have the authority to modify, amend, or extend
the Arboricultural Specifications Manual at any time that experience indicates
improved methods or whenever circumstances make it advisable.
2.4 The policy of the Tree Advisory Board shall be to cooperate at all times with the
public, property owners, other municipal departments, public utilities and with
appropriate not-for-profit organizations.
2.5 The Evansville City Arborist, in consultation with the Tree Advisory Board, shall
have the jurisdiction, authority, control, supervision, and direction over all trees

4

Last Revised 2/4/10

planted or growing in or upon public property, and the planting, removal, care,
maintenance, and protection thereof.
3.0 General Specifications
3.1 The Arboricultural Specifications contained in this document are to serve as a
standard for all work performed on or with all public trees and development
projects that include tree plantings as required by the Evansville Area Planning
Commission. These standards will apply whether the work is performed “inhouse”, contractually by private businesses, or by private individuals.
3.2 All terms used in this manual, which are defined in the “Ordinance of the City of
Evansville, Indiana Concerning Trees”, shall hold the same definition in this
manual.
3.3 A permit shall be obtained from the Tree Advisory Board, through the City Arborist’s
office, before any person, either for himself or another, prunes, removes, or
destroys any public tree.
3.4 All requests for bid specifications for landscaping should be reviewed by the City
Arborist and/or other qualified members of the Tree Advisory Board before they
are sent out to potential bidders. This will allow trained arborists and
horticulturists a chance to see whether items in the bid need to be altered for
long-term plant survival.
3.5 A site meeting shall be conducted between the contractor, the City Arborist, and a
representative from the public department responsible for the project before any
landscape work is to be performed. During such meeting the City Arborist shall
inform the contractor how all work shall be performed including, but not limited to,
proper planting techniques, proper irrigation techniques, proper mulching
techniques, and proper maintenance techniques. The City Arborist shall also
make clear to the contractor their responsibilities outlined in the contract for the
landscaping, and the contractor’s guarantee/warranty period for all vegetation
planted and/or maintained by them.
3.6 Oversight for contract administration of landscaping shall be performed by city
arborist. The City Arborist shall monitor, and regulate work done by the
landscape contractor(s) throughout the contract period. All non-compliance
issues of the contract by the contractor shall be reported to the public department
responsible for the project, and to the Tree Advisory Board. Follow up work and
routine maintenance work needed after the contract has been fulfilled shall be
determined by the City Arborist, and reported to the appropriate department.
3.7 It shall be unlawful for any person to engage in the business of cutting, trimming,
pruning, or removing any tree within the City of Evansville, for hire, without first
procuring a license as required by the “Ordinance of the City of Evansville,
Indiana Concerning Trees” codes 2.90.010 through 2.90.150.

5

Last Revised 2/4/10

3.8 Authorized work on or with public trees neither expresses nor implies a right to
violate any local, state, or federal law while in the process of performing such
work.
3.9 All such work shall be conducted in a manner as to cause the least possible
interference with, or annoyance, to others.
3.10 All personnel utilized for work on or with trees shall be trained to perform the work
properly and safely in accordance with these Arboricultural Specifications, and
ANSI standards.
3.11 Only a licensed tree pruner shall perform work on trees, except during
emergencies. An emergency shall be an instance when a public tree(s) has
been severely damaged by storms or other causes or is obstructing utility wires,
etc.
The Board of Public Works or public utilities may without permit resort to topping
or severe cutting back of limbs of public trees, but should report all such actions
to the Tree Advisory Board.
3.12 A licensed tree pruner is recommended, but shall not be required, for trees being
pruned or removed as part of a new development on public property, so long as
the project has been approved by Area Planning Commission. Tree preservation
and any tree pruning work that is required, shall be done in accordance with the
standards set forth in this manual.
3.13 Any use of tools and equipment for pruning, trimming, repairing, maintaining and
removing trees shall be in accordance with ANSI standards.
3.14 Approved street and sidewalk warning devices shall be in position as required at all
times while work on public trees is being performed. Adequate barricades and
other warning devices shall be placed and flagmen shall be stationed as
necessary for the safety of pedestrians and vehicles. All closures of public
rights-of-way shall be approved by the Evansville Safety Board.
3.15 Whenever overhead utility lines, gas lines, water lines, sewer lines, or other
improvements upon a public area are jeopardized by any authorized tree pruning
or removal activities, the proper authorities of the utilities involved shall be
consulted prior to performing any work activity and all requested precautions by
any such authority shall be followed. Those performing work shall be responsible
for having utilities located prior to planting, stump grinding, or any other type of
digging.
3.16 Companies that violate or ignore bid agreements during the installation or
maintenance of landscape plantings, or refuse to honor warranties, shall be

6

Last Revised 2/4/10

deemed a non-responsible bidder, and shall be denied an award on a bid for
landscaping for a period of no less than three years from the date of the violation.
3.17 All contracted landscape plantings shall have a minimum of two, or preferred three
year warranty. Bids should be worded such that landscape maintenance for a
minimum of two years, or for a preferred three year period, be performed by the
landscape installation company. Whoever plants landscaping on site shall be
responsible for their health. This will promote more conscientious planting
practices, and avoid the need to determine blame for tree failure.
3.18 All companies bidding on planting/maintenance must develop a complete postplanting maintenance program. This will include, but not be limited to: irrigation,
fertilization, pruning/training, and pest control. Pest control refers to controlling
insects, diseases, weeds, and other harmful agents.
4.0 Planting
4.1 Acceptable Tree Species. The Appendices contain lists of tree species or their
varieties and cultivars acceptable and approved for planting on public property.
No species other than those included in this list may be planted on public
property without written permission of the Tree Advisory Board.
4.2 Size. Unless otherwise specified by the Tree Advisory Board, all species and their
cultivars or varieties shall conform to ANSI standards.
•
•
•
•
•

Medium and Large trees (listed in Tables II and III) – 2½” caliper;
Small trees (listed in Table I) – 1½” caliper;
Medium and large evergreen trees and multi-stem trees – 12’ height
Small evergreen trees and multi-trunk trees – 10’ height
Shrubs – 5-gallon containers or equivalent balled and burlapped.

4.3 Grade. Unless otherwise allowed for specific reasons, all trees shall have
comparatively straight trunks (except for those that are multi-trunk), well
developed leaders and tops, and the roots shall not only be characteristic of the
species, cultivar or variety, but also shall exhibit evidence of proper nursery
pruning practices. They shall have acceptable balance between top and root. At
the time of planting, all trees must be free of mechanical injuries, and other
objectionable features that tend to affect the future form and health of the plant.
4.4 Location and Spacing.
4.4.1 Pavement and tree spacing for street trees and trees in public areas.
The distance that trees may be planted from curbs, curb lines and sidewalks may
be no closer than the following: Small trees, two (2) feet; Medium and Large
trees, three (3) feet.

7

Last Revised 2/4/10

4.4.2 Pavement and tree spacing for trees in parking lots. The distance that
trees may be planted from curbs, curb lines and sidewalks may be no closer than
the following: Small trees, three (3) feet; Medium trees, four (4) feet; and Large
trees, five (5) feet.
4.4.3 Driveways, Alleys and Intersections. Trees shall be planted at least
fifteen (15) feet from driveways and alleys. No street trees shall be planted at an
intersection corner within 25 feet of the curved intersection.
4.4.4 Utilities. No tree, other than those listed as small trees in the appendices
of this manual, may be planted within twenty (25) feet of any overhead utility
wire. Minimal planting distances from overhead utility wires should be based
upon mature tree height and spread. Species shall be selected for planting
under utility wires so that the maximum height of the trees at maturity will not be
the same or more as the height of the lowest electrical transmission wire. Trees
that have canopy heights exceeding the height of transmission wires shall be
spaced from utility poles at least a minimum of one-half (1/2) of their total mature
canopy spread plus ten (10) feet.
4.4.5 Other Utilities. Shade trees shall not be planted closer than fifteen (15)
feet from all lampposts and should allow for proper lighting. Trees planted near
light posts shall be monitored, and pruned as needed, to prevent obstruction of
light.
4.4.6 Spacing Between Trees. As a general recommendation, trees and shrubs
should be spaced so that they are separated by a minimum of one-third (1/3) of
their total mature canopy spread.
4.4.7 Miscellaneous. All planting on unpaved streets without curbs or sidewalks
must have the approval of the Tree Advisory Board, who shall determine the
location of the tree, so that it will not be injured or destroyed when the street is
curbed and paved, or when sidewalks are constructed. No street tree shall be
planted within ten (10) feet of any fire hydrant or stop sign. Where overhead
lines or building setback presents a special problem, the selection of planting site
and species shall be determined by the Tree Advisory Board.
4.5 Tree Transport and Storage. Trees shall be transported fully covered by tarp(s) to
prevent them from drying out and getting wind burn. During transport and
storage roots and root balls shall be routinely inspected and watered as
necessary to prevent from drying out. If proper moisture content of roots and
root balls cannot be maintained on site, they shall be healed in properly until they
are planted.
4.6 Tree Inspection. Trees shall be inspected for proper root to shoot ratio before
being accepted according to ANSI Z60.1-2004, and shall be replaced with
acceptable root stock when rejected. Trees shall also be rejected if they have

8

Last Revised 2/4/10

defects or have poor structure for that species. Balled and burlapped trees shall
have burlap removed from top of root ball to inspect root collar depth to
determine if the tree is acceptable.
4.7 Tree Planting Method.
4.7.1 Planting Depth and Width. The hole for tree planting shall be dug to the
depth of the measurement of the tree being planted from the root flare to the
bottom of the root ball. Care shall be taken to not confuse the tree graft, if one is
present, with the root flare (see figure 1). The root flare of trees that are
containerized or balled and burlapped shall be exposed to determine this
measurement before digging. Pits for the planting of trees shall be at least three
times wider than the diameter of the roots or root ball. The edges of planting pits
shall be scarified to prevent glazing of soil after digging.

Figure 1. Root Graft Vs. Root Collar (Flare)
4.7.2 Removal of Foreign Objects. Brick, rock, foreign roots, and other debris
that is not considered soil shall be removed from planting pits. Burlap, ropes,
and wires shall be either entirely removed from balled and burlapped trees, or cut
back at least 1/3rd down the sides of the root ball before backfill is used. Soil
may also be completely removed from balled and burlapped trees so long as
roots are not damaged. Containers shall be completely removed from trees
before planting containerized trees, and containerized tree roots shall be pruned
and spread apart as necessary to improve future root growth and prevent root
girdling. Roots of the trees shall be kept damp during these processes to prevent
drying out.
4.7.3 Tree Placement. The tree shall be centered in the planting hole with the
tree completely upright and with the root collar between zero to one inches above
ground level, and absolutely no lower than ground level. If the root collar is not at
ground level, soil shall be added or removed from the bottom of the pit until the

9

Last Revised 2/4/10

proper height is achieved. If soil is placed into pit to adjust root collar depth it
shall be tamped down before backfilling.
4.7.4 Amendments. Only the original soil removed shall be used as backfill, and
no soil amendments shall be used, unless the entire site is being amended with
the same amendment material and at the same percentage of amendment
uniformly.
4.7.5 Backfilling and Watering. As soil is placed into hole, clumps of soil shall
be broken up to a maximum size of ½ inch size clumps. Water shall be used
during backfilling intermittently to improve soil settling. When the planting is
completed, the entire root area shall be thoroughly saturated with water. Care
shall be taken to prevent the tree from becoming off center during this process.
4.7.6 Staking. Tree trunks shall be guyed, or supported in an upright position,
according to accepted arboricultural practices. The guys or supports shall be
installed so that they will neither girdle or cause serious injury to the tree nor
endanger public safety. Tree stakes, guy wires, and supports for trees shall be
removed the spring following the first full growing season.
4.7.7 Trunk Protection.Tree trunk protectors, if used, shall consist of wire mesh
screen, which shall be placed around trunk loosly in a way that it can be slid up
and down the trunk, unimpeded, and shall not be tied to the trunk, but shall be
attached to itself in the manner of a loose tube around the tree (see figure 2).
Trunk protection shall be removed the spring after the first full growing season.

Figure 2: Trunk Protection.
4.7.8 Tree Grates and Mulch. Organic mulch shall be immediately placed
around trees after planting for a minimum distance of three feet, or to the edge of
pavement, whichever comes first. The mulch layer shall be applied at a minimum
height of two inches, to a maximum height of four inches. Excessive mulch will
not be piled against the tree trunk (mulch volcano), and all mulch shall be pulled
away from the trunk one inch (1”). Acceptable mulch materials include wood

10

Last Revised 2/4/10

chips, shredded bark, bark nuggets, and similar products. No other mulch
material may be substituted without authorization from the Tree Advisory Board.
Grates shall not be used around trees.

Mulch shall be
pulled one inch
from trunk of the
tree

The root collar/flare shall be
0 to 1 inches above ground
level and not planted under
ground level

Hole should be dug 3 times
the width of the root ball

Mulch shall be 2 to 4 inches thick, in a flat ring around the tree
Use no
amendments or
fertilizers in fill

Cut wires,
rope and
burlap more
rd
than 1/3
down from top
of root ball

Figure 3: Proper tree planting.
5.0 Newly Planted Tree Care.
5.1 General. Newly planted trees (trees planted within 3 years), shrubs and other
plants shall require special maintenance for two or three growing seasons
following planting. All maintenance practices shall follow approved arboricultural
standards.
5.2 Watering. Trees shall be watered when one inch of rain water has not fallen within
7 days, or within 7 days of last watering. Proper watering of trees shall consist of
the equivalent of one inch of rain (1/2 gallon per square foot of soil) for the root
zone per tree per week. Gator Bags can be used, but must be completely filled
once per week for proper watering. Programmable or manual irrigation systems
may also be used, but shall be programmed or run only once per week after lawn
is established. To prevent overwatering of trees, irrigation that is required to run
more than once per week for other vegetation shall be set separately from the
irrigation that is installed for watering trees.
5.3 Fertilization. Fertilization of trees should not be needed for trees unless a nutrient
deficiency has been observed and shall only occur after approved by the Tree

11

Last Revised 2/4/10

Advisory Board. Fertilization of public trees shall follow ANSI standards or other
accepted arboricultural standards. Fertilization, if deemed necessary, shall be
done according to soil nutrient deficiencies, and current lawn and landscaping
fertilization shall be calculated, before fertilization mixes and a rates are
calculated. Only broadcast fertilization of wet or dry fertilizers over root system of
tree shall be accepted unless otherwise approved by the Tree Advisory Board.
5.4 Insect and Disease Control. Tree species that are resistant to insects and
diseases should be selected for plantings. Frequent and thorough inspections
shall be made to determine when measures for the control of insects and
diseases shall be taken. Before chemicals are used to resolve pest and disease
issues, the specific tree species and pest shall be properly identified to ensure
proper control method and alternative controls should be considered in the place
of chemicals. If fungicides, herbicides or pesticides are required to be applied for
controlling disease, pests or weeds, they must be applied by an Indiana Licensed
Pesticide Applicator, or by an employee working under direct supervision of a
licensed applicator who is within direct contact of the employer, as per the
regulations set forth by the Office of the Indiana State Chemist.
5.5 Pruning. Pruning newly planted trees shall consist of removing dead, broken, or
injured branches, water sprouts, and the suppression of uneven growth that
affects form. Pruning shall be practiced as often thereafter as needed to assure
strong branch unions. Newly planted trees need not have lower branches
removed until they are well established, or unless the branches visually or
physically obstruct paved right-of-ways and signs. Pruning of public trees shall
follow ANSI standards or other accepted arboricultural standards.
6.0 Established Tree Care.
6.1 Pruning and Removal. No topping of trees shall be permitted. All large,
established trees shall be pruned to a height of at least eight (8) feet above
sidewalks and twelve (12) feet above streets. All cuts shall be made with a saw
or pruner and only at the nodes or crotches. No stubs shall be left. No spurs or
climbing irons shall be used to climb trees, except when trees are to be removed
or during an emergency rescue. All dead branches shall be removed; branches
that cross or rub should be pruned to eliminate future problems. The stumps of
all removed trees shall be cut to at least six (6) inches below the ground level
where feasible. Stump grindings shall be hauled off, and the soil cavity shall be
filled with top soil, tamped, leveled and re-seeded. Pruning of public trees shall
follow ANSI standards or other accepted arboricultural standards.
6.2 Insect and Disease Control. Before chemicals are used to resolve pest and
disease issues, the specific tree species and pest shall be properly identified to
ensure proper control method and alternative controls should be considered in
the place of chemicals. If fungicides, herbicides or pesticides are required to be
applied for controlling disease, pests or weeds, they must be applied by an

12

Last Revised 2/4/10

Indiana Licensed Pesticide Applicator, or by an employee working under direct
supervision of a licensed applicator who is within direct contact of the employer,
as per the regulations set forth by the Office of the Indiana State Chemist.

6.3 Fertilization. Fertilization of trees should not be needed unless a nutrient
deficiency has been observed and shall only occur after approved by the Tree
Advisory Board. Fertilization of public trees shall follow ANSI standards or other
accepted arboricultural standards. Fertilization, if deemed necessary, shall be
done according to soil nutrient deficiencies, and current lawn and landscaping
fertilization shall be calculated, before fertilization mixes and a rates are
calculated. Only broadcast fertilization of wet or dry fertilizers over root system of
tree shall be accepted unless otherwise approved by the Tree Advisory Board.
6.4 Cabling and Bracing. As a general rule, cables should be located above the
crotch at a point approximately two-thirds (2/3) of the distance between the
crotch and tops of the branch ends. Rust-resistant cables, thimbles, and lags
should be used. The ends of a cable should be attached to hooks or eyes of lags
or bolts inserted near the ends of the branches; thimbles must be used in the eye
splice in each end of the cable. In no instance shall cable be wrapped around a
branch. All cabling and bracing practices shall follow ANSI standards or other
accepted arboricultural standards. Cabling and bracing shall only be performed
by a Certified Arborist.
7.0 Tree Protection.
7.1 Protection or Removal. In the circumstances where construction and utility
operations underground will affect the health of a tree, a determination will be
made considering the overall value of the tree. The criteria for determining a
value for a tree will be based on species, size, condition, location, cost of
preserving the tree, and urgency of work to be completed. A decision based on
this value will be made concerning the protection or removal of the tree in
question. This decision shall be made jointly by the Tree Advisory Board and the
City Engineer or appropriate city official.
7.2 Construction Zone. Existing trees in or near areas to be developed (construction
sites) shall be guarded with temporary fencing. Placement of the fence is to be
at a minimum distance of one and a half feet (1.5’) for each inch in trunk
diameter measured at breast height (4½ feet). All vehicles, construction
equipment, building materials, dirt, or other debris shall be kept outside of the
barrier.
7.3 Root Pruning. When large roots are to be cut during trenching or grading, pruning
of roots must be done with the proper pruning equipment. Clean, flush, smooth
cuts shall be made on tree roots.

13

Last Revised 2/4/10

7.4 Underground Utilities. All installations of underground utilities upon public
property, which may conflict with tree roots, are subject to the review and the
approval of the Tree Advisory Board before the project starts. All installations
through tree drip-line areas should follow approved tunneling methods.

animal(s) can be completely dry and out of the wind,
can heat the enclosed space with its own body heat
with the assistance of bedding (e.g. straw or blanket),
and has adequate ventilation to provide fresh air. If the
animal is placed into an outdoor enclosure (e.g. kennel
or pen) the enclosure must be a minimum of 100
square feet in size (10’ x 10’) and be constructed of
material that is sturdy enough to prevent escape and
must contain within it a dog house or shelter as

2. Orientation
A. Model File Drawings
Model File Drawings shall be oriented so that the entire project
area and model is created in (Autodesk) model space and all other
requirements of the CADD Standards are met.
B. Sheet File Drawings
Sheet File Drawings shall be oriented so that the entire project area
is shown on one drawing view if possible. If not possible, standard
match lines shall be used to designate which sheet or view the
project continues on.
Drawing views shall be oriented so that north is toward the top or
the right of the sheet if practical. The most appropriate method
which allows more of the project improvement (route) to be viewed
shall be used.
Drawing views shall be oriented so that the project improvement
route is as parallel as possible with the edges of the sheet title block
and centered within the view.
The plan view generally should be shown on the same sheet as the
profile view with the plan view located at the top of the sheet and
the profile view at the bottom. The alignment stationing on the
plan view shall line up horizontally with the profile view within the
sheet when possible. Profile views shall be oriented so that
alignment stationing begins at the left side of the sheet and
stationing increases as it approaches the right of the sheet.
A sample plan and profile sheet is available in Exhibit CADD5-7.
Cross-section views shall be shown with sections looking up station
and placed on the sheet progressing from the bottom of the sheet
for lower stations to the top of the sheet for higher stations and left
to right if more than one column of cross-sections is presented.
C. Maps
Vicinity and location maps shall be oriented with north toward the
top of the sheet.

sheet layout, as specified in Chapter CADD4 - Organization except for the
module lines and drawing area coordinates. In addition, the Title Sheet
shall include other components and information within the drawing area
unique to the project.
A project location map and standard north arrow shall be placed within
the pre-built viewport at the accommodating preferred scale so that at
least two major arterial or collector streets are shown (referenced from
model space) near the project location area; preferably intersecting each
other. Generally, in addition to annotation, hatching and symbols, only
right-of-way lines are shown to represent streets.
A vicinity map showing the approximate project location shall be placed
to the right of the project location map at the accommodating preferred
scale or be labeled N.T.S (not to scale). The vicinity map shall show major
arterial or collector street centerlines with street labels and be oriented
with north toward the top of the sheet.
On projects with a small amount of sheets (less than 11), a sheet index
schedule may be placed, centered to the right of the project location map
viewport and below the vicinity map. On larger projects, the sheet index
schedule should go on a separate sheet such as the sheet (layout) index
sheet or general notes sheet.
The additional components and title sheet layout requirements, including
layers, text styles and sizes, utility oversight board, CUE project staff
names, etc., are pre-built into CUE AutoCAD/Civil 3D DWT and DWG
templates. Refer to Exhibit CADD5-1 for an example of a Title sheet.

CADD5.12 Sheet Types
Sheet types shall consist of scaled views and non-scaled views. Scaled views
shall be plans, elevations, sections, large-scale plans, and details. Non-scaled
views shall be diagrams, 3D representations, details and schedules.
Each sheet type shall include the subject matter and minimum information
designated below within each sheet type requirement section. However, on
small projects, different subject matter or information may be combined on
the same sheet. For example, a sheet layout index and general notes may be
shown on the same sheet.
In instances where subject matter or information is combined, each separate
subject matter or information shall be clearly labeled.

Large-scale views are drawings reproduced at a larger scale to provide
more detailed information that cannot be accommodated at the smallerscaled drawing. Sometimes, a large-scale view can be accommodated
and shown within the same sheet that the enlarged area is located on. If
this cannot be accomplished, then a type 4 sheet may be created.
Examples of large-scale views are pump or lift stations, floor plans or
areas of civil plans where the amount of detail needed, requires a larger
view.
Areas to be shown at a larger scale shall have a dashed line placed
around the area to be enlarged. The information shall only be shown in
one of the views, the large-scaled view or standard scale view. Figure

Last Revised 12/3/15

3.0 General Specifications
3.1 The specifications contained in this document are to serve as a standard for all work
performed on or with all public trees, development projects that include tree
plantings as required by the Evansville Area Planning Commission, or public
projects involving privately owned trees paid for with public funds. These
standards will apply whether the work is performed “in-house”, contractually by
private businesses, or by private individuals.
3.2 All terms used in this manual, which are defined in the “Ordinance of the City of
Evansville, Indiana Concerning Trees”, shall hold the same definition in this
manual.
3.3 A permit shall be obtained from the Tree Advisory Board, through the City Arborist’s
office, before any person, either for himself or another, prunes, removes, or
destroys any public tree.
3.4 All requests for bid specifications for public landscape projects should be reviewed
by the City Arborist and/or other qualified members of the Tree Advisory Board
before they are sent out to potential bidders. This will allow trained arborists and
horticulturists a chance to see whether items in the bid need to be altered for
long-term plant survival. Necessary? Restrictive?
3.5 A site meeting shall be conducted between the contractor, the City Arborist, and a
representative from the public department responsible for the project before any
landscape work is to be performed. During such meeting the City Arborist shall
inform the contractor how all work shall be performed including, but not limited to,
proper planting techniques, proper irrigation techniques, proper mulching
techniques, and proper maintenance techniques. The City Arborist shall also
make clear to the contractor their responsibilities outlined in the contract for the
landscaping, and the contractor’s guarantee/warranty period for all vegetation
planted and/or maintained by them.
3.6 The City Arborist shall monitor, and regulate work done by the landscape
contractor(s) throughout the contract period. All non-compliance issues of the
contract by the contractor shall be reported to the public department responsible
for the project, and to the Tree Advisory Board. Follow up work and routine
maintenance work needed after the contract has been fulfilled shall be
determined by the City Arborist, and reported to the appropriate department.
3.7 It shall be unlawful for any person to engage in the business of cutting, trimming,
pruning, or removing any tree within the City of Evansville, for hire, without first
procuring a license as required by the “Ordinance of the City of Evansville,
Indiana Concerning Trees” codes 2.90.010 through 2.90.150.

5

Last Revised 12/3/15

3.8 Authorized work on or with public trees neither expresses nor implies a right to
violate any local, state, or federal law while in the process of performing such
work.
3.9 All such work shall be conducted in a manner as to cause the least possible
interference with, or annoyance, to others.
3.10 All personnel utilized for work on or with trees shall be trained to perform the work
properly and safely in accordance with these Arboricultural Specifications, and
ANSI standards.
3.11 Only a licensed tree pruner shall perform work on trees, except during
emergencies. An emergency shall be an instance when a public tree(s) has
been severely damaged by storms or other causes or is obstructing utility wires,
etc.
The Board of Public Works or public utilities may without permit resort to topping
or severe cutting back of limbs of public trees, but should report all such actions
to the Tree Advisory Board.
3.12 A licensed tree pruner is recommended, but shall not be required, for trees being
pruned or removed as part of a new development on public property, so long as
the project has been approved by Area Planning Commission. Tree preservation
and any tree pruning work that is required, shall be done in accordance with the
standards set forth in this manual.
3.13 Any use of tools and equipment for pruning, trimming, repairing, maintaining and
removing trees shall be in accordance with ANSI standards.
3.14 Approved street and sidewalk warning devices shall be in position as required at all
times while work on public trees is being performed. Adequate barricades and
other warning devices shall be placed and flagmen shall be stationed as
necessary for the safety of pedestrians and vehicles. All street restrictions or
closures of public rights-of-way shall be approved by the Evansville Safety
Board.
3.15 Whenever overhead utility lines, gas lines, water lines, sewer lines, or other
improvements upon a public area are jeopardized by any authorized tree pruning
or removal activities, the proper authorities of the utilities involved shall be
consulted prior to performing any work activity and all requested precautions by
any such authority shall be followed. Those performing work shall be responsible
for having utilities located prior to planting, stump grinding, or any other type of
digging.
3.16 Companies that violate or ignore bid agreements during the installation or
maintenance of landscape plantings, or refuse to honor warranties, shall be

6

Last Revised 12/3/15

deemed a non-responsible bidder, and shall be denied an award on a bid for
landscaping for a period of no less than three years from the date of the violation.
3.17 All contracted landscape plantings shall have a minimum of two, or preferred three
year warranty, and landscape contracts worded accordingly. Whoever plants
landscaping on site shall be responsible for their health. This will promote more
conscientious planting practices, and avoid the need to determine blame for tree
failure.
3.18 All companies bidding on planting/maintenance must develop a complete postplanting maintenance program. This will include, but not be limited to: irrigation,
fertilization, pruning/training, and pest control. Pest control refers to controlling
insects, diseases, weeds, and other harmful agents.
4.0 Planting
4.1 Acceptable Tree Species. The Appendices contain lists of tree species or their
varieties and cultivars acceptable and approved for planting on public property.
No species other than those included in this list may be planted on public
property without written permission of the Tree Advisory Board.
4.2 Size. Unless otherwise specified by the Tree Advisory Board, all species and their
cultivars or varieties shall conform to ANSI standards.
•
•
•
•
•

Medium and Large trees (listed in Tables II and III) – 2½” caliper;
Small trees (listed in Table I) – 1½” caliper;
Medium and large evergreen trees and multi-stem trees – 12’ height
Small evergreen trees and multi-trunk trees – 10’ height
Shrubs – 5-gallon containers or equivalent balled and burlapped.

4.3 Grade. Unless otherwise allowed for specific reasons, all trees shall have
comparatively straight trunks (except for those that are selected to be multitrunk), well developed leaders and tops, and the roots shall not only be
characteristic of the species, cultivar or variety, but also shall exhibit evidence of
proper nursery pruning practices. They shall have acceptable balance between
top and root. At the time of planting, all trees must be free of mechanical injuries,
and other objectionable features that tend to affect the future form and health of
the plant.
4.4 Location and Spacing.
4.4.1 Pavement and tree spacing for street trees and trees in public areas.
The distance that trees may be planted from curbs, curb lines and sidewalks may
be no closer than the following: Small trees, two (2) feet; Medium and Large
trees, three (3) feet.

7

Last Revised 12/3/15

4.4.2 Pavement and tree spacing for trees in parking lots. The distance that
trees may be planted from curbs, curb lines and sidewalks may be no closer than
the following: Small trees, three (3) feet; Medium trees, four (4) feet; and Large
trees, five (5) feet.
4.4.3 Driveways, Alleys and Intersections. Trees shall be planted at least
fifteen (15) feet from driveways and alleys. No street trees shall be planted at an
intersection corner within 25 feet of the curved intersection.
4.4.4 Utilities. No tree, other than those listed as small trees in the appendices
of this manual, may be planted within twenty (25) feet of any overhead utility
wire. Minimal planting distances from overhead utility wires should be based
upon mature tree height and spread (See Figure 1). Species shall be selected
for planting under utility wires so that the maximum height of the trees at maturity
will not be the same or more as the height of the lowest electrical transmission
wire. Trees that have canopy heights exceeding the height of transmission wires
shall be spaced from utility poles at least a minimum of one-half (1/2) of their total
mature canopy spread plus ten (10) feet.

Figure 1: Proper placement of trees near power lines.
4.4.5 Other Utilities. Shade trees shall not be planted closer than fifteen (15)
feet from all lampposts and should allow for proper lighting. Trees planted near
light posts shall be monitored, and pruned as needed, to prevent obstruction of
light.
4.4.6 Spacing Between Trees. As a general recommendation, trees and shrubs
should be spaced so that they are separated by a minimum of one-third (1/3) of
their total mature canopy spread.

8

Last Revised 12/3/15

4.4.7 Miscellaneous. All planting on unpaved streets without curbs or sidewalks
must have the approval of the Tree Advisory Board, who shall determine the
location of the tree, so that it will not be injured or destroyed when the street is
curbed and paved, or when sidewalks are constructed. No street tree shall be
planted within ten (10) feet of any fire hydrant or stop sign. Where overhead
lines or building setback presents a special problem, the selection of planting site
and species shall be determined by the Tree Advisory Board.
4.5 Tree Transport and Storage. Trees shall be transported fully covered by tarp(s) to
prevent them from drying out and getting wind burn, or if no way to cover trees,
then the vehicle shall be driven no faster than twenty five miles per hour (25
mph). During transport storage roots and root balls shall be routinely inspected
and watered as necessary to prevent from drying out. If proper moisture content
of roots and root balls cannot be maintained on site, they shall be healed in
properly until they are planted.
4.6 Tree Inspection. Trees shall be inspected for proper root to shoot ratio before
being accepted according to the latest edition of the ANSI Z60.1 standards, and
shall be replaced with acceptable root stock when rejected. Trees shall also be
rejected if they have defects or have poor structure for that species. Balled and
burlapped trees shall have burlap removed from top of root ball to inspect root
collar depth to determine if the tree is acceptable. If vendor selling trees claims
that doing so will void warranty, then a different vendor shall be selected for
purchase of trees.
4.7 Tree Planting Method.
4.7.1 Planting Depth and Width. The hole for tree planting shall be dug to the
depth of the measurement of the tree being planted from the root flare to the
bottom of the root ball. Care shall be taken to not confuse the tree graft, if one is
present, with the root flare (see figure 2). The root flare of trees that are
containerized or balled and burlapped shall be exposed to determine this
measurement before digging. Holes dug for the planting of trees shall be at least
three times wider than the diameter of the roots or root ball. The edges of
planting pits shall be scarified to prevent glazing of soil after digging.
4.7.2 Removal of Foreign Objects. Brick, rock, foreign roots, and other debris
that is not considered soil shall be removed from planting pits. Burlap, ropes,
and wires shall be either entirely removed from balled and burlapped trees, or cut
back at least ½ down the sides of the root ball before backfill is used. Soil may
be allowed to fall off or removed from roots, so long as roots are not damaged
and kept from drying. Containers shall be completely removed from trees before
planting containerized trees, and containerized tree roots shall be pruned and/or
spread apart as necessary to improve future root growth and prevent root
girdling. Roots of the trees shall be kept damp during these processes to prevent
drying out.

Figure 2. Root Graft Vs. Root Collar (Flare)
4.7.3 Tree Placement. The tree shall be centered in the planting hole with the
tree completely upright and with the root collar between zero to one inches above
ground level, and absolutely no lower than ground level. If the root collar is not at
ground level, soil shall be added or removed from the bottom of the pit until the
proper height is achieved. If soil is placed into pit to adjust root collar depth it
shall be tamped down before backfilling.

Mulch shall be
pulled one inch
from trunk of the
tree

The root collar/flare shall be
0 to 1 inches above ground
level and not planted under
ground level

Hole should be dug 3 times
the width of the root ball

Mulch shall be 2 to 4 inches thick, in a flat ring around the tree
Use no
amendments or
fertilizers in fill

Cut wires,
rope and
burlap more
than 1/2 down
from top of

4.7.4 Amendments. Only the original soil removed shall be used as backfill, and
no soil amendments shall be used, unless the entire site is being amended with
the same amendment material and at the same percentage of amendment
uniformly.
4.7.5 Backfilling and Watering. As soil is placed into hole, clumps of soil shall
be broken up to a maximum size of ½ inch size clumps. Water shall be used
during backfilling intermittently to improve soil settling. When the planting is
completed, the entire root area shall be thoroughly saturated with water. Care
shall be taken to prevent the tree from becoming off center during this process.
4.7.6 Staking. Tree trunks shall be guyed, or supported in an upright position,
according to accepted arboricultural practices. The guys or supports shall be
installed so that they will neither girdle or cause serious injury to the tree nor
endanger public safety. Tree stakes, guy wires, and supports for trees shall be
removed the spring following the first full growing season.
4.7.7 Trunk Protection to Prevent Sun Scald. Tree trunk protectors, if used,
shall consist of wire mesh screen, which shall be placed around trunk loosely in a
way that it can be slid up and down the trunk, unimpeded, and shall not be tied to
the trunk, but shall be attached to itself in the manner of a loose tube around the
tree (see figure 3). Trunk protection shall be removed the spring after the first full
growing season.

Figure 3: Trunk Protection.
4.7.8 Tree Grates and Mulch. Organic mulch shall be immediately placed
around trees to the edge of the planting hole that was dug, or to the edge of
pavement, whichever comes first. The mulch layer shall be applied at a minimum
height of two inches, to a maximum height of four inches. Excessive mulch will
not be piled against the tree trunk, and all mulch shall be pulled away from the
trunk one inch (1”). Acceptable mulch materials include wood chips, shredded
bark, bark nuggets, and similar products. No other mulch material may be

11

Last Revised 12/3/15

substituted without authorization from the Tree Advisory Board. Grates shall not
be used around trees.
5.0 Newly Planted Tree Care.
5.1 General. Newly planted trees (trees planted within 3 years), shrubs and other
plants shall require special maintenance for two or three growing seasons
following planting. All maintenance practices shall follow approved arboricultural
standards.
5.2 Watering. Trees shall be watered when one inch of rain water has not fallen within
7 days, or within 7 days of last watering. Proper watering of trees shall consist of
the equivalent of one inch of rain (1/2 gallon per square foot of soil) for the root
zone per tree per week. Gator Bags can be used, but must be completely filled
once per week for proper watering. Programmable or manual irrigation systems
may also be used, but shall be programmed or run only once per week after lawn
is established. To prevent overwatering of trees, irrigation that is required to run
more than once per week for other vegetation shall be set separately from the
irrigation that is installed for watering trees.
5.3 Fertilization. Fertilization of individual trees should not be performed in the first
growing season after planting. The bed the tree is in may be fertilized prior to
planting if it is necessary as determined by soil testing done through a certified
soil lab. Fertilization of public trees shall follow ANSI standards or other
accepted arboricultural standards. Only broadcast fertilization of wet or dry
fertilizers over root system of tree shall be accepted unless otherwise approved
by the Tree Advisory Board.
5.4 Insect and Disease Control. Tree species and cultivars that are resistant to
insects and diseases should be selected for plantings. Frequent and thorough
inspections shall be made to determine when measures for the control of insects
and diseases shall be taken. Before chemicals are used to resolve pest and
disease issues, the specific tree species and pest shall be properly identified to
ensure proper control method and alternative controls should be considered in
the place of chemicals. If fungicides, herbicides or pesticides are required to be
applied for controlling disease, pests or weeds, they must be applied by an
Indiana Licensed Pesticide Applicator, or by an employee working under direct
supervision of a licensed applicator who is within direct contact of the supervisor,
as per the regulations set forth by the Office of the Indiana State Chemist.
5.5 Pruning. Pruning newly planted trees shall consist of removing dead, broken, or
injured branches, water sprouts, and the suppression of uneven growth that
affects form. Pruning shall be practiced as often thereafter as needed to assure
strong branch unions. Newly planted trees need not have lower branches
removed until they are well established, or unless the branches visually or

12

Last Revised 12/3/15

physically obstruct paved right-of-ways and signs. Pruning of public trees shall
follow ANSI standards or other accepted arboricultural standards.
6.0 Established Tree Care.
6.1 Pruning and Removal. No topping of trees shall be permitted. All large,
established trees shall be pruned to a height of at least eight (8) feet above
sidewalks and twelve (12) feet above streets. All cuts shall be made with a saw
or pruner and only at the nodes or crotches. No stubs shall be left. No spurs or
climbing irons shall be used to climb trees, except when trees are to be removed
or during an emergency rescue. All dead branches shall be removed; branches
that cross or rub should be pruned to eliminate future problems. The stumps of
all removed trees shall be cut to at least six (6) inches below the ground level
where feasible. Stump grindings shall be hauled off, and the soil cavity shall be
filled with top soil, tamped, leveled and re-seeded. Pruning of public trees shall
follow ANSI standards or other accepted arboricultural standards.
6.2 Insect and Disease Control. Before chemicals are used to resolve pest and
disease issues, the specific tree species and pest shall be properly identified to
ensure proper control method and alternative controls should be considered in
the place of chemicals. If fungicides, herbicides or pesticides are required to be
applied for controlling disease, pests or weeds, they must be applied by an
Indiana Licensed Pesticide Applicator, or by an employee working under direct
supervision of a licensed applicator who is within direct contact of the employer,
as per the regulations set forth by the Office of the Indiana State Chemist.
6.3 Fertilization. Fertilization of established trees should not be needed for trees
unless a nutrient deficiency has been determined through soil testing by a
certified soil laboratory. Fertilization of public trees shall follow ANSI standards
or other accepted arboricultural standards. Fertilization, if deemed necessary,
shall be done according to soil nutrient deficiencies, and current lawn and
landscaping fertilization shall be calculated, before fertilization mixes and a rates
are calculated. Only broadcast fertilization of wet or dry fertilizers over root
system of tree shall be accepted unless otherwise approved by the Tree Advisory
Board.
6.4 Cabling and Bracing. As a general rule, cables should be located above the
crotch at a point approximately two-thirds (2/3) of the distance between the
crotch and tops of the branch ends. Rust-resistant cables, thimbles, and lags
should be used. The ends of a cable should be attached to hooks or eyes of lags
or bolts inserted near the ends of the branches; thimbles must be used in the eye
splice in each end of the cable. In no instance shall cable be wrapped around a
branch. All cabling and bracing practices shall follow ANSI standards or other
accepted arboricultural standards. Cabling and bracing shall only be performed
by a Certified Arborist.

7.0 Tree Protection.
7.1 Protection or Removal. In the circumstances where construction and utility
operations underground will affect the health of a tree, a determination will be
made considering the overall value of the tree. The criteria for determining a
value for a tree will be based on species, size, condition, location, cost of
preserving the tree, and urgency of work to be completed. A decision based on
this value will be made concerning the protection or removal of the tree in
question. This decision shall be made jointly by the Tree Advisory Board and the
City Engineer or appropriate city official.
7.2 Construction Zone. Existing trees in or near areas to be developed (construction
sites) shall be guarded with temporary fencing. Placement of the fence is to be
at a minimum distance of one and a half feet (1.5’) for each inch in trunk
diameter measured at breast height (4½ feet). All vehicles, construction
equipment, building materials, dirt, or other debris shall be kept outside of the
barrier.
7.3 Root Pruning. When large roots are to be cut during trenching or grading, pruning
of roots must be done with the proper pruning equipment. Clean, flush, smooth
cuts shall be made on tree roots.
7.4 Underground Utilities. All installations of underground utilities upon public
property, which may conflict with tree roots, are subject to the review and the
approval of the Tree Advisory Board before the project starts. All installations
through tree drip-line areas should follow approved tunneling methods.
7.5 Preventing Lawn mower and Weed Eater Damage Around Trees. In an effort to
minimize damage to the trunks of trees during lawn care operations one of, or a
combination of, the following methods shall be used when performing lawn
maintenance around trees with a trunk diameter of less than 12 inches,
measured 6 inches above ground level. Other methods must be approved by the
Tree Advisory Board.
7.5.1 Education of Mowing Personnel. Those contracted or employed by the
city to perform lawn maintenance shall be instructed not to damage tree trunks
with mowers, weed eaters, or lawn equipment, and shall be shown alternative
ways of removing weeds from around trees, rather than using lawn equipment in
close proximity to their trunks. Those persons must be advised that when all
other methods fail, weeds must be pulled up or cut by hand. No hoeing or
digging shall take place within 12 inches of any tree to prevent root and trunk
damage.
7.5.2 Mulch. A ring of mulch may be placed around the trunk of the tree
extending at least 12 inches out from the base of the trunk. The mulch layer
shall be applied at a minimum height of two inches, to a maximum height of four

14

Last Revised 12/3/15

inches. Excessive mulch will not be piled against the tree trunk (mulch volcano),
and all mulch shall be pulled away from the trunk one inch (1”). Acceptable
mulch materials include wood chips, shredded bark, bark nuggets, and similar
products. No other mulch material may be substituted without authorization from
the Tree Advisory Board. Mulch shall be checked once per year and replaced as
needed.
7.5.3 Trunk Protectors. A plastic ring may be placed around the trunk of a tree
that has potential to be harmed by mowers or weed eaters, so long as the ring is
loose around the trunk, and long enough to extend six to twelve inches from the
ground. The ring shall be checked at least once per year to ensure that it is not
girdling the tree trunk. Rings shall be removed in the event girdling is taking
place, the ring becomes tight around the trunk (touching on all or most sides), or
if the trunk caliper reaches 12 inches. Trunk protectors must be removed from
trees with care in making sure that the tree trunk is not cut or scraped in doing
so, unless the wrap has started to girdle the tree and there is no other way. Tree
trunk wrap materials shall not be used around tree trunks.
7.5.4 Weed Barrier. Weed barrier material may be used around trees so long as
it is checked at least once per year to ensure the barrier is not girdling the tree
roots or trunk.
7.5.5 Herbicide. A herbicide containing only the active ingredient of Glyphosate,
may be sprayed at least 12 inches from base of trunk to kill any vegetation
growing near base of tree. Care shall be taken not to get chemicals on the trunk,
nor on sprouts growing on trunk or fresh wounds on trunk.

(c) Color scheme.
(1) The business name and color scheme to be used by each licensee under this section shall not be
similar to one being used by another licensee, nor shall any name or color scheme in any way tend to
deceive the public as to the identity of the licensee. For purposes of this section, the licensee which has

licensee to provide commercial advertising for commercial enterprises regarding subjects not contrary to
the peace, dignity or public good. Further, that this advertising provision is not intended to fall within nor
be controlled by any relevant provision of the Carmel Sign Ordinance, as to taxicabs only.

CITY OF FORT WAYNE MASTER 		    	                                                UPDATED: 12/16/16
SECTION 33 01 30.73
PIPE REHABILITATION BY CURED IN PLACE PIPE LINING
GENERAL
DESCRIPTION
Scope:
    1.     Contractor shall repair designated defective sewer segments with cured-in-place pipe (CIPP) as specified herein and as depicted on the accompanying project maps.  The CIPP shall provide a flow capacity equal to or greater than 100% of the original pipe's flow capacity when new.
General Pipe Liner Materials, Testing, and Process Requirements:
The proposed pipe lining materials shall be suitable for use in the environment and conditions of this project. 
The product shall not be made of a dark or non-reflective material that would inhibit proper closed circuit TV inspection. The hue of color shall be dark enough to distinguish a contrast between the fully resin-saturated felt fabric and dry or resin-lean areas.
Sizing: The felt fiber tube shall be fabricated to a size that when installed shall neatly fit the internal circumference of the conduit. Allowance for circumferential stretching during insertion shall be made as per manufacturer's standards. The Contractor is responsible for determining the actual diameter of the segments to be lined.   If the size of sewer found in the field is different than shown on the drawings, the Owner shall be notified immediately.  This shall also be noted in Final List of Lined and Un-Linable Segments Submittal.  Along with this submittal shall be the reason why the pipe was not lined and the distance from the structure where the defect occurred.
The installed liner shall provide a hydraulic flow equal to, or greater than, the original sewer capacity when new.
Length: The length shall be that deemed necessary by Contractor to effectively carry out the insertion from inlet to outlet points.
Contractor shall verify the lengths in the field. Individual installation runs may be made over one or more access points as determined in the field by Contractor and approved by Engineer.
The material shall be manufactured in such a manner as to result in a tight-fitting, continuous liner after installation. There shall be no measurable annular space. The liner shall have a snug fit at sewer lateral connections and manhole terminations, as shall be evidenced by indentations and flares, respectively.
Contractor shall warrant and indemnify Owner against all claims for patent infringement and any loss thereof.
The Contractor shall monitor the by-products of the lining operation and notify the City of any levels that could cause detriment to the surroundings or wastewater treatment plant.
 
NTS: If the project uses a different process, such as UV curing, update the following specification.
 
Intent
It is the intent of this portion of this Specification to provide for rehabilitating pipelines by the installation of a resin impregnated flexible felt tube in all segments as listed on the accompanying maps.  The tube shall consist of one or more layers of absorbent fabric capable of carrying resin, capable of withstanding installation pressures and curing temperatures and to have sufficient strength to bridge missing pipe segments.  The tube shall be compatible with the resin system used.  The tube material shall be able to stretch to fit irregular pipe sections and negotiate bends.  The outside layer of the tube shall be plastic coated with a material compatible with the resin system used.  The tube shall be saturated with a thermosetting resin and installed into the existing pipeline. Curing shall be accomplished by circulating hot water or steam to cure the resin into a hard impermeable CIPP.  When cured, the CIPP should extend from end-to-end of the segment in a continuous tight fitting, watertight pipe-within-a-pipe.  
NTS: Update year of prequalification.  Update size of sewer package.  Update pre-qualified contractors approved under the current year.
Pre-Qualified Contractors
The following companies are pre-qualified under the 2015-2017 Request for Qualifications for construction of Small Diameter CIPP:  SAK Construction, Insituform Technologies, Miller Pipeline Corp., Inland Waters Pollution Control Inc., and Layne Inliner.  Only these pre-qualified contractors shall be allowed to bid this project.
Resident Superintendent
The Contractor shall keep on the work site at all times during its progress a competent resident superintendent, who shall not be replaced without prior written notice to the Owner and Engineer except under extraordinary circumstances.  The superintendent shall be the Contractor's representative at the site and shall have authority to act on behalf of the Contractor.  All communications given to or issued by the superintendent shall be as binding as if given to or issued by the Contractor.  The Contractor shall provide appropriate information so that the Owner and Engineer can contact the superintendent at all times during the construction period.

General: It is the intent of this Specification to provide for rehabilitating pipelines by the installation of a resin impregnated flexible felt tube (cured in place pipe). The design life of the cured in place liner shall be a minimum of 50 years.  The felt tube shall be saturated with a thermosetting resin and installed into the existing pipeline. Curing shall be accomplished by circulating hot water or steam to cure the resin into a hard, impermeable pipe. When cured, the cured-in-place pipe shall extend from manhole to manhole in a continuous, tight fitting, watertight manner.
General Design Criteria: The newly installed liner shall have a finished thickness as shown in this project manual, and shall have a design life for a minimum fifty-year service life under continuous loading conditions. The liner was designed according to ASTM F-1216 and ASTM F 1743 latest revisions. For use in determining liner thickness, the long-term modulus of elasticity shall be no greater than 50 percent of the short-term modulus of elasticity.
Design of the liner was based on the condition of the existing pipe, which was classified as fully deteriorated pipe, is structurally unsound, suffering from severe cracks, missing sections, or other defects. The liner was designed to withstand all imposed loads.   
The liner has sufficient wall thickness to withstand the anticipated external pressures and loads that will be imposed after installation. The design of the liner included considerations for ring bending, deflection, combined loading, buckling, and ovality.  If after the cleaning and televising portion of the project, the Contractor believes the thickness' shown, do not reflect the actual condition of the existing pipe, the Owner is to be notified at once.  The Owner may then request design thickness calculations from Contractor.
NTS: If the design parameters show more than 10 feet of groundwater above the invert of the host pipe, then adjust design calculations and this specification.
Design was based on the use of standard flexible pipe equations, as detailed in ASTM F-1216, latest revision, and accounted for the effects of ovality.  A safety factor of at least 2 was utilitized.  Other design criteria were used as follows:
Modulus of Soil Reaction: 700 psi maximum
Soil Weight: 120 pounds per cubic foot
Live Load: Highway
Ovality: 2% minimum or determined by the Engineer
Depth of Groundwater above Invert: 10 feet
Short-Term Modulus of Elasticity was reduced by 50% in the calculations
If so directed, Contractor shall furnish, prior to use of the materials, satisfactory written certification of their compliance with the manufacturer's standards for all materials and conformance with methods of the manufacturer's process.
Physical Properties
The cured pipe shall conform to the minimum structural standards, as listed below:
             Cured Pipe 			  Standard 			Results            
                          Tensile Stress			  ASTM D-638		3,000 psi
             Flexural Stress			  ASTM D-790		4,500 psi
             Modulus of Elasticity	  ASTM D-790		250,000 psi
   
LINER MATERIALS
At the time of manufacture, each lot of liner shall be inspected for defects and tested in accordance with applicable and latest ASTM standards. At the time of delivery, the liner shall be homogeneous throughout, uniform in color, free of cracks, holes, foreign materials, blisters, or deleterious faults.  Materials shall be shipped, stored and handled in a manner consistent with written recommendations of the CIPP system manufacture to avoid damage.  Damage includes, but is not limited to, gouging, abrasion, flattening, cutting, puncturing or ultra-violet (UV) degradation.  All damaged materials shall be promptly removed from the project site at the Contractor's expense and disposed of in accordance with all current agency regulations.
For testing purposes, a production lot shall consist of all liner material having the same marking number. It shall include any and all items produced during any given work shift and must be so identified as opposed to previous or ensuing production.
The Engineer may at any time direct the manufacturer to obtain compound samples and prepare test specimens in accordance with applicable and latest ASTM standards.
The fiber felt tubing, including the polyurethane or poly-vinyl chloride covered felt and the thermosetting resin shall meet the latest ASTM and manufacturer's standards.  The felt content shall ensure cured thickness of liner as required by design calculations.  Thickness of cured liner shall not include thickness of polyurethane inner liner.  Reinforcing material shall be needle interlocked polyester felt, or an approved equivalent non-woven material, or combination of non-woven and woven materials compatible with the resin system.
NTS: Review the project to ensure polyester or vinylester resins are the best design.  Revise the specification if another resin or UV curing is needed.  Also, if storm sewer applications are used, the styrene can affect the downstream waters.  Each circumstance should be reviewed and the specification adjusted if needed.
The cured-in-place pipe system shall utilize polyester or vinylester thermosetting resins, which shall withstand the corrosive effect of the existing residential, commercial, and industrial effluents, liquids and/or gases.  Resins shall be general chemical purpose, styrene based, unsaturated, thermosetting resin and catalyst system.  Epoxy resin and hardener may be required by Contractor if conditions are deemed to warrant their use.

The equipment and methods selected shall be satisfactory to Engineer and shall be capable of removing dirt, grease, rocks, sand, and other material and obstructions from the sewer line.  Any damage to public or private property as a result of high sewer cleaning pressures shall be the responsibility of the Contractor to correct, repair, clean, or compensate the owner.
Pipe Damage Preventing Cleaning Operation
Contractor shall recognize that there are some conditions such as broken pipe and major blockages that prevent cleaning from being accomplished or where damage would result if cleaning were attempted or continued.  Should such conditions be encountered, Contractor shall immediately notify Engineer.  If in the course of cleaning operations, damage does result from preexisting and unforeseen conditions such as broken pipe, Contractor shall not be held responsible.  Engineer shall be notified of any conditions that warrant termination of cleaning activities.
Contractor shall take satisfactory precautions to prevent damage to the existing pipe and to homes with laterals on the sewer main being cleaned.  Contractor shall be responsible for repair of damage that results from a lack of standard industry precautions taken during sewer cleaning operations, at no extra costs to the Owner.  Contractor shall immediately notify Owner and Engineer of any damage to homes or other private property due to sewer cleaning operations.
Equipment for Sewer Segment Cleaning
Hydraulically Propelled Equipment:  The equipment used shall be movable dam type and be constructed in such a way that a portion of the dam may be collapsed at any time during the cleaning operation to protect against flooding of the sewer.  The movable dam shall be equal in diameter to the pipe being cleaned and shall provide a flexible scraper around the outer periphery to insure removal of grease.  If sewer cleaning balls or other equipment, which cannot be collapsed, are used, special precautions to prevent flooding of the sewers and public or private property shall be taken.
High-Velocity Jet Equipment:  All high-velocity sewer cleaning equipment shall be constructed for ease and safety of operation.  The equipment shall have a selection of two (2) or more high-velocity nozzles.  The nozzles shall be capable of producing a scouring action from fifteen (15) to forty-five (45) degrees in all size lines designated to be cleaned.  Equipment shall also include a high-velocity gun for washing and scouring manhole walls and floor.  The gun shall be capable of producing flows from a fine spray to a solid stream.  The equipment shall carry its own water tank, auxiliary engines, pumps, and hydraulically driven hose reel.
Mechanically Powered Equipment:  Bucket machines shall be in pairs with sufficient power to perform the work in an efficient manner.  Machines shall be belt operated or have an overload device.  Machines with direct drive that could cause damage to the pipe shall not be allowed.  A power rodding machine shall be either a sectional or continuous rod type capable of holding a minimum of 750 feet of rod.  The rod shall be specifically heat-treated steel.  To ensure safe operation, the machine shall be fully enclosed and have an automatic safety clutch or relief valve.
To accomplish cleaning activities, Contractor shall use only such equipment as is mentioned in this specification.  Alternate equipment and/or methods shall not be permitted without the express written consent of the Engineer.  Accuracy of equipment and operating method for cleaning shall be judged by the results obtained.  There are not restrictions on types and use of machines involved.
When hydraulic or high-velocity cleaning equipment is used, a suitable sand trap, weir, or dam shall be constructed in the downstream manhole in such a manner that all solids and debris are trapped and removed thereby preventing such material from passing into the next sewer reach.
Contractor shall be responsible for all costs associated with providing water for hydraulic cleaning equipment.  All charges for obtaining water shall be considered incidental to the cleaning of the sewer segments.  Prior to commencement of the work, Contractor shall submit to Resident Project Representative evidence that he/she has made appropriate water usage and payment arrangements with the Fort Wayne Water Utility.  
When the Contractor encounters an obstruction that normally cannot be cleaned with equipment indicated above, Contractor shall indicate the location in his field log.  Acceptability shall be based on Engineer's review of the video.  It is the intent of these Specifications that pipe walls be clean enough for the camera to discern structural defects, misalignment, and points of infiltration.  A minimum of ninety-five percent (95%) of the debris shall be removed.
 
NTS: Heavy cleaning is mostly used in the specifications, especially if the sewer hasn't been televised or reviewed.  Update this specification if the video has been reviewed and looks to be less cleaning.
 
Heavy Cleaning Defined
Heavy cleaning shall mean mechanical (drag/bucket machines) cleaning or multiple (four or more) passes of hydraulic cleaning equipment through the entire sewer segment (manhole to manhole).   
NASSCO defines heavy cleaning: 
25% debris or more in pipes 12" and under
15% debris or more in pipes 13" to 24"
10% debris or more in pipes 25" or more
NOTE:  It is anticipated that the majority of the sewer cleaning, on this project, will be Heavy Cleaning.
Debris Removal and Disposal
Contractor shall remove all sludge, dirt, rocks, grease, and other solid or semisolid material resulting from the cleaning operation from the downstream manhole of the sewer segment being cleaned.  The Contractor shall ensure no solids are passed downstream to the next pipe section during the cleaning operation.  Contractor shall be responsible for capturing all debris during cleaning operations.  Satisfactory precautions shall be taken to protect the sewer segments and appurtenances from damage that might be inflicted upon them by any debris passing downstream.  Such precautions, a suitable sand trap, weir, dam, or other approved method, shall be constructed in the downstream manhole in such a manner that all solids and debris are trapped and removed, thereby preventing such material from passing downstream.  
In the event that sludge, dirt, sand, rocks, grease, and other solid or semisolid material resulting from the cleaning operation are observed and/or detected by Engineer as passing to downstream sewer segments, Contractor shall clean such sewer segment(s) at no additional cost to Owner upon written notice from Engineer. Any damage inflicted upon a sewer segment and appurtenances or other public or private property that is caused by debris passing downstream shall be repaired by the Contractor at no additional cost to the Owner.
When the bucket machines are being used, a suitable container shall be provided to receive the materials dumped from the buckets.
Contractor, at their discretion, may use an INDOT approved covered container (roll off) for the storage of debris removed from the line segments.  All material resulting from the cleaning operations shall be removed from the site when the container has reached three-fourths (3/4) of its volume, or at least once each working day and disposed of at the permitted disposal site.
Contractor shall submit a plan for disposal to Engineer for approval prior to beginning the work.  Debris, silt, and solids removed shall be disposed at the City of Fort Wayne's Bio-solids Handling Facility located at 5510 Lake Avenue, or other designated site by the Owner.  All debris, silt and solids removed by Contractor shall be disposed by Contractor in accordance with all appropriate codes, rules, and regulations for the handling and disposal of such materials and shall be removed from the sewer prior to beginning the televised inspection.  Under no circumstances shall the removed sewage or solids be dumped onto streets or into ditches, catch basins, storm drains, sanitary or combined sewer manholes, or otherwise improperly disposed.
Improper disposal of sewage or solids removed from the sewers may subject Contractor to fines imposed by the responsible regulatory agency and/or the City.  In addition, Contractor may be subject to civil and/or criminal penalties for improper disposal under the law.
Root Removal
Roots shall be removed in the designated sections where root intrusion is a problem.  Special attention shall be used during the cleaning operation to assure almost complete removal of roots from the joints.  Procedures may include the use of mechanical equipment such as rodding machines, bucket machines and winches using root cutters and porcupines, and equipment such as high-velocity jet cleaners.  Chemical root treatment may be used at the option of Contractor, however, the use of such treatment must allow for a root removal rate that allows the Contractor to complete all work within the required time for completion.
Calcium Removal
In areas where calcium-build up is a major problem, the deposits shall be ground down to at least 1 inch in 8 to 12 inch diameter sewers and down to 1(1/2)-2 inches in sewers greater than 12-inch diameter sewers.
Manhole Entry Protection
Contractor shall not enter into any sewer segment where hazardous conditions may exist until such time as the source of those conditions is identified and eliminated.  Contractor shall coordinate his/her work with local fire and police rescue units.
Contractor shall follow all local, state, and federal guidelines to provide safety when entering manholes or working around the sewer locations.
NOTIFICATION AND COOPERATION WITH CUSTOMERS
The Contractor shall notify any affected property owner/resident at least 48 hours, and not more than 96 hours, prior to installation of the liner and/or any repair of sewer laterals.  The notice shall explain what the Contractor is doing and inform property owner/resident to limit his/her water usage on the appropriate date of work.  The notice shall also include an approximate time that installation is expected to begin.  The Contractor shall furnish the Owner with a letter explaining the process to affected property owners/residents at least two (2) weeks before work is started for review and approval. After installation of the liner and reinstatement and/or repair of the sewer lateral connection(s), Contractor shall notify the resident(s) that their lateral(s) is back in service.  If any other construction equipment will disrupt customers, similar notice shall be given.
Care must be taken to avoid excessive disturbance of properties.   Property owners must be notified prior to any work, to allow time for property owners to leash pets.   
The Contractor shall be responsible for responding to all odor complaints that are a result of his/her operation, regardless of distance from the work site.
No work shall be done the day before holidays, or City-designated holidays themselves.
PRE-INSTALLATION INTERNAL PIPE TELEVISING
After cleaning the sewer segment, Contractor shall internally inspect, via Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) inspection, the sewer segment to be lined. The television camera shall be equipped with working pan and tilt capabilities. Personnel conducting the televising inspection shall be experienced in operating a sewer televising camera and analyzing pipe conditions from the video image. All CCTV files shall support Pipeline Assessment Certification Program (PACP) v 7.0. Contractor shall record and upload these inspections, as well as tabular sheets, onto the City of Fort Wayne's File Transfer Protocol (FTP) site.  The Contractor shall upload all tabular reports daily to the City's FTP site and all videos each month via the City's FTP site.  The following naming convention shall be used:
Tabular reports: (Work Order)  -  (Upstream Manhole)  -  (Downstream Manhole)  -  (Pre/Post) Report

Sewer lateral connections and branch sewer shall be noted as "Active" or "Capped" in narrative and on field log.
Remaining PACP defect codes.
All televised inspections must be coded using PACP formatting, and compatible with the Pipelogix 6.0 software.   
Video material shall visually display date, pipe section number (manhole number) and distance from upstream manhole with a minimum accuracy of two (2) feet.  The interior of the pipeline shall be carefully inspected to determine the location and extent of any structural failures. The location of any conditions, which may prevent proper installation of cured-in-place pipe into the pipelines, shall be noted so that these conditions can be corrected.
Where a manhole is encountered that does not have a number, the Contractor shall contact Owner for assignment of a new manhole number.  Where an obstruction is encountered and a reverse set up is required, the distance shall be written and noted on the video to clearly denote the manhole from which the measurements were taken.  No additional cost shall be paid for reverse set-ups.  
Video of all sections shall be provided to the Engineer along with the respective television inspection logs.  CCTV field logs shall legibly show the location of each point of significance in relation to an identified manhole.  Points of significance include, but are not limited to the following:  private sewer lateral connections, unusual conditions, roots, storm sewer connections, broken pipe, presence of scale and corrosion, structural failures, and other discernible features.  If a pipe cannot be lined because of a defect, a video shall be given to the City for their records for future repairs.
Owner shall classify as non-acceptable a significant deviation of a segment's hydraulic grade of a continuous linear footage of at least ten (10) feet, which impedes the accuracy and/or effectiveness of the internal inspection.  Contractor shall take all necessary measures to televise the internal surface of each segment in its entirety.
The camera utilized for closed circuit televising shall be equipped with remote control devices to adjust the light intensity. The camera shall be equipped with an articulating lens (pan and tilt capabilities) to provide clear views of laterals and other items of importance. The camera shall have a minimum of 1,000 feet of coaxial cable. The camera shall be able to transmit a continuous image to the television monitor as it is being pulled through the sewer segment.
Contractor shall present on CCTV recordings a continuous image of not less than ninety (90%) percent of the internal pipe circumference at all times. Maximum acceptable speed of camera through sewer shall be thirty feet per minute (30 fpm).
Contractor shall be responsible for any damage to public or private property resulting from televising activities and shall repair or otherwise make whole such damage at no cost to Owner.
Contractor shall reference the location and nature of the obstruction and immediately report all obstructions to the Engineer or Owner.
The deterioration of the pipeline is an ongoing process.  Should pre-lining inspections reveal the pipes to be in substantially different conditions than anticipated by the Engineer, the Contractor shall request a change in wall thickness supporting such request with design data in accordance with manufacturer's standard design policies.
Any questionable lining segments found during the Pre-Installation CCTV shall be submitted to the Engineer for review and recommendation for lining or submittal of a replacement line.  The Contractor shall submit the questionable lining segment through PMIS to the Engineer for review using the Questionable Line Segment Form on PMIS.  If the Contractor is requesting a replacement line, they must submit the QLS within 1 week of the CCTV date.  The last questionable segments submitted shall be no later than 30 days before substantial completion.  If any pipes found to be collapsed, partially collapsed, or in imminent failure, then the Contractor shall notify the Owner and Engineer immediately in writing.
BYPASS PUMPING
Bypassing Flow: Contractor, when required, shall provide for the transfer of flow around the section or sections of pipe designated for cured-in-place pipe.  The bypass shall be made by diversion of the flow at an existing upstream, or higher pressure, access point and directing the flow around the section to be taken from service. At no time shall sewage be allowed to flow on the surface.  Bypass lines and pumps shall be of adequate capacity and size to handle the flow.  The proposed bypassing system shall be set up to allow traffic flow to local business and residents. Contractor shall notify all parties whose sewer laterals will be out of service and shall advise against water usage until service reinstatement has occurred.  Contractor shall submit their plan for flow control to Engineer for approval prior to beginning the work.  Engineer shall approve the proposed bypassing system in advance. Contractor may consider bypass pumping to a sewer system separate from the project.  Record drawings for alternate sewer systems are available for examination in the Department of City Utilities Engineering office, Suite 250 of the Citizens Square Building.
Contractor may drain such water by pipes, chases, fluming, pumping above grade, or other appropriate methods approved by Engineer.  Sewer flows and seepage shall be controlled in such a manner that detrimental effects are completely eliminated.
Contractor shall provide adequate pumping equipment, pneumatic plugs, couplings, suction pipe, discharge pipe, etc. and other facilities to dewater the sewer segment during construction.  Contractor shall furnish all necessary labor and supervision to set up and operate the dewatering system.  Precautions shall be taken to ensure that flow control and dewatering operations will not cause flooding or damage to private properties.  In the event flooding or damage occurs to private properties, Contractor shall immediately notify the Engineer of such damage and shall make provisions to correct such damage at no additional cost to Owner.  Cost of any dewatering that is necessary, shall not be paid for directly, but included in the cost of the CIPP liner.
If bypass pumping is utilized by Contractor to control flows during construction, Contractor shall be responsible for monitoring the bypass pumping operation at all times until work is complete.  Owner shall approve the location of pump(s), force main, discharge point, etc.  
Contractor shall obtain permission from the Engineer to use plugs to interrupt the flow of sewage without bypass pumping.  Contractor's request shall include the location to be plugged, the anticipated duration, and the frequency that sewer is to be plugged.  Contractor shall not plug any sewer until the Engineer has approved the interruption of flows.
Any backup resulting in the damage of any property shall be the responsibility of the Contractor and shall be paid for by the Contractor at no expense to the Owner.
CLEARING PROTRUDING LATERALS
If the Contractor and Owner determine a protruding lateral must be cleared prior to installation of the liner, it shall be the responsibility of Contractor to clear protruding lateral.  The Contractor shall make a cut (or grind down) so that the lateral is to within one inch (1") of the inner wall of the sewer segment, unless otherwise instructed by the Owner.  The Contractor shall not use chains or other such devices to fracture or break protruding laterals back to the sewer's inner wall.  Any damage to the lateral connection outside the main sanitary sewer pipe or to the main sanitary sewer pipe itself, caused by cutting the lateral pipe shall be the responsibility of the Contractor and repaired to the satisfaction of the Engineer and Owner at no additional expense to the Contract.
If clearing a protruding lateral remotely is not possible, Contractor shall consult Owner.  This situation shall be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
LINE OBSTRUCTIONS
It shall be the responsibility of Contractor to clear the line of obstructions such as solids, protruding branch connections or broken pipe that will prevent the insertion of cured-in-place pipe.  The cost of removal of obstructions shall be included in the cost of cleaning.  If inspection reveals an obstruction that cannot be removed by conventional cleaning equipment, Contractor shall consult Owner.  The obstruction removals shall be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
INSTALLATION PROCEDURE
General: Each liner shall be subject to inspection by Engineer immediately before it is installed. Defective liner shall be rejected.
Following are general steps required for installation of CIPP liner systems. Specific requirements for temperature, pressure, and time of cure shall be determined by the manufacturer / Contractor and submitted to the Engineer and Owner for review and approval.
"Wet-Out": Contractor shall designate a location where the uncured resin in the original containers and the un-impregnated felt fiber tube would be vacuum impregnated prior to installation. Contractor shall allow Engineer to inspect the materials and "wet-out" procedure at the cost of the Contractor. A resin and catalyst system compatible with the requirement of this method shall be used. The quantities of the liquid thermosetting materials shall be per manufacturer's standards to provide the lining thickness specified.
Installation of Liner: The wet-out felt fiber tube shall be inserted through an existing manhole or other approved access.  The liner shall be inserted by either of the two following methods:
By means of an inversion process and application of hydrostatic head or air pressure sufficient to fully extend liner to next designated manhole or termination point and firmly into contact with the existing pipe walls.
By pulling or winching liner into place and application of hydrostatic head or air pressure sufficient to expand liner bag and place it firmly into contact with the existing pipe walls.
Tube installation forces or pressures shall be limited so as not to stretch the tube longitudinally by more than five percent (5%) of the original length.
A non-toxic, oil-based lubricant may be used.  The lubricant shall have no detrimental effects on the tube or boiler and pump system, shall not support the growth of bacteria, and shall not adversely affect the fluid to be transported.
Curing: After installation of wet-out felt tube is completed and calibration tube is inserted, Contractor shall supply suitable heat source and water recirculation, or steam equipment. The equipment shall be capable of delivering hot water or steam to the far end of the pipe section through a hose, which has been perforated per manufacturer's recommendations, to uniformly raise the water temperature in the line section above the temperature required to effect a cure of the resin. This temperature shall be determined by the resin/catalyst system employed.  The manufacturer's standards shall be closely followed during the elevated curing temperatures so as not to over-stress the felt fiber and cause damage or failure prior to cure.  It is the responsibility of the Contractor to determine if steam or water curing would be the appropriate curing application.  No extra payment will be paid during construction if changing the curing technique is necessary.
The heat source shall be fitted with suitable monitors to gauge the temperature of the incoming and outgoing heat exchanger circulating water. Thermocouples shall be placed between the impregnated tube and the invert at the far access point to determine the temperature and time of exotherm. Water temperature in the pipeline during the cure period shall not be less than 150F or more than 200F as measured at the heat exchanger return line, unless the liner manufacturer states otherwise.
Initial cure shall be deemed complete when inspection of the exposed portions of cured-in-place pipe appears to be hard and sound and the thermocouples indicate that an exotherm has occurred. The cure period shall be of a duration recommended by the resin manufacturer, as modified for the cured-in-place pipe process being used, during which time the recirculation of the water and cycling of the heat exchanger shall be maintained to ensure proper temperature.  After initial cure is reached, the temperature shall be raised to the post-cure temperature recommended by the resin manufacturer.  The post-cure temperature shall be held for a period as recommended by the resin manufacturer during which recirculation of the water and cycling of the heat exchanger to maintain the temperature shall continue.  The curing of the CIPP must take into account the existing pipe material, the resin system, and ground conditions (temperature, moisture level, and the final conductivity of the soil).  
Cool Down: Contractor shall cool the finished cured-in-place pipe to a temperature below 70F before relieving the static head in the inversion standpipe. Cool down may be accomplished by the introduction of cool water into the standpipe to replace water being drained from the downstream end. Care shall be taken so as to cool down the CIPP in a controlled manner as recommended by the resin manufacturer. Care shall be taken in the release of the static head such that a vacuum will not be developed that could damage the newly installed cured-in-place pipe.
     For storm sewer applications, no cure water shall be allowed to flow downstream.  Appropriate measures shall be taken at the downstream end to catch all cure water or pumping shall be used.  If pumps are used to discharge to a nearby sanitary sewer, the Owner shall approve all measures and flows discharged.  All discharging to sanitary sewers shall be completed in a low-flow time to avoid surcharging the sanitary system.
For pulled-in-place installation techniques where the inflation bladder is designed to not bond to the CIPP, all portions of the bladder material shall be removed from the installation.
Finish: The finished cured-in-place pipe shall be continuous over the entire length of the insertion run and be as free as commercially practicable from significant defects. Any defects which will affect, in the foreseeable future, the warranty period, the integrity or strength of cured-in-place pipe, and the flow capacity of the pipe shall be repaired at Contractor's expense, in a manner mutually agreed by Owner and Contractor.
Sealing the Ends: If the CIPP does not fit tightly against the original pipe at its termination point(s), the space between the pipes shall be sealed by filling with a resin mixture compatible with the CIPP.  If due to broken or misaligned pipe at the access points, cured-in-place pipe fails to make a tight seal, then the Contractor shall apply a seal at that point.  The watertight seal shall be of a resin mixture compatible with the cured-in-place pipe.  This sealing procedure shall be completed before proceeding to the next section of sewer main to be rehabilitated.
The water tightness of cured-in-place pipe shall be gauged while curing and under positive head.
Care must be taken to avoid damage to property.  Damage to public or private property shall be repaired or the respective party shall be compensated.
LATERAL/MANHOLE REINSTATEMENT
It shall be the Contractor's responsibility to determine and to assure that all active laterals are reinstated and connected to the liner.  Any damage to public or private property resulting from an active lateral not reinstated after installation of the CIPP shall be the Contractor's responsibility to repair.  The Contractor shall repair any damage to the property at no additional cost to the Owner.  The Contractor shall certify to the Owner that they have a minimum of two (2) complete working cutters plus spare key components on the site before each inversion.
Sewer lateral reinstatement shall be completed without excavation, utilizing a remotely controlled cutting device, monitored by a CCTV camera.  Lateral reinstatement shall be completed by utilizing a robotic type device to reinstate the lateral from inside the pipe or by man-entry. Where holes are cut through the liner, they shall be neat and smooth in order to prevent blockage at the sewer lateral connections. Robotically cut-in sewer lateral connections shall be opened to a minimum of 95 percent of the internal diameter and a maximum of 100 percent of the lateral.  The edges of the opening shall not have pipe fragments or liner fragments, which may obstruct flow or snag debris.  Contractor shall be responsible for capturing all debris, such as the "coupon," created by lateral restoration operations.  Satisfactory precautions shall be taken to protect the sewer segments and appurtenances from damage that might be inflicted upon them by any debris passing downstream.  Precautions, including a suitable sand trap, weir, dam, or other approved method of capture, shall be constructed in the downstream manhole in such a manner that all solids and debris are trapped and removed, thereby preventing such material from passing into the next sewer segment.  Any damage inflicted upon a sewer segment and appurtenances or other public or private property that is caused by debris passing downstream shall be repaired by the Contractor at no additional cost to the Owner.
Reconnecting the existing laterals to the newly lined sewer main shall include all labor, materials, equipment and incidentals including excavation, trench and site restoration, if required.  No additional payment shall be made for excavations for the purpose of sewer lateral reinstatement and the Contractor shall be responsible for all costs associated with such excavation and restoration work.
In the event the Contractor makes a lateral reinstatement which is not at a lateral, the Contractor shall make a point repair by excavation, or shall apply an approved internal patch, to repair the cut-in hole so infiltration does not enter the pipe at that location and the structural integrity of the liner is not compromised. The Contractor shall make the necessary repairs at no cost to the Owner
Contractor shall reconnect all active laterals within 24 hours of the installation of the CIPP liner.  If Contractor is unable to reconnect an active sewer lateral connection within 24 hours, the Contractor shall make appropriate arrangements for the resident.  The Owner and Engineer shall be notified immediately of the situation and informed of arrangements proposed by the Contractor for the residents.  Arrangements shall be at no additional expense to the Owner.
TESTING
All testing shall be the responsibility of and at the expense of the Contractor. The laboratory selected by the Contractor shall be subjected to approval by the Engineer, and submitted not later than the pre-construction conference.  All test results shall be submitted to the Owner within four (4) weeks of completion of installation of each inversion length of CIPP liner.  Owner may elect to have Contractor take additional samples and send the samples to a designated laboratory selected by the Owner.  Owner shall not release payment for CIPP liner segment until receipt of satisfactory test results.
For each CIPP inversion installation completed by the Contractor, a CIPP sample (or more if Owner chooses to test samples independently) shall be cut from an intermediate manhole that has been properly restrained or at the termination point that has been inverted through a like diameter pipe which has been held in place by a suitable heat sink, such as sandbags.  Plate sampling shall be an acceptable method for obtaining test specimens. The sample shall be large enough and properly shaped to provide a minimum of five (5) specimens for flexural and tensile testing, if applicable, unless approved by the Engineer.  The full CIPP sample wall thickness shall be tested whenever possible.  If the sample is irregular, distorted, or of such thickness that proper testing is inhibited, then the wall thickness shall be machined away from the inside pipe face of the sample only.  Thus, the test specimen shall be cut from the outside pipe face of the CIPP sample.  For specimens greater than (1/2) inch depth, the width-to-width ratio of the specimen shall be increased to a minimum of 1:1 and shall not exceed 4:1.  Test specimen shall be oriented on the testing machine with the interior surface of the CIPP in tension.  The following test procedures shall be followed after the sample is cured and removed:
Flexural Properties:  The initial tangent modulus of elasticity and flexural stress shall be measured for gravity and pressure pipe applications in accordance with ASTM D790, Test Method I, Procedure A.
Tensile Properties:  The tensile strength shall be measured for pressure pipe applications in accordance with ASTM D638.
Gravity Pipe Leakage Testing:  Leakage testing of the CIPP shall be conducted during cure while under hydrostatic pressure.  For CIPP products in which the pipe wall is cured while not in direct contact with the pressurizing fluid (i.e. a removable bladder is used) the CIPP must be leakage tested in accordance with ASTM F 1417.
Thickness: Test results showing thickness of finished liner shall be shown.
Should test results return unacceptable, do not meet Contract requirements, or do not meet Manufacturer's specifications, Contractor shall, at no additional cost to the Owner, provide additional samples from "inside" of the pipe to submit for additional testing.  After removal of samples, Contractor shall apply an Owner approved repair to spot where samples were removed.    All Test results shall show the Upstream and Downstream Structure ID#, of the sewer segment, where the test was taken.
Delamination Test:  For pulled-in-place CIPP products where the inflation bladder remains a permanent part of the finished CIPP product, a delamination test shall be performed on each installation length.  The sample shall be fabricated from material taken from the tube and the resin/catalyst system used and cured in a clamped mold placed in the down tube.  A portion of the inflation bladder material in the sample should be dry and isolated from the resin in order to separate tube layers for testing.  Delamination testing shall be in accordance with ASTM D903 with the following exceptions:
The rate of travel of the power-actuated grip shall be one (1) inch per minute.
Five test specimens shall be tested for each inversion specified.
The thickness of the test specimen shall not only be minimized, but also shall be sufficient to adequately test delamination of non-homogeneous CIPP layers.  The peel or stripping strength between any non-homogeneous layers of the CIPP laminate shall be a minimum of ten (10) pounds per inch of width for typical CIPP application.  The liner, when complete, shall conform to the shape of the pipe existing before liner installation.
The Contractor shall correct all defects discovered during the post-installation television inspection before the work under the Contract will be considered for final completion.  After the defects are corrected, the sewer shall be videoed again.  The post-installation television inspection video shall be submitted to the Engineer to review prior to the final completion milestone.
CLEANUP
The Contractor shall flush and clean the lined sewer section, if necessary, to remove all accumulated construction debris, rocks, gravel, sand, silt and other foreign material from the sewer system at or near the closest downstream manhole. Cleaning methods and criteria shall be the same as specified above in this specification. Debris shall not be allowed to pass downstream. If debris does pass downstream, the Contractor shall clean the next sewer segment at no additional cost.  Contractor shall be responsible for any damage to collection system equipment and appurtenances due to debris passing downstream from project site.
POST-INSTALLATION INTERNAL PIPE TELEVISING
All Post-Installation Internal Pipe Televising inspections and tabular sheets shall be in PACP format and include the following:
Sheet number, surveyor's name (initials), NASSCO certificate number.
Date, time of day, street address, and city.
City of Fort Wayne Manhole ID for upstream and downstream manhole.
Direction, last letter of the PSR, height (diameter), shape of pipe, pipe material, and whether or not the segment was pre-cleaned.
Locations, size, and material of sewer lateral connections and branch sewers into the main line.  Contractor is responsible for looking up each sewer lateral connection and branch sewer.  Sewer lateral connections and branch sewer shall be noted as "Active" or "Capped" in narrative and on field log.
Any lining failures found.
Any miscellaneous items to note.
The Contractor shall televise using PACP formatting and be compatible with the Pipelogix 6.0 software.  
The Contractor, at no additional cost to the Owner, shall correct all defects discovered during the television inspection. After the defects are corrected, the sewer shall be videoed again.
Contractor shall record and upload these inspections, as well as tabular sheets, onto the City of Fort Wayne's FTP site.  The Contractor shall upload all tabular reports daily to the City's FTP site and all videos each month via the City's FTP site.  The following naming convention shall be used:
Tabular reports: (Work Order)  -  (Upstream Manhole)  -  (Downstream Manhole)  -  (Pre/Post) Report
Videos: (Work Order)  -  (Upstream Manhole)  -  (Downstream Manhole)  -  (Pre/Post) Video
The Owner shall not release payment for CIPP liner until satisfactory review of post-installation video has been completed.  The Owner reserves the right to stop the Contractor from installing CIPP liners if the Contractor has not supplied completed post-installation video and associated paperwork in the proper amount of time.  No additional work days shall be added to the contract should the Owner choose to stop the Contractor from installing additional CIPP liners.
The Contractor shall submit to the Owner a final list of sewer segments lined and sewer segments that were unable to be lined at the end of the construction period.  Said list shall be in in a .xls format, compatible with Microsoft Excel.  This list is crucial for tracking, and shall be submitted through PMIS.  
WORKMANSHIP, TESTING, AND ACCEPTANCE OF THE INSTALLED LINER
The liner shall be continuous over the entire length of the installation run and shall be continuous through intermediate manholes if multiple segments are completed in a single installation run. The liner shall be free of all foreign inclusions, and visual and material defects except those resulting from pre-lined conditions (such conditions shall be brought to the attention of the Engineer prior to lining). There shall be no pits, pinholes, cracks or crazing. The surface shall be smooth and free of waviness throughout the pipe.
The final acceptance of the installed liner shall be based on the Engineer's evaluation of the post-installation inspection utilizing CCTV video prepared by the Contractor, receipt of liner test results, and inspection of the installation site.
During the one (1) year warranty period, any defects that may affect the integrity or strength of the liner shall be repaired at the Contractor's expense, in a manner mutually agreed by the Owner and the Contractor
