According to the National Network to End Domestic Violence, victims are killed
or severely injured on a daily basis due to the combination of guns and
domestic violence. An astounding number of women are killed by their abusers,
and guns are the most commonly used weapon in domestic violence homicides. When
abusers have access to firearms, victims&rsquo; lives are at risk. That&rsquo;s
why I am working on a new law that would require those placed under order of
protections to surrender their firearms and ammunition within 48 hours.

Dear friends, Happy Veterans Day! This national holiday is dedicated to
honoring U.S. veterans of all wars and recognizing those who have fought to
protect our freedom. According to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs,
Indiana is home to 476,000 veterans. To properly celebrate these Hoosiers, I

Dear Friends,
Great news! The downtown Evansville Indiana University medical and research
facility broke ground last week.
As a member of the House Ways and Means Committee, I worked to secure $25
million in funding for this new development because of the transformational
impact it will have on our community. The school expects 500 students to be
enrolled when the campus opens for its first semester in spring 2018.

Working with the medical community
I recently had the pleasure of speaking with members of the Vanderburgh County
Medical Society about the many health care issues that were addressed during
the 2015 legislative session.
Understanding the needs of the medical community is imperative for me to remain
informed during the legislative process. When health related legislation is
authored, I do my best to understand the impact it would have on the health
care community including patients and providers.

Posted by: Brandi Klingerman  | Tuesday, October 6, 2015
While the Environmental Protection Agency continues it&rsquo;s war on coal, you
can count on me to support Indiana&rsquo;s coal industry and the 26,000
Hoosiers it employs across our state. 
Recently, I joined the Indiana Coal Council on an underground tour of the
Sunrise Coal mine in Oaktown. Once we were underground, we drove more than five
miles to get to the mine. I was impressed by the workers, especially as I
watched a 26-year-old operator maneuver a complex machine with ease and
precision. The work and talent of these miners is essential to maintaining
affordable and reliable energy for Hoosier families and businesses.

Monday, September 21, 2015
This past legislative session, I supported an honestly balanced budget which

This funding was provided to allow DCS to increase their staff and better serve
Hoosier families and children.
The state is looking to hire additional Family Case Managers across Indiana to
serve our communities. To meet these needs, the DCS Vanderburgh County office
is hosting a career fair to recruit quality applicants.

Rep. Sullivan. &ldquo;This clarification to Indiana&rsquo;s code will help
secure jobs as developers will be able to continue their work and not stop
projects prematurely.&rdquo;

Friday, June 5, 2015
I recently had the opportunity to visit Alcoa in Warrick County. With my
background in manufacturing and production, I was interested in Alcoa&rsquo;s
operations and learning more about this successful, local business. Knowing
that June is National Safety Month, I was also intrigued by Alcoa&rsquo;s
dedication to maintaining a safe working environment by going above and beyond
the required safety standards to implement the best practices for their
employees&rsquo; needs. While touring the facility, I learned that in a five
year period, ending in 2014, the plant had a recordable Occupational Safety and
Health Administration rate of 1.8, lower than the national average.

Friday, March 20, 2015
The month of March is dedicated to bringing awareness and promoting
independence, inclusion and integration of people who have disabilities in
Indiana, known as Disability Awareness Month. The theme this year is
&ldquo;Love Where You Live&rdquo; and in that spirit, I wanted to share with
you how you can get involved.  
Vanderburgh County is blessed to be home to the Arc of Evansville, a non-profit
organization that supports individuals with disabilities and empowers them to
gain independence, build relationships and achieve their full potential.
Throughout March, they are hosting multiple events in our community, and I
encourage you to attend an upcoming &ldquo;Giveback Day&rdquo; where a local
restaurant will donate 10 percent of their sales to this organization,
supporting those with disabilities.
**** Rep._Sullivan_works_for_Hoosier_motorists ****
Monday, March 16, 2015
STATEHOUSE &ndash; State Representative Holli Sullivan (R-Evansville) has
authored a bill to benefit taxpayers and Hoosier motorists. House Bill (HB)
1362 would extend the amount of time that Indiana is required to reissue
license plates. The bill passed unanimously out of the Senate with a 48-1 vote.
&ldquo;I was pleased to see HB 1362 receive such bipartisan support and pass
out of the Senate,&rdquo; said Rep. Sullivan. &ldquo;This legislation will
allow the state to save tax dollars which can then be passed onto
consumers.&rdquo;
Currently, license plates must be issued by the state every five years. If
enacted, HB 1362 could extend the life cycle of license plates by up to 10
years, which could save the state on average around $10 million per year
starting in July 2016.
HB 1362 gives the Bureau of Motor Vehicles the ability to set the license plate
life cycle at no less than five years, but no more than 10 years. The bill does
not change the exemptions for certain plates like municipal or commercial motor
vehicles.
&ldquo;With updated technology, license plates are able to withstand more and
last longer,&rdquo; said Rep. Sullivan. &ldquo;This change would allow Indiana
to keep the cost of license plates low while maintaining quality.&rdquo;
HB 1362 now goes to the governor to be signed into law. To learn more about
Rep. Sullivan, visit www.indianahouserepublicans.com.

This week, House Bill (HB) 1362 passed out of the Roads and Transportation
Committee with unanimous support. If enacted, this bill would extend the amount
of time by up to five years that Hoosiers would be required to replace their

legislation. You can also learn about HB 1362 and follow it through the

This Cash for College site allows students to compare college costs, factoring

plan, the site also provides resources along with a step-by-step guide to make
that process easier.
