Storm Water Technical Advisory Committee
Clean Stream Team Advisory Committee

Date:

March 22, 2011

Time:

5:30-7:30 p.m.

Location: Fall Creek Conference Room
Subject: Storm Water Technical Advisory Committee Spring Kick-Off
Participants: John Oakley, Ed Bukovac, Tim Jensen, Jessica Castellanos, Terri
Czajka, Abe Swidan, Gary Whitmore
MEETING SUMMARY:
The March 22nd meeting marked the first gathering of the Storm Water Technical Advisory
Committee for 2011. Although six (6) of the seven (7) members had RSVP’d to attend, only
three (3) actually attended.
Ed Bukovac began the meeting with introductions and sharing that we are now called the
“RebuildIndy Team.” He asked if there were any questions regarding the change. No questions
were asked.
Each of the current projects, their status, details on problem areas and solutions for each were
reviewed by Ed, John and Tim. The following additional conversations arose from TAC
members:
Regarding Norwaldo Phase 2, Abe Swidan asked if the City had explored recycling existing
pavement in order to lower the cost of the project. John Oakley addressed his comment to
assure him that they City is and has explored many variations on this plan to maximize cost and
green infrastructure.
Regarding Glenroy Village, Gary Whitmore had several questions/comments about the hybrid
ditch system planned for this area. His questions were addressed by Ed and John.
Discussion was also had regarding Frog Hollow. Gary Whitmore raised the question as to
whether the City has considered buying the homes in the area rather than fixing the drainage
issues as a more cost-effective solution. John Oakley addressed his comment and assured him
that this was a highly unlikely solution.
Next, Program Funding was reviewed and the TAC was asked for their input on a possible storm
water rate increase. This sparked questions from Gary Whitmore and Abe Swidan regarding the
source of storm water project funding and current interest rate on the bond, respectively. John
addressed the funding source, but did not have the interest rate to share.
Next, Ed Bukovac addressed information on NPDES Compliance and a potential audit. Terri
Czajka asked who would be conducting the audit, but that is not known at this time.

Then, John Oakley reviewed new Storm Water Standards and scheduled internal and external
training sessions.
Lastly, Ed led a brief discussion on future meetings including potentially rotating locations. The
TAC generally seemed to be in favor of doing this for some future meetings.
Next meeting will likely be held in June.

Date:

July 12, 2011

Time:

5:30-7:30 p.m.

Location: The Nature Conservancy
Subject: Storm Water Technical Advisory Committee Q2 Meeting
Participants: John Oakley, Ed Bukovac, Jessica Castellanos, Gary Whitmore;
Guest Speaker: John Hazlett
MEETING SUMMARY:
The July 12th meeting marked the second gathering of the Storm Water Technical Advisory
Committee for 2011. Six (6) of the seven (7) members notified us that they were unable to
attend.
Through feedback gathered during a member survey, we learned that SWTAC members were
interested in “field trip” experiences around this city. In response to that commentary, this
meeting was hosted at the Nature Conservancy and had a special focus on sustainability. John
Hazlett, Director of the Office of Sustainability, began the meeting with a presentation on the
work that his office is doing and green infrastructure being utilized throughout the city. He
answered Gary Whitmore’s questions regarding rain gardens.
Following John Hazlett’s presentation, Ed Bukovac discussed Storm Water Program Funding, the
IDDE brochure, the current status of projects and gave a brief update on the NPDES Permit.
Next, Ed introduced the Google Earth application to Gary Whitmore in an effort to solicit his
feedback. He was shown examples of how the application works and a more in-depth
conversation was had about the connection between complaints logged with the Mayor’s Action
Center (MAC) and the Google Earth application. Ed and John Oakley both encouraged Gary
Whitmore to share with his network of concerned citizens the importance of reporting their
issues/complaints through the MAC.
Lastly, Travis from The Nature Conservancy led the group on a tour of the building and shared
many of their BMPs with the group.
Next meeting will be held in the fall.

Steve Nielsen welcomed Clean Stream Team Advisory Committee members and guests, and he
gave a brief overview of the meeting agenda.
Consent Decree Enhancement Plan
Nielsen announced that the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and U.S. Department
of Justice (DOJ) have fully executed Amendment 2 of the city’s Combined Sewer Overflow
(CSO) Consent Decree. The Indianapolis Department of Public Works (DPW) has received
verbal notification of the approval, but a signed document has not yet been provided. As part of
Amendment 2, the city is required to construct a citywide tunnel system with a storage capacity
of no less than 250 Million Gallons (MG).
The Belmont Advanced Wastewater Treatment (AWT) Plant will be upgraded to treat 300 MGD,
while the Southport AWT Plant will have a treatment capacity of 250 MGD. Nielsen said the air
and oxygen nitrification systems at the Belmont AWT Plant are under construction to expand
capacity to 300 MGD. The ultraviolet (UV) disinfection and pre-ozonation project was recently
bid, and the contractor’s bid came in $6 million below the engineer’s estimate. He said the
engineer designed the project to the specifications of three (3) UV manufacturers’ products,
which helped to keep bids competitive. Trojan will be the manufacturer for the UV units. Both
the UV and pre-ozonation projects must be completed and in full operation by 2013 and notices
to proceed with the construction has been issued.
Nielsen said the Deep Rock Tunnel Connector (DRTC) will be the first leg of the overall tunnel
system for the ultimate storage of 250 MG of wastewater for treatment at the Southport AWT
Plant. The project is to be bid in two (2) phases with the first phase being the tunnel and the
second phase being the DRTC pump station with a capacity of 90 to 120 MGD. In the future,
DPW will also construct new grit removal and screening facilities and upgrade the headworks
facility at Southport along with primary clarifier enhancements and the addition of UV
disinfection to provide for 250 MGD of treatment capacity. At Belmont AWT Plant, DPW is

moving forward with the installation of centrifuges and primary clarifier enhancements. A
conversion of the air nitrification system to oxygen nitrification is also in progress. At both
plants, DPW plans to eliminate the bio-roughing systems, which can be a major cause of odors.
The Deep Rock Tunnel Connector design is currently 90 percent complete. Nielsen said the
project is the first phase of the citywide tunnel system, and it will provide approximately 58
million gallons of wastewater storage. The project will address CSOs 008, 117 and 118, as well
as two other smaller outfall structures 112 and 113 in the future. Nielsen said DPW expects to
begin to advertise for bids in early May 2011 and receive bids in July. A notice to proceed (NTP)
will most likely follow in September, and the contractor must complete construction by
December 31, 2017. Nielsen said the three shafts for launching of the tunnel boring machine,
screening & grit removal and pump station, will be consolidated to two, and screening and grit
removal will be incorporated into the tunnel system.
For the Fall Creek/White River Tunnel DPW has determined that the ending shaft will not be near
Bush Stadium. Nielsen said many groups had expressed concern about construction noise in the
area, so instead, the ending retrieval shaft for the White River tunnel and start of the Fall Creek
tunnel will be located near West 21st and West Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. streets at the Citizens
Energy Langsdale site. To accommodate this change, the White River Tunnel will be lengthened
and the Fall Creek Tunnel will be shortened in the plans, he said. Nielsen said as part of the
project, DPW is also working with Citizens Energy Group (CEG) on an agreement to haul away
soil materials at an old Citizens Coke facility that use to be at the Langsdale site.
Bill Beranek asked how the site at Langsdale Avenue and West Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Street
will be impacted by the project.
Nielsen said the muck from tunnel construction will be removed at the site, and the tunnel team
also will likely have construction staging there. He said if all is functioning as planned, the
potential for an overflow into the White River will be reduced. Nielsen said DPW is updating its
surge models to prevent negative impacts to the river and the canal.
Glenn Pratt said he and other Indianapolis citizens appreciate Director Sherman and the
engineering staff reviewing the City’s CSO Long Term Control Plan to ensure it will provide the
most benefit to the community.
Dick Van Frank requested more detail on the surge problem that was mentioned.
Nielsen explained that when wastewater travels 200 feet down into a deep rock tunnel while
overflows are occurring downstream, friction can build up in the tunnel. The friction can then
cause “belches” in the system, and the result can be a surge, much like a geyser, that is discharged
above ground. He added that at a future meeting, DPW could review the hydraulic models with
the committee to show gates, load on the system, etc.

Dan Considine said a video of a surge is posted on YouTube; he suggested sending it to the
committee.
Pratt requested that the effectiveness of the disinfection process be addressed. He acknowledged
that the City treatment plants have oxygen and ozonation systems but said they don’t work
together. The oxygen system delivers O2 at a higher pressure than is optimal for the ozonation
system, he said. Pratt suggested installing valves to streamline the system. He also recommended
using the chlorination/dechlorination for wet weather flow treatment and pre-ozone and UV
disinfection for normal daily flows. He added that DPW should begin discussions with the
regulatory agencies on the permit requirements to integrate ozonation into the treatment system.
He added that if deadlines are not met, the EPA and IDEM may come inspect ammonia limits at
the plant. The limits are currently at the maximum levels allowed, he added.
Pratt asked about the bio-roughing facilities and de-icing chemicals in place at the airport. He said
the airport is considering allowing new de-icing chemicals that can increase ammonia. He asked
what the City will do to address this.
Nielsen said he will look into the issue but believed the concern with the new chemicals would be
a problem with soluble Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD). The current limit is 60,000 pounds
per day for treatment at Southport, which the system can handle. He said the airport and DPW
will be communicating with regard to soluble BOD concerns.
Pratt asked about the implementation of ozonation at the treatment plants. He said that
downstream of the plants, male fish have eggs. He said he expects the EPA to require ozonation
at some point, whether it’s in two or 10 years.
Nielsen said the City has an ozonation system in place that will pre-ozonate 2 to 3 milligrams per
liter. He added that the technology is still being improved.
Pratt said Indianapolis is a pilot city for identifying endocrine disruptors, which can cause the
problems with fish reproduction. He said a number of years ago, the EPA pulled samples from a
number of cities, and Indianapolis participated.
Nielsen said down the road we’ll have an improved ozonation system. He said the technology
needs to improve, so the City is not investing in something that treats some but not all harmful
chemicals.
Wastewater/Water Utilities Transfer Update
Nielsen introduced those CEG staff in attendance: Dan Considine, Jamie Dillard, Jeffrey
Harrison, Dave Kiesel and Ann McIver.

With respect to the water utility, Nielsen said the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC)
recently approved a 26 percent rate increase for drinking water customers. He noted that a 33
percent increase was the percentage that Indianapolis Water initially requested.
For the wastewater utility, DPW and CEG continue to develop plans for the transition and
integration of staff. Beranek asked if DPW staff with the option to join CEG have been notified.
Nielsen said DPW staff members have been interviewed, but offers have not been extended.
Dick Van Frank said the transition of Septic Tank Elimination Program (STEP) to CEG seems to
be a little in flux. He said that per the Consent Decree, CEG is committed to completing 7,000
septic tank eliminations, but there doesn’t seem to be much enthusiasm to continue the program.
Nielsen commented that STEP is not a requirement of the Consent Decree. Jamie Dillard said
CEG intends to continue the program, but the pace and schedule are to be determined. He added
that the IURC needs to indicate that it’s appropriate for sewer user fees to fund STEP. Following
that decision, Dillard said the timing and project prioritization of STEP would be examined.
Nielsen said the question of future funding is challenging. Currently, the cost to complete septic
tank elimination averages $22,000 to $25,000 per home. The City only collects a $2,500
connection fee per home from property owners, which partially funds the work. He said CEG
needs to find out if the IURC will support the current funding structure of the program in order to
plan for the future.
Beranek said traditionally, the IURC doesn’t support subsidizing the cost of new connections to
utilities. He asked if in the CD, there’s language stating that a certain number of home
conversions would be funded beyond the 7,000 connections.
Nielsen said not all STEP projects are part of the CD. In Indianapolis’ long-term plan through
2025, STEP comprises approximately $700 million. He said a few areas were required as part of
the CD, and those projects have been completed. The 21,000 septic tanks remaining are
prioritized as high, medium and low in the STEP Master Plan.
Beranek asked if a problem with regard to funding STEP after the utility transfer exists, would
the City then consider funding the $700 million program.
Nielsen said if the utility transfer is approved by the IURC, then CEG would be responsible for
implementing STEP.
Dillard said there’s not a legal obligation for CEG to complete the remaining $700 million in
STEP projects.
Pratt said the City faced a lawsuit years ago because failing septic tanks and combined sewer
overflows caused a significant health concern to Indianapolis citizens. He said the City committed

to converting 7,000 homes to city sewers from 2009 to 2013, which is great. With regard to the
Consent Decree, Pratt said his understanding was that a certain amount of funding must be spent
to achieve a specified level of control. He added that if the City comes in under budget on
required CD projects, the remaining funds must be invested to address health issues, like failing
septic tanks, since the level of control is already met. He said the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) recently made a statement before the IURC in support
of continuing STEP.
Dan Considine said CEG has clearly stated that it plans to continue the STEP program.
Beranek reiterated that if the program can be financed, CEG has pledged to continue it; however,
CEG is not legally required to continue the program.
Dillard said after the IURC rules on the utility transfer, CEG will then be able to more closely
examine the program and develop plans for STEP.
Pratt suggested that perhaps the EPA needs to get more involved, so in 2013, after the 7,000
septic tank eliminations are completed, CEG will continue moving forward with STEP.
Beranek said both points were valid, and his hope is that the STEP issue can be resolved before
anyone goes to court.
Van Frank asked if the City’s Financial Capability Analysis (FCA) for the CD has been resolved.
Nielsen said the City has requested discussions with the EPA related to the methodology and
guidance for the FCA. He said the latest FCA was submitted in 2009, and updating the Use
Attainability Analysis (UAA) is on hold.
Beranek requested an explanation of the UAA and FCA update process.
Nielsen said IDEM provides the guidance document to cities on the UAA for determination of
financial affordability, while the EPA manages the FCA update process with respect to the
consent decree. He added that the IDEM UAA guidance allows inclusion of cost of water and
storm water along with other cost factors in the determination of residential burden which results
in higher costs and burden than allowed by EPA in the FCA process. The City and EPA are
arguing over what the FCA can include. EPA, Region 5 has requested that IDEM not approve the
UAA until the City and EPA can resolve the FCA issues.
Indianapolis originally submitted its updated FCA in 2009 and has been working on a revised
update subsequent to comments by EPA. The City used census data from 2010 instead of 2000,
and the median household income from the original submittal was also updated. Nielsen said
apartments also weren’t included in the original residential indicator update since the properties
are considered commercial. DPW did not incorporated data from the excluded cities in the FCA,
with which the EPA doesn’t agree. Nielsen said DPW would prefer to use the Engineering News

Record (ENR) construction cost index when estimating projects rather than the consumer price
index (CPI), but the CPI is what EPA requested.
Nielsen said DPW and the EPA are at 85 percent agreement on the FCA, but the city would like
feedback before the document is submitted. Currently the residential indicator numbers are above
2.4, and the EPA identifies 2.0 and above as “high burden” on residents.
Beranek asked if CEG would complete a new FCA if the utility transfer is approved.
Nielsen said CEG would most likely complete a new FCA; however, CEG will need some time
for the transfer to reach a steady state and to learn about the sewer system first.
A CSTAC member requested clarification on what is part of the savings from the utility transfer.
He said the savings were estimated at $20 million when the transfer was first announced, but he
had heard estimates of up to $60 million, if a 25 percent rate mitigation is achieved by 2025.
Dillard said the savings relate to all five regulated utilities: gas, steam, chilled water, drinking
water and wastewater. With regard to the 25 percent rate mitigation, he said the estimate is based
on rate projections for the water and wastewater user fees. He said, in the future, CEG believes
that the water and wastewater rates will be 25 percent lower than they would have been if the
utilities had remained with the City.
Beranek said that, initially, the savings were emphasized strongly, and now any mention of a
specific percentage for savings seems to have disappeared. He said that if more savings are now
expected to be achieved, it seems that rates should be mitigated more drastically.
McIver said Beranek’s point was valid, and Considine added that the estimate just hasn’t been recalculated to determine the new projected savings. He said the anticipated water/wastewater rate
mitigation will be at least 25 percent, possibly more.
Pratt said there’s a huge backlog of work on the water system. He expressed concern with
maintaining the competency of the operation, rather than savings down the road. He added that
the City has a very complex system in place.
Beranek asked what the deadline to update the UAA and submit it to IDEM was.
Nielsen said the deadline is October 2011, and if the UAA is not approved, IDEM’s guidance
documents state that Indianapolis can stop work on CD projects.
Beranek suggested that staff members be extremely cautious in their approach to the UAA and
spending money on projects. He said that if CEG will also be completing a UAA, coordination of
those efforts should be discussed to determine what parts of the program are feasible to complete.

Nielsen said the UAA must be submitted to the Water Review Board in order to keep projects on
schedule.
Beranek said at some point Congressman Carson or Senator Lugar may need to be engaged in
this, and he did not see an endpoint.
Nielsen said the agreement in Amendment 2 of the CD states that EPA, Region 5, will not
interfere with UAA approval. DPW is currently trying to schedule a meeting with Region 5 to
review the updated FCA. He said that no matter how the residential indicator is calculated, the
financial burden to residents is higher than the initial FCA, and EPA’s consultants have
confirmed that.
Beranek said with the estimated LTCP savings, perhaps EPA is expecting more money to be
invested in additional system improvements.
McIver said CEG also has discussed the utility transfer savings with EPA. CEG has explained
that the $60 million in anticipated savings extends across all the utilities and is an allocated
savings to the community.
CEG expects that it will complete an FCA as well, McIver said, but staff would not complete one
until CEG has at least one year experience operating the system. She said collecting system
operations and maintenance (O & M) data is necessary in order to complete the FCA.
Beranek said if the EPA and IDEM would solidify the rules, there would be less spinning of
wheels by DPW and CEG.
Nielsen said the October 2011 date to submit the UAA is real to DPW. He said projects need to
continue, but if needed, staff will take a step back before spending millions of dollars. He said
DPW, through NACWA, also is in discussions with EPA about the sewage sludge incinerator
rules and EPA has been granted a one month extension by the courts for issuance of the rules .
Beranek said regardless of how CEG funds STEP, he has never heard that the program wouldn’t
continue.
Pam Thevenow said she’s been with the Marion County Health Department (MCHD) for the
terms of four or five Indianapolis mayors, and the cost to connect homes doesn’t get any cheaper.
She said that waiting to complete projects creates a major problem for the homeowner with a
failing septic tank. Some pay $200 or $300 per week to get a septic tank pumped because they
have no other choice. Thevenow said Indianapolis needs to have sewers in neighborhoods.
Van Frank suggested that those present re-read the CD. He said septic systems are mentioned as
part of the water quality problem, and they’re covered in the LTCP.

Beranek said the fundamental difficulty is how to fund STEP and who should pay for the
program; it’s a difficult public policy issue.
Nielsen said even if the City was going to continue to continue managing the program, projects
still would have to be completed on a specific schedule and at pace that rate payers can afford.
Pratt handed out the NAACP statement on the STEP to the IURC. He said failing septic tanks can
lead to encephalitis and mosquito breeding, and kids also play in water contaminated with
sewage. He said there was an agreement in place with Bart Peterson to eliminate septic tanks, and
it was supported by the City-County Council, the Indianapolis Star, and TV stations in the area.
Pratt said we must move forward with a solution to the problem.
White River Cleanup
Kevin Hardie, executive director of Friends of the White River, introduced himself. He said the
White River Cleanup was founded 25 years ago to engage residents in an effort to have a cleaner
river, and the 2011 cleanup will take place Saturday, April 30. This year’s event will have a
maximum of 200 volunteers, and it will conclude around noon. The Friends of the White River is
working with DPW and United Water to plan the event.
The focus of the event was initially areas south of White River State Park where many dumping
sites existed. He said many are gone, thanks to increased awareness in the community and the
White River Cleanup. Hardie said volunteers include teens and adults, and over the years,
multiple generations have begun to participate.
Thevenow said in the early years of the White River Cleanup, there was a focus on illegal
dumping. In recent years, there are fewer abandoned cars, illegally dumped appliances and less
litter. She added that the investment in green infrastructure and improvements in White River
park create a sense of celebration for the event.
Hardie distributed a flyer to the group. Nielsen said the White River Cleanup was a great
program, and Hardie thanked him for the City’s commitment. More information is available at
www.friendsofwhiteriver.org.
Marion County Soil and Water District (MCSWCD) Clean Water Presentations
Ron Lauster, director of the Marion County Soil and Water Conservation District (MCSWCD),
provided attendees with a news release on the clean water presentations being offered.
He referenced a recent article in the Indianapolis Star in which are residents were interviewed.
DPW has plans to complete a sewer separation project and install a bioswale near Pogues Run on
the east side of Indianapolis, and he said neighbors were upset about the project because they
didn’t understand the concept of a bioswale. He said this instance is just one example of an
opportunity for MCSWCD to use clean water presentations as a community learning tool.

MCSWCD received a grant to fund the clean water presentations, and since mid-2010, staff have
given 30 of the 50 presentations that are possible as part of the grant. Lauster said for 40 years,
his staff worked with residents to drain farmland, and recently, there’s been a move to use more
natural practices such as rain gardens and bioswales. He said the presentations are helping to
educate the public on these more sustainable practices.
Beranek referenced the handout, and he asked if MCSWCD assists with erosion control plans at
construction sites.
Lauster said that 80 percent of MCSWCD’s funding is provided by city-county government. As a
result, MCSWCD and the City have a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for construction
site inspection. Lauster’s staff members inspect county-sponsored construction sites and report on
the effectiveness of the erosion control plans. He said MCSWCD staff members submit a report,
and city-county government determines what, if any, additional action is needed.
Pratt mentioned House Bill (HB) 1425, which will be voted on in the current legislative session.
He said the bill will have an impact on the levels of nutrients that are allowed in Indiana
reservoirs and lakes. He said several local soil and water conservation districts have banned
phosphorous in fertilizers. Sierra Club and the Indiana Wildlife Federation (IWF) also have
worked with MCSWCD to stress the importance of phosphorous-free fertilizers. He said
Representative Richard Dodge is aware that the issue has both environmental and economic
impacts. Two years ago, the Indiana legislature passed a bill eliminating requiring phosphorousfree dishwasher detergents in Indiana.
Pratt encouraged those in attendance to support HB 1425. He said if it passes the House of
Representatives; Senator Beverly Gard would carry the bill through the Senate. He said investing
in phosphorous-free fertilizers would help the state to begin securing adequate funding for soil
and water conservation districts statewide. He added that work must be done with the agricultural
community to make progress.
Nielsen said that in addition to erosion control inspection work and clean water education, the
MCSWCD assists meeting residents with resolving drainage problems. He said drainage
assistance offered by MCSWCD is a valuable service for homeowners, since DPW storm water
projects can only be completed for public benefit. Thevenow agreed.
Other Business
Van Frank said he’d like to hear more about the sludge incineration rules being considered by
EPA mentioned earlier in the meeting.
Nielsen said the City is moving ahead with rehabilitation of incinerators, which includes new
scrubbers. He said the work will bring the City facilities within the range of reasonable permit

limits. He said discussions with EPA included differing opinions on how to clean up the sludge
so it meets environmental requirements.
The City also looking at ways to capture energy from the sludge during incineration.. Other
concerns include how to treat chlorides and eliminate cyanides with the incinerators at a higher
temperature. In addition, the City would like to identify ways to provide the ash to concrete
contractors.
Van Frank suggested using the sludge to produce bricks.
Nielsen said they had examined that, and IDEM in the past would only allow the bricks to be
used at the treatment plants. He said the City is currently conversing with some brick
manufacturers.
Van Frank asked if the inclusion of ash could be incorporated into bid process for City projects.
Nielsen said the tunnel liner and concrete mix will be left up to the contractor.
The meeting was adjourned.

Date: August 4, 2011

Time: 11:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.

Location: Fall Creek/White River Room
Subject: Clean Stream Team Advisory Committee (CSTAC) Meeting
Participants: Ken Almon, Paul Berebitsky, Tim Blagsvedt, Jimmy Bostick, Dan

Bob Masbaum welcomed CSTAC members and guests, and introductions were made.
He then invited Dan Considine of Citizens Energy Group to begin his presentation on
the water and wastewater utility transfer.
Utility Transfer Update
Considine said the utility transfer process began for the City of Indianapolis and
Citizens Energy Group in December 2009. Both groups have received lots of public
input at more than 60 meetings, and the process has been very complicated. He
reviewed key dates including:
July 2010 City-County Council approves transfer
May 2011: Citizens reaches settlement agreement
July 2011: Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) approves utility
transfer
(Citizens Energy Group PowerPoint, slides 1-3)
Highlights of the IURC Order were as follows:
Utility transfer in the public interest
Citizens has legal, financial & technical expertise: Considine said legal
expertise would be taken care of through in-house staff or the acquisition of
employees.
Asset purchase agreement approved
Current water & wastewater rates retained: Citizens Energy Group will
continue assessing the current user fee rates that are in effect until the next
rate case is presented to the IURC.
STEP approved through 2013
o Future STEP costs will be considered with next rate case

o Citizens remains committed to future STEP projects
o Citizens is optimistic STEP costs will be approved
o Citizens will seek collaboration with community in presenting case for
STEP: Considine said Citizens remains committed to long-term
implementation of the STEP program. He added that during the rate
case advisory groups like the CSTAC, neighborhood associations and
residents all will be called on to support the STEP program during the
first rate case.
Approves Environmental Compliance Plan: Citizens will make an additional
filing with regard to the plan.
o Mechanism for recovering costs of LTCP
Citizens will document and report savings: Considine said Citizens will report
regularly to the IURC and publish an annual report to the community on its
website. Citizens also will issue a report to the City-County Council. The
report will cover savings as well as overall processes, synergies and
opportunities for improvements.
Citizens will engage advisory groups: Currently, Citizens interacts with the
CSTAC, water technical advisory committee, an advisory committee for the
advanced wastewater treatment (AWT) plants and the Citizens Advisory
Group (CAG), which includes volunteers who represent the Indianapolis
Water customer base. Considine said Citizens will eventually look into
combining the technical groups to more efficiently gather input. He added
that Citizens already has begun conversations with the CAG facilitator about
calling on this the group for input on all Citizens utilities.
Water conservation and drought response plans will be submitted
(Citizens Energy Group PowerPoint, slides 4-5)
When Citizens completes the acquisition of the water and wastewater utilities, it
will assume $1.5 billion in debt from the City of Indianapolis. Citizens also will pay
$262.6 million for the purchase price of the utilities. Payment in Lieu of Taxes
(PILOT) will also be monetized for the wastewater system at an estimated cost of
$140 million. The total proceeds to the City will be approximately $425 million.
(Citizens Energy Group PowerPoint, slide 6)
Currently, Citizens staff members are focused on executing a smooth transition.
Their goal is to continue providing excellent service and reliability to its customers,
Considine said. Virtually all Indianapolis Water employees will be retained, as well
as the United Water contract to operate the wastewater collection system. Citizens

will also welcome employees from the Department of Public Works (DPW) and
Department of Waterworks (DOW). (Citizens Energy Group PowerPoint, slide 7)
Considine said the transition is going pretty well overall, but it will not be completed
without some chaos as employees move to new and temporary locations, and adopt
new phone numbers and emails.
As the utility transfer approaches the closing date, Considine said Citizens is
thankful that the debt ceiling has been raised by the U.S. Congress. If the debt ceiling
wasn’t raised, the bond market would have been unstable, and the next steps of the
transition may have been put on hold, he added.
In mid-August, Citizens will sell bonds to finance the purchase price of the utility,
and a water bill insert will update customers on the transition. Citizens anticipates a
closing date in late August, and on Day One, 400 new employees will join Citizens.
(Citizens Energy Group PowerPoint, slide 8)
On the water side, employees will report to work like normal. Operations employees
also will primarily report to the same locations. Wastewater utility staff, on the
other hand, will report to the Langsdale facility.
Citizens will make the following commitments to its water and wastewater
customers:
Safe, high-quality water & wastewater service
Cleaner area rivers and streams:
o Invest $3.5 billion to reduce Combined Sewer Overflows (CSOs)
o Continue Septic Tank Elimination Program – 7,000 by 2013
Capital investments to ensure safety and reliability
Achieve $60 million in annual savings: The savings will be achieved after a
three-year integration period.
Reduce rate increases 25 percent by year 2025
(Citizens Energy Group PowerPoint, slide 9)
Considine said continuing to offer quality service for all of its utilities is a priority.
Citizens will assume the City’s current role of meeting CSO Consent Decree
compliance and, as a result, will be very focused on making smart decisions with
regard to capital investments. The gas system is rated as one of best maintained in
the United States, and Citizens looks forward to achieving the same reliability with
the water and wastewater utilities.

After the closing date, customers will see a new Citizens Water Authority logo at the
top of their water/wastewater bill. The entries on the bill will look exactly the same,
and phone numbers will not change. Citizens will still distribute a
water/wastewater bill separate from the gas bill. In 12 to 18 months, he said
Citizens plans to create and distribute a combined bill for all three utilities to
customers in Marion County. On roughly the same timeline, call centers also will be
consolidated.
To manage customer expectations, Citizens also will launch
www.CitizensWater.com immediately upon the completion of the utility transfer.
This website will include information on the new water/wastewater utility, as well
as content from the DOW and DPW websites. (Citizens Energy Group PowerPoint,
slide 10)
Considine closed his presentation by emphasizing Citizens’ focus on quality. For the
past 20 years, Citizens has employed a quality process based on the Malcolm
Baldrige Quality Program, and the leadership plans to continue using that process.
Expectations for quality are high, and Citizens has the following goals:
Industry leading customer service
Combined meter reading for consistency & efficiency
Improved website functionality
Enhanced public outreach
(Citizens Energy Group PowerPoint, slide 11)
Citizens heard complaints about water meter reading and bill estimation during the
utility transfer public meetings, so meter reading will be combined in conjunction
with utility bill and operations consolidation.
Considine said the bill estimation procedure also will be addressed within the first
year in an effort to estimate closer to normal consumption. He explained that water
meters are below ground, so there will be times when meters are not read because
there’s snow on the ground.
Pratt said that IURC mandates yearly average estimates, but they can be inaccurate
in January. He said the sooner the estimation procedure is changed, the better.
Considine said Citizens is focused on getting meter reading process in place as
quickly as possible. For the gas utility, less than 1 percent of meter reads are
estimated, and when an estimate does occur, normal consumption of gas for that

particular month is considered. For example, an estimated bill in December 2011
would be based, in part, on the consumption during the previous December or
January.
Considine said enhancing public outreach also is a priority after the closing. Water
and wastewater utilities differ greatly from gas in terms of their impact on citizens.
He added that they touch people’s lives in a more personal way because they are
used for home consumption, recreation, and they also present environmental
factors. All of this will be examined as public outreach planning continues, he added.
Considine said Citizens is very excited about the utility transfer, although it is a
hectic time. He added that this is biggest change in the organization’s history since it
was formed 124 years ago, and it presents a huge opportunity to better serve the
community.
Questions
Roper asked if other cities have completed similar utility transactions.
Considine said that in 1997 or 1998 in Jacksonville, Florida, a municipal electric
system took over the water and wastewater system, and Citizens has studied that
acquisition closely. Citizens interviewed municipal staff members that were
involved with the acquisition, and a former chief executive officer of the utilities
worked with Citizens on a consulting basis.
The Jacksonville example is somewhat different since the electric utility made the
acquisition, Considine explained. He said the gas, water and wastewater
combination actually can offer more synergies since all three utilities are
underground.
Considine concluded that because Citizens is the only public charitable trust
operating utilities in the United States, the transaction is fairly unusual. Citizens has
had lots of interest from associations and other cities during the utility transfer.
Pratt said another Indiana community combined its gas, water and wastewater
utilities but it didn’t work out. He said he hoped this one would.
Considine said there are a number of successful combination utilities including
Colorado utilities, which have gas, water and wastewater utilities plus electric.
Memphis also has combined light, gas and water. He says these are somewhat
unusual, but they are in operation.

Van Frank asked how the utilities will be listed in the phone book. He said
traditionally, people don’t like to think about sewer and water being together.
Considine said the Citizens Gas number will still be listed in the phone book, and
initially, on the water and sewer side, customers will be instructed to call the water
company phone number. As the utilities are integrated in the next year or two, call
centers and phone numbers will be consolidated. Considine said having one phone
number and web address will make customer service more effective.
Van Frank said Citizens Water makes him think of drinking water.
Considine reminded CSTAC members that the water/sewer bill is currently
combined, so consolidating other communications should be easy.
Glenn Lange said he hoped outreach would be very prominent because there is
some confusion about what agency to contact. He said the Marion County Soil &
Water Conservation District (MCSWCD) receives dozens of calls every day about
water service. He added that directory assistance doesn’t have a clear
understanding of the service provided by each agency, and the problem has been
difficult to resolve.
Considine said he had a good point, and the issue can be addressed if Citizens Water
creates a strong web identity. He said getting the Citizens Water website to the top
of a search list through search engine optimization will direct customers to the
appropriate phone number. Considine added that the communication staff’s first
action will be to make fire and police departments aware of Citizens Water’s
responsibilities.
Citizens also is coordinating with the Mayor’s Action Center. All water-related calls,
including flooding and drainage, will be directed to the water company phone
number. They will then be rerouted to the appropriate agency. Considine said the
City and Citizens agreed that to the public “water is water” whether it’s a flood or a
sewer backup, and a resident should only have to place one phone call.
Lange and Thevenow acknowledged that both MCSWCD and the health department
receive sewer backup calls.
Considine said resolving the confusion on what agency to call will be achieved
through repetition with many communications tools including the water/sewer bill,
monthly bill inserts and on the website.

Paul Berebitsky asked if the debt Citizens will assume is related to the Deep Rock
Tunnel Connector.
Considine said it was not. Citizens will assume $900 million in debt from DOW and
about $500,000 from DPW. He said the debt is from operations and capital
investments that have already been made in the systems.
Jamie Dillard added that Citizens will be responsible for all bonds moving forward
including the Deep Rock Tunnel Connector.
Pratt said he hoped Citizens was considering how it would fund the services
provided by MCSWCD, as well as issues related to the development taking place
near Geist Reservoir. He said these and other watershed impacts should be
considered.
Considine said Citizens likes the soil and water conservation district.
Roper asked when the Day One will be.
Considine said the closing is currently scheduled for the last week of August, and
Citizens could adjust if necessary to implement the transition in a responsible way.
Dillard said there are lots of working pieces and the sale of the bonds could put a
snag in the closing. He added that interest rates are very good right now, and
Citizens is pleased with that.
Masbaum asked if there were any other comments or questions.
Van Frank requested an update on the City’s pilot program to implement storm
water control using wetlands, rain gardens, etc. He said the program was previously
presented to the committee, and it sounded good but expensive up front. Van Frank
said he later learned results from the Fall Creek pilot project weren’t measured
because it was working too well. He suggested that the pilot program should be
pursued further to improve water quality and save money, long-term.
Masbaum said an update on this would be considered as a potential agenda item in
the future.
Pratt said the green development goes hand in hand with CSOs and really should be
considered. He also announced that the Environmental Council meeting at the
statehouse would be starting at 1 p.m. and encouraged those present to attend.

Roper asked when the Deep Rock Tunnel Connector would bid.
Masbaum said the bid date was August 11, and he adjourned the meeting.

TAC\Clean Stream Team Advisory Committee\2010\11-04-10

Steve Nielsen thanked members of the Clean Stream Team Advisory Committee for attending and
gave an overview of the agenda. He said the meeting was timely since the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) signed off on the second Consent Decree (CD) amendment the day prior
(November 3). He said he expects that the amendment to the CD will be published in the Federal
Register in the next few weeks, and a 30 day comment period will follow. In early 2011, the city
should have final approval and will move forward with implementation.
Inflow/Infiltration (I/I) Program Update: Database Development and Tracking
Bill Grout said he would give an update on the progress of the program since his last presentation
to the CSTAC in February.
In 2010, the Department of Public Works (DPW) has begun developing a database to track I/I
complaints and monitor progress with regard to correcting illegal connections. Grout said the
database structure should be completed in the next couple of months, and testing will follow. He
said staff will be able to plug an address into the database and see I/I related problems in a given
area and the tasks/actions associated with those problems.
Grout said members of the I/I team include DPW engineering and operations staff, environmental
services staff and United Water. He added that Correct Connect, the most visible piece of the
program, is being handled by the environmental services division of DPW.
I/I complaints are numerous and come from multiple sources. Grout said if a back up or manhole
overflow is reported, those become “priority” projects.
The I/I team meets once a month, and tasks are assigned based on recent complaints. Grout said I/I
is difficult to identify and correct, and once a leak or crack is plugged, another is likely to open up.
As a result, he said DPW is focusing its attention on the larger I/I sources. Christina Bowers is the
team coordinator.

Grout said I/I problems in a mainline sewer are considered a public issue, and I/I related to a sump
pump or downspout connection is considered a private issue. Homeowners are responsible for the
cost and work required to correct private I/I issues; Grout said that makes private I/I issues more
challenging.
A recessed loading dock that is connected to the sewer would be considered a private problem. He
said this problem is not an easy fix and would require pumps to get the water out.
Grout said DPW is currently completing house inspections to identify sump pump connections.
Smoke testing is also being used to identify private defects and get them offline. At Stop 11 and
Madison Avenue, several private and public defects have been identified in the Winchester Village
neighborhood.
I/I successes include disconnecting a parking lot on the north side of Indianapolis. Once it was
offline, Grout said the Belmont North Interceptor stopped overflowing as often.
Bill Beranek asked if the I/I problems are related to old or new development, in particular.
Grout said the problems are related to both old and new development. Some property owners have
yard drains that were not permitted when they were installed. Also some neighborhoods that were
developed in the 1980s and 1990s have illegal sump pump and downspout connections. Recently, a
condominium complex with illegal downspout connections was approached. The owner wasn’t
aware that the connection was illegal, and it was corrected.
The most common defect that is being found is a cleanout cap connected to the sewer. Grout said
DPW does send any property owner with this defect a letter, and inspections are completed
following the letter, as time allows.
Grout said when the I/I database is completed, the enforcement process will go more smoothly. He
said DPW is taking small steps to reduce clear water connections to the sewer. He added that
Richard Wise is overseeing the Correct Connect portion of the program.
Dick Van Frank asked if Correct Connect will become the responsibility of Citizens Energy Group
(CEG) if the transfer is approved.
Nielsen said yes; the program would be CEG’s responsibility. He said CEG recognizes that I/I
reduction is critical since it may help minimize the need for additional relief sewers.
Grout said a draft plan with recommendations with regard to the future of program has been
developed. At a later date, the plan may be something that is shared with CSTAC members.
In the past, United Water and DPW were basically working independently of each other on the I/I
program. There was some overlap in certain areas, but now the groups are collaborating on this

effort, Grout explained. Representatives from all organizations on the I/I team attend progress
meetings.
Al Polin asked if there’s a priority list for I/I defects. He said there is a serious problem in the Fall
Creek Parkway area.
Nielsen said that Fall Creek Parkway is in the combined sewer area, and the amount of clear water
in the system is being examined. He said DPW is currently developing a list and then ranking needs
to ensure the greatest progress. He said DPW is also looking at sealing manholes off in the city’s low
lying areas.
Bob Masbaum suggested that Polin remind his neighbors to call the Mayor’s Action Center when
they have basement backups or manhole overflows.
Polin said that overflows and backups are occurring in the 3700 and 3800 blocks of Fall Creek
Parkway; water comes out of the manholes after heavy rain.
Grout added that the flow monitoring process is also being updated, which will help to more
accurately identify the amount clear water entering the sewer system.
Nielsen said another area that’s being examined is the downtown combined sewer area. He said
some buildings such as the City-County Building have two or three floors underground. DPW is
looking at what buildings are pumping clear water into the sewer system and the Pogue’s Run box.
He said the clear water capture in the downtown area may be a good subject for a future meeting.
He added that CEG also is aware of these investigations.

Deep Rock Tunnel Connector and Pump Station: Implementation of Value Engineering
Initiatives
John Morgan said one of the biggest mantras of U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is…“Value
engineering: It pays.” He said he agrees with that statement because project managers that are
working on a project everyday can get tunnel vision. He added that having someone else review the
work can offer a fresh perspective on any project.
Morgan said he would cover value engineering during advanced facility planning and 30 percent
design of the Deep Rock Tunnel Connector, as well as 30 percent design of the pump station. The
pump station associated with the DRTC project will be installed about 250 feet below ground
surface, and it will pump high volumes of flow to Southport Advanced Wastewater Treatment
(AWT) Plant. (DRTC, slide 2)

During value engineering, the team participated in a process that involves advanced preparation, a
workshop and post-workshop effort. Morgan said this process was used for the tunnel and the
pump station. He said pump station value engineering lasted about six weeks, and five staff from
the design team and four on the owner side participated. In addition, a certified value engineering
coordinator facilitated the event. Morgan said the workshop for the $100 million pump station took
about two days. (DRTC, slide 3)
DRTC Value Engineering: Advanced Facility Planning (AFP)
The value engineering team generated 23 ideas, and six were accepted as part of the design. The
potential savings is expected to be more than $73 million. The six ideas that were accepted include:
Pump station reconfiguration (two suggestions): $29.16 million
Design for one bar screen instead of two: $2.34 million
Eliminate intermediate work shaft: $5.93 million
Eliminate CIP tunnel liner: $32.6 million
Bid pump station sooner: $3.04 million
(DRTC, slide 5)
Morgan said the Deep Rock Tunnel Connector will be the first deep tunnel to be bid and built in
Marion County. He said the cost estimates were developed based on market value for other deep
tunnels in the Midwest. He also said that the pump station will be bid about one year early, and the
savings for that portion will be driven by cash flow. The configuration of the pump station includes
four 30 million gallon per day (MGD) pumps and a wet shaft, he explained. (DRTC, slide 6)
DRTC Value Engineering: 30 Percent Design
The value engineering team generated 14 ideas, and six were accepted for a potential savings of
approximately $46 million. The six ideas that were accepted include:
Eliminate Pleasant Run working shaft: $21 million
Change CIP lining productivity assumptions in schedule: $6 million
Allow precast liner option: $0 savings, possible schedule reduction
Revise depth of slurry walls to only go to top of shale: $4 million
Construct separate shaft for grit and screenings equipment: Additional cost of $8 million
Change shaft type at CSOs 117 and 118 to vortex drop: $23 million
(DRTC, slide 9)
Morgan said that an “adit” is the pipe that will connect the Deep Rock Tunnel Connector to the
Pleasant Run tunnel. He said the adit will be included in the project, but the working shaft will not,
which will result in the $21 million savings.

Additionally, the design team is considering two options for liner installation. Morgan said a “one
pass” approach involves installing a precast liner immediately behind the tunnel boring machine. A
“two pass” method involves boring the entire length of the tunnel and then coming back at a later
time to install the liner. Morgan said the rock stratum in Indianapolis is very similar to Chicago. He
said the tunneling contractors in Chicago are likely to bid on the job, and allowing them to
determine the method of liner installation will most likely improve bids and allow for a smoother
construction period.
The type of drop structure in the pump station also has a significant cost impact, Morgan said.
Initially, the project team incorporated a baffle drop structure at 30 percent design and then a
vortex drop structure was discussed in value engineering.
A vortex drop structure would be eight feet in diameter, while a baffle drop structure would be 30
feet in diameter. A vortex slows the flow down by circulating it (like a commode) as it drops to
reduce the energy in it. The vortex drop would not erode the structure or add air to the flow, which
could take up volume. A baffle drop, on the other hand, slows the flow down and reduces the
amount of energy in the water by sending it downward across a series of ledges about 8 feet apart.
The value engineering team determined that a baffle drop would be about three times as expensive
as a vortex drop to construct, and it would also have a much larger footprint. (DRTC, slide 11)
Van Frank asked how many drop shafts will be needed to construct the deep rock tunnel.
Morgan said three will be necessary to install the Deep Rock Tunnel Connector, and for the Fall
Creek/White River tunnel 10 or 11 drop shafts will be necessary. Citywide—with the other planned
tunnels included—between 30 and 40 will be needed. Morgan said the project team is doing
everything possible to eliminate drop shafts, but they are necessary to maintain the tunneling
equipment.
Pump Station Value Engineering: 30 Percent Design
At the start of pump station value engineering, the project team had the following concerns:
Two foot liner in pump cavern
Reduce cover over pump cavern
Stainless steel (SST) 316 vs. 304
Process piping materials
Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) configuration
Cost reduction and “better” way
(DRTC, slide 13)
Nielsen asked what the horsepower on the pumps would be.

Morgan said he wasn’t sure, but the pumps at the Southport AWT Plant pump station were around
400 horsepower per motor.
Nielsen said he believed the pumps for the total horsepower for Deep Rock Tunnel Connector pump
station would be more than 5,000.
Ralph Roper said with that amount of power, cooling the motors would most likely a challenge. He
asked how it will be done.
Morgan said with that much power, water induction will be used to cool the pumps.
Morgan explained that the pump station in the original CD was 150 MGD, but with CD Amendment
2 signed, the pump station would be 90 MGD firm. The pump station will include three 30 million
gallon pumps and an additional 30 million gallon pump to be used as a spare. He said each of the
pumps will be exercised on a regular basis.
Beranek asked if the pumps will heat the water as it flows through them. He said the water may not
heat that quickly, but heating, if it occurs, would be beneficial when the flow gets to the Southport
AWT Plant in the winter.
Morgan said the pumps would not have a significant impact on the temperature of the flow.
Roper said a separate engineering project would be required to heat wastewater that rapidly.
The current design has the pump station located below grade at the downstream end of the Deep
Rock Tunnel Connector, while the pump station building will be above grade. The purpose of the
pump station will be to dewater the tunnel system and transport flow to the Southport treatment
facility. The design team’s operational philosophy is to turn the pumps on as soon as enough flow is
available to safely operate the pumps. (DRTC, slides 14-15)
The pump station will have four shafts. Two shafts will be bid with the pump station, and the
remaining two will be bid with the deep rock tunnel. Per the CD, the city must issue a Notice To
Proceed for some portion of the project by Dec. 31, 2011. (DRTC, slide 16)
Morgan described the cost allocation for the pump station. He said that direct costs are
approximately $70.6 million. The access and discharge shafts as well as the caverns are expected to
be the majority of the pump station cost. Time spent on the project will be a factor that may also
increase the cost. Morgan said the entire project must be completed by 2017. (DRTC, slides 17-19)
During 30 percent design of the pump station, the value engineering team generated 69 ideas, and
35 were accepted for a potential savings of more than $18 million. Ideas were sorted into the
following categories:
A: Most likely to be developed = 21 ideas

B: Varying degrees of development potential = 19 ideas
C: Not to be developed = 5 ideas
D: Design Suggestions = 24 ideas
(DRTC, slide 20)
The 35 ideas that were accepted are listed below. Morgan said an additional five ideas will be
evaluated at 60 percent design.
1: Combine access and discharge shafts and include a possible safe room to address a single
egress point.
4: Replace screen and grit building with open air canopy structure, and eliminate
mechanical room.
12: Reduce diameters of access and discharge shafts.
13: Review need for structural liner and membrane in pump room.
14: Revise overhead crane support if liner is eliminated.
15: Reduce the width of pump room and overhead crane.
16: Reduce the pump room length.
20: Move mag-meters upstairs in the pump station building to reduce pump room height.
21: Remove mag-meters or use alternative flow measuring.
22: Reduce discharge pipe diameter from 42" to increase velocities that will transport finer
grit.
25: Move pump station building away from access shaft and eliminate caissons.
26: Use steel frame panel clad building instead of reinforced concrete panels.
27: Replace deep foundations with spread footings or mat between shafts.
28: Eliminate second floor of pump station building.
29: Raise pump cavern up to 10 feet.
31: Confirm screen spacing with solid sizes that can pass through pumps.
34: Reduce size of emergency dewatering pumps (EDPs).
36: Replace pump station building overhead crane with jib crane.
37: Revise pump station building to house only electrical and mechanical gear. Provide
canopy over access shaft.
40: Eliminate pump station control room and use panel view interfaces.
41: Install double doors for electrical room.
43: Move pump station building HVAC to first floor or roof and eliminate second floor.
47: Reduce 9.5 foot freeboard in discharge chamber
50: Replace asphalt paving with porous pavers or gravel. Eliminate pump station building
drive through and reduce paving.
51: Review hydraulics at screen in screen and grit shaft.
52: Analyze surge velocities at the screen to determine if additional protection/support is
needed.

56: Review substation sizing with 700 horse power (HP) emergency dewatering pumps fed
at 460 volt (V). Consider 5 kilovolt (kv) pumps, if available.
58: Provide space at 5kV panel for future breakers.
59: Eliminate cable vault in pump station building.
60: Reduce pump room width by installing platform over discharge pipes.
61: Reduce pump room arch and lower ceiling.
63: Support suction piping and discharge headers with saddles and frames connected to the
floor.
64: Reduce pump room hydrostatic loading criteria (TM-11 – pages 10/11) to reducing
lining requirements.
65: Replace discharge structure caisson foundation with spread footings.
67: Use carbon steel or ductile iron instead of stainless steel piping.
69: Eliminate pump room liner.
(DRTC, slides 21-25)
Morgan said at both the Deep Rock Tunnel Connector and pump station value engineering
workshops, everyone had similar ideas for the pump station.
He explained that Idea 25, to move the pump station building away from the access shaft and
eliminate caissons, will create two distinct areas for the deep rock tunnel and pump station
contractors to work. He said the design modification is expected to reduce project costs by
approximately $1.4 million.
Idea 26, to construct a steel frame panel clad building instead of using reinforced concrete panels,
will reduce construction costs. Morgan said the building will be an open air concept rather than an
enclosed building. Many of the structures currently at the plant are open air, and that type of
structure will be sufficient to house the pump station. The savings is expected to be approximately
$1.4 million. (DRTC, slides 31)
Idea 40, to eliminate the pump station control room and use panel view interfaces, involves
consolidation of the Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) equipment. Morgan said
eliminating the pump station control room will also reduce the likelihood of equipment failure.
Eliminating the control room is expected to save approximately $100,000.
Roper asked if floatables have been considered in the pump station design.
Morgan said a clam shell bucket will be used in the grit shaft to reduce floatables, and Nielsen added
that the team plans to follow Milwaukee’s example. Staff will inspect the floatables, and when they
reach a specified quantity, the floatables will be removed.

In value engineering, the team also downsized the pump station. The original design included five
30 MGD pumps, but with space limitations, the revised design now includes three 30 MGD pumps
plus a spare fourth pump.
Morgan described the site development, which includes a pump station building and a separate
screen and grit building. The main tunnel will connect to the shaft at the screen and grit building,
which will help to reduce the amount of clear water coming into the plant. (DRTC, slide 26)
Idea 4 involves replacing the enclosed grit and screen building with an open air building with a
solid roof. Using a steel frame instead of panels is expected to generate a savings of approximately
$2.4 million. The mechanical room also will be eliminated. (DRTC, slides 29-30)
Morgan summarized the potential savings that have been identified as part of the value engineering
process for Deep Rock Tunnel Connector and pump station. He said the total savings listed for each
workshop are independent of each other. The value engineering summary is as follows:

Van Frank asked if during heavy rain, the treatment plants and storage tunnels all reach full
capacity, what would happen.
Nielsen said the pump station would immediately begin pumping wastewater to the treatment
plant when capacity is available. If the tunnels are full and the plant can’t accept the wastewater, he
said a sewer overflow may occur upstream of the tunnel, possibly through the gating structures on
the White River.
Van Frank said his preference would be for the overflows to occur in the White River instead of Fall
Creek.
Morgan said if the rain is really heavy, an overflow may occur on Fall Creek if the White River can’t
accommodate additional overflows. Nielsen added that once the CD is fulfilled, the city will still be
allowed to have four overflows per year on the White River and two overflows per year on Fall
Creek.
Van Frank said the upstream end of the tunnel is near Fall Creek. He asked if an overflow occurs,
why the pumps couldn’t be turned on to divert it to the White River.

Nielsen said the tunnel will address CSOs 008 and 017, and the city also would prefer that any
overflows that occur go into White River. However, new overflow points cannot be created. Nielsen
said DPW is looking at what existing overflow locations could be used for overflows. He said the
overflow locations would be a future point of discussion.
Beranek requested clarification on how savings will be achieved with regard to the tunnel liner. He
stated that if the liner is completely removed from the design, infiltration may increase, and the
savings may actually be used to reduce the infiltration of clear water.
Nielsen said a partial liner is being considered for the bottom of the tunnel. He said achieving “zero”
inflow/infiltration (I/I) would be too expensive. Another consideration would be to install a half
liner and grout inside the tunnel as needed. He said about 170,000 gallons of water will be coming
into the tunnels every day. Nielsen said he expects that the design will include a full lining for the
system to reduce I/I and lower the risk on the contractor, but a liner with steel is not necessary. The
contractor will also have the option to determine if installation is completed with a “one pass” or
“two pass” method.
Beranek said it appears that DPW is considering both the short- and long-term expenditures, which
is a good way to approach the project.
Roper asked where the cuttings will be disposed of during construction. Morgan said cuttings and
muck will belong to the contractor, and he will be responsible to obtain a permit and properly
dispose of the cuttings. If DPW were to dispose of the cuttings, Morgan said that activity would fall
under miner’s regulations, which does not fit with the city’s goals.
Nielsen said that DPW is recommending locations for dumping such as the Southside landfill, but
DPW will not dictate the location.
Morgan said the Deep Rock Tunnel Connector project will be bid in June or July 2011. The tunnel is
at 60 percent design currently, and value engineering has only extended the schedule by 60 days at
the most.
Nielsen said many qualified contractors are aware of the project and are interested in bidding. He
added that once the Notice To Proceed is issued, construction will last 16 to 18 months.
Morgan said the volume of cuttings and muck being hauled away from the construction site will fill
20 to 25 tri-axel trucks per hour. If hauling is limited to 12 hours instead of 24 hours per day, the
number of trucks hauling waste away will double to 40 to 50 per hour.

RebuildIndy Overview
Larry Jones gave an overview of the transportation program; he said there is approximately $1.5
billion in need across Marion County. The program includes:
7,302 lane miles of thoroughfares and residential streets
15,840,000 feet of existing sidewalks
DPW identifies street segments recommended for the program.
(RebuildIndy, slide 2)
Jones said a variety of factors are considered when selecting RebuildIndy projects. He said projects
should be identified in areas that are the most difficult to maintain by DPW Operations. Selection
factors include:
Mayor’s Action Center (MAC) referrals
Administration/operations input
Staff input
Condition assessment
Average daily traffic (ADT)
Neighborhood organization/councilor input
Funding breakdown:
o 75 percent for thoroughfare projects
o 25 percent for residential projects (less traveled areas)
(RebuildIndy, slide 3)
The condition assessment includes scoring of street conditions according to the following scale:
0-10: Failing
11-25: Very Poor
25-40: Poor
(RebuildIndy, slide 4)
Curb and sidewalk selection factors include age, economic development/other commitments, high
pedestrian areas, workload distribution and neighborhood organization/councilor input. DPW also
has a separate voluntary compliance agreement to install approximately, 1,500 ramps per year and
meet requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA); this is also considered when
selecting projects. (RebuildIndy, slide 6)
Jones said that Present Serviceability Rating (PSR) projects with a score ranging from 0 to 2 will be
addressed as part of the RebuildIndy program. Curbs and sidewalks with a score ranging from 3 to
5 will not be rehabilitated or replaced. Mayor Greg Ballard also has indicated that constructing new
sidewalks in areas where they are missing is a priority. Installing these sidewalks will provide

connectivity throughout the county. However, in many cases when a sidewalk is missing there is
virtually no right of way and minimal drainage. Jones said a roadside ditch is the area that would
most likely accommodate a new sidewalk, so installing new sidewalks and correcting the drainage
can be very expensive. Jones said areas on the west, east and south sides of Indianapolis have
missing sidewalks. (RebuildIndy, slides 7-9)
Jones said that out of the $1.5 billion in need, the RebuildIndy program will be successful if $0.3
billion in projects are funded. He said the program manager, American Structurepoint, continues to
work with DPW to prioritize projects and determine the best funding sources.
Jones described a chart of needs and how they would be prioritized if $1 million was available to
fund them. The top priorities were bike lanes, residential resurfacing and alley rehabilitation.
Thoroughfare resurfacing, sidewalk rehabilitation and construction, and greenways were other
priorities. (RebuildIndy, slide 10)
Craig Parks, a program manager for the RebuildIndy program, said the challenge DPW is facing is
determining how best to spread $1.5 billion over multiple areas. He said bike lanes are less
expensive if an existing asphalt section can be restriped, so they rank as a high priority. Parks said
DPW is working to leverage the funding it has currently to secure additional funding. An example of
leverage would be using $1 million as collateral to secure an additional $3 million from a federal
funding source. Types of funding include:
Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement (CMAQ) Program
Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP)
Transportation Enhancements (TE)
Department Of Energy (DOE)
Earmarks (legislation-related)
PILOT (Payment In Lieu Of Taxes) funds from the utility transfer agreement generated $155 million
in funding for the RebuildIndy program. Parks said $55 million in projects have already bid and will
be constructed by the end of 2011. DPW is working aggressively to select and design projects that
will comprise the remaining $100 million. (RebuildIndy, slide 11)
Parks reiterated that tapping into federal funding is key to the RebuildIndy program. He said that
15 years ago the Indianapolis Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) received about 80 percent
of the federal funds that were available. Today, MPO receives about 50 percent of the federal
funding that’s available. He said with development outside Marion County increasing, securing 80
percent of the funds may not be available but the goal is to get closer to that percentage.
The program management team has identified low cost, high impact projects that they can move
forward with quickly and aggressively. Parks said projects that add travel lanes are being
prioritized based on need and geographic location. He explained that securing funding is crucial to

design and build projects, so one staff member is dedicated to identifying and pursuing federal
funds. (RebuildIndy, slide 12)
In 2011 and 2012, high impact projects that require limited or no right-of-way will be completed
with federal funds. Parks added that the projects are spread throughout Marion County, and more
difficult projects with lots of required land will have a later completion date.
Parks said meeting Minority-, Woman-, and Veteran-owned Business Enterprise (M/W/VBE) goals
are difficult to meet when completing transportation projects. To accomplish those goals,
RebuildIndy has created an oversight committee that will educate the industry on how to register
as a minority firm and bid on city projects. The oversight committee also is identifying tools that
will be used to measure progress. Components of the oversight committee include: public relations,
industry connectivity, mentoring/training, tracking and project makeup. (RebuildIndy, slide 13)
Because there is overlap between the transportation, sanitary and storm water programs, quarterly
meetings with each division have been established. Parks said these meetings will allow staff to
identify when minor storm water improvements and green initiatives can be incorporated into
resurfacing projects. (RebuildIndy, slide 14)
Bill Beranek said that in the past Indianapolis Water and Department of Public Works coordination
was lacking. He said storm water currently drains into the Central Canal, which is a drinking water
source. He asked if drainage could be examined on future projects so the problem can be corrected.
Nielsen said the drainage into the Central Canal is fairly limited on the north side of Indianapolis.
There are some instances near Butler University and Woodstock Country Club where storm water
drains to the canal, but those are basically it. He added that when the wastewater and water utilities
are transferred, CEG will be addressing the issue.
Polin said the bridge in the Keystone Avenue and Fall Creek area has just had a bridge rehabilitated,
but after rain, storm water builds up on the bridge. He suggested that drainage on the bridge be
examined.
Allyson Pumphrey of the Office of Sustainability presented green infrastructure aspects of the
RebuildIndy program. She said a Green Checklist has been developed to provide guidance and
evaluation tools for capital improvement projects. The checklists will be utilized in project scoping,
design, construction and post-construction to assist project managers in identifying opportunities
to incorporate green infrastructure. Pumphrey said green infrastructure is more than rain gardens.
It also includes bioswales, connectivity, bioretention, porous pavement, performance monitoring
and more. Pumphrey said many of these components will improve storm water drainage, which
will, in turn, extend the life of the pavement. (RebuildIndy, slide 15)

Pumphrey said the “Big Ten” green infrastructure pilot projects have been identified, and the
timeline for completion is July 2010 through December 2011. (RebuildIndy, slide 16) The Big Ten
projects include:
1. Alabama Street:
o Location: From Terrace Avenue to Lincoln Street

o Construction: Schedule is to be determined
Pumphrey said the Office of Sustainability values the pilot project process as a means to evaluate
areas where green infrastructure can be successfully implemented in Indianapolis. She said staff
will measure the successes and failures in the Big Ten projects, as well as develop maintenance
plans for each. The projects will also aid in the development and implementation of green
infrastructure policies.
The Office of Sustainability also has developed a Web resource center as part of its rain garden
program. www.sustainindy.org offers guidance for designing, constructing and maintaining a rain
garden. Pumphrey said the city is looking to residents and business owners to participate in the
rain garden program, which will reduce the stress being placed on the city’s sanitary, storm water
and transportation systems. Pumphrey added that outreach is focused on internal and external
publics, and an on-call urban conservationist will be hired to assist.
Polin asked if Fall Creek Pilot Project has been monitored.
Nielsen said the project is actually working too well; he said there isn’t a discharge from it. He
explained that some additional sewer separation work to capture discharge for flow monitoring. He
added that the DPW is considering expanding wetlands at Troy Avenue and Banta Road, and the
CSO 143 separation at 21st Street and Sherman Drive is being considered for bioremediation and
rain gardens.
Polin requested an update on funding for the transportation and mass transit system.
Parks said Indianapolis is competing for funding with several communities in the metropolitan area
but is trying to maximize what’s available.
Jones said a sales tax increase and Surface Transportation Program (STP) is being considered to
fund mass transit. He said the mass transit is competing for funding with the transportation portion
of the RebuildIndy program, and its route may be in conflict with the transportation and sewer
infrastructure. Jones said the mass transit corridors have been identified, and many of the routes
are in existing rail corridors.

Long Term Control Plan Update
Masbaum reviewed the requirements of the city’s consent decree with the EPA and DOJ. The CD,
which was executed in September 2006, requires:
97 percent capture in Fall Creek with up to two CSOs in a typical year
95 percent capture in White River and all other waterways with up to four CSOs in a typical
year
Completion of a $1.7 billion (2004 dollars) Long Term Control Plan that includes 31 control
measures
(Long Term Control Plan, slide 1)
He said DPW has completed value engineering to identify cost savings related to the Long Term
Control Plan. The first piece included a review of the Interplant Connect, which is now referred to
as the Deep Rock Tunnel Connector. The city initiated conversations with IDEM and EPA in May
2008 to discuss CD modifications, and in December 2008 the EPA and DOJ approved them. The CD
amendment will allow the city to construct the Deep Rock Tunnel Connector, a more reliable tunnel
solution. (Long Term Control Plan, slides 2-4)
Masbaum said the Deep Rock Tunnel Connector diameter was increased from 12 to 18 feet, and it
will be constructed in deep rock rather than soft ground. One of the two previously planned pump
stations also were eliminated, which will result in energy savings. (Long Term Control Plan, slides
5-6)
In May 2009, the city proposed a second CD modification, which is referred to internally as the
Enhancement Plan. Masbaum said the plan was based on more detailed system modeling and a
holistic analysis of the sewer system’s storage and treatment. Based on this additional information,
DPW identified ways in which to reduce the size of planned projects while still achieving CD
requirements. Goals of the second CD amendment included:
Remove more sewage sooner
Meet CD performance criteria and schedule
Incorporate the most cost effective environmental solutions
Reduce the carbon footprint
(Long Term Control Plan, slide 7)
Roper said the method of flow measurement used in the original analysis was overestimating the
flow to the treatment plants, and more accurate measurement helped to match the model to the
data.

Masbaum said the EPA provided verbal approval of the Enhancement Plan in May 2010, and
written approval is expected to be completed later in November. Publication in the Federal Register
will occur about two weeks after written approval is granted. (Long Term Control Plan, slide 8)
The Enhancement Plan will add additional deep storage tunnels along Pogues Run and Pleasant
Run, instead of collection sewers. Masbaum said the addition of these tunnels will have a more
positive impact on the environment. Milestone dates in the CD were modified slightly to ensure that
all projects are scheduled in a logical/cost effective sequence; however, the final Long Term Control
Plan compliance date of 2025 will remain the same. Masbaum said that with this second CD
modification, DPW will have the ability to refine the Long Term Control Plan to be more affordable
for the city and ratepayers. (Long Term Control Plan, slides 9-12)
Masbaum said all deep storage tunnels are currently in design or advanced facility planning.
Following is a list of tunnels and other key CD projects still to be delivered:
Deep Rock Tunnel Connector
Fall Creek/White River Tunnel
Pogues Run Tunnel
Pleasant Run Tunnel
Eagle Creek Interceptor (not started)
Castleton Relief Sewer (phase I has bid)
East Marion County Interceptor (manhole and rehabilitation phases have bid)
Southport Advanced Wastewater Treatment (AWT) Plant
o Headworks Expansion
o Secondary Expansion
o Primary Clarifiers
o Wet Weather Disinfection
(Long Term Control Plan, slide 13)
CD Elements that still must be delivered include:
Update of the Long Term Control Plan every five years
Use Attainability Analysis Development: In progress/discussions with regulatory agencies
Financial Capability Assessment (FCA)
o Updates completed every five years
o In progress/discussions with regulatory agencies
o Periodic CD reporting
(Long Term control Plan, slide 13)

Masbaum added that the EPA guidance with regard to the FCA offers lots of flexibility, but the
agency itself has a different interpretation of what the guidance suggests. Because of economy, the
FCA actually looks worse for Indianapolis than when it was first developed.
Van Frank asked if the utility transfer would have any impact on the FCA.
Nielsen said the utility transfer could impact the financial capability, but CEG isn’t able to step up to
the table yet. The FCA examines affordability of the Long Term Control Plan for ratepayers and the
amount of work that can be completed during a given time. Nielsen said that IDEM has requested an
updated FCA before the UAA is addressed.
Masbaum said that in the 1990s, the Long Term Control Plan and UAA were developed to work
together. The original CD stated that approval of an updated UAA must be completed in September
2006 and 2011. The city submitted a UAA in advance of the 2011 deadline, but once the EPA
became involved IDEM decided not to approve it.
Beranek said the agencies seem to be using the documents in the wrong way. He said financial
capability should not be tied to the UAA, and the clear guidance that EPA laid out has been lost. He
said these issues with the FCA and UAA need to be resolved or the schedule will be affected.
Masbaum said the UAA is based on water quality standards, and if the updated version is not
approved, an Indianapolis citizen could sue the city for not meeting those standards.
Non-CD programs that still need to be delivered include plant expansion (growth), plant
rehabilitation, collection system expansion, collection system rehabilitation, Septic Tank
Elimination Program (STEP) and the storm water capital program. (Long Term control Plan, slide
14)
Masbaum said electrical rehabilitation is in progress at both treatment plants. An additional
challenge will be to meet air pollution standards at the plant. Masbaum said a requirement to
measure the air pollution from incinerators is being implemented, and there isn’t currently a
method for measurement in place.
Beranek said the mass burning facility at the Belmont AWT Plant was designed and bid to burn
sludge as well as trash. After the project was bid the contractor pointed out that burning sludge
and trash would not produce consistent sludge quality. He said that’s why sludge isn’t being mass
burned as intended.
Nielsen said CEG, Covanta and DPW would need to meet and discuss the options.
Beranek said the city is in violation of the water quality standard and has been in violation for 20
years.
Nielsen adjourned the meeting.

RULES AND PUBLIC POLICY COMMITTEE
The Rules and Public Policy Committee of the City-County Council met on Tuesday,
June 12, 2012. Chair Brian Mahern called the meeting to order at 5:48 p.m. with the
following members present: John Barth, Vernon Brown, Monroe Gray, Maggie Lewis,
Robert Lutz, Angela Mansfield and Michael McQuillen. Councillors Zach Adamson, Jeff
Cardwell and Leroy Robinson were also in attendance. General Counsel Fred
Biesecker, Chief Financial Officer Hope Tribble and Minority Caucus Counsel Robert
Elrod represented Council staff.
Chair Mahern asked committee members to introduce themselves and indicate which
portion of the County they represent.
PROPOSAL NO. 168, 2012 - authorizes the controller to make application to the
Department of Local Government Finance for an interest free loan to enhance revenues
in the City Cumulative Capital Development Fund
Councillor Mansfield said that this proposal was originally referred to the Administration
and Finance Committee, and was postponed to a subsequent date, which was later
cancelled. The proposal, however, needs to be passed before July 1st, so the proposal
was re-assigned by the president to this committee for action. Councillor Mansfield said
that the amount listed in the originally introduced proposal was an estimate of $500,000,
and they now have a specific amount of $442,935, and she therefore moved, seconded
by Councillor Lewis, to “Amend” Proposal No. 168, 2012 to reflect that proper amount in
Section 3. The motion carried by a vote of 8-0.
Councillor Brown asked if they are borrowing the money this year in anticipation of
receiving those funds next year. He asked if they do not do it this year, if they will be
forfeiting funds. Jeff Spalding, City Controller, Office of Finance and Management
(OFM), said that during the last Indiana General Assembly session, the Department of
Local Government Finance (DLGF) issued the budget orders for all the counties. One
of the things that came to light when they issued those orders was the reduction of the
Cumulative Capital Development Fund tax rates for several units of government. Many
of these taxing units disagreed with the decision of the DLGF to reduce these rates, and
they communicated this concern to their legislators, who then, after reviewing the issue,
came to the conclusion that the action taken by the DLGF was not consistent with the
legislative intent in the oversight of these tax rates. Because budget orders had already
been established and sent out, they did not want to delay property tax billings. So the
General Assembly came up with a different solution in the form of interest-free loans
from the State to any unit of government taking action through a resolution by June 30,
2012, seeking a loan in the amount of the taxes that were reduced from the Cumulative
Capital Development Fund. These lost revenues could then be levied in 2013 in order
to repay that loan. Councillor Brown asked if they have any specific spending plan for
the money or if it just goes into the fund balance. Mr. Spalding said that it will simply go
into the fund balance until projects are defined from that funding source. Councillor
Brown asked what the down-side is if this is not approved now. Mr. Spalding said that

Rules and Public Policy Committee
June 12, 2012
Page 2
they would lose the ability to recoup those lost revenues. With already limited options in
generating revenue, this is a prime opportunity the State is offering.
Chairman Mahern asked if the levy increase that is being corrected with this action was
budgeted. Mr. Spalding said that it was assumed in the revenue for 2012 when the
budget was passed last fall. Chairman Mahern asked if the tax cap losses would be the
same whether this levy was decreased this year or increased next year. Mr. Spalding
said that essentially the trade-off is the same. Chairman Mahern asked what
protections will be taken to make sure if they borrow an amount that they do not spend
money that they are later not able to collect because of tax caps. Mr. Spalding said that
because the fund balance is more than this loan, they will use fund balance to facilitate
projects this year, holding that loan amount in the fund and incruing some interest.
They will then pay back that loan next year, with those same funds. As a result of
taking that action, they will have the ability to levy the higher rate in 2013 to make up for
the loss in 2012. Chairman Mahern asked if the ability to levy that increased rate next
year is dependent upon taking this loan. Mr. Spalding responded in the affirmative.
Councillor Brown asked what the Cumulative Capital Development Fund is used for,
and what the plans are for the spending of this fund balance this year. Mr. Spalding
said that this fund is a separate revenue source defined in State law to be used for
infrastructure improvements and major equipment, mostly major capital purchases.
Chairman Mahern called for public testimony. There being no one present to testify,
Councillor Mansfield moved, seconded by Councillor Lewis, to send Proposal No. 168,
2012 to the full Council with a “Do Pass As Amended” recommendation. The motion
carried by a vote of 8-0.
PROPOSAL NO. 179, 2012 - amends Chapter 901 of the Code by making it a condition
of licensure that a hotel not be party to any agreement that prevents the hotel from
hiring employees of a hotel cleaning service
Councillor Robinson, co-sponsor of the proposal, said that this proposal will affect
roughly 1,000 workers and he acknowledged “Unite Here” for their work in this area.
Councillor Robinson said that after working for temporary cleaning agencies, many of
these workers are then barred or black-listed from holding a full-time job in a hotel.
Chairman Mahern called for public testimony.
Fernando Gomez, Hospitality Services and Solutions (HSS), said that he worked for
HSS at the Marriott Hotel and found that many housekeeping personnel were being
pressured to finish 40 to 45 rooms in eight hours. If they did not complete this amount
of rooms in the allotted time, they would have to clock out and still go finish the rooms.
He said that he is paid $7.25 an hour, and often works over with no extra pay, and this
is not enough to support himself and go back to school. He said that many of his coworkers have three and four kids, and it is impossible for them to provide for their

Rules and Public Policy Committee
June 12, 2012
Page 3
families with this kind of pay. After working at the Marriott, he started working in
banquet service at the Sheraton Hotel, and asked about applying to work directly for the
hotel. He said that he was told he could not apply for a permanent position with the
hotel because of the contract between Sheraton Hotel and HSS. He said that some of
his co-workers were even fired for applying for a permanent job. He said that one friend
quit working at HSS after a job with the Canterbury, and was told by Human Resources
at the Marriott Hotel that they could not hire her because she belonged to HSS. He said
that he supports this legislation.
Jeff Macey, local attorney, thanked Pastor Steven Clay with the National Action Network
for yielding his time. He said that he represents “Unite Here” and many individual hotel
workers. He said that these anti-competitive agreements being entered into between
hotels and staffing agencies are unfair to workers. He said that this ordinance does not
prevent a hotel from subcontracting work to a staffing agency, prevent a subcontractor
from entering into non-compete agreements with their employees or impose any
owner’s reporting requirements on hotel licensees. He stated that what the ordinance
does is prevent anti-competitive agreements that depress wage and benefits for
thousands of hospitality workers, ensure that Indianapolis’ labor market operates
efficiently, and benefits the city as a whole by encouraging growth and demand for other
city businesses.
Keisha Johnson, Westin Hotel employee, said that the Westin has over 500 rooms, with
only one other permanent Westin worker, and 30 HSS workers servicing those rooms.
As permanent housekeepers quit, they were replaced with HSS workers. She said that
some of the HSS workers have been there for over 10 years; and their hard work, skill
set and dedication to their job should be enough to ensure proper full-time employment
with fair wages and necessary benefits.
Jim Dora, president and chief executive officer of General Hotels Corporation, said that
their company has four hotels throughout the city, and he is also here representing the
Greater Indianapolis Hotel and Lodging Association. He said that the innkeeper’s tax in
Indianapolis is the second highest in the country, and therefore, hotels in Marion County
greatly support downtown infrastructure and initiatives. As with any business, rates for
hotels go up and down with patronage cycles, and they have to make adjustments for
that. Staffing agencies allow them to better address those schedules to coincide with
seasonality, and allow staffing agency personnel to have full work weeks when a
particular hotel may not have enough hours for them. He said that staffing agencies are
a win-win solution and offer more flexibility for hotels. Their number one concern is
taking care of their paying customer, who pays taxes to the city and pays their
employees’ wages. He said that they also want to take care of their personnel, but they
feel this ordinance is unfair to hotel businesses.
Chairman Mahern asked what particularly in this ordinance is not to the hotel industry’s
liking. He said that the ordinance does not prevent hotels from contracting temporary
services or entering into agreements for staffing. He said that the only thing it does is

Rules and Public Policy Committee
June 12, 2012
Page 4
say that this agreement cannot undermine free market economics within the county to
allow workers the opportunity to supplement their income at another hotel or make a
better living at another hotel. He asked what kind of circumstance would make sense to
interfere with a free market. Mr. Dora said that the staffing agencies have an
investment in the recruitment, background checks and training of their associates, so
they would want to protect their investment in those workers, as a part of a free market
enterprise. He said that he feels the hotels are being stuck in the middle of the
Council’s issue with one contracting company, by taking away their flexibility and adding
requirements, paperwork and inspections. He said that this ordinance creates a larger
bureaucracy without necessarily addressing the specific issue, because the hotels are
the licensed business involved. He suggested the city should maybe take a look at the
contracts they have entered into, as well, in cleaning all of their properties and buildings.
Chairman Mahern asked if Mr. Dora is in favor of some type of indentured servitude
because a company has spent money training a worker. Mr. Dora said that the
contracting company has a reasonable expectation of a return on their investment. He
cannot comment on how they choose to take care of their people, because they are not
his employees; but this resolution specifically targets hotels, mostly in the downtown
area. A hotel owner’s goal is to take care of their customers, get rooms cleaned in a
reasonable time, and take care of their associates so that they are happy and in turn
take care of the customers. The challenge is in finding enough individuals who want to
come to work every day and work in their business and in giving them enough hours to
sustain them. He said that he does not want anyone to be an indentured servant, but
he does not believe in reality this is the case in Indianapolis. He said he wants a happy
person to come to work and take care of his customers who are paying all the bills.
Councillor Mansfield said it seems Mr. Dora is arguing on behalf of the contracting
company, instead of hotels. She said she does not see how this impacts Mr. Dora’s
business. A contract company could have someone working only five hours and being
paid an unlivable wage, yet not being allowed to supplement that income. She said that
this proposal is being offered because of some bad practices by some contracting
companies, not necessarily on the part of hotels. She said that according to some of
the testimony she has heard, some hotels are prohibiting individuals from gaining
additional employment because they are under contract with a staffing agency at
another hotel. Mr. Dora asked if they are basing this ordinance on hearsay and have
not actually done any study or research to make sure these claims are correct.
Councillor Mansfield said that she does not understand why Mr. Dora is arguing on
behalf of the contracting companies, when this ordinance does not have the same effect
on him, as a licensed hotel owner. Mr. Dora said he is arguing on behalf of the hotel
industry, which is being singled out in this ordinance as the licensed business being
affected. He suggested they look at other businesses as well. Councillor Mansfield
said that this is the industry that has been highlighted most to them, and if they become
aware of this type of practice happening in other industries, she believes they will be
back again addressing it with them, as well.

Councillor Lutz said that a situation was relayed to him where an employee was
employed by a temporary service and placed at one hotel. They then went to another
hotel, without having been placed there by the temporary agency, to apply for a job.
Because of their contract with the staffing agency, the employee was ineligible for hiring
at that second hotel. He asked if this is accurate. Mr. Dora said that this is not his
understanding of how the contract works.
Chairman Mahern said that Mr. Dora has provided some knowledge of at least one
contract, and he asked if he could provide them with a copy of that contract to check the
voracity of statements made that may or may not comport with the testimony presented
this evening. Mr. Dora said that he would have to check with counsel on making that
contract available.
Councillor Gray asked if Mr. Dora knows what the contract says. Mr. Dora said that he
does not have any of the contracts with him and has reviewed some of them in the past,
but not recently. Councillor Gray said that he does not understand why Mr. Dora would
come before the body this evening without reviewing that information or having it with
him.
Councillor Lewis said that Mr. Dora claimed their first priority was to take care of their
customers, and then their associates. She said that she feels this body’s responsibility
is to take care of workers, and she asked Mr. Dora what his suggestions are to do that.
Mr. Dora said that there are laws in place that allow for unionization of any business
where workers are not happy. He said that those options are well-known. He said that
in his business, it is his responsibility to take care of his associates in the best way he
possibly can. If he does not do that job well, his associates have the option of
unionizing. He said that the opportunity is already there, and more government is not
necessary.
Chairman Mahern asked if Mr. Dora is saying that in the absence of a union, workers
should expect unfair treatment. Mr. Dora said that he is not saying that at all, but that if
a company is treating its employees that unfairly, unionizing is a tried and true
opportunity for those employees to make changes. Chairman Mahern said that the
testimony that has yet to be refuted with the producing of any actual contract has shown
that what is occurring is that employees believe they are entering into temporary
employment opportunities. Yet these temporary employment opportunities seem to be
turning into some type of indentured servitude for an undetermined length of time. He
said that he supports the unionization of workplaces, but he does not believe they have
to wait until this might or could happen to ensure that workers are treated fairly. This
proposal and the testimony brought forward supports that this is an area that needs to
be addressed. He said that Mr. Dora says the hotel industry is being singled out, and
this is true; but that did not happen just today. That happened decades ago when
leaders in this City decided to promote the hospitality industry. They took community
resources, focus and attention to construct and promote the hospitality industry to
create good paying jobs and help the economy flourish. But after all that focus, they

Rules and Public Policy Committee
June 12, 2012
Page 6
instead have workers prohibited from practicing the free market economics that his
more conservative friends advocate frequently. He said that they did not wade into this
area for the first time today. They have promoted this industry, yet this industry has not
responded, and instead has discriminated against workers. Chairman Mahern said that
he appreciates Mr. Dora coming to testify and would appreciate any concrete
information he can provide to the committee.
Councillor Lewis asked if Mr. Dora has had an opportunity to sit down with the workers
and hear their concerns. Mr. Dora said that he is very available to his associates, but
none of them have brought up this issue, even though he spends his lunch hour every
day in the breakroom regularly conversing with many of his associates.
Councillor Robinson asked if Mr. Dora does not specifically know what the contract says
if he at least is aware of the general practice and if he is prepared to move forward and
work with “Unite Here” regarding the practices they have testified about. Mr. Dora said
that if “Unite Here” would like to contact him, they are welcome to do so, but his concern
is for his associates in his specific hotels, and they are not here this evening with any
complaints.
Councillor Adamson said that Mr. Dora indicated that he is not sure these practices are
a reality in this City. He asked if, hypothetically, these things were occurring, if Mr. Dora
would be supportive of this ordinance. Mr. Dora said that he would not be supportive,
because hotels are judged by their customers, their names and their brands, and if they
have unhappy associates, they have unhappy customers. They have performance and
service scores they have to achieve, and are already accountable to the federal
government, their brands, their customers and their associates. Councillor Adamson
said that typically, if a worker was not happy, they would leave their job and go work
somewhere else. He said that his concern is that this practice prevents that for some
workers. Mr. Dora said that there are many opportunities for associates throughout the
County that may or may not work with contracting companies. Concentrating on the
downtown hotels does not really present the big picture. He said that the issue should
be studied further.
Councillor Mansfield said that she believes Mr. Dora came here in good faith and is
giving honest answers according to his experience; and she would hope everyone here
could be respectful of those who come before this body, even if they have differing
opinions. She said that it is important to encourage dialogue and listen to opposing
views.
Councillor Barth said that he has a hard time seeing any down-side for the industry. He
asked if Mr. Dora’s objection is the requirement being imposed on contracting or the
view of an intrusion on their practice of contracting. Mr. Dora said that it is certainly
intrusion, which takes them away from their core mission of serving their customers and
associates. He said that it brings up a lot of questions regarding where the paperwork
is going to go, who is going to review it, and how it will be enforced, etc. He said that

Rules and Public Policy Committee
June 12, 2012
Page 7
his hotels are already inspected by their brand company two or three times a year, the
State and City Fire Marshals, and the Health Department. This is just one more layer of
administration that takes time and effort away from their core mission. He said that he
also questions why the hotel industry is the only one being looked at. Councillor Barth
said that he can understand the concerns that come with a highly regulated industry, as
that is his day-to-day responsibility; but he is not fully understanding the objection, as it
seems a very minimal burden to fill out an additional piece of paperwork. Mr. Dora said
that there is also mention of inspections, and as he understands it, law enforcement
could demand an inspection of paperwork at any time.
Chairman Mahern asked if Mr. Dora is aware that the hotel industry is subsidized in
Indianapolis, in room rates and booking of hotels, by entities that receive tax dollars
which are not hotels, such as the Indiana Convention and Visitors Association (ICVA).
He said that they do this because they believe a vibrant hospitality industry can be
beneficial to the community as a whole. Mr. Dora said that not all hotels in Indianapolis
are subsidized. Chairman Mahern said that saying that events brought to the City and
paid for and maintained through tax dollars, such as the SuperBowl, do not help the
entire community and only benefit downtown is disingenuous. Money was invested in
an ArtsGarden that was then joined to area hotels. With money sometimes comes
additional requirements, which is all part of a free market. Mr. Dora said that Crowne
Plaza/Union Station paid for their own connector to the convention center, and therefore
all hotels, even downtown hotels, are not subsidized. Those hotels outside of
downtown are not funded by the Convention Center and have to secure rooms with the
ICVA at a specific rate for certain events to occur. He said that while the room rate
provided to the ICVA for the SuperBowl was a good rate, the second weekend that had
to be held was down because it was empty downtown; and factoring that in, it was a
good weekend, but not as strong as some would say. He said that there are some
hotels that have been subsidized to draw certain businesses into town, but the hotels
also pay into the ICVA for some of these events. But the downtown hotels are now able
to absorb most of the demand for rooms, and this is where people want to be, so the
outlying hotels are less busy, adding to their down business cycle. Chairman Mahern
asked if Mr. Dora’s hotels benefit when there is a big conference or event like the
SuperBowl. Mr. Dora said that they do, but they have also paid a lot of taxes during
those events and employed a lot of associates. Chairman Mahern said that a lot of the
hotel tax goes back into the hotel industry and is the source of many of the subsidies he
mentioned.
Andy Downing, LGC & Associates, a staffing company in Indianapolis, said that he was
planning to say one thing when he entered the room this evening, but since that time
has sensed the bias in this room, and therefore will alter his testimony. It does seem
that some of these testimonies are pointed at specific situations, and even one specific
company. This ordinance does not deal with that company, but instead groups all
staffing agencies into one category. He said that LGC employs almost 2,000 people
annually in the Indianapolis area, and does not have any bad marks and is a fair
employer. He said that his job is to recruit, screen, train and test individuals for the

Rules and Public Policy Committee
June 12, 2012
Page 8
hospitality and food service industries. They then provide this talent pool to their clients,
which in this case, is primarily the downtown hotel market. The downtown market
benefits by getting a trained hospitality professional. He said that they also provide
opportunities for their employees for full-time jobs, and the black-listing that has been
referenced is not prevalent in any of the staffing companies he is familiar with. He said
that contracts exist between staffing companies and clients/hotels, but not with
employees. He said that the contracts exist to help recoup investments made in
recruiting, screening, training and testing workers. He said that after 10 weeks of work,
the client can hire an individual sent to them by the agency with no fees associated. He
said that he writes the contracts for his company, and the hotel can pay a fee and hire
any of their employees even without the 10 weeks of work.
Chairman Mahern asked for Mr. Downing’s understanding regarding hospitality staffing
in Indianapolis. Mr. Downing said that they work in other markets, but their company is
headquartered here. He said that United and HSS are two of the other large staffing
companies in Indianapolis. HSS is a large national company. Chairman Mahern asked
if Mr. Downing thinks this ordinance will inhibit their business. Mr. Downing said that it
would hinder them if they were not able to recoup their original investment. If they
recruit, screen, train and test 40 individuals to work in a hotel, and the hotel after only
four hours of work wants to hire these individuals; he would not be able to stay in
business. Chairman Mahern asked if the hotel would not then be cutting its own throat
if they are relying on LGC to feed them workers. He said that he has nothing against
LGC, but he thinks it would be wonderful if the hotels would hire workers directly. He
said that he does not follow the logic that LGC provides a quality product to a hotel that
would then turn around and run them out of business. Mr. Downing said that the
ordinance is attempting to come in and negotiate the terms for them, and they would
quickly see that they would be out of business. He does not understand why, when
they are not doing anything wrong, they are being regulated and micro-managed like
this. Chairman Mahern asked if they have, whether in a contract, or through an
unwritten understanding in a cartel fashion, an understanding that the hotel cannot hire
one of their workers because they belong to them. Mr. Downing said absolutely not.
Chairman Mahern said that he would not then object to the spirit of this ordinance, but
rather has issue with the flawed implementation. Mr. Downing said that he strongly
agrees that the implementation is flawed.
Councillor Mansfield asked if LGC’s employees are prohibited from having a second
job. Mr. Downing said that they are not. Councillor Mansfield asked if they could have
a second job at another hotel while working for LGC at one hotel. Mr. Downing said
they absolutely could, and most do.
Guadalupe Sanchez, a former HSS worker for seven years and now full-time employee
at Marriott, said that her experience was good with HSS, and they helped her work her
way up and she had incentives to better her work environment.

Rules and Public Policy Committee
June 12, 2012
Page 9
Maria Ortega, a former HSS worker and now employed by White Lodging, said that it is
much better working for the hotel directly instead of working for a temporary agency,
because they have benefits and the opportunity to work their way up into better
positions.
Tamara Johnson, LGC employee, said that she has worked for LGC for six years, and
many of her fellow associates have been hired on full-time at a hotel, and she is aware
there is a process. She enjoys her flexibility and the opportunity to say “no” if she does
not wish to work. She said that she does not feel restricted and prefers to be a
temporary associate. She added that some of her associates that were hired full-time
can continue to work for LGC when their work hours are cut back.
Jacqueline Walker, LGC employee, said that she has a son who is mentally challenged,
and she prefers the temporary staffing opportunity. She added that LGC has been
extremely supportive of her and she has many co-workers that have been hired on at
hotels permanently. Even those who are hired are still available to work for LGC or at
other hotels.
Albert Small, LGC employee, said that he has had no problems with LGC and they have
not tried to restrict him in any way, but instead have helped him to remain gainfully
employed.
Eva Sanchez, HSS employee, said that she is a single mother, and her experience with
HSS was not good. There were hours missing from her paychecks, and she applied for
full-time positions, and was told they could not hire her because she worked for HSS.
The managers never recognized her work ability but only saw the brand of HSS, which
made her feel like someone’s slave. She said that working for HSS, she was a witness
to many abuses and injustices against her co-workers. She asked the Council to
support Proposal No. 179, 2012.
Rosario Ramirez, HSS employee, stated that she reported injuries while she was
working at the Marriott, and they did nothing about it. She said that employees were not
treated well, and she was constantly missing hours from her check. She asked the
committee to support the proposal.
Jimmy Smith, LGC employee, said that he moved here last February and applied for
employment at many places, but could not find a job. He said that he heard about LGC
through a friend, and they hired him and put him to work immediately. Even though he
works full-time now for the Convention Center, he still works part-time for LGC. He said
without their help, he would probably be homeless.
Colleen Quilty, junior at Butler University, said that half of college graduates are
entering the hospitality industry to support themselves. She said that this issue does
not only affect immigrants and non-graduates.

Rules and Public Policy Committee

James Meyers, “Unite Here,” said that he knows HSS workers who, after having been
hurt on the job, were told to go back to work and not say anything. He said that all
Indianapolis workers deserve respect.
Chairman Mahern called for a recess at 7:11 p.m. Chairman Mahern reconvened the
Rules and Public Policy Committee at 7:30 p.m.
Councillor Lewis moved, seconded by Councillor Lutz, to “Postpone” Proposal No. 179,
2012 until the next meeting.
Councillor Mansfield said that many of the members are still supportive of this proposal,
but an issue was raised with regard to contracting with LGC & Associates, and they may
need to add some exception language. They do not want to do it in a hurry and want to
put thought into it.
Councillor Lewis said that the next Rules and Public Policy Committee is scheduled for
July 3, 2012, which is the day before a holiday. She asked if that meeting could be
moved to July 10, 2012. Consent was given to reschedule the meeting.
Proposal No. 179, 2012 was postponed until July 10, 2012 by a vote of 7-1, with
Councillor Gray casting the negative vote.
PROPOSAL NO. 209, 2012 - establishes the Marion County Property Tax Amnesty
Program pursuant to I.C. 6-1.1-37-10.1
Chairman Mahern said that this proposal is a result of changes in State law to address a
situation in parts of the State, particularly up north in Lake County, where there was a
backlog of tax bills that were not sent, resulting in taxpayers falling behind in their taxes.
He said that the option was presented to all counties to establish an amnesty program.
Claudia Fuentes, Marion County Treasurer, and Billie Breaux, Marion County Auditor,
made a brief presentation regarding the tax sale (attached as Exhibit A). Ms. Breaux
stated that she supports the concept of a tax amnesty program in general if it is geared
to help taxpayers with the greatest need; provided that it actually increases property tax
collections and does not place an unreasonable administrative burden on the County.
She said that she does, however, have some concerns about the tax amnesty program
proposed at this time. She said that implementing such a program in the near future
would increase the workload for her staff, and her budget has been cut each year that
she has been in office, and her office is currently seven staff members short. She
added that it is important also to weigh whether a property tax amnesty program is fair
to taxpayers who have paid their taxes on time, as they may question why benefits are
being offered to those who did not meet their obligations, yet no corresponding benefit
is being given to those who pay on time. She said that Marion County currently has a
70-75% collection rate on delinquent taxes, including penalties assessed. It is critical
before starting this program to determine whether they will actually collect more taxes

Rules and Public Policy Committee
June 12, 2012
Page 11
without the penalties than they are currently collecting with penalties in place. She said
that the Treasurer’s Office has already implemented several payment plans for
taxpayers in need, including monthly payments and automated debit options. These
programs already provide taxpayers with significant relief, and therefore, an amnesty
program may not be necessary at this time.
Chairman Mahern asked if Marion County has experienced anything like the situation in
Lake County where bills were sent out late, and therefore, taxpayers are delinquent
through no fault of their own. He asked if delinquencies are any greater currently than
they have historically been. Ms. Fuentes said that Lake County found themselves in a
situation with taxpayers having to make five and six tax payments a year, when the
normal cycle for payments is May and November. She said that Marion County does
not find themselves in the same kind of predicament, and the parcels that would be
eligible for a program like this do not have the same characteristics as in Lake County’s
situation. She said that Marion County has had on-time billing for the last two years.
Councillor Mansfield said that a program like this might make sense during an event like
the reassessment year, which created massive confusion for almost everyone. She
said that it does not make sense for Marion County at this time, based on testimony.
She therefore moved, seconded by Councillor Lutz, to “Strike” Proposal No. 209, 2012.
The motion carried by a vote of 8-0.
Chairman Mahern said that with the next corresponding proposal that will address some
issues that might be faced by taxpayers, he supported the motion to “Strike.”
PROPOSAL NO. 210, 2012 - encourages the Treasurer and Auditor to implement an
optional pre-tax sale payment plan
Ms. Fuentes said that taxpayers that would find themselves eligible for a pre-tax sale
payment plan would have to agree to have all of their taxes, delinquent and current,
paid in full by July 1, 2013. If they were to come to an agreement with her office, the
taxpayer would be removed from the upcoming 2012 tax sale in October. The program
would be a monthly payment plan, and the taxpayer would make payments up until July,
2013 in order to bring themselves current and remove themselves from a delinquent
situation.
Councillor Lutz asked if this would apply to all types of parcels, including residential,
commercial and rental, or if it would only apply to homestead properties. Ms. Fuentes
said that it would apply to all real estate parcels, but does not include mobile homes or
personal property. Councillor Lutz asked if both the Treasurer and Auditor are willing to
implement this plan. Ms. Breaux said that the Auditor’s Office is in full support of this
ordinance, and she is extremely aware of how difficult it is for many constituents to
make it from one day to the next. Ms. Fuentes said that she is also in favor of the
program.

Rules and Public Policy Committee
June 12, 2012
Page 12
Councillor Lutz said that since they are both in support of this, he is not sure why the
Council needs to take any action to encourage them to support it. Chairman Mahern
said that he believes it is absolutely relevant for this fiscal body to weigh in on a matter
that affects the finances of the City and County and add their support to such a
program.
Councillor Lewis stated that she believes the Council was to respond to House Bill
1090, which sparked this proposal.
Councillor Barth asked when they anticipate this will go into effect. Ms. Fuentes said
that certification will happen July 1, 2012, so it will be implemented immediately
following July 1st.
Councillor Lewis moved, seconded by Councillor Barth, to send Proposal No. 210, 2012
to the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried by a vote of 80.
PROPOSAL NO. 211, 2012 - amends the Code to allow for regulation and oversight of
flea market sales in the city and county
Councillor Robinson, co-sponsor of the proposal, said that in working with community
police and neighborhood activists, it has come to their attention that many of the items
taken during burglaries across the County are being fenced at flea markets. Flea
markets do not have the same regulations and oversight that a pawn shop would have.
This proposal would bring more regulation and oversight to the flea markets, similar to
those that govern pawn shops. He said that they are still working with the Department
of Code Enforcement (DCE) and the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department
(IMPD) to further fine-tune the language, and he would suggest a postponement of the
proposal until an agreement is reached regarding the appropriate language.
Councillor Lutz moved, seconded by Councillor Barth, to “Postpone” Proposal No. 211,
2012 until July 10, 2012. The motion carried by a vote of 8-0.
{Clerk’s Note: Councillor Brown left at 7:58 p.m.}
PROPOSAL NO. 212, 2012 - supports and encourages the right of janitors to a livable
wage, health insurance, job security, safe working conditions, and a union contract
Councillor Lewis said that there is a growing gap in this city between those who have
and those who do not, and this proposal is an attempt to encourage the City to support
and encourage living wages for janitors.
Councillor Lewis moved, seconded by Councillor Mansfield, to send Proposal No. 212,
2012 to the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation.

Rules and Public Policy Committee
June 12, 2012
Page 13
Councillor Gray asked what binding authority this proposal has. Councillor Lewis said
that this is an attempt to urge local managers and business owners to look at livable
wages for janitors. She said that they have done these types of proposals in the past,
and it is not binding, but is simply an encouragement and an attempt to bring attention
to the issue. She said that these are usually handled on the floor at the full Council, but
she felt it would be better to have discussion in committee.
Councillor McQuillen said that he does not understand why this is not just a Council
Resolution, as proposals that go through committee are usually then signed by the
Mayor. Fred Biesecker, General Counsel, said that Council Resolutions typically relate
to the internal procedures of the Council and confirmations of appointments, which does
not really fit with this proposal. In theory, this could have been a Special Resolution, but
it seemed to him to fit better in the General Resolution category. He said that even if
they had chosen to make it a Special Resolution, he still probably would have
recommended it be sent to committee, because it would only take eight votes to do so,
and he believes that would have happened anyway.
Chairman Mahern asked if there is any downside to making it a General Resolution and
hearing it in committee. Mr. Biesecker said that he cannot think of any.
Councillor Gray asked if this is just another “feel good” proposal that does not really
have any binding authority. Chairman Mahern said that the Council has a “bully pulpit”
or platform to address issues that affect families in the community. It is clear these
types of jobs help support the tax base, yet these employees are some of the lowest
paid workers in the City. He said that he would like to be added as a co-sponsor of the
proposal. Councillor Lewis said that it is not just about feeling good, but is a serious
issue that warrants discussion in committee and public testimony.
Chairman Mahern called for public testimony.
Amy Shackelford, Central Indiana Jobs with Justice, said the disparities that exist in
Indianapolis between classes is unacceptable. She said there is no reason someone
with a full-time job should be living in poverty. She said this resolution is a first step to
making the City a more fair and just place for all to live.
Chrystal Ratcliffe, president of the Greater Indianapolis Branch of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), said that she is a retired
union worker who was also a janitor. Janitors who do not make good wages cannot
provide for their families. It is time to raise the standards for City workers and rebuild
the middle class. The NAACP supports janitors and their struggle to obtain good jobs.
Willa Johnson, member of the local janitorial bargaining committee, said that she
believes in fighting for better conditions and uniting toward a common cause. She said
that good jobs increase the standards of the entire City, and a fair contract is a step in
the right direction to get this economy back on track.

Rules and Public Policy Committee

The motion to send Proposal No. 212, 2012 to the full Council with a “Do Pass”
recommendation carried by a vote of 5-2, with Councillors Lutz and McQuillen casting
the negative votes.
Councillors McQuillen and Lutz asked for consent to explain their votes. Consent was
given. Councillor McQuillen said that while he supports good jobs for janitors, he does
not believe this is properly written, and that is why he opposed the measure. Councillor
Lutz said that he is not against support of janitors and thinks they should have the right
to collectively bargain, but he does not think the Council, as a governmental body,
should take a side in it one way or the other, and that is the reason for his vote.
PROPOSAL NO. 213, 2012 - establishes Domestic Partnership and provides equitable
benefits for Consolidated City and County employees who are in a domestic partnership
Councillor Mansfield said that this bi-partisan proposal would extend benefits that
currently only married couples receive to other domestic partners. She said that this is
the right thing to do and is not really ground-breaking. She said that 60% of Fortune
500 companies extend benefits to domestic partners and 83% of Fortune 100
companies do likewise. Major universities, such as Butler University, Purdue University
and Indiana University, also offer these benefits, along with many other entities.
Municipalities throughout the country offer such benefits, and this is another way to
show those employees in the public sector, who often do not have the same salary
structure or wages as the private sector, that they are valued. Councillor Mansfield said
that, along with looking at information given to her by the City Controller, they did a
fiscal analysis which included looking at Columbus, Ohio, whose demographics and
numbers are similar to those of Indianapolis. She said that Columbus passed their
ordinance in 2010, and they do not have a spousal exclusion policy. She said that the
fiscal analysis shows an impact of approximately one-third of one percent of the total
benefits budget, which is very small. She said that Hope Tribble, Council Chief
Financial Officer (CFO), also did a financial study, factoring in some additional items,
and it still ended up being less than half of one percent impact. She said that these
benefits to a non-married domestic partner are taxable, both federally and at a State
level. Therefore, they do not see people taking advantage of this unless it is their only
option.
Councillor Mansfield provided an amendment (Exhibit B), and said that these
amendments are based on some feedback and comments from constituents. One
change is in Sec. 291-504 changing the word “when” to “if,” with regards to the
termination of a domestic partnership, which she totally agrees with. Most of the other
changes are stylistic changes suggested by the Mayor’s Office and Corporation
Counsel, which are not really substantive. One item to note is the effective date change
to January 1, 2013, this would give Human Resources time to get controls in place, and
allow employees to go through open enrollment, which would make it much easier. She
said that it is the intent going forward that when someone submits a declaration of a

Rules and Public Policy Committee
June 12, 2012
Page 15
domestic partnership, it would be treated as a qualifying event, much like if someone
got married. She added that some concerns have been raised with regard to fraud, and
that has not been the experience throughout the country in places where this has been
instituted. The same types of controls for married individuals would be put into place.
If there had been widespread abuse, all of these companies would not be offering this
option. Human Resources would continue to perform audits to monitor these benefits,
as they do now.
Councillor Mansfield moved, seconded by Councillor Lutz, to “Amend” Proposal No.
213, 2012 as per Exhibit B.
Chairman Mahern said that he is supportive of this in concept. He referred to Sec. 291503, benefits, and said that the word “identical” promises a lot. He asked, taking into
account limitations that may be in State or Federal law, if the City can deliver on that
promise. Councillor Mansfield said that she looked at State and Federal laws when
drafting the ordinance and drafted the language so that they can provide these benefits
as permitted by law. She said that if there are some limitations in the State law, as she
recalls there might be some in the pension language, they will provide benefits to the
extent that they can. Chairman Mahern said that there is no language that says “to the
extent possible under the law.” Instead, as it reads, they are essentially promising
identical benefits, which may not be possible. Councillor Mansfield said that the City
and County’s benefit package is done through policy, and they want to continue to have
that flexibility there for best practices going forward. Because of that, they need to be
careful not to have language that is too restrictive. Chairman Mahern said that the
ordinance says it would be identical, but Councillor Mansfield is seeming to say the
administration has the discretion to determine that. Councillor Mansfield said that this is
not what she is meaning to say. She said that this authorizes benefits permitted by law.
If there is a legal limitation, it should be clear that the City cannot supercede that legal
limitation. But the intent is for these domestic partners to have the same types of
benefits that are offered to married couples.
The motion to “Amend” Proposal No. 213, 2012 as per Exhibit B carried by a vote of 70.
Councillor Lutz said that he supports this wholeheartedly, and he is a co-sponsor. He
said that he believes this is the right thing to do for employees. His only concerns were
with regard to cost and possible fraud. Two hundred thousand dollars, even though it
seems a small amount in the grand scheme of things, is still $200,000. He said that
people have to make choices about the best way to spend their money every day, and
in order to be a great City, he believes they should hold themselves to a standard to
welcome diversity and recognize non-traditional households. Employees should not
have to come to work worrying about medical needs or family leave time in the event of
the death of a loved one or other situation. He added that Eli Lilly, one of the City’s
biggest companies, has adopted this policy and he would like to hear from their
representative as to how it has affected their workplace.

Rules and Public Policy Committee
June 12, 2012
Page 16
Chairman Mahern called for public testimony.
Mike O’Connor, Eli Lilly, stated that they have had domestic partner benefits for a little
over a decade. He said in relation to business, the growth of those covered was slightly
less than one percent. Even with rising health costs, the actual cost increase to the
company was just slightly higher than one percent. He said that they did not do it
because it was cost-effective, but because it was the right thing to do. He said that
throughout the competitive atmosphere in which they operate, in pursuing the best and
brightest minds world-wide, they are often asked these types of questions in considering
employment. He said that they would encourage the City to do the same, because that
would say a lot about the community they have chosen to house their headquarters. He
said that it simply says they respect peoples’ decisions about who they want in their
lives as much as they respect those who choose to pursue the marriage option. He
said that it has been a positive experience for Eli Lilly and they applaud the Council for
taking this step.
Chairman Mahern asked if Eli Lilly endeavors to offer identical benefits and if they have
found any difficulties in compliance with State laws. Mr. O’Connor said that there are
some concerns about issues being debated at the State level that may impact their
ability to offer identical benefits, but at this time, they do not have those types of issues
currently. He added that roughly 35% of those availing themselves of domestic partner
benefits at Lilly are heterosexual couples.
Councillor Barth said that the fact that Eli Lilly does this to attract and retain the best
employees says a lot. The City reflecting that same philosophy would further enhance
that effort, and he therefore has even more reasons to support the proposal.
Rick Sutton, president of Indiana Equality, said they value the City’s workers, and he is
proud of the Council for taking this action. He said this sends a strong message to
workers about their value. He said that this does not only affect gay couples, but others
who may choose not to marry for some reason or other.
Ryan McCann, Indiana Family Institute, stated that their mission is to strengthen
families across the country. He said that there has been a lot in the news about $15
million budget shortfalls and cuts in public safety, yet the Council is bringing forth a
divisive ordinance that will offend many taxpayers. He said that Eli Lilly is a private
entity and is not funded by taxes, and there are many taxpayers who would not want
their taxes going to pay for such a program. He said that he still has concerns about the
potential for fraud and abuse. He said that the definition of a domestic partnership
requires an “intimate and committed relationship.” He said that as a young guy out of
college, he had two male roommates, and this kind of living arrangement would lend
itself easily to abuse and fraud of this benefit option. He asked how they can prove that
a relationship is intimate and committed. He said that beyond the taxpayer issue, there

Rules and Public Policy Committee
June 12, 2012
Page 17
are religious liberty issues, such as the recent incident with “Just Cookies.” He said that
they are being promised one thing but promoting something else.
Randy Sipe, citizen, said he is concerned about the cost of this, and the government
does not have a good track record in estimating costs. Public Safety is in terrible
trouble financially and the Parks Department is having to find outside entities to bring
attractions to the parks to generate revenue. Eli Lilly is a wonderful community partner,
but that is a private company and their benefits are funded by profits earned by that
company. He said that saying this is the right thing to do can be challenged based on
an individual’s perception of what is right and what is wrong. He asked if it is right
because it is popular or because others are doing it. He said that some have a higher
moral authority to test what is right. He finished by quoting philosopher Plato, who said,
“What the State allows, it promotes.”
Desmon Dobbins, citizen, said that she lived for seven years as a lesbian, and in 1999,
she surrendered her life to the Lord and was delivered and has not looked back. She
said that before they start changing all the rules, she is a testament to the fact that it is a
choice. She said that she feels this is geared toward promoting same-sex marriage,
and she does not wish to be disrespectful, but she does not welcome that.
Rick Snyder, first vice president of the Indianapolis Fraternal Order of Police (FOP),
said that the FOP asks for the Council’s support of this proposal, and believes it is a
step to move the City forward and will benefit their members. He said that they also
concern themselves with the cost of any new initiative, but they also highly consider the
equitable treatment of employees and stand for closing gaps in benefits and
compensation. He said that he appreciates the financial analysis of this proposal, and
feels that the benefits far outweigh the cost. He said that their members simply ask for
the same opportunity as all families to support and provide for their loved ones. He said
that it will also assist the public safety agencies in their recruitment efforts in competing
for qualified candidates. He asked them to avoid confusing equitable treatment with
personal moral judgments. This proposal outlines safeguards and consequences to
prevent fraud and abuse, which already exists for married partners. He said that it is
not only the right thing to do, but is being proposed at the right time and in the right way.
He asked committee members to support the proposal.
Annette Gross, state coordinator for Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and
Gays (PFFLAG), said that many of their members’ children have left Indianapolis
because they do not feel welcome here, even though they are bright and talented
people with educations from prestigious colleges. She said that she believes they have
so much to offer the City and State, and if these benefits were afforded to them, they
would not be leaving the City. She said that if these employees were legally married,
cost would not be a factor, and the money would be there for them.
Bill Buffie, internist and chief executive officer (CEO) of a provider physician group, said
that he has been researching the public health implications of this whole issue for

Rules and Public Policy Committee
June 12, 2012
Page 18
several years. The State of Indiana was the first state medical association in the
country to pass a resolution recognizing the healthcare disparities that exist for the
lesbian, gay, bi-sexual, transgendered (LGBT) community, on the basis of being denied
civil union. Articles that he has written as a result of his research have been peer
reviewed and based on fact to take the emotion out of this issue. He said that many
national health organizations recognize the disparities for the LGBT community, due to
access and the minority stress phenomenon. He said that societal prejudice is
internalized, resulting in self-doubt and fear for many of these individuals, which in turn,
can result in risky health behaviors, causing a cycle of medical problems. He said that
the cost is quite minimal when they consider that there are 16,328 same sex couples in
the State of Indiana, according to the latest census. Approximately one-fifth of them are
raising children. He relayed some statistics regarding HIV treatment and cases in
Indiana, and said that where there are supportive measures, there is a positive impact
on medical expenses. He said that cost is really not an issue when they consider the
medical costs that might be prevented due to support measures like this proposal. He
said that the real issue is to promote a place of inclusion.
Councillor Barth said that the comments about health disparities have not been
mentioned enough, and he thanked Mr. Buffie for his comments.
Councillor Mansfield said that many were prepared to act on this proposal and pass it
out of committee this evening, but she and Councillor Lutz have been in communication
with the Mayor’s Office, and they have asked for some additional time to review it,
seeing that the Mayor was out of town part of last week. In deference, she moved,
seconded by Councillor Lutz, to “Postpone” Proposal No. 213, 2012 until July 10, 2012.
The motion carried by a vote of 7-0.
{Clerk’s Note: Councillor Gray left at 8:54 p.m.}
PROPOSAL NO. 221, 2012 - adopts policies that comply with House Enrolled Act 1005
concerning nepotism and contracting with relatives
Councillor Lewis said that this propsoal is in response to House Enrolled Act (HEA)
1005 and she asked Mr. Biesecker to explain the proposal. Mr. Biesecker said that
HEA 1005 takes effect July 1, 2012 and mandates that all local units of government
adopt policies relating to nepotism and contracting with relatives of elected officials.
The Indiana Association of Cities and Towns strongly recommended that units of
government adopt an ordinance that essentially incorporates the substance of the new
State statute, so that they do not run afoul of the law that takes effect July 1st. This
proposal incorporates the minimum requirements set forth in that statute. Indianapolis’
ethics code already addresses some areas of nepotism, but this measure is required by
the State to incorporate the new State laws.
Councillor Lewis said that she believes the administration is going to offer some
additional comments and amendments before the full Council meeting, but she feels it is

Rules and Public Policy Committee
June 12, 2012
Page 19
important to move forward. She moved, seconded by Councillor Mansfield, to send
Proposal No. 221, 2012 to the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation.
Councillor McQuillen asked how relatives are defined. Mr. Biesecker said that the
language mirrors the State statute and he read the definition included in the proposal.
The motion to send Proposal No. 221, 2012 to the full Council with a “Do Pass”
recommendation carried by a vote of 6-0.
There being no further business, and upon motion duly made, the Rules and Public
Policy Committee was adjourned at 8:58 p.m.

RULES AND PUBLIC POLICY COMMITTEE

The Rules and Public Policy Committee of the City-County Council met on Tuesday,
July 6, 2010. Chairman Robert Lutz called the meeting to order at 5:30 p.m. with the
following members present: Bob Cockrum, Monroe Gray, Angela Mansfield, Michael
McQuillen, Angel Rivera, Joanne Sanders and Ryan Vaughn. Jon Elrod, acting on
behalf of General Counsel Robert Elrod, and Aaron Haith, counsel for the minority
caucus, represented Council staff. Councillors Vernon Brown and Barbara Malone
were also in attendance.
Chairman Lutz stated that he does not anticipate taking a vote on Proposal No. 229,
2010 this evening, as he believes more time is needed for review, but the committee will
take public testimony and ask questions of the presenters.
PROPOSAL NO. 225, 2010 - amends the Code requiring the Purchasing Division to
adopt rules to give a preference to Indiana businesses pursuant to IC 5-22-15-20 and to
companies participating in the Indiana Business Plan
Councillor Brown said that next year, they will have nearly half a billion dollars to spend
on curbs and sidewalks from selling the water company and parking rights. A couple of
months ago, he asked the purchasing division for a record of the contracts awarded by
the Department of Public Works (DPW) for curbs and sidewalks and other related
capital improvements. He said that $80 million was spent in 2008, $100 million in 2009,
and $80 million so far in 2010, whereas the baseline for projects has been $250,000
annually. He said with this much stimulus money being added to help supplement the
budget, this proposal will provide the city the opportunity to employ minorities in
construction projects, and will allow them to track the money generated in Marion
County, so that those paying the taxes can make a decent living. He said that the
proposal requires that 67% of those employed by the creation of these projects be
Marion County employees. He said that people in his district, and he would imagine
everyone’s districts, need jobs, and this is an opportunity to make advancements in
employment for the County. He said that with half a billion dollars of Marion County
money, he would like to see purchasing track that money to see how much is spent with
contractors inside, and how much outside, of Marion County. He provided a handout
detailing a similar plan adopted by Hammond, Indiana, and he asked the committee to
take some time to look at the proposal and come up with a consensus to make this
work.
Councillor Vaughn asked if Councillor Brown’s intent is to introduce the proposal this
evening and then have ongoing discussion after the budget process. Councillor Brown
responded in the affirmative, and said that he would like to have some meetings with

Rules and Public Policy Committee
August 30, 2010
Page 2
DPW, purchasing, and union representatives in the next couple of months to come up
with some friendly amendments to make this proposal work for all citizens of Marion
County. He said that he is open to any and all suggestions. Mr. Haith said that at
introduction of the proposal, general counsel added comments that raised questions as
to some terms in the proposal being unconstitutional. He provided a handout of the
ruling of the Supreme Court’s Justice O’Connor regarding the case of Grutter vs.
Bollinger. He said that the Indiana Plan is based on this decision and language, and
this is not a quota system; but what Councillor Brown believes to be in the best interest
for the citizens of Marion County. He said that the Indiana Plan is written in such a way
that each county can further refine it to fit its specific needs, and as long as the interests
are narrowly tailored and race is not used as an identifier, such plans can be devised
that further the interests of the municipal entity. He said that if the Indiana Plan were
found to be unconstitutional, then this proposal would be as well, but he does not
believe the Indiana Plan is unconstitutional. He said that lawyers usually defer to
Supreme Court decisions with regard to constitutionality, and while the language may
need some refinement, he does not believe it is unconstitutional.
Councillor Brown said that due to a recent situation where the crime prevention money
to keep kids out of jail and ex-offenders from re-offending, was reduced from $5 million
to $2 million, he learned from Councillor Vaughn that if something is not put in writing, it
does not matter what the intentions were. That is why he is putting these intentions for
use of that money into writing, so that guidelines for its use are clear.
Councillor Sanders asked if Councillor Brown received the list of contracts he
requested. Councillor Brown said that he did receive a list of over 30 pages, and can
ask purchasing to also send that information to the rest of the committee. He said that
this intent stemmed from a bridge project in a neighborhood where all the cars parked
around the job site had Ohio license plates. He said that with the exception of very
unique technical skills, he would like to avoid using out-of-state contractors on any of
these types of projects in Marion County.
Councillor Sanders added that the Indiana Plan is referred to as the Indiana Business
Plan in a couple of instances in this proposal, as well as in the digest, but the actual
name of the plan is the “Indiana Plan.” She moved, seconded by Councillor Vaughn, to
technically “Amend” Proposal No. 225, 2010 to replace all references to the Indiana
Business Plan with “Indiana Plan.” The motion carried by a vote of 8-0.
Councillor Rivera asked if Councillor Brown’s intent with this proposal is to guarantee or
create a strong incentive to give preferential treatment to locally owned firms, and if the
intent is to incentivize these firms to employ county residents or minorities. Councillor
Brown said that the Indiana Plan brings non-traditional workers into the construction
industry, by giving some preference to women and minorities. He said that the proposal
also requires that 67% of the workforce for these projects be made up of Marion County
residents, to help stop foreclosures and put this money into the hands of the people who
live in Marion County.

Councillor Vaughn moved, seconded by Councillor McQuillen, to “Postpone” Proposal
No. 225, 2010 until December 14, 2010. The motion carried by a vote of 8-0.
PROPOSAL NO. 228, 2010 - amends the Revised Code of the Consolidated City and
County to correct certain obsolete references to the Indiana Code
Councillor Vaughn stated that this proposal is mostly a clean-up ordinance to make
technical corrections in the Code. He said that the only change that is not necessarily
clean-up is with regard to DPW holding hearings for waivers, but this responsibility now
lies with the Department of Code Enforcement (DCE) and not DPW. He moved,
seconded by Councillor McQuillen, to send Proposal No. 228, 2010 to the full Council
with a “Do Pass” recommendation.
Councillor Sanders asked, with respect to page two, Sec. 261-405 (4), if the reference
to IC 36-1-9 no longer applies, and this is no longer any part of Section 36 of the Code.
Mark Mertz, Assistant Corporation Counsel, stated that the new citation is IC 5-22, as
this section was recodified several years ago.
The motion to send Proposal No. 228, 2010 to the full Council with a “Do Pass”
recommendation carried by a vote of 8-0.
PROPOSAL NO. 229, 2010 - approves and authorizes the execution of a concession
agreement to grant a concessionaire the right to operate, maintain and improve the
metered parking system of the City of Indianapolis and amends the Code to provide for,
among other things, new metered parking zones, hours of operation and rates for the
metered parking system in accordance with the provisions set forth in such concession
agreement
Michael Huber, Deputy Mayor for Neighborhoods and Economic Development,
introduced Kurt Fullbeck, project manager, Mayor’s Office; and Michael Milliken, outside
counsel from Ice Miller law firm, and several other individuals involved in this
transaction. Mr. Huber said that the administration has been looking for ways to fund
infrastructure improvements without relying so heavily on property taxes. He stated that
this concession agreement would modernize the parking system without placing the
burden of cost for that modernization on the taxpayer. He said that people want to be
able to use credit or debit cards when parking, like they can in other major cities,
instead of always having to have sufficient coins on hand to park. The purpose of
parking meters is to provide turnover and move business within commercial districts of
the city. If meters are tied up for long hours, it will hurt businesses, because clients will
be more inclined to take their business to a location where parking is more readily
accessible. He said that while this solution is not a perfect deal, it has received
widespread positive feedback from affected merchants, and they have spent a lot of
time asking for input from business owners as a focus of this proposal.

Rules and Public Policy Committee

Mr. Huber said that the goals of this transaction are to improve parking technology, to
streamline parking operations and management to realize efficiencies and reduce costs,
and to upgrade aging and sometimes inadequate downtown and Broad Ripple
infrastructure, including parking, streets, sidewalks and bridges. He said that the
request for qualifications (RFQ) the city started at the beginning of the year
contemplates two separate agreements: a 10-year proposal for parking garages and
lots, with a single manager holding all contracts and streamlining operations; and a 50year proposal for parking meters in the form of a concession agreement between the
city and the winning bidder to manage and operate the system. He said that a shorterterm agreement is being considered for garages and lots because the city is already
committed to some long-term agreements with regard to these garages and lots for
economic development projects, and they would like to continue to use this resource for
that purpose. The 50-year proposed concession agreement for parking meters would
provide the city with $35 million up front in two payments, as well as a revenue share
over the life of the agreement. Mr. Huber stated that they have had several public
forums and stakeholder briefings as outlined in Exhibit A (attached) and explained the
timeline for this process as outlined in Exhibit B (attached). He said that the shortlisted
bidders were announced on April 8, 2010, and were whittled down from the 16
responses to seven viable proposals from both international and local firms. ACS, a
Xerox company, in a partnership with local firms Denison Global Parking and Evens
Time, were selected on August 20, 2010 as the winning bid. Mr. Huber presented a
snapshot of current parking revenues and expenses (attached as Exhibit C) to show
that the current system has not been a critical asset for the city and does not really
generate enough revenue to make a dent in the infrastructure needs, as parking meter
revenues are required by Indiana law to be used for infrastructure improvements on
streets and sidewalks where parking meters exist. He said that with this agreement,
expenses in the areas of personnel, supplies and materials, and contractual services
would no longer be needed by the city, as ACS would absorb these costs, and
personnel would be moved to the Department of Public Works (DPW) in the transition.
He said that they are working to insure that the transition of these personnel can be
accomplished without any negatively impacted employees.
Mr. Huber said that the metered parking system is divided into four zones: downtown
core, downtown other, downtown residential and Broad Ripple, which has 162 parking
meters. In total, there are more than 3,600 meters, and there are different
recommendations and rates for each zone, based on demands and data. He shared
the proposed parking rates (attached as Exhibit D) and stated that even with the
increases, Indianapolis’ parking would still be one of the most inexpensive in the
country. Past 2012, the agreement allows that the rates would not increase any more
than the rate of inflation rounded down to the nearest quarter over the life of the deal.
He added that the agreement adds Saturday hours and extends the hours in the
downtown core to 9:00 p.m., in the downtown other zone to 8:00 p.m., and in Broad
Ripple to 11:00 p.m., with residential staying the same. He said that they spent a lot of
time with the Broad Ripple Village Association (BRVA), and there is widespread
acceptance for the changes, provided there is more revenue for infrastructure

Rules and Public Policy Committee
August 30, 2010
Page 5
investment, as well as a residential parking permit program. He said that some policy
issues for the Council to consider in approving this agreement are rates and hours, new
meters and locations, a residential parking permit program, enforcement and the use of
proceeds. He said that they are proposing adding 100 spaces on Massachusetts
Avenue northeast of St. Clair Street and College Avenue based on demand, and
another 30 meters in Broad Ripple on Westfield Boulevard behind Chase Bank. He
said that 10 or 11 years ago, metered spaces in this Broad Ripple location were
removed, due to a development project, and it was always intended to bring those
spaces back, which has not yet occurred. Mr. Huber said that as a part of this
agreement, the city is requiring that ACS administer a residential parking permit
program where negotiated. He said that there are a few of these programs already in
existence, such as in Lockerbie Square; and other areas, such as Broad Ripple, have
approached the city to discuss such programs, as well. This concession agreement
specifies a process by which a residential area, through the approval of the Council,
could require the ACS team to manage a parking permit program if there was a demand
for it in that area. He said that they are not creating a new program, but are simply
simplifying the process. He said that enforcement would essentially stay the same
under this agreement, with the exception of some longer hours. He said that parking
enforcement has essentially been outsourced in Indianapolis for more than 10 years,
with Denison employees handling the enforcement. He said that the city will still
maintain the adjudication process, so that residents can still appeal to the city if they
feel they have been issued a parking ticket in error. He added that the police
department would also continue to have the power to enforce and issue tickets, as well.
Mr. Huber said that the use of the up-front payment and proceeds over time would be
used to improve and maintain streets and infrastructure, as prescribed by statute. He
said that the city chose not to maximize the up-front proceeds by only taking $35 million
at the onset and leaving a significant revenue stream in place for future administrations
and generations, which would also allow them to hold the contractor more accountable
over a long period of time. He provided a brief overview of private parking management
alternative scenarios (attached as Exhibit), such as a pure management contract or a
pure 100% up-front payment. He said that they tried to strike a balance with an up-front
payment, as well as revenue sharing over the life of the contract. He said that they are
confident that, with this model, they can generate more revenue than they have ever
had for future administrations. He said that ACS is proposing a revenue share
mechanism that allows the city to share in all revenue generated from the metered
parking system, including enforcement revenue. He added that this revenue sharing
would be paid in a tier system, with the city receiving 20% and ACS receiving 80% of
annual revenues up to $8.4 million. The city would then receive 55% and ACS 45% of
any annual revenues over $8.4 million. He said that while the first tier seems to be
heavily weighted in favor of ACS, the city will be receiving a $35 million up-front
payment on an asset that has netted less than $800,000 in revenue over the last
several years. ACS will also be making an estimate of $7 to $10 million in meter
upgrades in the first several years, for which the city would have to issue bonds to do
the project themselves. He said that they will also maintain responsibility for

Rules and Public Policy Committee
August 30, 2010
Page 6
maintaining the meters and refreshing the meters every 10 years, and the city
administration felt this was a business that government does not necessarily need to be
in. Mr. Huber said that in the RFQ process, it was made clear that the winning firm
would need to invest in local companies and have a strong minority and women
business enterprise (MBE/WBE) component. He said that the city felt ACS took that
requirement into consideration by partnering with local firms Denison Global and Evens
Time. ACS expects to add 200 jobs in the local community over two years, which will
not necessarily be related to parking, and were not factored into the decision regarding
the winning bid. This job creation was a decision made known to the city after it was
announced ACS was their first choice. He said that these jobs will remain in place for at
least seven years, located within Marion County, most being encouraged within Center
Township, with an economic value of over $40 million.
[Clerk’s Note: Councillor Cockrum left at 5:55 p.m.}
Mr. Milliken stated that committee members should have received an executive
summary of the concession agreement, and he will outline some key points of that
agreement. He said that this proposal follows prior precedent regarding the sale or
management of similar assets in other states and cities, and they tried to incorporate
provisions that have worked well in some of these other instances. He said that one
factor that is different in this proposal from other agreements is the revenue share.
When all the money is paid up front, the partnership, in many respects, ends. With the
revenue share aspect, the city and concessionaire are incentivized to work together. A
lot of provisions that are written into many of these types of concession agreements
were not necessary, then, because of the revenue sharing component and the
continued relationship. Mr. Milliken said that if the Council approves this proposal, then
the concession agreement would be signed by ACS and the city soon thereafter.
Following that, with most agreements, there would be a 30 to 60-day period to work on
the transition plan before the financial closing, at which time ACS would then be
charged with running the system. Because there is no financing involved and ACS is
paying for this transaction through operating funds, a bank cannot step in and delay the
closing or cause further delay in negotiations. In lieu of that, the city will hold a $6
million letter of credit from ACS between now and the time of closing, and if ACS should
back out of the deal, the city would get to keep the $6 million. Therefore, ACS is
financially tied to the deal and is incentivized to resolve any transition issues. He said
that once the closing takes place, the city would be paid the first up-front payment of
$20 million, with the other $15 million due on or before January 1, 2011. He said that
the up-front payment was split into two installments to allow ACS to spread it between
two budget years, allowing them to pay a higher up-front payment. If they did not do it
this way, the up-front payment would have been $27.5 million. He said that if the
second payment is not made, and for some reason ACS should default at that point,
then the city gets to keep the $20 million, and the parking meter system reverts back to
the city. He said that the enforcement piece is similar to what is in place now, with the
city still adjudicating disputes, and the proceeds of those disputes would count toward
the revenue share. While the concessionaire will be the primary enforcer, the

Rules and Public Policy Committee
August 30, 2010
Page 7
Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department (IMPD) still has the right and ability to
enforce parking, as well.
Mr. Milliken said that throughout the 50-year term of the agreement, there may be times
when certain meters need to be closed for a variety of reasons. In the event that the
city would want to permanently remove a meter, there is a formula based on historic use
of the meter, and the city would make a payment to compensate the concessionaire for
the removal of that potential revenue. With regard to temporary closures, each meter
has a 6% closure rate allowed under the agreement, so that the meter could be
temporarily closed up to 19 days out of the year without any compensation to the
concessionaire. Sundays and holidays do not count toward this closure rate, and an
additional carve-out is provided for special events like the SuperBowl and National
Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) events, and closure for these types of events do
not result in compensation. While some of these special events are listed specifically,
with a 50-year agreement, there may be events of a similar magnitude that the city
cannot predict or foresee, such as a Republican or Democrat National Convention, and
these are also covered without required compensation. He added that any closure less
than four hours, such as for quick construction work, a charity run, a parade, or an
accident investigation, would not count toward the 19-day closure allotment. He said
that there is, therefore, some flexibility for the city to conduct normal operations without
penalty. The agreement also allows for the city and concessionaire to add additional
meters by agreement. In such an event, the concessionaire would pay all the costs
associated with the addition of that meter, and the revenue would be shared under the
same formula as existing meters. There is a reserve meter clause in the agreement
which provides for a situation where the city wants to add more than 10% of existing
meters in any particular zone, and the concessionaire does not feel the addition is
economically viable. If the city wanted to add 161 meters to the downtown zone, where
there are 1,600 existing meters, but the concessionaire did not feel it was economically
viable, the city could pay the cost to install the meters and then receive a special
revenue split of 80% on those additional meters. Mr. Milliken said that the more likely
scenario, however, would be the concessionaire coming to the city to propose new
meters versus the city approaching ACS.
Mr. Milliken referred to the placard parking program, where there are approximately 400
placards allowing certain city officials and employees to park at meters at no charge.
Once the new electronic meters are installed, those placards will be replaced with some
sort of smart card, which will be issued to the same officials and can provide a better
handle on how those placards are used. The agreement is not very specific with regard
to this program, because ACS is still looking at technology options, and they are not
sure of the actual technology to be used. He said that they included a provision with
regard to advertising, if the new meters are large enough to include space for
advertising. The agreement provides that any advertising to be done on the meters, if
any at all, would have to be approved by the city, and the revenue generated would also
be shared with the city. With the existing concerns about billboards and the proliferation
of signage downtown, it would be completely in the city’s control whether or not to allow

Rules and Public Policy Committee

the advertising. One other provision with regard to the increase in fees, is that they
cannot be increased until the electronic meters are in place. This creates additional
incentive for the concessionaire to install these in a timely manner so that patrons can
begin using their credit or debit cards to park, increasing the usage of meters, and
allowing the concessionaire to put rate increases into effect. Thirty days public notice is
also required for the rate increases. With ACS being a subsidiary of Xerox, a public
company, their financials are public record, and they will deliver detailed financial
reports to the city at the end of every year. The city will also receive a report each
quarter when they receive their share of revenues, and they can ask for additional detail
at any time and can audit their operations, as well. Mr. Milliken added that the goals for
MBE/WBE/VBE (minority, women and veteran owned businesses) participation is 15%,
8% and 3%, as per the standard guidelines for the city, in accordance with the most
recent disparity study. He added that if the concessionaire does not fulfill their duties,
they would be considered in default, and there is a cure period where the meter system
would revert back to the city, with the city keeping all up-front payments and equipment
upgrades in the event of a default. He said that since there are no financial covenants
from a bank or lender involved, it is very clear cut that if they default, the meter system
would revert back to the city. The concessionaire must post a letter of credit to
complete upgrades within five years of the end of the 50-year agreement, so that
meters would be in operating order when they revert back to the city.
Chairman Lutz called for public testimony.
Zach Adamson, owner of a small business at 133 East Ohio Street, said that he has
been in business for 14 years, during both thriving economic times and times that were
not thriving. He said that he opposes this proposal because of the challenge small
businesses have in marketing their services to consumers outside of the city center. He
said that the number one reason consumers give for not coming downtown is parking.
He said that people also do not want to work for a business where parking is a
complication. He said that in these bad economic times, the small businesses feel it the
most, and already have to increase their costs to make ends meet, while experiencing
basic licensing increases just to continue operating. Local governments have also
increased their attention to economic development, which causes more hurdles for
small businesses. He said that government should not make it harder for small
businesses to attract customers and employees, since small businesses employ over
70% of all Americans. While he understands the city needs money, small businesses
also need to provide a living for their employees. He said that it has been reported that
the merchants support this initiative, but he has worked during his lunch break to poll his
neighbors, and he has 10 pages of signatures of people opposed to this transaction.
He said that out of the 150 signatures he has, 81 are small business owners or
managers, with 30 from Massachusetts Avenue and all but three of the businesses in
the City Market included. He asked the committee to reject this transaction and find
another way to solve the city’s money problems. He added that it was testified that the
city has been speaking to business owners affected, and especially those on

Rules and Public Policy Committee
August 30, 2010
Page 9
Massachusetts Avenue; but he was never contacted, and many of those who signed
this opposition petition are located on Massachusetts Avenue.
Larry Vaughn, citizen, said that the city is proposing turning over its parking meters to
the same company that the State of Indiana is suing for messing up poor relief. He said
that the city seems to be selling all of its assets, and after looking into Mayor Greg
Ballard’s background, he can understand why. He said that Mayor Ballard ran the PX in
the army, which is the equivalent of a convenient store manager, and this is the reason
why all these attorneys and promotional men are getting rich taking 20% off this deal.
He said that selling assets is spinning out of control, and he does not understand why
the city cannot use its own brain trust here in the city to renew this system and
manufacture those electronic meter boxes locally instead of outsourcing them to China.
He said that this transaction does not show any aspect of self-preservation. The city is
selling its assets and labor force while the city is already in decline, and if this continues,
the city will not last another 20 years, and it will be a ghost town downtown.
David Andrichik, owner of the Chatterbox Jazz Club on Massachusetts Avenue, stated
that the Massachusetts Avenue businesses have a lot of history with the city and DPW
related to parking. He said that he remembers when the parking was changed from
parallel parking to perpendicular to help triple the number of parking spaces along the
Avenue, and they did not think at that time they would again have a parking problem.
He said, however, that because business is good, he is happy to say they do have a
parking problem still. He said that there are, however, some glitches in the
management of meters right now, and concerns from residents who live nearby and rent
spaces. He said that he is not completely familiar with this concession agreement, and
those issues may be addressed in the document, and it will prove to be very beneficial.
He said that there has been very little upgrade on infrastructure since the late 1980s,
and he believes if this deal provides money for infrastructure while gaining better meters
and spaces, it will be a good deal. He said that they have had presentations on this
transaction given to the Massachusetts Avenue Merchants Association, and there has
been very little opposition to the proposal. The avenue businesses are 65 members
strong, and he supports it.
Fred Laughlin, vice president of management services for Indianapolis Downtown, Inc.
(IDI), said that IDI has been involved in advising the Mayor’s office throughout this
process and they are in favor of the proposal. He said that no one likes rate increases,
but it has been 35 years since the parking meter rates were raised, and both downtown
and Broad Ripple will benefit by the improvements made for convenience in use and
infrastructure. He said that it is a win-win situation for the city and its citizens.
Kevin Martin, owner of the United Parcel Service (UPS) store at 133 West Market
Street, stated that in general, this sounds like a good plan, although he does not know
all the details. He said that he has owned his store for six years and lived downtown for
five years, and absolutely loves it. He said that there are 60 UPS stores in the state,
and those customers who visit his store, are either downtown employees who are

Rules and Public Policy Committee
August 30, 2010
Page 10
parking for the day or visitors doing business downtown who use the meters. He said
that he believes the perception of this deal might be worse than reality. He said that
paying an extra quarter, when the fee has been seventy-five cents forever, should not
really be a big problem. He said that turnover is critical to his business, and this may be
the best way to keep the turnover going. He said that when the city red-bags the
meters, it drives businesses like his crazy. He said that these bags usually do not get
unbagged very quickly, and they take up several spaces for sports teams that come in
for one night, but may take a couple of days to unbag the meters. He said that he
suspects a private company would move those red bags quicker, because the longer
they leave them bagged, the more revenue they lose. He added that including Saturday
hours is an excellent addition. He encouraged the city to maintain loading zones and
retain control over these, as they are critical to downtown businesses. He said that he
pays for his employees to walk three blocks and park in a nearby lot, but many
employees at downtown businesses are parking at a space and feeding the meters
every couple of hours with coins. He said that hopefully, this transaction will decrease
this problem with some specialized parking programs. Councillor McQuillen asked how
many parking spaces are immediately adjacent to Mr. Martin’s business. Mr. Martin
said that there are about 15 spaces. He added that when a sports team comes into the
hotel and meters are red-bagged in front of the hotel, it really hurts their business, and
he hopes the private company will get the meters unbagged faster.
Jean Farison Renk, Greater Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce (COC), said that the
city asked for COC’s input, and their membership agrees with this proposal and
supports it. She said that it makes sense to do it this way to upgrade technology and
help with infrastructure needs. She said that in the absence of mass transit to
downtown, this parking is critical.
Jeff Miller, resident of Fletcher Place and member of Southeast Neighborhood
Development (SEND), said that no one wants to pay more for parking, but he has seen
the list of $1.5 billion in backlog of infrastructure projects, and the city is in poor
condition. He thanked the Mayor for helping to get the $425 million to start to address
these issues, but the city can use every dollar available. He said that the budget pays
for less than the amount of deterioration per year, budgeting around $20 million last
year on streets, with over $60 million in deterioration taking place each year. He said
that the current Mayor has tripled the budget from the budgeted $8 million by the
previous administration, but they are still $40 million in the hole every year. He said that
they need to find dedicated annual funding to help address the infrastructure needs, and
this is a brilliant one. He said that they still need to find more, however, because this
will not cover it all. He said that by statute, this money is dedicated to streets and
sidewalks and cannot go to the Capital Improvement Board (CIB) or to anything else.
While it will not cover everything, it is very important to find every dollar they can to
address this issue. He said that he, like most citizens, is willing to pay more if he knows
it will go toward fixing the infrastructure problems. He said that there are still some
details to be dealt with, but he is definitely in favor of the concept.

Councillor Rivera stated that he would like to disclose for the record that ACS
subcontracts some of its work to his employer, but it is not parking related, and he has
no role in this deal whatsoever and will not benefit from the transaction in any way. He
said, however, that he felt it was important to disclose the relationship to avoid the
appearance of a conflict of interest. He asked what service levels are included in the
agreement with regard to bagging the meters. Mr. Huber said that he does not doubt
that the transaction will insure a vast improvement over the current bagging service
levels. He said that with upgraded multi-space meters in the busiest areas, it will be
easier and quicker to put up and take down signage, and of course, the concessionaire
will be more incentivized to remove the bags, as bagged meters affect revenues. Mr.
Milliken said that all the guidelines for bagging the meters are covered in the operating
standards in Schedule 2 of the agreement. Councillor Rivera asked if there was a
certain amount of hours required to unbag the meters. Mr. Milliken said that he does
not know the particular hours off-hand, but can get that information for Councillor
Rivera. Mr. Huber said that through the revenue sharing arrangement, both the
contractor and the city have a healthy incentive to immediately un-bag the meters after
the special event. With a centrally controlled system for electronic meters, the
concessionaire will be able to know exactly when the meters were shut down and then
re-activated and how much money was lost due to bagging.
Councillor Rivera said that the Indiana Business Journal (IBJ) says that the revenue
from the concessionaire will be about the same as the expenditures the city is incurring
right now to maintain and enforce the parking meter system. He asked if the money will
be a wash. Mr. Huber referred to Exhibit C and said that under the new agreement, the
personnel, supplies and contractual services expenses will be passed on to the
contractor, which represents a cost savings to the city. The parking enforcement
expense paid to IMPD in 2008 and 2009 was about $2 million, and this amount should
decrease significantly, and is budgeted at $1.7 million in 2011. It is further expected to
decrease in future years, while the revenues are expected to escalate over the 50 years
of the contract. He said that in the next 10 to 15 years, it will be the job of the Mayor’s
Office to further evaluate and look at the contracts and determine how the city will be
reimbursing IMPD for parking meter enforcement, considering the new structure.
Councillor Rivera asked if future rate increases will no longer need Council approval.
Mr. Huber said that hours, new meters and locations would still be subject to the
approval of the Council. The Council is being asked with this agreement to approve a
maximum rate schedule that is adjusted by inflation after the incremental increases in
2011 and 2012. He said that rate increases would also be part of the auditing process,
and he is sure the Council would be keeping track of those increases. Councillor Rivera
asked if the rates of the garages are subject to this deal or are different. Mr. Huber said
that the users of the garages should see little to no change. Because this agreement
shifts to one company managing the garages for 10 years, they are hoping to see more
consistency in technology. The reason they did not suggest any rates or formula for
rates with regard to the lots and garages is because the contractor would be competing
with 75% other privately owned lots and garages, and they would, therefore, have to

Rules and Public Policy Committee
August 30, 2010
Page 12
raise or decrease rates to remain competitive. He said that there should not be much
change in the way the garages are operated today. Councillor Rivera asked who
enforces the one foot from the curb requirement for parking. Mr. Fullbeck said that the
concessionaire would enforce this, but they will not see any revenue from this, and a
violation which might generate revenue would be parking over the time limit or parking
in a handicapped space without proper plates or signage.
Councillor Rivera asked if any internal study or comparison has been done on the
numbers if the city did this internally and borrowed debt to finance the upgrades. Mr.
Huber said that they asked their financial advisors for other ways to do this in-house,
including issuing debt to buy and own the technology upgrades and to issue debt for
more infrastructure. In this case, they would have had to come to the Council for
approval to create a new entity to issue the debt for parking management, such as a
parking authority, and this entity would not have a long history of high returns to receive
the most favorable interest rates or financing costs from potential investors. He said
that they tried to work this analysis in as many ways as they could. The highest amount
of money they could work into their internal scenarios was about $20 million. Part of
this proposal is paying for $7 to $10 million in estimated technology improvements
through the revenue sharing, which does not account for the $35 million additional
dollars up front for infrastructure upgrades, even though the city or Council could bond
separately for that $35 million. Councillor Rivera asked who is responsible for the cost
of signage. Mr. Fullbeck responded that the concessionaire is responsible for that cost.
Councillor McQuillen asked why this is a 50-year contract and if that is a normal term for
this type of contract. Mr. Huber said that it seems like a long time, but one reason for
such a lengthy contract is to get the most competitive financing with the equity funds
involved. Fifty years tends to be the minimum amount of time that lenders will invest in
city infrastructure. By proposing a 50-year agreement in the RFQ, they created a
competitive situation which increased the value for the city. If they had gone with a
shorter time, they would be competing among companies who do operation only of the
meters. But by going to 50 years, they were able to secure some of the best
infrastructure funds and create a competitive situation, which ultimately drove up the
value for the city. The other reason they feel good about a 50-year term is that,
because of the shared revenues, there is a healthy incentive for the city to hold the
contractor accountable. Finally, the city would have to borrow $7 to $10 million to make
the technology upgrades, with those meters only having a life of 10 to 15 years. The
long-term revenue share provides the incentive for the contractor to manage the meters
and refresh them at the right time. The government is not a good manager of certain
types of assets and is better served by having others with more expertise manage some
of these assets. He said that this is a good incentive for the contractor to refresh meters
every several years, without passing that cost along to the taxpayers. Councillor
McQuillen said that rumors surround transactions such as these, and he asked Mr.
Huber to comment on the rumors that this agreement creates a monopoly and that it
was initiated with a no-bid contract. Mr. Huber said that with regard to bids, they tried to
be transparent throughout every stage of this process, and posted the 16 RFQ

Rules and Public Policy Committee
August 30, 2010
Page 13
responses immediately after they were received on the Mayor’s website and talked
about them in public forums. He said that he believes anyone interested in this process
would say that they had a great variety of firms submit responses, making this a very
competitive situation. He said that they stayed well within the guidelines of the private
public partnership statute which governs this particular procurement process. In terms
of creating a monoply, parking meters are owned by the city, and therefore, they are not
competing with privately owned on-street parking, because this is essentially city real
estate. However, with the garage and lot spaces, when they created this coalition of the
city’s, the CIB’s, and Health and Hospital Corporation’s garages and lots (including the
new Wishard Hospital), these spaces represented less than 30% of the total parking in
downtown. ACS is still then competing with at least 70% of privately owned parking,
and would therefore, not be considered a monopoly. He asked Mr. Laughlin of IDI to
confirm those statistics. Mr. Laughlin said that there are over 72,000 parking spaces
downtown, and this agreement actually probably covers less than 30% of that available
parking, including only about 20,000 spaces.
Councillor Sanders asked Mr. Huber to explain the process regarding who appraised
the present value of the properties that are a part of this agreement. Mr. Huber asked if
Councillor Sanders is referring to the meters. Councillor Sanders said that she is
referring to the garages, lots, parking spaces, rights-of-way and meters. Mr. Huber said
that they did not look at the garages and lots, because that agreement is a pure
management contract, and no appraisal was needed. He said that Morgan Stanley,
outside financial advisors, appraised the assets for the parking meter agreement.
Councillor Sanders asked at what year ACS will consider that they have received a
return on their investment. Mr. Huber said that this would be speculative on their part,
as lots of things could happen in 50 years. Barbara Roberts, vice president of business
development for ACS, stated that their projections make several assumptions based on
data provided by the city, historicals, and their subject matter expertise in the industry.
She said that only reality will substantiate those projections and assumptions. She said
that at this point, those assumptions are internal to this project and therefore
confidential, but they expect that they will receive a fair payback from this agreeement, if
the program is successful. Councillor Sanders asked if it is fair to say that the reported
accounts in the newspaper of ACS accumulating $1.2 billion in profits over the 50 years
of the agreement are correct. Ms. Roberts said that this number was generated
independently and is not in keeping with ACS’s numbers, and they have a far more
conservative projection. Councillor Sanders said that she understood someone to say
that ACS, as a subsidiary of Xerox, is a publicly traded company, and she asked why
their documents would not then be public, and why this information would be considered
proprietary. Ms. Roberts said that Xerox is a public corporation and does post complete
corporate revenues and earnings, but they do not report those revenue projections at a
project level. She said that in a revenue share arrangement, all supporting data is fully
auditable, but the independent components on cost are confidential within their
company. Councillor Sanders said that, as an elected official making this type of
decision, she would like to know what the ballpark figure would be and what year ACS
expects to receive a return on their investment. She said that she hopes ACS will re-

Rules and Public Policy Committee
August 30, 2010
Page 14
consider sharing that information with the committee, and it would not have to be done
publicly in front of the media. Mr. Huber said that the media reports speculated
numbers in gross revenue; and for this industry, 10% is a healthy internal rate of return.
Councillor Sanders said that 50 years is an extremely long time, and she is very
concerned about this aspect. Mr. Huber said that he will try and answer Councillor
Sanders’ question more completely.
Councillor Sanders said that there is language in the agreement that says the
concessionaire has the opportunity to identify an operator, which may or may not be the
concessionaire. She asked who the operator is in this particular situation. Mr. Huber
said that the way he understands it is that the operator is the team of ACS, Denison
Global and Evens Time. Ms. Roberts concurred and said that they are subcontracting
some services to Denison and Evens Time, but ACS will be serving as both the
concessionaire and operator. Councillor Sanders asked about the difference between
an RFQ and a request for proposals (RFP), which is more commonly used; and how an
RFQ constitutes bidding. Mr. Huber said that an RFQ is more focused on qualifications,
whereas an RFP is more of an apples-to-apples comparison across all operators. He
said that they very strictly adhered to the public private partnership (P3) process as
prescribed by statute, which lays out a very specific process for stepping through an
RFQ. He said that this is different than the way the city would procure a typical good or
service, and this agreement meets the standards for the P3 partnership. Mr. Milliken
added that the P3 statute enables a government body to go through a process and
basically provide a recommendation based on the RFQs received. He said at the end
of the day, they had three bidders, and the city met with an independent team which
graded those bidders on a variety of criteria, and then the DPW board recommended
the winning bid to the Council. Councillor Sanders asked if the city then did not
establish parameters that anyone bidding would have to meet as they would have in an
RFP. Mr. Huber said that they did establish parameters when they put out the RFQ,
and those were published on the website. He said that those parameters were wider,
due to the P3 statute, and they received 16 submissions, then tightened up their
requirements and narrowed the submissions down using the P3 standards. Councillor
Sanders asked for the citation for the P3 statute. Mr. Milliken said that the statute is IC
5-23, and he would be happy to send it to Councillor Sanders. Councillor Sanders
asked with regard to closing meters, if the agreement looks at recurring events that
happen annually and if a list is included to exempt these events from a penalty. Mr.
Milliken said that unless the time frames are already covered, such as with a parade
that lasts less than four hours, there is a list of events included. He said that not every
single event is stipulated, and some go toward that annual 6% allowance.
Chairman Lutz called for a brief recess at 7:17 p.m. The committee was reconvened at
7:27 p.m.
Chairman Lutz recognized Wayne Township Trustee David Baird, and welcomed Debra
Jenkins, County Surveyor, who missed out on the public testimony and would like to
make a few comments.

Rules and Public Policy Committee
August 30, 2010
Page 15
Ms. Jenkins said that last year she submitted her budget to the Council not realizing
there would be a $23 million stimulus package, where the projects affected her office.
She said that certain road projects had to go down so deep that some monuments
needed to be replaced, and this placed a financial burden on her budget. She said that
she would like more time to study the impact of this agreement on her budget, as there
might be some effect on the rights-of-way or other issues that may seem irrelevant or
minor to some, but might affect her office and her budget greatly. She said that she
would like to be included in the discussions about new meters and where they are being
located. She added that in looking over the agreement hastily she saw the 100-feet
requirement for motorcycle parking and asked if that would be adjusted if the city gets
the Motocross event. Chairman Lutz stated that Ms. Jenkins has raised some very valid
concerns that he had not considered.
Councillor Mansfield said that she appreciates the additional time and the fact that they
are not expected to make a decision on the proposal this evening. She said that it is
troubling that she is getting the impression that this administration is either incapable or
unwilling to govern. By putting all these processes outside of government control, the
city is foregoing flexibility and the opportunity to retain revenues. She said that it seems
with this proposal they are trying to improve parking technology, raise rates and improve
infrastructure. She added that she has served on the Public Works Committee since
2004, and she is very aware of the infrastructure issues, with some streets being
repaved and not lasting more than four years. In 2006, a study was conducted to look
at different types of parking meters, and it is no surprise that the public wants higher
technology equipment and more convenience. However, she believes the city can
address these issues, provide these services themselves and retain significant revenue
streams. She said that ACS is motivated to enter into this agreement because they are
going to profit immensely from the deal. She said that they have promised to create
200 jobs, but County Option Income Tax (COIT) goes to the county of residence, and
there is no assurance that these private-company employees will actually live within
Marion County, unlike if they were City or County employees, where there are residency
requirements. She said that there is no guarantee these will be tax-revenue producing
jobs for the benefit of Marion County residents. She added that ACS has a program to
encourage people to work from home, and this just gives even more encouragement for
those employees not to live within Marion County. She said that in 50 years, the
community will change drastically, and governance needs to be able to change with it.
She said that under this proposal, there are significant penalties for removing meters or
putting meters out of service, yet there is no way to determine future development or
where people will want to be and where parking will be in demand in 50 years. She said
that in looking at the special events list, all of those listed are sports-related. She said
that her constituents are somewhat tired of bending over backwards for sporting events,
when Indianapolis provides many other festivals and events that should not be
relegated to the 6% allowance. Councillor Mansfield added that, currently, the city does
not collect revenue for those elected officials or employees using the parking placards,
but the way this is set up, it looks like the city will have to start paying ACS for those

Rules and Public Policy Committee
August 30, 2010
Page 16
parking privileges. She said that it also looks like the concessionaire has the exclusive
right to collect all parking citation revenue from parking violations. She said that if there
are more than 30% of appeals for parking violations, it looks like the city would have to
pay compensation to the concessionaire. She said that she is not clear, nor does she
think the agreement is clear, with regard to possible commercial advertisements. She
said that she believes it could create visual clutter, and it seems there might be some
first amendment issues and lawsuits because of the picking and choosing regarding the
control of the messages allowed. She said that her biggest concerns are about
removing the Council’s ability to govern and giving up revenues.
Councillor McQuillen asked Councillor Mansfield to explain her concerns about the
creation of 200 jobs, as he does not understand her objections. Councillor Mansfield
said that ACS is a private entity and is not bound by residency requirements as city and
county employees are. Councillor McQuillen said that it would still mean the creation of
jobs in Marion County, and he does not understand how that is a bad thing. Councillor
Mansfield said that COIT is paid to the county of residence, and not the county of
employment, and therefore the city can be short-changed, because they provide all the
resources like police and fire and infrastructure for those workers, but do not receive
any revenue as reimbursement. Chairman Lutz said that maybe the House of
Representatives could do something to change that inequity.
Councillor Gray said that he is disappointed that the administration used an RFQ. He
said that they all know what happened here, and that they had already picked someone
with whom they wanted to enter a contract, and they wasted the time of 15 other
entities. Chairman Lutz said that Councillor Gray cannot legally say that. Councillor
Gray said that he can say that, because it is what happened. He added that they said
they are going to move personnel to DPW, but asked what DPW is going to do with
them, as they have already had some Parks personnel moved over, and the department
cannot continue to absorb these extra positions and salaries. He said that someone is
eventually going to get laid off. Mr. Huber said that there are only five jobs impacted,
and they have worked with Steve Quick, president of the union, to find jobs and they are
confident that they have found positions for these individuals. Councillor Gray said that
the transition of positions from Parks to DPW has not gone well, and talking to Mr.
Quick, Mr. Huber should know that.
Councillor Malone said that as sponsor of the proposal, she wholeheartedly supports
the initiative to bring in much-needed revenue and supply funding for infrastructure
needs that are way past due. She asked who is bearing the cost of the transaction, and
if this is taken out of the $35 million up-front payment or is included in the 2011 or 2012
budget. Mr. Huber said that the fees are paid on contingency for the financial advisors,
and these legal expenses are budgeted. If the deal closes, these advisors will receive a
little over $1 million, and if not, they will receive close to $50,000 for expenses. He said
that they estimate expenses on legal fees to be half a million dollars, and they do not
run up fees they have not budgeted for. He said that they anticipated this, and
budgeted for it.

Councillor Rivera said that Councillor Gray’s allegations about a vendor already having
been chosen before this process begain is very extreme, as this could be viewed as
almost criminal. He asked if Councillor Gray has substantiated evidence that this
process was a farce or unnecessary and was simply a game of “smoke and mirrors.”
Councillor Gray said that he did not say it was a farce, but that the RFQ process could
be viewed as “smoke and mirrors” with a contractor already chosen. He said that he did
not say it happened in this case, but that it could happen. Councillor Rivera thanked
Councillor Gray for the clarification, and said that he wanted to understand his
comments correctly.
Mr. Huber said that this is a significant proposal with a lot of policy issues, and he will be
happy to answer any questions that might arise for Councillors in the coming days and
will do his best to answer all questions. He asked committee members to provide them
with any additional questions or requests through John Cochran, Council liaison for the
Mayor’s Office.
Councillor Sanders stated that she could not get the link for the concession agreement
to work on the website. Mr. Huber said that he will make sure the link is tested and
working.
Chairman Lutz stated that he will have the committee clerk contact committee members
with another date for an additional hearing on this proposal, and Proposal No. 229,
2010 will stay on the table until that meeting.
There being no further business, and upon motion duly made, the Rules and Public
Policy Committee was adjourned at 7:48 p.m.

ADMINISTRATION AND FINANCE COMMITTEE
The Administration and Finance Committee of the City-County Council met on Tuesday, March
20, 2007. Chair Joanne Sanders called the meeting to order at 5:03 p.m. with the following
members present: Paul Bateman, Lynn McWhirter, Jackie Nytes, and Lincoln Plowman. Absent
were Vernon Brown and Lance Langsford. Representing Council staff was Bart Brown, Chief
Financial Officer.
PROPOSAL NO. 100, 2007 - reappoints John Thompson to the City-County Administrative
Board
Chair Sanders said that Mr. Thompson is unable to attend the meeting. Councillor McWhirter
moved, seconded by Councillor Bateman, to “Postpone” Proposal No. 100, 2007 until April 3,
2007. The motion carried by a vote of 5-0.
PROPOSAL NO. 101, 2007 - reappoints Brenda Rising-Moore to the City-County
Administrative Board
Ms. Rising-Moore said that she has served on the Board for approximately six months and it has
been a challenge to get up to speed, but it has also been a wonderful experience. She said that
the Board has gone through a lot with the changes due to the election, which has resulted in
many last minute issues. She said that her only concern is that sometimes there is not enough
time to look over all necessary information, as they try to remain on track. Chair Sanders said
that the Council appreciates when citizens are actively involved in local government and commit
their time, as they realize that it is a volunteer commitment. Chair Sanders asked if the clerk was
aware of Ms. Rising-Moore’s attendance record. The clerk answered in the negative. Ms.
Rising-Moore answered that she has missed one meeting due to a pre-planned family vacation.
Councillor Nytes asked Ms. Rising-Moore to give a brief description of the responsibilities of the
Administrative Board. Ms. Rising-Moore said that the Board usually receives a packet of issues
to research and formulate decisions. Councillor Nytes asked if the types of things that come
before the Board are contracts, proposals, and other issues from agencies that do not have
another governing board. Ms. Rising-Moore answered in the affirmative. Chair Sanders said
that she understands how Ms. Rising-Moore can be concerned about trying to come up to speed
with some information that could be two to three years old, as the Administrative and Finance
Committee reflects on some of the items relative to contract negotiations for the Sheriff’s
Department, and now, Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department (IMPD).
Councillor Nytes moved, seconded by Councillor McWhirter, to forward Proposal No. 101, 2007
to the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried by a vote of 5-0.
PROPOSAL NO. 102, 2007 - authorizes the issuance of up to $75 million in refunding bonds
to generate savings and provide funds for capital projects
Barbara Lawrence, Executive Director, Indianapolis Bond Bank, said that the Bond Bank would
like to present and seek approval for Refunding Bonds of 2007, Series D. She introduced Brad
Hartz, Senior Project Manager, Bond Bank. She said that generally she comes before the

Administration and Finance Committee
March 20, 2007
Page 3
Committee to request bonds for new things, but currently she is here to ask for authorization to
issue bonds that will save the City money and will float back to its qualified entities and the
departments that originally benefited from the bond issue. She said as the Bond Bank goes
through all of its outstanding issues, team members are being sought to help assess the benefit or
cost of doing the refunding. In some instances it results in a small savings amount, but in this
case, it is a substantial amount, depending on the market conditions. She said that it could range
anywhere from $2.7 million to $3.4 million. Ms. Lawrence distributed a handout (Exhibit A)
that outlined their presentation, which included the following key points:
•

2007 Bond Refunding – Overview given by Ms. Lawrence
o Refunding occurs primarily because the interest rate, environment, and market
conditions differ substantially from when the bonds were originally issued.
o Current low interest rate environment presents an excellent opportunity for the
Indianapolis Bond Bank to lock in significant savings through a current refunding
transaction of the 1998A Bonds.
o The original issue was 1993 “Building Better Neighborhoods” Bonds for projects
in the:
 Sanitary District
 Parks Department
 Flood Control District
 Metro Thoroughfare District
o In 1998, the Bond Bank did an advance refunding of a portion of the 1993 Bonds.
o It is now economically advantageous to do a current refunding of the 1998A
Bonds to generate savings.
Structure of Proposed Refunding given by Mr. Hartz
o The Indianapolis Bond Bank would like to do a current refunding of certain
maturities of the 1998A Bond Bank Bonds that can be executed now, for forward
delivery, or any time until the due date in February 1, 2008.
o The Bond Bank anticipates issuing $69.055 million to refund approximately
$68.205 million of the 2014-2018 maturities of the outstanding 1998A Bond Bank
Bonds.
o Debt service for the 2007 refunding transaction will match, as closely as possible,
the existing debt service for the 1998A Bond Bank Bonds being refunded.
Qualified Entities – Projects given by Mr. Hartz
o Flood Control District Uses:
 Sanitary and Flood Improvements to reduce flooding
 Improvements to Storm Sewer Drainage to provide flood control
 Regional Drainage and Flood Control Improvements
 Separation and Renovation of the Sewer System
o Metropolitan Thoroughfare District Uses:
 Bridge Rehabilitations, Improvements, and Replacements
 Street reconstructions and widening
 Intersection improvements
 Traffic Control projects
o Park District Uses:
 Rehabilitations and improvements to Municipal Parks
 Renovations to city swimming pools

 Assessments and improvements to various pump stations
 New Sanitary sewers and extensions
2007 Bond Refunding – Analysis given by Mr. Hartz
o Based on February 12, 2007, market conditions reflect a savings of approximately
$2.7 million in net present value (NPV) or 3.98% refunded par.
 Total interest cost = 4.13%
 Net interest cost = 4.27%
 All-in total interest cost = 4.27%
 Delivery date of 11/6/2007
o Total Qualified Entities Savings = $2.7 million
 Flood Control District - $225,000
 Metropolitan Thoroughfare District - $866,000
 Park District - $483,000
 Sanitary District - $1,135,000
2007 Bond Refunding – Schedule given by Ms. Lawrence

[Clerk’s note: A full copy of Exhibit A is on file in the Council Office with the original
set of minutes.]

Chair Sanders asked for an explanation of the total interest cost, the net interest cost, and the allin interest cost as described in the analysis (shown on page 7 of Exhibit A). Diana Hamilton,
Financial Advisor to Bond Bank and Sycamore Advisors, LLC President, said that the all-in
interest cost includes everything over and above the actual interest expense such as rating, cost of
issuance, legal expenses, bond insurance, and some run analysis.
Councillor Bateman asked why the $2.7 million savings would not go back into the General
Fund. Ms. Lawrence said that City-issued bonds are for specific purposes; therefore, any
proceeds generated from a refunding must be used for the same issues and projects. She said that
the amount going back to each entity is based on the amount that is outstanding.

Administration and Finance Committee
March 20, 2007

Councillor McWhirter asked if the $2.7 million savings will later cost the City more. Ms.
Lawrence answered in the negative. She said that amount is the net present value amount which
the City would receive up front.
Councillor McWhirter said that the distribution will be received in November of 2007, which is
after the budget is set for 2008. She asked if the proceeds have to be spent on projects in the
qualified entities or are simply put back into the funds of those entities. Ms. Lawrence answered
that the money can go to either the funds or the projects. Councillor McWhirter asked if those
amounts will be counted in the 2008 budget.
Council Chief Financial Officer, Bart Brown asked if the bonds are General Obligation (GO)
Bonds. Ms. Lawrence answered in the affirmative. Mr. Brown asked if the savings is calculated
interest savings or if the Bond Bank will actually receive cash out to deposit into the debt service
accounts of the qualified entities. Ms. Lawrence answered that the savings will be received as
cash up front and redistributed to the qualified entities as Bond Proceeds, and their debt service
will remain the same. Mr. Brown asked what will happen with the proceeds. Ms. Lawrence
answered that the proceeds will either be expended for projects or put back into the entities’ fund
balances. Mr. Brown asked if there is an appropriation request involved with the proposal. Ms.
Lawrence answered in the negative, as the authorization is determined by the Council, and the
appropriation will be determined at the board level. Mr. Brown said that once a bond is issued,
the appropriation comes with the bond issue, and this money will be put into the Bond Fund and
may possibly be used for projects. He asked if another option might have been to reduce debt
service instead of taking the proceeds. Ms. Lawrence answered in the affirmative. Mr. Brown
said that this option could reduce property taxes, by transferring some of the bond proceeds to
debt service. Therefore, the money may or may not be used for the 2008 budget, depending on
which option the Council and the City decide upon. Ms. Lawrence said that it was determined
through discussions with the Department of Public Works and the Parks Department that it
would be beneficial to have the revenues for projects to meet their ongoing capital needs.
Councillor McWhirter asked what the current bond rating is for the City. Ms. Lawrence said that
the City’s rating is still good and bonds are continuing to be issued, but one of the challenges is
the unfunded pension obligation. She said that although it was not popular to issue $100 million
in Pension Obligation Bonds at the time, rating agencies view it as an important, positive step
and they like to see that the City is taking steps to solve the problem.
Councillor Nytes said that she supports putting the proceeds back to work for the qualified
entities, because there are lists of things that constituents would like done in their neighborhoods
and finding resources to handle the requests is difficult. She said that the benefit to using the
proceeds to pay down the debt would be miniscule to an individual taxpayer and more results
will be seen in the completion of projects. Councillor Nytes said that it is helpful to the City
when refunding is found in this fashion. She asked if there are other opportunities such as this.
Ms. Lawrence answered that there is one other opportunity that will come before the Committee,
and she stated that any savings amount that is discussed with the Committee is savings after
expenses. She said that the Bond Bank is being vigilant in examining all opportunities, as
market conditions change.

Chair Sanders said that she would be very leery of using anticipated funds with such a volatile
market in terms of creating the 2008 budget. She said that she feels that the funds should be
dealt with when they are received.
Councillor Bateman moved, seconded by Councillor Nytes, to forward Proposal No. 102, 2007
to the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried by a vote of 5-0.
Update on the Tax Management Associates (TMA) contract
Chair Sanders said that Mr. Brown has the responsibility to keep the Council informed of what is
going on financially at the city and county level, relative to the budget. Mr. Brown said that the
Council was first involved in the TMA issue when the Assessors entered into a contract in 2004
and later realized that the means was not available to pay the contractor. He said that he believes
that there are statutes that state that contractors may be paid directly out of funds collected by
audits. Mr. Brown said that when the Assessors met with the Treasurer and the Auditor, it was
determined that the best way to pay the contractor was to set up a fund, which can only be done
through the Council. He said that the reasons to outsource were because the Assessors did not
have the qualified people available to perform the audits and there was also a claim that a state
statute established that only the State does audits over $150,000. Mr. Brown said that TMA was
chosen for the following reasons:
1) They had a track record of receiving a three-to-one or a four-to-one ratio, which
would result in $3 million being received by the local units of government for every $4
million collected.
2) They would never collect more than what they found.
3) They could do all the townships at the same time.
4) No other company in Indiana could do this type of work.
Mr. Brown said that in June, 2006, some results were seen, and a claim was made that the
transactions has not cost taxpayers any money. However, that was not true, because it cost
money to pay TMA, but they were also bringing in money. He said that the June 2006 estimate
was that $15 million to $18 million would be collected, as TMA could get to the companies that
were suspected of under-reporting. Chair Sanders said that Mr. Brown’s comments reflect the
history of statements made at previous Administration and Finance Committee meetings, as
people presented early results. She said that she recalls the statements made at the meetings, but
she does not recall receiving much documentation summarizing cost versus collections. Mr.
Brown said that requests were made for the documentation and promises were made to honor the
requests, but he has no record of any documentation to meet those requests.
Mike Rodman, Marion County Treasurer, said that he believes that he and Paul Ricketts, former
Lawrence Township Assessor, appeared before the Committee last fall with figures that were not
in balance. He said that the two of them were to re-appear before the Committee; however, Mr.
Ricketts is no longer the Lawrence Township Assessor. Mr. Rodman said that the only figures
that he has are the ones from the Treasurer’s Office, and he distributed a handout (Exhibit B).
[Clerk’s note: A full copy of Exhibit B is on file in the Council Office with the original set of
minutes.]

Administration and Finance Committee

Cindy Land, Deputy Administrator, Treasurer’s Office, said that the last page of Exhibit B
represents the total taxes collected in 2005 and 2006 by township and the Property Tax
Replacement Credit (PTRC) that the Treasurer billed the State in order to have a gross tax
collection. She said that per the contract, TMA was entitled to a gross tax distribution, which is
the net tax with the PTRC. Ms. Land said that over $8 million of taxes were collected in 2005
and 2006, and the PTRC collected from the State was $1.5 million. Therefore, the total taxes
available are $10.1 million. Ms. Land said that TMA invoices were provided to the township
assessors, and the Treasurer’s Office would receive invoices from the assessors by signature or
by e-mail indicating which ones were authorized for payment. She said that the last page of
Exhibit B reflects that invoices totaled $7.1 million and TMA was paid $6.2 million, which
leaves a balance of approximately $862, 000.
Councillor McWhirter asked if the total taxes that were collected in 2005 and 2006 were
reflective of only those collected by TMA. Ms. Land answered in the affirmative. She said that
there are unpaid balances to TMA, but money was paid to the individual units. She explained
that TMA was only paid based on their invoice amount or what the Treasurer’s Office had
available per cycle. Ms. Land said that the ordinance indicates that all monies go into the fund
and are to be paid out every June and December. She said whatever is not paid to TMA, goes to
the individual units, which totaled $3.8 million. Ms. Land said, per the original contract and City
Legal, penalties and interest were not to be included in payments to TMA; therefore, the units
received $2.3 million in penalty and interest for a total received of $6.2 million.
Ms. Land said, in addition, the State indicated that if TMA does discovery and uncovers that
there should be an increase in assessed value (AV), the treasurers will increase those amounts.
However, if it is discovered that over-reporting has been done, those cases are entitled to refunds.
She said that there was $2 million of discovery refunds, which comes out of money that will be
distributed to the units of government. Therefore, the net benefit to units is $4.2 million.
Mr. Rodman said that page 1 of Exhibit B is broken up into townships, illustrating the total
invoices for each township, the amount paid to TMA, the outstanding amount still owed to TMA,
and unknown amounts that are unbilled. Mr. Rodman said that it is his understanding that TMA
has not yet sent in all of their invoices, but he is not sure of the dollar amount of those invoices.
Ms. Land said that she believes that TMA has only billed for the items that have provided an
increase in billing. She said that the concern is that if the Treasurer’s Office does not collect
enough money, TMA is still entitled to the amount that is owed to them, and that becomes a
county liability. Chair Sanders said this is why the Councillors became concerned, because of
the condition of the County General Fund. She said that she understands that from the
Assessors’ perspective, this arrangement may look good if it is working in their particular
township. However, everyone should be aware of the holistic view of its impact on Marion
County.
Councillor Nytes asked how the $862,000 owed to TMA is concluded as a county responsibility,
when the contract was not signed by the Council or by County-elected Officials, but was instead
signed by individual Township Assessors. Ms. Land said that it was a contract of which the
content was approved by City Legal, and the Assessors are part of the county government. She
said that their budgets are funded by the General Fund and, therefore, if sued, the money would
come from the General Fund.

Councillor Plowman asked if there are any townships to which the agreement is unprofitable.
Mr. Rodman said that page 2 of Exhibit B shows the percent of tax dollars that are going to each
of the units. He said that although Washington Township’s percentage reflects 0%, there was
approximately $600 paid to that unit. As a result, every township received some tax dollars.
Councillor McWhirter asked if the increases will be repetitive for future years if the businesses
stay in the townships, as it is now recognized that they were previously below value. Ms. Land
answered in the affirmative. Mr. Rodman said that the problem will be indetermining who will
check to ensure that the self-assessments are being done. He said that the question is if an
outside vendor is needed to do the audits, since the Townships Assessors were not able.
Councillor Nytes said that although the increases will be repetitive, the refunds will also be
repetitive in the future. She asked if the gain is a multi-year gain or a yearly gain. Mr. Rodman
answered that it is a multi-year gain. Mr. Brown said that page 2 of Exhibit B reflects a total of
38% distributed to the units, but it should have been 75%, based upon the information that the
Council was given. He said with regard to contract performance, the question should be why the
units did not receive the 75%.
Councillor McWhirter asked if the Township Assessors have a spokesman. Chair Sanders asked
if the presentation can be completed before hearing from the assessors. Councillor McWhirter
answered in the affirmative.
Mr. Rodman said that page 3 of Exhibit B summarizes that 38% was the net tax to the units, and
62% was paid to TMA, which resulted in TMA receiving $.62 for every dollar collected.
Councillor McWhirter asked of the overall taxes collected, what percentage is attributed to the
refund. Ms. Land answered that she is unsure. Councillor McWhirter asked what the total
amount of taxes collected overall is. Mr. Rodman answered that overall taxes collected are $1
billion. Chair Sanders asked if the refund amount shown in Exhibit B is for all taxes that have
been collected. Ms. Land answered in the negative and said that those refund amounts are only
reflective of what has been done by TMA. She said that the Treasurer’s Office has recently
completed $15 million of refunds from December 1, 2006 to the present, and there are more to
be done.
Councillor Plowman asked if the 75% distribution to the units was in writing. Ms. Land
answered in the negative. Councillor Plowman asked if the City is still ahead. Mr. Rodman
answered in the affirmative, but stated that there is still the question of the amount of unbilled
invoices. Chair Sanders said that she believes that it is relative to the cost of collecting the
amount received. She said, for example, page 3 of Exhibit B reflects that Washington Township
received approximately $617, but the cost to collect that amount was slightly over $707,000.
Councillor Plowman asked if there is a way that the City can handle this process in the future or
ensure that a more solid contract is negotiated. Mr. Brown said that another issue with the
process is that, in dealing with taxpayer money, the City should be aware as to whether the
increases were based upon a fair price. Unfortunately, there is no way to track the information.
Ms. Land said that she understands the Assessors’ perspective on the ability to have the audits
done, but she believes that the charge for the service was too high. She said that TMA receives

Administration and Finance Committee
March 20, 2007
Page 9
between $700,000 and $10,000 per audit, whereas, the City could possibly hire accountants
locally for each township and pay them a salary, including fringes and benefits, and still not total
the amount that TMA is charging.
Mr. Rodman said that he is very concerned that TMA has shared figures that do not correspond
to the Treasurer’s figures, and he does not know how to resolve that. Councillor McWhirter
commented that no more payments should be forwarded to TMA until the books are reconciled.
Chair Sanders said that she agrees with Councillor McWhirter; however, there is a possible
liability because a contract has been signed. Chair Sanders said that there needs to be a solution
to the process that appeases everyone and determines what the efficiencies are for reporting and
settling.
Councillor Nytes asked why there are huge differences in the percentage amount paid to each
unit. Ms. Land said that she does not believe that there is enough information available to make
the determination, but she believes that it is based on the amount of taxes collected in each
township.
Councillor McWhirter asked if the ordinance can be amended to state that nothing is disbursed
until all outstanding balances are paid. She asked if that change will eliminate the balance owed
to TMA, since this is the last year of their contract. Ms. Land said that there is no guarantee that
it can be eliminated, because there are so many unknowns. Councillor Nytes said that may put
the County back into a situation in which taxpayers from one individual township pay the fees to
have another township’s assessments updated, which was one of the principles that the City was
trying to avoid.
Councillor Nytes asked if there is a coordinator among the Township Assessors for the contract.
Joline Ohmart, Washington Township Assessor and President, Marion County Township
Assessors, answered in the negative. She stated that everything has been a joint effort by the
Assessors. Councillor Nytes asked if each township worked individually with TMA for their
township. Ms. Ohmart answered in the affirmative. Councillor Nytes asked if the Assessors
know how many more files need to be processed. Ms. Ohmart answered that Washington
Township has approximately 400, but she is unaware as to the amount of the other townships.
She said that information can be made available to the Committee. Councillor Nytes asked if
any of the townships know how much TMA is still owed for their particular township. Ms.
Ohmart said that the Assessors are unsure of the amount at this time.
Chair Sanders asked if the formula that the Assessors used to determine which files were turned
over to TMA can be provided to the Committee. Ms. Ohmart answered that all files over
$50,000 were given to TMA. Chair Sanders asked if the Assessors can provide the Committee
with a list of the individual files that were turned over to TMA. Ms. Ohmart answered in the
affirmative.
Councillor McWhirter asked why a three-to-one payout was anticipated and why that did not
happen. Ms. Ohmart said that TMA’s history reflected a three-to-one payback, and that is what
the Assessors initially based the contract on. Councillor McWhirter asked if the Assessors are
fairly satisfied with the audit and what they anticipate doing in the future. Ms. Ohmart said that
it has not been discussed as a group, but they feel that auditing is a necessity. However, the

Administration and Finance Committee
March 20, 2007
Page 10
Assessors will have to work out the methodology. Ms. Ohmart said that there is also $3.2
million in penalties and interest that have not been included in the figures given to the
Committee; therefore, the overall percentage will be slightly raised. Chair Sanders said that she
is not sure that those figures can be included in the overall percentage. Ms. Ohmart said that it is
money that will be received by the townships. She said that there are also some large amounts
that are not yet on the books.
Councillor McWhirter asked if the Assessors anticipate that all of the auditing will be completed
by the end of the contract, which is 2007, and how long after do they anticipate knowing the end
results. Ms. Ohmart said that the Assessors have no control over that. Ms. Land said that
TMA’s bill will be paid in January, 2008, but the Treasurer will not be aware of any additional
values that Assessors possess.
Greg Bowes, Marion County Assessor, said that the contract does not have an expiration date, as
it reads that it will continue on a month-to-month basis until the Assessors give a written 30-day
notice to cancel. However, he said that the ordinance has an expiration date of 2007. Mr. Bowes
said also, as a part of the termination clause, TMA is allowed to complete any audit that they
have been assigned, and invoice for that audit once completed. He said that TMA can only audit
as assigned by the Assessors; therefore, the Assessors can stop sending audits without trouble.
Mr. Bowes said that in speaking with TMA, he was told that approximately 1,700 audits have
been assigned to the company and are all in various stages of completion. In response to
Councillor McWhirter’s question about benefits after the audits, Mr. Bowes said that personal
property tax returns that are being audited are self-disclosed by the taxpayer. Therefore, there is
no way of knowing if the information is accurate, unless an audit is completed. Because of this,
there is no guarantee that additional revenue will be received each year. Ms. Land said that
audits have been on Schedule A and Schedule B, and Schedule B for businesses is for inventory.
She said that the Schedule B is going away, effective this year; therefore, some of the realization
may not be realization in future years.
Chair Sanders said that she does not believe that the information given is anything that anyone
could have predicted, but it raises concerns about how to proceed, how to pay unfunded
balances, and what to do to improve the process. She suggested that maybe an audit can be
performed on the auditors.
Councillor Nytes said that it concerns her that it will not be documented in any budget or
published financial report that the cost of auditing personal property tax returns for this time
period was $7 million, because it was paid off the top. She said that assessments cost money,
and the City’s challenge should be to find the most efficient and cost-effective way to perform
assessments. She said that there are still a lot of unanswered questions, and the potential liability
is unknown. She said that she would like to ask the President of the Council to ask that the
Assessors cease giving TMA any more files for a time period, during which time a review of the
process and the procedures involved with the contract can be conducted.
Councillor Nytes moved, seconded by Councillor Bateman, to request that the President of the
Council allow the Council to conduct a formal review by an objective third-party of this process
to date, the reconciliation issue, and projections as to where the County is likely to end up before
the end of the contract this year.

Councillor McWhirter said that she is concerned that there is no timeframe on the motion.
Councillor Nytes asked to amend the motion to have the review completed by June 1.
Councillor Plowman asked Ms. Ohmart how the Assessors feel about a review being done on
TMA. Ms. Ohmart said that she understands that the Committee feels that a review is
appropriate. Councillor McWhirter asked what type of review is being sought. Mr. Rodman
said that he would like for a review/audit to be done to examine the Treasurer’s figures and
TMA’s figures to ensure that everything is reconciled. Mr. Rodman said that the Treasurer’s
Office books are public record, and it should not take much time for a review or an audit to be
done on them. Ms. Land said that the Treasurer’s 2005 books have already been audited as a
county-wide audit; therefore, they will simply need to be compared to TMA’s 2005 books. Mr.
Brown said that if it is a contract review, it is typical to break the contract down into
deliverables, review all the invoices, and take samples to ensure that they have done the work for
which they have been. Councillor McWhirter asked if a review is being done to see if TMA has
done their job or if too much money has been paid to them. Mr. Brown answered that both of the
issues will be examined. Mr. Rodman said that he would like to see some of the undefined
things calculated.
Becky Williams, Franklin Township Assessor, said that six of the Assessors have petitioned the
State Board of Accounts to audit the Fund. She said that she was not aware of the figures, but
she has spoken with TMA, and they say they have found over $500 million in assessed valuation.
She said that should amount to a lot of taxes. She said that if the Assessors were aware of the
issues, they could have possibly gotten the answers from TMA. She said that she was told that
no more payments were to be sent to TMA, but the reasons were not disclosed. Ms. Williams
said that TMA has performed audits all over the country, and to her knowledge, Marion County
is the only county that has had any major problems. She said that the refunds were not a
consideration in the beginning, but the State later informed them of the process of overpaid
discoveries. Ms. Williams said that one of the reasons TMA was chosen is because the auditing
may sometimes require travel out of the state to a company’s headquarters. She said that she
does not believe that the County will do that.
Ms. Ohmart said that she does not believe that the review should be done to determine if TMA is
doing a good job, but to determine the reconciliation of the finances.
Councillor Nytes said that the Committee tried to retrieve accurate numbers associated with this
contract and process last fall, but it was not resolved. She said that over the winter, the Council
began to hear issues when it was time to send bills, which caused concern. Through discussion
with some of the townships, it was discovered that there is a liability and interest is paid on it.
She said that caused more concern. Chair Sanders said that the statements that Mr. Brown gave
were from observations and questions at previous Administration and Finance Committee
meetings since 2005. She said that Assessors have been represented at some of those meetings
giving reports on the contract and the Committee asked for reports in Spring of 2005, in Fall of
2005, in Spring of 2006, and in Fall of 2006, and the information is still not available.
Councillor McWhirter asked if the motion carries, is it able to begin at any time and must it be
completed by June 1. Chair Sanders said that it should be completed no later than June 1, but
she would prefer that it be completed prior to that time. Councillor McWhirter asked who would

Administration and Finance Committee
March 20, 2007
Page 12
perform the review. Chair Sanders said that she believes that the Council will hire an outside
consultant to receive an independent view, who has experience in tax assessment and extensive
credibility.
Councillor Nytes moved, seconded by Councillor Bateman, to respectfully request that the
Assessors suspend the release of files to TMA for audit, and that the Chair be authorized to ask
the President of the Council for a review of this process, to be completed no later than June 1.
The motion carried by a vote of 5-0.
Councillor Plowman asked if the Council has the authority to mandate that the Assessors stop
payment. Councillor Nytes said that she is unsure, since the Assessors signed the contract, but
the review can still be done.
With no further business pending, and upon motion duly made, the Administration and Finance
Committee of the City-County Council was adjourned at 6:45 p.m.
Respectfully submitted,
Joanne Sanders, Chair
Administration and Finance Committee

PUBLIC SAFETY AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE COMMITTEE
The Public Safety and Criminal Justice Committee of the City-County Council met on
Wednesday, August 24, 2005. Chairwoman Mary Moriarty Adams called the meeting to order at
6:09 p.m. with the following members present: Greg Bowes, Vernon Brown, Sherron Franklin,
Lynn McWhirter, William Oliver, Lincoln Plowman and Scott Schneider. Also present was Bart
Brown, the Council’s Chief Financial Officer.
Chair Moriarty Adams apologized for the late start of the meeting due to a prior meeting and asked
for the Committee’s approval to alter the order of the meeting to allow the County Coroner to
present first. There were no objections.
County Coroner
Dr. Kenneth Ackles, Marion County Coroner, said that there have been a few changes since his
election which include no longer working with the Sheriff for vehicles and gasoline, and that
Indiana University (IU) will no longer perform autopsies for the department after September 30th.
IU was planning to eliminate the entire staff, but the Coroner’s Office would like to have the staff
work for them instead of having to recruit new people. Dr. Ackles said that the idea of having IU’s
staff work with the Coroner’s Office has worked well so far instead of having to recruit people at
this time. He said that mostly all the staff is interested except for one; therefore, the transition is
going well. With a transition of this nature, there is a monetary difference, which is the reason for
coming before the Committee.
John Linehan, Chief Deputy Coroner, read a typed statement included in Exhibit A of the
Coroner’s presentation. [Clerk’s note: A full printout of Exhibit A is on file in the Council Office
with the original set of minutes.] Mr. Linehan’s discussion included:
o An overview of the Marion County Coroner’s Office’s responsibilities.
o A list of the Coroner’s staff and hours of operation.
o Information on present autopsy procedures that will be discontinuing on October 1,
2005, and the impact the discontinuation will have on the Coroner’s Office.
o Current budget expenditures
o Information on fleet services
o Supporting information on the need and reason for conducting autopsies.
Also included in Exhibit A are:
o A copy of the Marion County 2006 Proposed Budget.
o Documentation of costs for monthly supplies and outside services provided by IU
Pathology last year.
o Budget documents of Midwest cities comparable in size to Indianapolis including
Cincinnati, St. Louis, and Louisville.
Mr. Linehan explained that IU has conducted autopsies for the Marion County Coroner’s Office
for the past 12 years, but will no longer support a Forensic Science Division at the University. The
University gave the Coroner’s Office a 60 day notice that they will no longer perform autopsy
services. The last time the Coroner’s Office was trying to find a Forensic Pathologist, it took seven

Public Safety and Criminal Justice Committee
August 24, 2005
Page 2
months, and that one was recruited from in town. If it is necessary to recruit from another city, 60
days is not enough time. The Coroner’s Office has a proposal that was presented by members of
IU Forensic Pathology to continue the service, but due to the elimination of reduced costs for
hospital supplies, linen services, and hazardous waste services, the Coroner’s Office would be
faced with paying an additional $40,000 per month to support the service with IU. He said that
there are no other Forensic Pathologists in town; therefore, leaving no option to go elsewhere. He
said that the Coroner’s Office could try to get private autopsies done, but they only perform
forensic autopsies, and the most inexpensive private autopsy would cost about $3,500 plus
additional costs. IU was providing those services in the past for about $700 - $800. With the new
service, it would cost about $1,000 each, which is still well below $3,500.
Mr. Linehan stated that he has looked over the numbers, and the Coroner’s Office has the bare
minimum of staffing. He said that of the 15 appropriate Full Time Equivalent (FTE) positions, the
Coroner’s Office only has 13, but the additional has to be saved for the part time staff. He said the
operational supplies reflect the actual cost of performing an autopsy and the supplies to perform
the autopsy based on a 12-month period. He said that the Coroner’s Office conforms to alternative
ways to reduce spending. For example, buying paper directly from an office supply store as
opposed to using the paper that Xerox offers because of a better price and being able to purchase
vehicles elsewhere at a lower price than what the Sheriff’s Office offers. He said that although
these things are done, there is not much room to reduce their budget or staff. They are also looking
for other ways to generate more consumer revenue, but have not yet noticed the benefits of current
efforts returned to the department in the way of additional funding. He asked that the Committee
look over the information that he has provided and consider the need of the Coroner’s Office.
Dr. Ackles mentioned that the suicide rate in Marion County unfortunately is up by about 20%,
which increases the budget in order to perform effectively. Mr. Linehan added that there were
three triple homicides this year; one homicide resulted in the Coroner’s office spending one month
on the scene and absorbing 100 percent of costs of excavating three bodies out of a 14-inch slab of
cement, which cost $50,000. With that, the Coroner’s Office is still under budget for the year due
to cut-backs and holding off on hiring staff as long as possible. As part of these cut-backs, the
Coroner’s Office has an answering machine that answers calls about 50% of the time, which is
unacceptable for a city of our size; did not buy police radios this year, therefore some of the
deputies have no way of communicating with the Police Department; did not purchase new
computers; and is sharing vehicles to stay under budget. The 24 hour shifts are stressful for the
employees, and there is a need to increase staff.
Councillor McWhirter asked how many more employees the Coroner’s budget calls for. Mr.
Linehan said they functionally have 13 FTEs, but on paper it shows 15, but the funding that is
represented by the additional 2 positions is needed to cover for time taken off by a Deputy.
Councillor McWhirter asked if the Coroner is asking for additional employees. Mr. Linehan
answered that the Coroner’s Office needs to absorb more employees, but part of that is through
Indiana University. He said that the office would be funding 15 FTEs, which is what they have
been appropriated, but have not funded in the past. The Coroner’s Office was given additional

Public Safety and Criminal Justice Committee
August 24, 2005
Page 3
FTEs last year, but no money was given to pay for those positions, and that is what is needed now.
Councillor McWhirter asked about the $375,000 rent and $30,000 for the copier that the Coroner’s
Office has in its budget. Mr. Linehan said that the rent is a fixed rate because they are leasing the
building on a 10-year lease, and the $30,000 is for leasing machines that was also through a lease
agreement from the prior administration. Councillor McWhirter asked if the $1.3 million for
contractual services is for the proposal from IU. Mr. Linehan said they already had a contractual
agreement for close to $800,000 and the additional $500,000 would be for the new contractual
agreement with the IU Services Group. Councillor McWhirter asked if the Coroner’s Office has
checked to see if it would be more inexpensive to hire people to do the job. Mr. Linehan answered
in the affirmative and said that it would be more expensive to get private services than what the
Coroner’s Office would pay to IU. He said the Coroner’s Office is required to have a board
certified forensic pathologist perform the autopsies and cannot hire a general pathologist.
Dr. Ackles added that the Coroner’s Office is also under a restraint of only a couple months’ notice
from IU.
Councillor McWhirter asked Bob Clifford, Controller, if he was aware that there were changes
with IU when the Coroner’s budget was being coordinated and if changes can be made to
accommodate the needs of the Coroner’s Office due to those changes. Mr. Clifford said that when
he met with Dr. Ackles and Mr. Linehan, they were not yet aware of the problems with the IU
contract. He said that the Controller’s Office was informed by the Mayor’s Office that IU had not
been paid since January of 2005 under contract, due to the signed contract not being sent to the
County. After this discovery, Mr. Clifford was told in mid-July that IU did not like the terms of
the contract and was going to get out of the contract. Tonight is the first that he has heard about
the actual changes that IU has made. He said that he will talk with Mr. Linehan to see how far he
can make it on the current budget and thinks there will have to be a reexamination based on the
final conclusion with the pathologist. Mr. Linehan said that some of the information that he has
was just given to him this afternoon; therefore, he has not had a chance to discuss the changes with
Mr. Clifford.
Councillor Bowes asked if the total budget amount of $2.8 million on the last page of Exhibit A is
reflecting that the Coroner’s Office is asking for an additional $1 million over the budgeted amount
of $1.8 million that the Controller’s Office has allotted. Mr. Linehan said that the $2.8 milliion
reflects the original amount requested by the Coroner’s Office. Councillor Bowes asked what
specific items account for the $1 million difference. Mr. Linehan answered that $360,000 is for
operational supplies, which were previously supplied by IU; a little more than $500,000 for
contractual services, due to IU’s program change; and a few other supplies. Councillor Bowes
asked if the Coroner’s Office is trying to recover the $77,000 that was reduced from the 2005
budget. Mr. Linehan answered in the affirmative.
Councillor Franklin asked why the Sheriff’s Office discontinued its help with vehicles and
maintenance. Mr. Linehan said that the Sheriff’s Office stopped everything and that he does not
think that the Sheriff had money in its budget to continue supplying the help. Councillor Franklin
asked if IU is discontinuing its Forensic program or if they simply want out of the contract with the

Public Safety and Criminal Justice Committee
August 24, 2005
Page 4
Coroner’s Office. Mr. Linehan answered that IU is discontinuing its support of the entire Forensic
Pathology School. Councillor Franklin asked if the Coroner’s Office would have to set up a new
facility to support hiring a new Forensic Pathologist. Mr. Linehan answered that the facility is in
the Coroner’s building, but the equipment belongs to IU. He said the Coroner’s Office is working
to negotiate a price to buy the equipment since IU will no longer need the items. One of the
options of the Coroner’s Office is to start from scratch and hire all new employees. However, IU
will fire all their current employees but one, effective October 1st. Those employees are willing to
come together as a group and take over the contract, with the task of only having to hire a Forensic
Pathologist. Mr. Linehan said that he is also working with Clarian Hospital to get a break on some
services in exchange for allowing nursing and paramedic students to come through the facility for
autopsy experience by either charging a fee to generate additional revenue or as an exchange for
services. Councillor Franklin asked if there will only be one Forensic Pathologist to work on all
the bodies that come in. Mr. Linehan answered that there is one primary and one back-up on duty
24 hours a day. There is also a third person that rotates with the other two on a weekly basis;
therefore, each person will work two weeks and be off one week.
Councillor Bowes asked how the approximate 2,000 death cases that the Coroner has worked on to
date this year compares to years past. Mr. Linehan said that it has been fairly steady for the past
several years. He said 4,000 cases were looked at last year, with 1,356 autopsies or examinations
conducted, and the Coroner’s Office is expected to do the same this year. The difference may be in
the cause of the cases, whether homicide, accident, or suicide.
Mr. Brown commented in regard to Mr. Linehan’s statement of saving money by purchasing copy
paper from an office supply store; that the difference is that Xerox offers a package that includes
the copy paper and the amount the departments are charged to copy. He also asked if the vehicles
that Mr. Linehan stated that he could purchase for a lower price are used or brand new vehicles.
Mr. Linehan answered that the vehicles they were able to purchase were new vehicles that were
two years old and still on the lot that were not able to be sold. Some were demos.
Councillor Oliver asked if a fee can be charged on the autopsies. Mr. Linehan said only if a person
is injured and dies in another county and is transferred to Marion County; that other county can be
and is charged approximately $2,000 for the autopsy. Otherwise, the Coroner is required by law to
do Forensic autopsies and cannot charge for the service. Councillor Oliver asked how Marion
County’s fees compare to other cities. Mr. Linehan said that Marion County operates at 60% of
the budget of the cities included in Exhibit A.
Chair Moriarty Adams asked Mr. Clifford or Jeff Seidenstein, Budget Manager Controller’s
Office, if they had anything further to add. Mr. Clifford said that he will sit down with the
Coroner’s Office to figure out what can be done with the money that the City has. Chair Moriarty
Adams asked if this will be between now and the final review. Mr. Clifford answered in the
affirmative.

Mr. Seidenstein said that he placed a handout (Exhibit B) at each seat for the Councillors that
relates to the amendment of the revised budget for the Prosecutor’s Office.
[Clerk’s note: A full printout of Exhibit B is on file in the Council Office with the original set of
minutes.]
Carl Brizzi, Marion County Prosecutor, said that the Criminal Justice System is in need of some
big fixes, which includes the addition of more jail beds and additional officers on the streets,
especially for the Marion County Sheriff. He said that steps are being taken tonight towards
incremental improvements in terms of improving the Criminal Justice System situations. Mr.
Brizzi gave a presentation which included the following highlights:
o The baseline budget that was submitted to the Controller for the County General,
Deferral, and Diversion funds.
o The recommendation from the Criminal Justice Commission of an additional $2.7
million.
o The plans for the County Option Income Tax (COIT) money, which includes
• salary increase for Deputy Prosecutors
• raising minimum starting salary for prosecutors
• adding 17 additional prosecutors
• supplying six additional prosecutors in the six major felony courts
• adding five lawyers for the new major felony court
• adding seven additional support staff positions
• adding a drug court prosecutor
o The average caseload of the Deputy Prosecutors.
Several months ago, the Prosecutor’s Office created a homicide unit of the
most experienced lawyers in the office trying murder cases and the
remainder of the lawyers trying B & C Felony cases and second chairing
murder trials. The additional prosecutors will allow more help for homicide
prosecutors.
o The reason for adding a prosecutor to drug court (Court 20)
• The number of filings is increasing.
• Marion County is responsible for 55% of the Department of
Corrections (DOC) population.
• Some of the people being sent to DOC are drug dealers who do not
want to modify their behavior.
• Problems with MethAmphetamine (Meth).
o Alternative funding
 grant of approximately $2.4 million, which is becoming harder due to
Law Enforcement Forfeitures that are typically driven by DEA and FBI
who are more focused on preventing terrorist attacks.

Public Safety and Criminal Justice Committee

almost half of salary and fringes paid to employees are also from
alternative sources of funding.
Grant Initiatives
o Victim Advocates
o Adult Protective Services
o Senior Sentinels
o Gang Task Force Prosecutor
o Fatal Alcohol Crash Team (FACT)
o Traffic Safety Partnership
o “My Kid” Program – Mentoring program for four city and
township schools.
o Human Trafficking – modern concept of slavery

Chair Moriarty Adams commended the Prosecutor’s Office on obtaining grants.
Councillor Franklin asked what the turnover rate is this year compared to last year. Mr. Brizzi said
that he does not have the exact number, but it is high. He said that he thinks that paying more
money to people who are sacrificing is the right thing to do. He said that it may also be due to law
school graduates obtaining the job right after school to gain the trial experience and possibly
leaving to pursue other areas.
Councillor Schneider asked if there is a fee for the Adult Protective Services and other adult
services that are provided. Mr. Brizzi said that the Family and Social Services Administration
(FSSA) helps pay for that and that Marion County is simply the coordinator of the program.
Councillor Oliver asked for further explanation of drug users, specifically of Meth, being sent to
DOC. He asked if there are specific numbers for Meth offenders that are sent to DOC. Mr. Brizzi
said that he thinks that it is very rare for a casual user to be sentenced to DOC who has not had the
opportunity to get drug treatment. He said that most of the people that are sent for long sentences
are drug dealers and that he does not have the specific numbers in regard to Meth, but could
provide those numbers. Councillor Oliver asked if there is any data intake on the increase of crime
in the suburb and township areas. Mr. Brizzi said that murders are holding steady, but property
crimes are increasing. He said that he thinks this is increasing because offenders of low-level
crimes are not facing consequences and are being rotated in and out of the Arrestee Processing
Center in two hours due to the lack of space in the Marion County Jail. Councillor Oliver asked if
the narcotics cases being sent to DOC are of offenders committing crimes in the proximity of
where the offenders’ live or other areas. Mr. Brizzi said that he is unsure but that research could
possibly be done to obtain those answers.
Chair Moriarty Adams asked if the human trafficking is of children. Mr. Brizzi said that it is
across the board and they are just now scraping the surface. He said that some of the biggest issues
for the next couple of years include: Meth, identify theft, immigration problems, and the new issue
of human trafficking.

Public Safety and Criminal Justice Committee
August 24, 2005
Page 7
Councillor Franklin asked Mr. Brizzi if he could explain human trafficking. Mr. Brizzi said that it
consists of bringing people over from other countries who do not speak English, who have no ties
to the community, and enslaving them for forced labor or sexual trades.
Mr. Brizzi said that the first priority of the Prosecutor’s Office is to focus on traditional, in-thecourtroom prosecution, which will effectively and fairly prosecute criminals. The second goal is to
work toward prosecution prevention and intervention by educating the community on a variety of
issues.
Councillor Bowes said that he is supportive of the recommendations of the Criminal Justice
Planning Council regarding salary increases. He said that the National District Attorneys
Association reflects that the City’s salaries are well below the national average. He asked about
the proposal that suggested a significant difference in Character 01 for the County General Fund,
but not much difference in the Diversion and Referral Fee Fund and Child Support. Mr. Brizzi
said that it was a bit complicated and thought that he would determine what money would be
appropriated and then apply it to the different areas if acceptable with Council. Councillor Bowes
asked how the staffing additions compare to 2005, 2004, & 2003. Mr. Brizzi said that the number
differs because of attrition issues, but it is normally in the range of 130 lawyers and the 17 would
be added to that. Councillor Bowes asked if there are less experienced Deputy Prosecutors
working on more serious cases compared to previous years. Mr. Brizzi said that the Prosecutor’s
Office follows a cycle of hiring lawyers once they pass the bar, which is given twice a year. He
said that most times the Prosecutor’s Office is down lawyers because people leave whenever they
are ready to leave and it may not be during a good time to hire. He said that there are times when
they hire young lawyers right out of law school and other times when experienced lawyers have
been hired that may have left prosecuting and decided to return. In the past two weeks, four lateral
or experienced hires have been accomplished. He said that the Homicide unit was created to
ensure that the most experienced lawyers are prosecuting the more complicated cases. Councillor
Bowes said that he would like to see a measurement of the impact of increasing the budget. Mr.
Brizzi said that it could be compared by looking at the attrition rate for this year and looking back
at the rate next year and to what extent. Councillor Bowes asked if the Prosecutor’s Office could
look at the amount of experience of the Deputy Prosecutors and determine an average to compare
to the national average and to determine if the lawyers are able to gain the experience needed to try
major felony cases. Mr. Brizzi answered in the affirmative and stated that they will look at how to
do that within the next couple of weeks.
Councillor Bowes asked Mr. Brizzi what his view is on the COIT increase, which will devote
resources to public safety and fight the issue of jail overcrowding. Mr. Brizzi said that he had a
difference of opinion about how the money should be spent and how much was allocated toward
solving the problem. He said he supports paying the Prosecutors as well as the Public Defenders
more money to provide a level of comfort. His concern is that some have said this will be a cureall and that extra jail beds will not be needed. He does not believe that and feels that all police

Public Safety and Criminal Justice Committee
August 24, 2005
Page 8
officers should continue to work, more officers should be added to the Sheriff, and that more jail
beds are needed.
Councillor McWhirter asked Mr. Clifford if he could explain what the additional $200,000 is for
that is included in the revised budget. Mr. Clifford said that the original amount was a mistake and
the revised version included the correct amount. Mr. Seidenstein said the $218,000 that was added
back to the County General Fund was originally requested in the Diversion Fund, but there was not
sufficient revenue in the Diversion Fund. It was intended to be put in the General Fund, but the
amount was left out. He said that there should also be a correction for the County General Fund in
the column marked 6/30/2005 Revised; it is actually the original budget, and there was also a
$250,000 appropriation that was approved by the Committee and the full Council that is not
reflected on the handout. Therefore, the grand total of the County General Fund’s current budget
for 2005 is actually $7,377,193.
Chair Moriarty Adams asked if Mr. Clifford or Mr. Seidenstein would like to add anything. Mr.
Clifford said that he did not have anything to add for the Prosecutor, but would like to inform the
Committee that the Controller’s Office made budget cuts across the board in the preliminary
version of the budget. He said that they thought they restored all the cuts to the public safety
agencies, but the Clerk will attest that the funds were not returned on their behalf. He said that
there are instances where the COIT money did not get back into the budget. Chair Moriarty
Adams asked if the money will be put back. Mr. Clifford answered in the affirmative and said that
the provision will be put into the Controller’s proposed budget with the Council’s consent.
John Owens, Chief Deputy Prosecutor, presented information for the Child Support Division. He
said that the agency’s caseload continues to grow and is currently up 8.5% from last year. He said
that the agency continues to increase collections, due to innovative planning and hard working
staff. The agency is currently on a rate to collect about $85 million this year. The federal
government heavily subsidizes the Child Support Enforcement Program and through the total
budget of a little over $4 million, the County will attain reimbursements of almost $3 million. He
said that hopefully through measurement of the agency’s performance on the federal performance
factors listed in Exhibit C, the department will earn an additional $260,000. Both of these factors
will result in additional revenue of more than $3 million to the County and to the agency. Mr.
Owens also mentioned that the Child Support Division’s budget is increased by about $134,000,
which represents an increase in ISA charges.
Councillor McWhirter commented that the internet site in which child support can be paid from
employees’ paychecks is a good idea. Mr. Owens said that program is credited to the Clerk’s
Association and the State Child Support Bureau.
Marion County Clerk
Doris Anne Sadler, Marion County Clerk, introduced the Chief Deputy Clerk, Tony Schaffer and
explained that the Clerk’s Office is responsible for the court records in Marion County and also

Public Safety and Criminal Justice Committee
August 24, 2005
Page 9
handles child support distribution and collection. A handout (Exhibit C) was distributed to all
Councillors. [Clerk’s note: A full printout of Exhibit C is on file in the Council office with the
original set of minutes.] Ms. Sadler’s presentation included the following key points:
o Clerk’s Office revenues
- new law passed this year to charge a $10 per defendant fee.
o Revenue Enhancements
o Character 01
- personal services – will have another revised budget for differences in benefits.
- increases – shows the difference between the 2005 and 2006 budget. Clerk’s Office
has a very high turnover rate that will hopefully be counteracted by salary increases.
- cost savings
- challenges
o Character 02 – supplies and cost savings
o Character 03 – other services and charges, expenditures, and cost savings
o Character 04 – capital and cost savings
o Special Funds budget, explanations, and uses
Chair Moriarty Adams asked if the revenues from the Clerk’s Perpetuation Fund are from fees that
are charged. Ms. Sadler said that a portion of the filing fees that people pay when cases are filed in
the court go into the Perpetuation Fund to pay for things such as computer systems.
Councillor Schneider asked if Ms. Sadler could explain some of the uses of funds from the
Perpetuation Fund. Ms Sadler said that $300,000 was set aside this year to pay for servers for the
Justice.net upgrade. For the 2006 budget, the charge-backs from ISA to pay for computers and
technology costs were transferred out of the General Fund account to the Perpetuation account to
cover those charges. Councillor Schneider asked if there are any stipulations on what the money
from the Perpetuation Fund cannot be used for. Ms. Sadler read information from the statute that
states that the Clerk may use any money in the fund for the preservation of records and the
improvement of record-keeping systems and equipment.
Councillor Bowes asked if there are any other details that need to be looked at on the differences
between the 2005 and 2006 budgets. Ms. Sadler said that she simply points out the two main
impact issues of the $200,000 coming out of the Clerk’s Perpetuation Fund to cover ISA expenses
and, more importantly to the Clerk’s Office, the salary increases and health insurance benefit
increases that are in Character 01. Mr. Clifford said that there were a number of County agencies
that had reductions in their benefits, as well as some that had increases; therefore, once it is more
closely examined there should not be a significant overall impact on the County General Fund
balance. Mr. Brown referred back to the new defendant fee discussed earlier and asked if the
Clerk’s Office expects the revenue from that fee to pay for postage fees. Ms. Sadler answered in
the negative and stated that she simply noted the fees as additional revenue and is not expecting the
fees to pay for any charges. She stated that the appropriations of the Clerk’s Office are at the
appropriate level.

Public Safety and Criminal Justice Committee

Councillor Bowes asked if and when the Clerk’s Office may be approaching a more paperless goal.
Ms. Sadler said that the Clerk’s Office is currently working on converting to the Justice.net
environment. She said that this enables the Clerk’s Office to make programming changes and
upgrades in the system. This process used to take about three months to program for a new type of
report, but now can be done in a day. She said this is the first step in the process of obtaining
online filings, which corresponds with the goal of the Criminal Justice System to eventually have
the paperless-type system. She said that it will be years before that point is reached, but the first
steps are being made to reach that goal.
Community Corrections
Brian Barton, Executive Director, distributed a handout (Exhibit D) and introduced Tiffany Clark
who is responsible for the agency’s finances. [Clerk’s note: A full printout of Exhibit D is on file
in the Council Office with the original set of minutes.]
Mr. Barton said that 2006 will look a lot like 2005, in which three things were focused on: finding
and securing a work release center to help on the post-trial side as well as the pre-trial side;
growing the pretrial program; and the juvenile program. He said that there has been a tremendous
growth on the post-trial and pre-trial programs; the post-trial programs grew by 3% and the pretrial programs grew by 20% in relation to the year before. He said that he is proud that the
Community Corrections agency will be getting $225,000 for the General Fund and will increase
the user fee, which derives from the home detention program, to make up the difference. The 2006
budget also reflects a decrease of $225,000, but about $149,000 will be utilized for additional ISA
charges and possible charge-backs for legal fees.
Mr. Clifford said that the agency should receive credit for all of the money that is brought back
because the other charges are fixed charges that are already in the base budget.
Mr. Barton said that the Community Corrections Department will continue to work hard; that the
work release center is a priority and he is hoping to get some of the COIT dollars allocated for beds
for that center. He said that later this year a plan will be introduced to MIBOR and the Council to
rehabilitate the Delaware Youth Center, which was used as an overflow for the Detention Center,
at a cost of about $600,000. No tax dollars will be used to reopen this facility and it will offer the
opportunity to house more juveniles at the local level.
Councillor Oliver asked how many juveniles are in custody on home detention and what the user
fee amount is. Mr. Barton answered that 160 juveniles are on home detention, and the user fee is
$2 a day.
Councillor Bowes asked how the capacity matches for eligibility or demand for the home detention
spots. Mr. Barton said the Community Corrections Board periodically revises the criteria and
make occasional exceptions. For example, if a gentleman commits a robbery at age 18 and lives a
crime-free life, but then gets charged with drunk driving at age 50, several years ago the man

Public Safety and Criminal Justice Committee

would be considered ineligible. But individual cases such as this are now recognized and the
department has attempted to grow with the system. Councillor Bowes asked if the City has the
appropriate amount of equipment, such as beds, for the people that would be eligible for the work
release program or home detention. Mr. Barton said that the home detention program will continue
to grow as long as they continue to receive the equipment from the vendors. He said that the
judges feel comfortable and confident in work release; thus, the reason it has been identified as a
need. He said that 350 beds will help the pre-trial side with the emergency releases, but will also
help the post-trial side by providing approximately 80 beds for reentry from DOC. Mr. Barton
stated that screening has also greatly improved due to the use of nationally recognized screening
tools.
Councillor Franklin asked if the $2 home detention user fee is the same for juveniles and adults.
Mr. Barton answered in the negative; he said that the adult fee is $12 a day, but the fees are based
on the individual’s ability to pay. Councillor Franklin asked if there are more people that cannot
afford to pay than those that can, resulting in a loss of revenue. Mr. Barton answered in the
negative and stated that the department is not losing money, but has a surplus collecting at a rate of
52%. He said that the goal is to collect at a rate of 70%, but has lately taken more of a loss on the
pre-trial side.
Mr. Seidenstein explained that Exhibit E does not reflect any change to the total budget for
Community Corrections. It reflects a reallocation between the Conditional Release (Pre-trial fund)
and the Home Detention User Fund. He said that the budget also does not reflect the COIT dollars
that are expected to be obtained for the work release center.
Chair Moriarty Adams asked if the Character 03 amount change from $75,000 to $519,000 is
because of the new work release center. Mr. Barton answered in the affirmative.
CONCLUSION
With no further business pending, and upon motion duly made, the Public Safety and Criminal
Justice Committee of the City-County Council was adjourned at 8:03 p.m.
Respectfully submitted,

ADMINISTRATION AND FINANCE COMMITTEE
The Administration and Finance Committee of the City-County Council met on Tuesday, August
14, 2007. Chair Joanne Sanders called the meeting to order at 5:03 p.m. with the following
members present: Paul Bateman, Lynn McWhirter, and Lance Langsford. Absent was Lincoln
Plowman. Vernon Brown and Jackie Nytes arrived shortly thereafter. Representing Council staff
was Bart Brown, Chief Financial Officer (CFO). Council President Monroe Gray was also in
attendance.
Chair Sanders stated that Proposal Nos. 300, 301, and 302, 2007 were originally postponed to
August 14, 2007, but are not ready for action and need to be postponed again.
Councillor Bateman moved, seconded by Councillor McWhirter, to “Postpone” Proposal Nos. 300,
301, and 302, 2007 until August 21, 2007. The motion carried by a vote of 4-0.
[Councillor Nytes arrived at 5:04 p.m.]
Chair Sanders opened the hearing by stating that the Council has seen some rather exciting meetings
in the recent past where individuals have questioned the process followed by chairs. Because of the
frustration which arose when people questioned the manner in which meetings were run, she
explained that the rules governing meetings were established by General Ordinance beginning in
1968 and amended thereafter, in accordance with the establishment of UniGov. They can be found
in Chapter 151 of the Revised Code of the Consolidated City and County. They are also available
online at Indygov.org/Council or by calling the Council office at 327-4241. She said that it is
important for the public to know the rules under which meetings are required to be conducted.
President Gray stated that he joins the Mayor in calling for all city and county agencies and units of
local government to reduce spending in 2008, in order to lessen the dependence on property tax.
This year, as in the past, he has ordered that the Council Budget be reduced as much as possible. He
stated that he is happy to report that there has been an eight percent cut for the 2008 budget. He
invited all Marion County residents to participate in the budget process. Since everyone cannot
attend all of the budget hearings, they are offering two ways for citizens to participate in this
process. One is Budget Talk, a form e-mail, instituted this year so people could share their ideas for
the budget. The other is a survey that has been added to the Council website, so that people can
share what is important to them during this budget process. For those without access to a computer,
please call the Council Office at 327-4241 to obtain a copy of the survey.
Bart Brown, CFO, stated that in the past, internal surveys were sent out, so that funding for budgets
could be prioritized. This year, President Gray expressed to him that these types of surveys should
be made available to the public. He said that he looked around and saw that Eau Claire County,
Wisconsin had a simple survey that listed services and asked citizens to rank them in terms of
priority. He added that the Information Services Agency (ISA) should be commended for getting
this done in less than twenty-four hours. There is a link posted on http://www.indygov.org. The
link will take citizens to an introductory page. This is a simple survey, so it asks that only people
from Marion County answer the survey. ISA will try to filter out answers that are meant to skew
the results, such as all unnecessary answers or several from the same IP address. He said that the
survey tried to cover every area of service, including those that have to be funded by state or federal
mandate. He said that the results will be posted on the website as well as distributed to the Council
members.

[Councillor Brown arrived at 5:08 pm.]
President Gray stated that once again the Council is trying to react to the requests of the constituents
to be a part of this process. For the first time, they have been given three options to voice their
concerns. By August 27, 2007, there should be enough questions and answers from people who
want to be a part of this process. He said he encourages everyone to at least visit the survey. He
said he understands that it may not be possible to attend every meeting, but it gives people the
opportunity to look at the services and pick which ones they think are most important, even if they
only answer some of the questions and not all of them.
Chair Sanders stated that ISA will be compiling the responses and posting them on the website. She
added that she would like ISA to indicate the areas where funding is mandated by the state or
federal government. Mr. Brown said that it is easy to do and that ISA can create a more in-depth
survey. It was intended to be simple for people without a lot of time. He added that at the end of
the survey there is a link to Budget Talk so that people may make comments about the budget,
survey, or anything else. Chair Sanders said that the link is on the City homepage just below the
icons, not the Council homepage.
Councillor Langsford asked how often a person can respond. Mr. Brown said that ISA can look at
the IP address and will look out for large numbers of responses from the same IP address to prevent
skewing the survey.
Councillor Nytes stated that this is excellent and the branch libraries have internet access to this
survey, if constituents do not have access at home. Mr. Brown said that if someone calls the
Council office, a paper copy can be sent to their home.
BUDGET HEARING

Robert Clifford, City Controller, stated that several departments will be presenting revised budgets.
The Controller’s Office will be keeping a log of all budget changes and will be able to provide a
new budget book without the old pages after the first round of the budget process. He added that
the budget on the website is also being kept up-to-date.
City-County Council and Clerk
Jean Milharcic, Council Clerk, distributed a handout detailing the presentation (Exhibit A).
Chair Sanders stated that this budget is located in the budget book on page sixteen under the
executive and legislative tab.
Ms. Milharcic stated that at the direction of President Gray, the 2008 Council budget has been cut
by 8%. There are no cuts from Character 01, and the increase is due to rising insurance costs. She
said that Character 02 has a $2,750 cut, and staff has been informed to use supplies sparingly.
Character 03 has a $135,532 cut. Management consulting has been reduced and no outside
consultants, other than the Chief Financial Officer, will be used. Additional cuts were made to
postage, travel, and information technology. She said that small cuts were made to copying,

Administration and Finance Committee
August 14, 2007
Page 4
printing, and binding. She said they are small because there are things that need to be copied and
made available according to law. Character 04 was cut in its entirety except for the postage
machine rental. She said there will be no purchases of office equipment. She stated that since
2004, the Council budget has been cut 17%.
Chair Sanders asked if 2004 was Ms. Milharcic’s first year as the Clerk. Ms. Milharcic answered in
the affirmative.
Ms. Milharcic said that Full Time Equivalents (FTE) have been decreased by one and one-half and
the office currently employs seven and one-half FTEs. This causes the staff to work some extra
hours on diverse projects. In 2007, the Council has underspent $30,000, but does not plan any
further underspending until after the budget season and it will be reassessed in November.
Chair Sanders said that the budget book does not seem to reflect the cuts mentioned in the
presentation. Mr. Clifford stated that the budget book is from July. They have recently made these
changes and it will be updated soon. He added that this will occur with other agencies as they
change their budgets.
Councillor McWhirter said that this appears to be a lean budget and asked if this budget contains
any salary increases. She said that Mr. Clifford stated that salary increases will only be included if
the agency can find the money elsewhere. Ms. Milharcic said they are not included and will not be
if other agencies are not able to fund increases. Councillor McWhirter asked if they were still
looking for funds for those increases or are increases simply not possible. Mr. Clifford stated that
he meant that they would like to find salary increases, but efficiencies had to be found in operations.
He said that if Character 01 was $1 million in 2007 and remained $1 million in 2008 and an office
had two fewer FTEs, then the savings could be passed on as an increase to the employees. Ms.
Milharcic stated that there will not be a salary increase in January, but they are waiting to see how
other agencies handle it. Mr. Clifford stated that they are waiting on recommendations from
department heads. Councillor McWhirter asked if the attorney listed is Aaron Haith. Ms. Milharcic
stated that attorney dollars include Aaron Haith, Randle Pollard, and Robert Elrod. Councillor
McWhirter asked what the breakdown for all three contracts is. Ms. Milharcic stated that Mr.
Elrod’s contract is $45,000, Mr. Pollard’s is $50,000, and Mr. Haith’s is $100,000.
Councillor Brown stated that since the $30,000 in savings had been identified, then the department
should be able to give the employees a 3% raise, and asked Mr. Clifford if that was correct. Mr.
Clifford stated that this is not quite right. Councillor Brown stated that he understood that if they
identified money in the budget, it could be passed on to the employees. Councillor McWhirter
stated that she had the same understanding. Mr. Clifford said that they tried to flat line Character
01, and if operational changes could be found and if FTEs were reduced, then salary increases could
happen. Councillor Brown said unless money is saved in Character 01, then it cannot be passed on
as salaries. He asked if that meant someone had to be fired to give the rest of the employees a raise.
Councillor Nytes said that it may not be found in the overall $30,000 budget reduction, but if it is
found in year-to-date spending and the agency is able to continue to work one employee short, then
those raises could be funded out of Character 01. Mr. Clifford agreed. Chair Sanders asked if a
particular department could fund raises if they had underspending in 2007. Mr. Clifford stated that
2007 underspending would have to be appropriated by the Council.

Administration and Finance Committee
August 14, 2007
Page 5

Councillor Brown said that civilian employees work hard, do not want to cut services, and need to
be compensated. He said that employees went a long time without a raise. Mr. Clifford said he is a
proponent of giving raises to employees. He said if the Council retains the vacancy and is able to
pay for their employees through an appropriation, then the funds for raises will be made available.
It will be up to the individual managers to find the efficiencies to fund the raises. He added that
they cannot give 3% raises every year and not expect the budget to grow.
Mr. Brown stated that the ordinance introduced did not reflect the cuts in the budget, but during the
review phase the Controller’s Office will bring amendments for the proposals.
Chair Sanders stated that the discussion illustrates how difficult it is to find funding for increased
wages. She said that the budget will be forced to increase with the salary raises, which affects
health care and pensions. She said it can be a conundrum because raises cannot be given in this
type of environment where budgets are frozen, and the Council is finding ways to alleviate the
burden of property taxes.
Department of Administration and Equal Opportunity
Sherlonda Anderson, Department of Administration and Equal Opportunity (DAEO) Director,
distributed a handout detailing the presentation (Exhibit B). She said in 2007 they expanded
methods to improve service delivery to city and county agencies and citizens. There is a new
electronic process for applications, and the manual has been consolidated for city and county
employees. She said the manual will also be given to all employees electronically. She said that
page four of the presentation illustrates the 2007 budget reductions. They have instituted hiring
freezes and other budget cuts. Slide five illustrates the 2008 budget overview. She said the budget
book shows an increase of 0.7%, which is due to an increase of $85,000 in the microfilm division
contract. The microfilm contract ends December 31, 2007, because the current vendor will no
longer provide this service. She said that they have discussed moving this service from the DAEO
to the Marion County Clerk’s office. The Clerk serves as the chair on the commission that governs
documentation that must be kept.
Councillor McWhirter asked what the contract is worth. Hope Tribble, Office of Finance and
Management (OFM) Budget Manager, said that it is a $72,960 contract for three full-time
employees. The Auditor’s Office has paid $43,700 of the contract, the remainder is paid for out of
the DAEO budget. Ms. Anderson stated that the increase is based on the cost of health insurance
for the employees. Councillor McWhirter asked if they have looked at any other vendors to save
the cost of employee health insurance. Ms. Anderson said the service is antiquated, but must be
used by law. Councillor McWhirter asked if ISA has looked into keeping records in electronic files.
Ms. Anderson said that they have looked at it, but the law has not kept up with technology.
Councillor McWhirter asked what is the purpose of moving this division to the County Clerk’s
office. Ms. Anderson stated that it seems to fit better because the majority of the records that are
kept on microfilm are under the Clerk’s purveyance. Councillor McWhirter asked why this contract
is being paid out of the Auditor budget. Mr. Clifford stated that traditionally, general county
expenses were paid out of the Auditor budget. He said that purchasing tried to bid the contract out
and could not find any takers. There are a number of departments using electronic storage when it

Administration and Finance Committee
August 14, 2007
Page 6
is legal, and as a result, the volume of records that are sent to microfilm is dwindling. The small
amount of volume is one of the reasons the current vendor does not want to rebid the contract.
Ms. Anderson stated that slide seven has been revised; one of the biggest changes has been the
Office of Corporation Counsel charges.
Councillor Langsford asked if there would be an increase in the budget for the County Clerk’s
Office. Mr. Clifford answered in the affirmative. He added that there will be a slightly larger
increase than what is currently shown in the budget for microfilm. The three employees that work
in microfilm will receive salary increases because they are currently below the city’s minimum
standards. Councillor Langsford stated that the city should approach the Indiana General Assembly
and ask for changes in the law, so that record keeping could be more effective and less costly.
Councillor Nytes stated that the debate regarding electronic records and microfilm has been
difficult. They met with the State Archives Director regarding the Public Records Commission. She
said that the director recommends microfilm, because technology changes so fast, and those files
will not be able to be read easily. She said that Councillor Rozelle Boyd has convened a committee
that will meet on this subject and will make recommendations.
Mr. Clifford stated that the Marion County Alliance of Neighborhood Associations (MCANA)
asked that each agency state the 2007 number of FTEs and the 2008 number of FTEs. Ms.
Anderson stated that there are 45 FTEs in 2007, and it will remain the same in 2008.
Administrative Services
Ms. Anderson stated that DAEO also works with charter schools, constituent services, and Latino
affairs.
Chair Sanders asked for the number of FTEs dedicated to charter schools. Ms. Anderson stated that
there are now four FTEs, because one recently left.
Ms Anderson stated that slides eleven and twelve (Exhibit A) illustrate the highlights of Mayorsponsored charter schools. Slide thirteen illustrates the 2008 budget and changes for administrative
services.
Chair Sanders asked for public testimony. None was offered.
Human Resources,
Collin Kebo, DAEO Human Resources Division (HR) Administrator, distributed a handout
detailing the presentation (Exhibit C). He said in 2007, the focus was the merger of HR functions
for the city and the county. The merger added 3,000 employees and over 30 county and township
offices. He said slides three and four illustrate the service areas of HR. He said that HR
administers over 25 different benefit plans. The Sherriff’s office, Prosecutor’s Office, and the
Courts were not included in the consolidation. He said it has eliminated duplication of services.

Administration and Finance Committee
August 14, 2007
Page 7
Chair Sanders asked if this move was driven by Senate Enrolled Act 307. Mr. Clifford answered in
the affirmative.
Councillor Nytes stated that this is commendable and asked if there are still places that job
applications are handled outside of HR. Mr. Kebo said there are three agencies that are outside of
the consolidation. Councillor Nytes asked if the employees of those agencies were covered under
the same benefits programs administered by HR. Mr. Kebo answered in the affirmative.
Chair Sanders asked if the excluded agencies are using HR services for other things, such as
background checks. Mr. Kebo stated that they do their own background checks. He said they opted
into HR’s compensation programs and the open enrollment process.
Councillor Brown asked if the three organizations follow the guidelines requiring employees to live
in the County. Mr. Kebo said he does not know.
Mr. Kebo stated that HR consolidation has been completed successfully. He said that they have
implemented an electronic job application system, and it allows for all jobs to be posted
electronically on the website. This allows potential applicants to search for job openings and apply
on the website.
Councillor McWhirter asked if people can apply for a position type or for a specific job. Mr. Kebo
stated that they have to apply for each job individually, but they can apply for as many jobs as they
would like.
Mr. Kebo stated that the applications can be processed electronically, which results in a faster, more
streamlined hiring process. They have received many positive comments regarding this new system
from both applicants and agencies. He said this has also implemented common job classifications
and wages. The benefit programs have also been merged, so that there is one benefit plan. He said
they will introduce an employee assistance program and health savings accounts.
Mr. Kebo said that slides nine through eighteen illustrate the impact of the consolidation. Slide
eleven illustrates the number of employees eligible for benefit enrollment and the number of
employees that have enrolled. He said 88.2% of eligible city employees and 84.1% of eligible
county employees have enrolled in the benefits programs. He said he believes that this shows the
quality of the City-County benefit program.
Chair Sanders stated that it also shows that there are some businesses in this community that benefit
from this plan. She said it may be subsidizing their employees with spouses who are eligible for
these benefits.
Mr. Kebo stated that the demographics show the average age of employees is rising; city employees
are about 76% male and county employees are about 58% male.
Councillor Bateman asked if there is a wellness program. Mr. Kebo answered in the affirmative.
Councillor Nytes asked if the number of employees over age 55 is growing. Mr. Kebo answered in
the affirmative. Councillor Nytes asked if anyone is discussing the impact on the loss of

Administration and Finance Committee
August 14, 2007
Page 8
institutional knowledge if all of these employees are retiring around the same time. Mr. Kebo
agreed that it should be considered.
Mr. Kebo stated that slide thirteen illustrates the employment results from years 2005 through 2007.
He said that 2005 only shows city job applications; 2006 illustrates both city and county job
applications after the merger; while 2007 illustrates city and county job applications with the
introduction of electronic postings, prior to the hiring freezes.
Councillor McWhirter asked if they only process applications and forward them to the hiring
managers so that they can decide which applicant to hire. Mr. Kebo stated that each agency makes
their own hiring decisions.
Mr. Kebo stated that slide fourteen illustrates an overview of training courses offered by DAEO.
Slides fifteen and sixteen show an overview of Worker’s Compensation Claims for 2004 – 2006.
Councillor Nytes asked if the downward trend is a result of any concerted efforts to promote safer
workplaces. Mr. Kebo stated that several programs have been introduced to reduce these costs,
including a light-duty program. The light-duty program brings employees back to work faster. He
said they analyzed areas in which accidents occurred the most and implemented safety programs to
reduce accidents. They have also investigated the possibility of adding an on-site nurse to treat
simple illnesses, rather than sending employees to an off-site medical facility.
Mr. Kebo stated that slides seventeen and eighteen illustrate turnover rates for 2004-2006. He said
that only bi-weekly and union employees are included in these graphs; sworn employees are not.
Chair Sanders asked if this is strictly turnover, not attrition or retirement. Mr. Kebo said this only
includes voluntary termination.
Councillor Nytes asked if 2004-2006 are years when union and public safety employees received
salary increases, but not unrepresented employees. Mr. Kebo answered in the affirmative.
Councillor Nytes stated that the city absorbed increased insurance rates during that time period, but
this is one reason that employees have unions. When there is a body that represents employees, one
of the things that happens is that those people still get raises, while the unrepresented do not in
times of budget crisis. She said that the city needs to recognize that when there are employees that
do not receive raises, the result is often high turnover. High turnover rates are very costly to
agencies, and as such, perhaps raises should be a consideration rather than simply flat-lining wages.
Chair Sanders said that she agrees whole-heartedly that there is a cost involved with this and would
like to see a comparison between the cost of raises and the cost of turnover.
Councillor Bateman said that he would like to see the cost of training and retraining employees.
Chair Sanders stated that she would like that to include the cost of overtime incurred due to being
short-staffed.
Mr. Kebo stated that slide nineteen illustrates the number of FTEs in HR from 2004–2008. He said
slides twenty through twenty-one illustrates the budget from 2004-2008.

Administration and Finance Committee
August 14, 2007
Page 9
Mr. Brown stated that Character 03, line 362, in the budget book page eleven shows $15,000
budgeted for building maintenance and repair. Mr. Kebo stated that this is for additional office
space. Mr. Brown asked if this is for the additional employees that were brought over from the
County. Mr. Clifford stated that it is for a records retention area and a larger area for applications.
Chair Sanders asked for public testimony. None was offered.
Equal Opportunity
Robert Ransom, Division of Equal Opportunity Administrator, distributed a handout detailing the
presentation (Exhibit D). He said that slide three indicates the number of minority and women
owned businesses (M/WBE) that have received certifications from the city. Slides four and five
illustrate an analysis of M/WBE utilization.
Chair Sanders said that it appears that the performance under WBE is not as it used to be. She said
that it is her understanding that the annual goal was 8% and asked if there is any information or
documentation that may indicate why the city is not achieving 8%. Mr. Ransom stated that it may
have been the nature of the projects. The emphasis has been on combined sewer overflow projects
and underground utility work. He said there are not many WBE firms that perform that type of
work. He added that they are receiving new applications from WBE firms that engage in that type
of work. He said that the Southeastern project has a high percentage of WBE participation. He said
they are also seeing large increases in WBE engineering firms.
Mr. Ransom said that their main focus is to attract M/WBE participation, evaluate bids, monitor
contracts and wages, and host quarterly outreach events. Mr. Ransom stated that slides seven and
eight illustrate adjudication and a breakdown of allegations.
Councillor Nytes asked if this number is higher or lower from past years. Mr. Ransom stated that
this number is down. Councillor Nytes asked if there has been some sort of education process. Mr.
Ransom said that agencies are doing better.
Mr. Ransom stated that slide nine illustrates the budget proposal and it is essentially flat. He said
that the only increase is in Character 01, because insurance and pension costs have risen.
Chair Sanders stated that on slide nine Character 01, 2007 Originally Budgeted, should read
$328,786, not $358,786, if there is a $19,493 increase.
Councillor McWhirter asked how often the board meets. Mr. Ransom said they meet bi-monthly.
Councillor McWhirter asked if all the positions are full. Mr. Ransom answered in the affirmative.
Councillor Nytes asked if the ordinance change last year helped him achieve a quorum. Mr.
Ransom said it reduced the number of board members from 22 to 14, and they have had almost
100% participation.
Chair Sanders asked for public testimony. None was offered.

Election Board
Elizabeth White, Election Board Secretary, distributed a handout detailing the presentation (Exhibit
E). She stated that the election board is a three member board. Mark Sullivan is the Chairman and
was appointed by the Democratic Party. Frank Otte is the Vice Chair and was appointed by the
Republican Party. She said that she is the Secretary because the County Clerk always serves as
Secretary.
Chair Sanders asked what defined the members of the Election Board. Ms. White stated that it is
defined in state statute.
Ms. White said the members are appointed by the County Party Chair, so those can change. She
said that slides three and four outline the duties of the Election Board. She stated that the Voter
Registration in Marion County is an independent county agency. These are combined in almost
every other county. She said that the 2008 goals and initiatives on slide five were formed from the
recommendations made by the Council Investigative Election Committee.
Councillor McWhirter asked if reprecincting occurs, will the process concentrate on putting smaller
precincts together or a county-wide overhaul. Ms. White stated that the plan is submitted by the
Mayor to the State Election Board. The Clerk has no direct responsibility in that process, but will
implement whatever maps are approved. She said that she has been told that this is a demographic
exercise that is intended to equalize the populations in each district. She said that the population in
the county has shifted; cornfields now have subdivisions and subdivisions near the airport have
become runways. She said that there is a precinct in the middle of Eagle Creek reservoir. The State
Election Board should be issuing a decision soon.
Ms. White stated that they are implementing new software, called TRS. The 500 Festival and
Sports Corporation have been using this software. This software will allow better volunteer
management and recruiting. She said they are trying to use more city cars to reduce their reliance
on rental cars. She said that they will implement early absentee satellite voting in 2008. She said
that slides six through eight outline some of the election challenges for 2008. The first initiative
will be the first challenge. Reprecincting will create voter confusion because of the new locations.
She said that outreach will be very important. In addition, the entire election will change, and
voting machines will require reprogramming. She said that the touch-screen voting machines will
be used for the first time in a presidential election, and it will be challenge. She said that the 2008
election will be large because so many offices are on the ballot. She said in May, 2008 the school
board election will occur. This is a challenge because school board districts do not respect precinct
boundaries and are created by the school board. This will result in over 5,000 ballot styles for the
primary election. She added that all of this means that this will be a more expensive election.
Chair Sanders asked if the maintenance and service is included in the contract. Ms. White stated
that the vendor supplies support in terms of service days, and there will be more of those in an
election of this scale. She said that the warranty expires in 2008, and it is crucial that another
warranty is purchased.

Administration and Finance Committee
August 14, 2007
Page 11
Ms. White stated that absentee satellite voting will have an impact on the 2008 budget. She said
that the ballot-on-demand printer that will be needed in each location is $4,500. She said that this is
also an increase in temporary staff. She said that slide nine illustrates expected staffing.
Ms. White stated that slides ten through 14 illustrate the budget. She said that reprecincting should
lower the costs of poll workers, because fewer would be needed.
Councillor Nytes said that the Investigative Election Committee discussed increasing pay for
election workers. Ms. White stated that the possibility remains if efficiencies can be found
elsewhere. Councillor Nytes stated that she hopes that possibility remains open.
Ms. White stated that Character 02 has an increase because of the increase in supplies needed for a
large election. She said that renting tables and chairs will cost more money, but so will fuel costs if
they use city-owned cars.
Chair Sanders asked if tables and chairs for polling sites are included in the site contract. Andy
Mallon, Election Board Administrator, stated that it is included in many contracts, but some places,
such as fire stations, do not have them available.
Chair Sanders asked if the voting machines will be capable of increased use due to the reduction of
precincts from 917 to 600. Ms. White stated because they will be using the same number of
machines, but they will be in different locations. She added that this is one of the reasons that repurchasing a warranty is critical.
Ms. White stated that Character 03 will increase because of the nature of a large election and the
voter outreach that will need to occur. She said there are 623,026 registered voters as of today,
which is a lot of postage. She said Character 04 is increasing because of the need for ballot-ondemand printers.
Chair Sanders asked for public testimony. None was offered.
[Clerk’s Note: Councillor Brown left at 7:00 p.m.]
Voter Registration
John Riordan, Marion County Board of Voter Registration Democratic Board Member, and Cindy
Mowery, Marion County Board of Voter Registration Republican Board Member, distributed a
handout detailing the presentation (Exhibit F). Mr. Riordan said that state statute requires that the
board must be bi-partisan and separate appointed by the Party County Chairs, and staff is divided by
political affiliation. He added that they are required to maintain bi-partisan bounds within the
office. Mr. Riordan stated that slide two shows an overview of the responsibilities of the board. He
said that there are actually 917 precincts in Marion County, but only 914 contain voters. One
precinct encompasses the surface area of Eagle Creek Reservoir, another encompasses the surface
area of Geist Reservoir, and the third encompasses the airport. He said slide three illustrates voter
registration statistics from 2002-2007. He added that registration work is tied to the type of
election.

Councillor Nytes stated that if the year-to-date number for 2007 Municipal Elections continues to
grow it will exceed the 2004 Presidential Election. She asked if they thought it was due to increased
community activism of late. Ms. Mowery said that she believed it was attributable to the Bureau of
Motor Vehicles (BMV) and the ease of registering there. Mr. Riordan stated that there has been a
high volume of BMV registrations.
Chair Sanders asked if that also meant there is a high volume of duplicate registrations. Mr.
Riordan stated that renewed licenses do not create duplicates, and if Voter Registration receives
another registration from the same person at the same address, a duplicate will not be created. Chair
Sanders asked if these numbers have duplicates filtered out. Mr. Riordan answered in the
affirmative.
Councillor McWhirter asked if they have an increase in unqualified voter registrants coming from
the BMV applicants. Ms. Mowery stated that if the application is incomplete, the system generates
a letter to the applicant informing them that their application is incomplete. She said that there are
notes for the election clerks to check the identification of a first-time voter. Mr. Riordan stated that
the national voter registration act requires a seven-day period for new or transferred registration.
They send out a postcard to the new address, and if it is returned to voter registration, then it is not
activated.
Mr. Riordan stated that slide four illustrates a budget overview that is relatively flat. Ms. Mowery
stated that slide five details staffing for voter registration, including associated increases. She said
that slide six illustrates the budget by Character. Slide seven illustrates the budget actuals from
2006. She added that voter registration closes on October 9, 2007, and she reminded people to vote
on November 6, 2007.
Councillor Langsford asked how many temporary employees would be hired, when they are hired,
how long they work, and if they are partisan. Ms. Mowery stated that they are hired six weeks
before the poll book is printed, they work approximately 37.5 hours per week, and they are partisan.
She added that in large elections, they sometimes work overtime. Councillor Langsford asked if
they would need to hire additional staff to keep up with the high volume of registrations. Ms.
Mowery said that it is not necessary currently.
Chair Sanders asked for public testimony. None was offered.
With no further business pending, and upon motion duly made, the Administration and Finance
Committee of the City-County Council was adjourned at 7:15 p.m.
Respectfully submitted,

Joanne Sanders, Chair
Administration and Finance Committee

MEMORANDUM
TO:
FROM:

City-County Councillors
Jean Milharcic, Clerk of the Council

RE:
DATE:

2008 Budget for Council
August 13, 2007

Attached is the Council’s budget for 2008. At the direction of President Gray, I
have again made deep cuts. The decrease from 2007 to 2008 is 8%.
Character 1: The only increase is from the insurance increase for employees.
Character 2: There are $2,750 in cuts. Staff has been advised that this will be a
very frugal budget, and as such, to please use supplies sparingly.
Character 3: There are $135,532 in cuts. You will see a decrease in
Management Consulting to the extent that there will be no funds for additional
consultants other than a CFO in 2008. Cuts have been made to postage, travel
and IT. Small cuts have been made to copying and printing & binding since
these are services that we must have in order to keep with the law in creating
and maintaining minutes of our meetings.
Character 4: All of character 4, except for the lease of our postage machine is
cut for 2008. There will be no purchases of furniture or printers in 2008.
As you can see this is an austere budget. At the request of the President and
Council leadership, we have continued to be frugal in our spending and make the
necessary decreases in tight budget years. Since 2004, we have successfully
cut our budget from the 2004 total of $1.95 million to $1.75 million for 2007 and
now $1.62 million for 2008. That is a total decrease of 17% over four years.
Since the Council has statutory obligations for record keeping, there is not much
more left to cut. Please let me know if I can answer any questions.
Thanks, Jean

CHARTER SCHOOLS
• There will be 16 Mayor-sponsored charter schools open during the
2007-08 school year. The schools will serve over 4,000 students.
• Currently, one additional school is scheduled to open in the fall of
2008 – Honor Charter Academy, which was recently approved by the
City-County Council.
• As the sponsor of these schools, the Mayor’s Office engages in a
number of activities to ensure the schools comply with the terms of
their charter and deliver a quality education to the students they serve.
These activities include:
– Monthly visits to each school by Mayor’s Office staff to collect school
information and monitor compliance with laws and regulations;
– School visits conducted by education experts to evaluate the schools’
performance and help them improve the educational services they provide;

City of Indianapolis--Department of Administration and Equal Opportunity

CHARTER SCHOOLS
– Preparing the annual accountability report in order to inform the
public how well Mayor-sponsored charter schools are performing;
and
– Evaluating charter school applications to ensure that only the highest
quality applicants receive charters.

• Mayor-sponsored charter schools have produced a solid track
record of academic performance. Information that the Indiana
Department of Education released late last spring showed that:
º 6 of the 11 schools in Marion County with the most student
improvement on ISTEP were Mayor-sponsored schools;
º The school with the most student improvement in Marion County was
a Mayor-sponsored school – KIPP Indianapolis College Preparatory;
and
º 5 of the top 50 schools in the state were Mayor-sponsored schools.

ADMINISTRATION AND FINANCE COMMITTEE
The Administration and Finance Committee of the City-County Council met on Tuesday, December
11, 2007. Chair Joanne Sanders called the meeting to order at 5:04 p.m. with the following
members present: Paul Bateman, Lynn McWhirter, and Jackie Nytes. Absent were Vernon Brown,
Lance Langsford, and Lincoln Plowman.
PROPOSAL NO. 527, 2007 - restates the AUL Deferred Compensation Plan to promote ease of
administration, permit additional rollovers into the AUL plan to increase attractiveness to
employees, and provide for matching contributions by the City for police officers and firefighters
as negotiated in labor agreements
Doug McCollom, Human Resource Benefits Manager, City of Indianapolis/Marion County, said
that he and his team took the restated document to the City of Indianapolis/Marion County
Administrative Board on November 1, as they are listed as the plan administrator in the AUL plan
document. He said that they asked for the Administrative Board’s request to pass the information on
to the next level, which consisted of introducing the document as a proposal at the Council meeting
on December 3. Mr. McCollom said that the current AUL plan document is an individually
designed document which does not allow for certain things that have been updated due to new laws
and legislation with retirement accounts. He said that new legislation known as the Economic
Growth and Tax Relief Act (EGTRA) was passed in 2001 that has allowed mixed money to be
rolled over into retirement plan accounts. The current 457 plan does not allow an employee of the
City of Indianapolis or Marion County to roll over money from, as an example, a 401K plan from a
former employer into the 457 plan. The only rollover money that is accepted into the 457 plan is
money from the same type of plan as a 457 plan. Mr. McCollom said that the updated/restated
document would afford employees the advantage of being able to roll over any type of money.
Chair Sanders asked Mr. McCollom to make a distinction about the difference in money to which
he is referring. Mr. McCollom said that all of the retirement plans to which he is referring are pretax deductions, but there are different plans associated with different corporations. He said that the
City has a 457 plan because it is a government entity, and some private organizations have plans
based on their type of corporation.
Mr. McCollom said that the second piece of the restated document reflects that the new Indianapolis
Fire Department (IFD) and the new Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department (IMPD) contracts
include match money for their members. For 2008, the maximum match amount will be $20 per
pay; for 2009 it will be $25 per pay; and for 2010 it will be $37.50 per pay. He said that the City’s
current document does not allow match dollars to come into the plan. Mr. McCollom said that there
are 726 employees from IMPD that are participants in the AUL plan, and there is an option within
the Fire Department for employees to participate in Nationwide or AUL. The Fire Department
currently has 161 employees in the AUL plan and 426 employees in the Nationwide plan. Mr.
McCollom said that the Nationwide document that is in place is a 457 plan that is available only to
the sworn firefighters. It is not being presented because it already includes the updated language for
the match dollars and rollover money.
Councillor Nytes asked if other city and county employees participate in the AUL plan, and if the
plan is open to any employee that wishes to participate. Mr. McCollom answered in the affirmative.

Administration and Finance Committee
December 11, 2007
Page 3

Councillor Nytes asked if the percentage of employees that participate in the 457 plan is known.
Mr. McCollom answered that approximately 10% to 15% of the employees participate in the plan.
He said that AUL performs a variety of communication processes on a quarterly basis to encourage
increased employee participation, in addition to attending Human Resources’ new hire orientation
sessions that occur every other week. AUL educates employees on how the plan works and how the
pr-tax contributions can benefit the employee. Councillor Nytes asked if the city or county provides
any matching dollars to employees or union workers other than those of the police and fire
departments. Mr. McCollom answered in the negative. Councillor Nytes encouraged Mr.
McCollom and his team to continue trying to encourage employees to participate in their retirement
planning.
Councillor McWhirter asked where the information regarding matching funds is addressed in the
document. Ellen Gabovitch, Corporation Counsel, said that it is set out in an appendix to the
adoption agreement. Councillor McWhirter asked if there is a concern with this program as to who
does and does not pay taxes on the matching funds, with regard to employees or employer. Sue
Williams, Attorney, AUL, answered that the funds are not taxable for income taxes, but are subject
to social security and FICA taxes. Mr. McCollom stated that the information for the matching
contributions is in Section 3.03 on page 5 of the prototype plan. He said that the adoption
agreement goes into more detail about how the plan operates. He also added that as AUL went
through the process of updating the document, all of the information from the current document was
transferred into the new restated document, with the addition of the rollover and matching
contribution language.
Councillor Bateman asked what the maximum percentage amount is that employees can contribute
per year. Mr. McCollom answered that employees may contribute a total maximum of $15,500 per
year. The percentage varies based upon the employee’s income, but that amount is indexed by the
IRS and can increase each year.
Chair Sanders asked if there is a way to establish a fund so that the employer does not have the
social security indebtedness on the matching of contributions. Ms. Williams said that she does not
believe that there is a possibility of that under the 457 plan, that she will check on it and let the
Council know. Chair Sanders asked if that information can be given to the Committee before the
Council meeting on December 17, as the proposal may be amended to include some other fund that
keeps the City from paying that tax. Ms. Williams said that it depends on whether a 457 plan in
general permits such. She said that she has had very limited experience with social security offset
plans, and the situations in which she has witnessed them used have been with a money purchase
plan.
Councillor Nytes moved, seconded by Councillor Bateman, to forward Proposal No. 527, 2007 to
the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried by a vote of 4-0.
PROPOSAL NO. 425, 2007 - urges the Council to consider a reduction in the amount of the
property tax levy needed to generate the tax increment replacement amount as determined
pursuant to I.C. 6-1.1-21-11(b) in certain tax districts

Administration and Finance Committee
December 11, 2007
Page 4

Chair Sanders asked if there is anyone to speak to the proposal. She said that she would entertain a
motion to strike or postpone the proposal, but that it falls off at the end of the year.
Councillor Bateman moved, seconded by Councillor McWhirter, to “Strike” Proposal No. 425,
2007. The motion carried by a vote of 4-0.
PROPOSAL NO. 522, 2007 - transfers and appropriates $1,138,000 in the 2007 Budget of the
Information Services Agency (Information Services Internal Services Fund) to purchase FileNet
software upgrades for the Department of Metropolitan Development, for other expenses related to
the DMD and DPW move to new offices on Madison, and for computer hardware to be used
throughout the enterprise
Aaron Hood, Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Information Services Agency (ISA), distributed a
handout (attached as Exhibit A) outlining the detailed numbers supporting his presentation. He said
that the necessity for the requested appropriation is to reimburse ISA’s budget for expenses that
were incurred by various city/county departments and agencies which were not originally included
in ISA’s budget for this year. Mr. Hood stated that some of the projects listed on Exhibit A are
currently in progress and some have been completed this year, but all projects listed make up the
requested amount. Mr. Hood said that the eStreem Fax Solution Software product will help the
Department of Metropolitan Development (DMD) streamline paper faxes to save quite a bit of
money on the costs associated with faxing. Mr. Hood said that since ISA is an Internal Services
Fund, their situation is unique as they are in a double-budgeting situation, where some of the 56
departments and agencies within the enterprise have expenses allocated in their budgets as well as
being included in ISA’s budget. He said that ISA has worked with the Office of Finance and
Management (OFM) throughout the year with these unplanned expenses, but decided that it was
best to come before the Committee at the end of the year with a comprehensive list, versus
appearing before the Committee several times during the year. Mr. Hood added that $253,000 will
be moved from ISA’s Character 01 to Character 03, due to underspending in Character 01. He said
that ISA’s fund balance will be reimbursed by the specific departments. However, ISA is
requesting that the Council approve the appropriation, because the reimbursed funds go back into
the fund balance as revenue, and are not placed back into ISA’s spendable budget.
Councillor McWhirter asked why ISA is using part of their Character 01 funds, if the money is
reimbursable by the different departments. Jeff Seidenstein, Budget Manager, OFM, answered that
ISA had more appropriations in Character 01 than they will spend, due to attrition and turnover.
The alternative would be for ISA to ask for a total increase of $1.1 million in their budget. Since
they will underspend some of their Character 01, OFM suggested that they simply transfer some of
those appropriations, so that the net total requested is less.
Councillor Nytes commented that she believes that it was a good idea for ISA to appropriate in this
way, as requesting the total $1.1 million would probably have led to additional discussions about
how much underspending the department had for the year. She asked for an explanation of the need
for the fax software for DMD, with the decreased demand for faxing. Shital Patel, Chief
Information Officer (CIO), ISA, said that the fax solution software is to automate faxing duties and
move away from paper faxing. Councillor Nytes asked if this software is for making faxing more

Administration and Finance Committee
December 11, 2007
Page 5

technologically advanced. Ms. Patel answered in the affirmative, and stated that all faxing would
be done electronically.
Councillor Bateman moved, seconded by Councillor Nytes, to forward Proposal No. 522, 2007 to
the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried by a vote of 4-0.
Mr. Hood asked for the Committee’s permission for ISA’s Project Manager, Dan Pavey, to give a
brief update regarding the property system. Consent was given.
[Clerk’s note: The Presentation portion of this meeting will be distributed at a later date.]
PROPOSAL NO. 523, 2007 - approves temporary tax anticipation borrowing and authorizes the
City to refinance warrants issued to make temporary loans for the use of certain funds and
accounts in anticipation of current taxes levied in the year 2006 and still collectible in the 2007
budget year and to make and refinance temporary loans during 2008 in anticipation of current
taxes levied in the year 2007 and collectible in 2008, authorizing the issuance of tax anticipation
time warrants to evidence such loans, pledging and appropriating the taxes to be received in such
funds to the payment of such warrants, including the interest thereon
Barbara Lawrence, Director, Indianapolis Bond Bank, distributed an updated version of Proposal
No. 523, 2007’s Exhibit A (attached to these minutes and hereinafter referred to as Exhibit C) and
Proposal No. 524, 2007’s Exhibit A (attached as Exhibit D). She said that the exhibit that was
originally filed with the resolution was based on levy, but Jim Steele, Fiscal Consultant, went back
and reconciled what the difference would be. Mr. Steele distributed a memo including the
estimated 2007 property tax distributions and shortfall (attached as Exhibit E). Ms. Lawrence said
that the Bond Bank’s Tax Warrant Program has been in existence for 20 years. She said that the
Bond Bank comes before the Council every year to seek approval for the program that was formed
to alleviate cash flow problems between when the property tax is actually received and when
expenditures need to be made. She said that the Bond Bank has issued over $2.2 billion in Tax
Revenue Anticipation Notes, which are short-term notes that typically cover about 80% of the
property tax levy. She said that Proposal 523, 2007 is a resolution that deals specifically with the
City, and Exhibit C illustrates that the 2007 amount has been reconciled between the levy and the
amount that was actually received, which is the actual distribution amount that is reflected on the
second page of Exhibit E. She added that Exhibit D reflects the same for Proposal No. 524, 2007.
Ms. Lawrence said that the 2008 amount is summarized, but is the same amount that was included
in the original resolution, and actually represents 100% of the levy. She said that the total amount
for the city will be $314,935,989. Ms. Lawrence said that the first part of the program is to come
before the Committee seeking approval to do the Bond Bank’s traditional six-month issuance for
the 2008 program. She said that the program would typically consist of two six-month programs
with a “true up” after the first of the year, and then after the first of July, and reconciling with
distributions. She said that she is also seeking approval for the 2007 portion, which is viewed as a
rollover of outstanding notes or a shortfall financing, based on the difference between what was
anticipated to be received and what was actually received. Ms. Lawrence said that one portion of
the request involves the standard structure, in which there may be some flexibility as to how the
structure looks in order to address the issues with reassessment, when the revenues are actually
received and when the reconciliation payment is received. She said that those potential structures
are being examined, and they anticipate that unlike most tax warrant issues, they would have a call

Administration and Finance Committee
December 11, 2007
Page 6

provision to include some flexibility to address when the reconciliation payments and actual
distributions are received. She said that the difference in this request is due to the reassessment
issue.
Mr. Steele said that the memo portion of Exhibit E explains the situation this year, which is unique
because of the reassessment order issued by the Department of Local Government Finance (DLGF).
He said that because the state has not distributed all of the Property Tax Replacement Credit
(PTRC) and the Homestead Credit (HSC), the amounts cannot be finally allocated until the
reassessment is completed and the true property tax bills are known for each taxpayer, including
how much they will receive for the credits. Mr. Steele said that the state has distributed 92.25% of
the PTRC and 66% of the HSC, which added to the collected amounts based upon the last billing
that was due December 10. Therefore, the Treasurer’s Office was able to determine how much has
been collected and is available for distribution. He said that this short-term borrowing takes place
because all of the money is not available, but it will be paid off once the reconciliation is completed
next spring and final settlement is made for the property taxes that were originally due in 2007. Mr.
Steele explained page 2 of Exhibit E. As an example, he stated that the County General Fund for
Marion County had a projected levy of $117,569,018, and with all of the revenues that have been
received year-to-date from the property taxpayers, the PTRC fund, and the state and county HSC
fund, $94,504,446 has been collected and is available for distribution, resulting in an actual shortfall
of $23,064,572. He said that these are actual numbers because the property tax bills have all been
calculated and allocated to the appropriate taxing units. Mr. Steele said that the total county
shortfall is about $48.7 million and the total city shortfall is about $42.2 million. He said that the
shortfall amounts match the amounts included in Exhibits C and D, with the exception that Exhibit
C includes a Tax Increment Financing amount that is not included on the spreadsheet attached to
Exhibit E.
Chair Sanders asked why Warren Township Fire has a separate line item listed on Exhibit C. Mr.
Steele answered that Warren Township Fire was consolidated with IFD this year, and therefore,
Warren Township still received the property tax levies for 2007. However, next year the taxing
area that was outside of the old IFD, but inside the old Warren Township Fire Department district
has a levy of $2.9 million for next year. He said that amount will be administered by the city next
year through the consolidation, so the city is asking to borrow up to that amount on tax warrants.
Mr. Steele said that these amounts are maximum, but not necessarily true amounts. Chair Sanders
asked if this line item will be nonexistent in 2008. Mr. Steele answered that he would anticipate
that amount would be included in the Fire Consolidated line item for 2008.
Councillor McWhirter stated that she is concerned with the blanks in the proposal and asked if an
amendment needs to be done to fill the blanks, as she does not like to pass proposals that are
incomplete. Ms. Lawrence answered that there are two issues: Proposal No. 523, 2007 needs to be
amended to substitute the new numbers for what was included in the original proposal, but the
blanks are reflective of what is considered the “form of the warrant” because it is considered an
exhibit and is always blank. Councillor McWhirter said that the ordinance for the county has
additional blanks that need to be filled. Ms. Lawrence said that those will be amended separately
from this proposal. Councillor McWhirter asked if the interest rate for this plan is known. Ms.
Lawrence answered that it will probably be in the low 3% to 3.25%, and added that the city will
also be earning interest on the unspent balance while paying interest for this program.

Administration and Finance Committee
December 11, 2007

Councillor Nytes asked if the borrowing of $74 million more for the city and $48 million more for
the county is due to the suspension of the tax collections at the 2007 level. Mr. Steele answered that
these amounts are in addition to what the city and county planned to borrow because of the late
settlement. Councillor Nytes asked if the borrowing is reflective of collecting less than expected
and collecting later than planned. Mr. Steele answered in the affirmative. Councillor Nytes said
that she realizes that until the bonds are sold, the money is drawn down, and the bill is paid; exactly
how much this will cost is not known, but she wonders if there is an estimate of the total costs. She
asked if there will be additional appropriations requested in budgets after the first of the year to
accommodate additional interest expenses. Mr. Steele answered in the affirmative, and stated that
he believes that there is actually another proposal that will be heard at this meeting that will request
additional appropriations for 2007. Councillor Nytes asked if this will need to be revisited again for
2008. Mr. Steele answered in the affirmative. He stated that he has been working with Mike
Rodman and Cindy Land, in the Treasurer’s Office, and commented that they have been great in
gathering all of the information, determining where all the money goes, and allocating as much
money as possible back to the local units of government.
Councillor Nytes asked if this same process will need to happen for every school district, the
library, the bus company, and every department that is supported by property taxes. Mr. Steele
answered in the affirmative, and stated that the Treasurer’s Office notified all local units of
government in Marion County that receive property tax of the amount that they will receive in
settlement at the end of this month, so that they can calculate what their shortfall is and anticipate
any necessary borrowing.
Councillor Nytes moved, seconded by Councillor McWhirter, to “Amend” Proposal No. 523, 2007
to substitute the spreadsheet included as Exhibit A in the proposal with the spreadsheet reflected on
Exhibit C. The motion carried by a vote of 4-0.

PROPOSAL NO. 524, 2007 - approves temporary tax anticipation borrowing and authorizes the
County to refinance warrants issued to make temporary loans for the use of certain funds and
accounts in anticipation of current taxes levied in the year 2006 and still collectible in the 2007
budget year and to make and refinance temporary loans during 2008 in anticipation of current
taxes levied in the year 2007 and collectible in 2008, authorizing the issuance of tax anticipation
time warrants to evidence such loans, pledging and appropriating the taxes to be received in such
funds to the payment of such warrants, including the interest thereon
Ms. Lawrence said that there are two blanks in the proposal that should be filled in with actual
numbers from Exhibit D. The total amount for 2007 should be entered under the second “whereas”,
section A and in Section 1 of the proposal and the total amount for 2008 should be entered under the
second “whereas”, section B and in Section 2 of the proposal.
Councillor McWhirter moved, seconded by Councillor Nytes, to technically “Amend” Proposal No.
524, 2007 to insert the amounts as stated above. The motion carried by a vote of 4-0.

Councillor Nytes moved, seconded by Councillor Bateman, to “Amend” Proposal No. 524, 2007 to
substitute the spreadsheet included as Exhibit A in the proposal with the spreadsheet reflected on
Exhibit D. The motion carried by a vote of 4-0.
Councillor Bateman moved, seconded by Councillor Nytes, to forward Proposal No. 524, 2007 to
the full Council with a “Do Pass as Amended” recommendation. The motion carried by a vote of
4-0.
Councillor Nytes thanked all the staff of the city and county for making sacrifices to compensate for
this very unusual year with regard to the property tax system. She stated that she feels that all the
employees need to be commended for their resourcefulness and their patience, as the work of the
city and county is still getting done even with all the changes and adjustments in funding being
made.
PROPOSAL NO. 525, 2007 - appropriates $3,093,901 in the 2007 Budgets of the Revenue
Serviced Debt Funds of the City of Indianapolis, the Office of Finance and Management and the
County to pay interest expense for revenue bonds, County Option Income Tax anticipation loans
and tax anticipation warrants
Chuck White, Deputy Controller, distributed a handout (attached as Exhibit F) and said that there
are a number of things in this proposed ordinance.
Councillor Bateman moved, seconded by Councillor Nytes, to amend Proposal No. 525, 2007 as
stated in Exhibit G. The motion carried by a vote of 4-0.
Mr. White said that in preparing the 2007 budget for the city, $9 million of county option income
tax (COIT) notes were issued to get the city through 2006, which had to be repaid in 2007. He said
that the amounts in the first column of Exhibit F reflect the interest that the departments that
received the notes had to pay. He said that the “Bridge” tax warrants represents the interests that
the City owed for money borrowed, due to the property tax distributions not being received in June,
as normal. Mr. White said that the third column represents the additional amount that was required
for the tax warrants for IMPD General, Fire General, and Parks General, due to late receipt of
property taxes. He said that when a debt issue happens late in the year, the budget for the incoming
year does not contain the details as to exactly what the debt service is going to be. Therefore, an
ordinance has to be done to fund all of the interest for the bonds that have been issued. He said that
this appropriation was accounted for in the budget process.
Councillor McWhirter asked what the differences are in the original ordinance versus the amended
one. Hope Tribble, Budget Manager, OFM, said that the first change is in Section 1, and simply
notes, as requested by the CFO for the Council, that the tax anticipation borrowings are additional
expenses expected to be realized due to the delay in tax collections, and the Sanitation Revenue
Bonds fund was erroneously omitted from the 2007 Budget. She said that the second change on
page 3 is a technical correction of the fund name from Consolidated County Capital Cumulative
Fund to City Cumulative Capital Development Fund, and the total for that line was incorrect. Also
there was a correction in the amount for the Sanitation Revenue Bonds Fund. The next change is on
page 4, and changes the fund name from the Consolidated County Capital Cumulative Fund to the

Administration and Finance Committee
December 11, 2007
Page 9

City Cumulative Capital Development Fund. The last change adds the words County Auditor in the
digest, as the word “Auditor” had been left out.
Councillor McWhirter asked if the changes were simply typographical errors that reflected no
change in the total. Ms. Tribble answered in the affirmative.
Councillor Nytes asked if the two middle columns reflected on Exhibit G indicate the additional
interest costs that the City has as a result of the additional borrowings from the delays in the receipt
of the property taxes. Mr. White answered in the affirmative.
Councillor Bateman moved, seconded by Councillor Nytes, to forward Proposal No. 525, 2007 to
the full Council with a “Do Pass as Amended” recommendation. The motion carried by a vote of
4-0.
PROPOSAL NO. 526, 2007 - approves disposal of certain parcels that have an appraised value of
$50,000 or more by the Marion County Board of Commissioners
Mike Rodman, County Commissioner, distributed a handout (attached as Exhibit H), and said that
when the Commissioners have county property, they are charged with the responsibility of
disposing of those properties and getting them back on the tax roles. However, a property that
exceeds a certain amount has to come before the full Council. Currently, there are six properties
that exceed that amount. Mr. Rodman said that he has been pleased that a number of the members
of the public have come to the Commissioners’ meetings this year. He said that letters from King
Park and Englewood Development Corporation have been included in Exhibit H, along with some
resolutions from the Parks Department.
Cindy Land, Deputy Treasurer, said that four of the properties are actually county assets, of which
three are properties that the courts have asked the Commissioners to dispose of. The Mayor granted
the County Commissioners the authority to dispose of county-owned properties. She said that one
of the properties used to be affiliated with the county home and has been used as farmland. Two
other properties have delinquent taxes. She said that because these properties have an assessed
value of more than $50,000, they have to get the Council’s approval to dispose of the properties.
Ms. Land said that Exhibit H provides relevant information about each property, such as councillor
for the district, neighborhood liaison and Community Development Corporation (CDC)
information, appraisal amount, highest and best use recommended, and suggested disposition. She
said that she will talk about some specifics of each.
Ms. Land said that they have been working closely with the neighborhood liaisons of the 447 E. 38th
Street property, and the liaisons have been communicating with the CDC. The Commissioner’s
Office is hoping to work with a group of CDCs and neighborhood groups in that area to see if there
is some way for the neighborhood to obtain the title of that property.
Ms. Land said that the property at 5440 E. 38th Street is in the United North East district, and they
have worked with Kyle Clark, neighborhood liaison. The property is in Councillor Bateman’s
district. She said that there is a letter included in Exhibit H from James Davie with United North
East, and they are trying to work with them to see if the CDC can obtain funding to buy the

Administration and Finance Committee
December 11, 2007
Page 10

property. The CDC is very interested in the property. Councillor Bateman asked if the CDC is
willing to pay face value for the property. Ms. Land said that no official negotiations have been
made, as they have only been getting information out to determine interests.
Ms. Land said that there are four different representatives from different organizations here
displaying interest in the 2528-2542 N. Delaware Street property. She said that the included letters
from King Park and Englewood Development are directed toward this property. Ms. Land said that
the Commissioners’ Office is trying to determine the best direction that should be taken to include
everyone’s interest. She said that this particular property may be a little more complicated to
resolve than the others, because some people feel that the building should be torn down and more
Fall Creek-type housing should be built. Some want senior housing developed and some want to
contribute to the cause and mission of the Crane House. Ms. Land said that they would like to put
the property out for bid.
Ms. Land said that the property on Massachusetts Avenue and Sherman Avenue used to be a DriveIn Theatre. It is believed that this property needs to be disposed of in a public auction. Councillor
McWhirter said that she wonders how some of the properties got into the situation where more
property taxes are owed on the property than the property is worth. Chair Sanders asked how many
acres are included with this property. Ms. Land answered that it is 4.88 acres.
Ms. Land said that the Parks Department has indicated that they are interested in the Sutherland
Avenue property, and the Commissioners passed a resolution to transfer the property to the Parks
Department, who will adopt a similar resolution for the property. Ms. Land said that because some
of the properties have been delinquent in taxes for many years, they were already in their third or
fourth year of delinquency before the county took title. She said that the Commissioners have had
possession of the Sutherland Avenue property, but there have been long-term discussions with
Parks to try to get negotiations finished. Ms. Land said that it will cost Parks significantly, because
the building needs to be demolished. In addition, the Commissioners would also like to transfer the
Troy Avenue property to the Parks Department. They refer to this property as the Kitley property
because of its location. It consists of 60 acres, of which 15 acres are complete woodland that they
would like to keep as woodland. She said that copies of resolutions from the County
Commissioners and the Parks Department are included in Exhibit H.
Ruth Powell, Vice President of Citizens Coalition, said that the neighborhood is interested in the
property at 2542 N. Delaware. She said that they believe that a beautiful place can be put on this
property for the senior citizens that live and want to stay in the neighborhood. She said that she
would like to see something other than another high rise building that senior citizens cannot afford.
Janine Betsey, Executive Director at King Park, said that King Park has had the opportunity to work
with some other surplus opportunities with the Treasurer’s Office, but this is one of the first
opportunities they have had to hopefully facilitate a process that promotes more community buy-in
than dissolution. She said that there has been a lot of growth and change in the neighborhood, and
this would be a great opportunity to develop a win-win situation. She said that they can easily pull
together some of the funding to acquire the property and make a great project happen. She said that
it is rare for them to attract and obtain parcels of this size in their neighborhood.

Administration and Finance Committee
December 11, 2007

Shanda McPike, Englewood Development Company, said that they have met with King Park about
a possible joint venture. She said that they have about 30 years of experience developing senior
housing and affordable family housing in Indiana, Illinois, and Arizona. She said that they have had
discussions with King Park about affordable senior housing, with a potential meal center and other
ideas that would positively impact the community. Ms. McPike said that she lives in the
neighborhood and, therefore, has a personal and business vested interest.
Councillor McWhirter asked Ms. McPike if she is suggesting that Englewood is interested in
developing senior housing and a senior community center of some type. Ms. McPike answered in
the affirmative, and stated that their discussions have included some type of meal center so that
seniors in the community could get meals.
Jane Haldiman, New Northside Neighborhood Organization, said that she has lived in the
neighborhood for 44 years. She said that with all the work that has been done in the area, there still
is not much being done to provide rental opportunities for people with the lowest incomes. She said
that so much stress has been put on homeownership, but there needs to be more options for senior
citizens. She said that the new high-rise developments are not made available for those with low
incomes. She said that she feels that the general economic base of the neighborhood should be
taken into account with the various neighborhood plans.
Suzanne Pierce, Executive Director for John P. Crane House, an alternative sentencing program for
female offenders and their pre-school age children. She said that they are at their 30th year of
operation and at a position to expand. She said that they are only a few blocks away. She said that
she has toured the facility and it is in bad shape, but she believes that it has a lot of potential.
Chair Sanders asked Ms. Land what the process is once permission has been granted to dispose of
the properties and how much time it will take to complete the process. Ms. Land said that it will be
different with some of the properties, as she believes that the property on Delaware will take more
time to complete the process of dissolution. She said that they will continue to talk with the
neighborhoods and try to negotiate the pricing, but it should hopefully be a short period of
approximately 30 to 60 days, because the buildings are all empty. She said that if negotiations
cannot be worked out with the neighborhoods, perhaps the properties will be able to be sold at
public auction. She said that she would like to continue working with DMD and other center
township neighborhood coordinators, as she has had meetings with them, to talk about the Delaware
property. She said that she would like to put together a committee to decide what direction to take
with the property and put it out for bid. If a particular use is identified it can be expressed to
bidders.
Mr. Rodman said that it has been about a year since he came before the Committee about the Kitley
property, which at the time he suggested could be sold at a significant price. He said that he
believes that Councillor Nytes suggested that it might be good for Parks, and on reflection, it has
been worked out to transfer it, as well as the Sutherland property, to the Parks Department, because
park land is hard to find. He said that even though they could possibly get more money if it goes
out to bid, the highest bidder may not put the property to the highest and best use for the county.
Ms. Land said that she hopes to have resolution with most of the properties within a couple of
months, but they want to make sure that they have thoroughly thought through and made the best

Administration and Finance Committee
December 11, 2007
Page 12

possible decision with the Delaware property. She said that she would expect it to take no more
than six months to resolve the Delaware property.
Councillor Nytes moved, seconded by Councillor Bateman, to forward Proposal No. 526, 2007 to
the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried by a vote of 4-0.
PROPOSAL NO. 531, 2007 - appoints Councillor Jackie Nytes as a member of the High
Performance Government Team, pursuant to General Ordinance No. 47, 2007 (Proposal No. 388,
2007)
Chair Sanders said that this team was put together a few months ago in an effort to obtain a
complete overview of various agencies and departments to determine what the best means is by
which they can measure their performance and what types of procedures they can impose within
their agencies or departments to be the most efficient and have the best use of their budgets. She
said that as a Council, members have the authority to make appointments, which will consist of one
Democrat and one Republican for this team, who will be ex-officio members.
Councillor Bateman moved, seconded by Councillor McWhirter, to forward Proposal No. 531, 2007
to the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried by a vote of 3-0-1, with
Councillor Nytes abstaining from the vote.
Chair Sanders said that this is the final action of this Committee. She said as chair of the
Administration and Finance Committee, she has been very pleased to be a part of much of what has
happened in the last several years relative to the budget. She said that she did have the opportunity
to serve on the Committee prior to being chair, and as a fiscal conservative, it has been her pleasure
to serve both as a member and as chair and she hopes to be able to serve more in the future. She
said that she does want to point out that the Council is saying goodbye to Councillor McWhirter, as
this is the end of her term. She said that the Committee wishes her the best, and she has enjoyed
working directly with her and enjoyed the questions that she posed, as they helped them all to better
understand the issues that have been presented before the Committee. She wished her future
success and enjoyment with her family. Chair Sanders added that Councillor Langsford is also
leaving the Council and wished him well, as he has been on the Committee for quite some time and
has served well in the issues of public finance.
With no further business pending, and upon motion duly made, the Administration and Finance
Committee of the City-County Council was adjourned at 6:53 p.m.
Respectfully submitted,
Joanne Sanders, Chair

RULES AND PUBLIC POLICY COMMITTEE
The Rules and Public Policy Committee of the City-County Council met on Monday,
June 13, 2011. Chairman Michael McQuillen called the meeting to order at 5:31 p.m.
with the following members present: Bob Cockrum, Monroe Gray, Robert Lutz, Angel
Rivera, Joanne Sanders and Ryan Vaughn. Angela Mansfield was absent. General
Counsel Robert Elrod represented Council staff.
Chairman McQuillen asked Committee members to introduce themselves and indicate
which portion of the county they represent.
Chairman McQuillen asked for consent to hear Proposal No. 161, 2011 first. Consent
was given.
PROPOSAL NO. 161, 2011 - amends or repeals certain provisions of the Code
regarding dangerous weapons and firearms to comply with Senate Bill 292, 2011
Councillor Rivera said that new state law adds some restrictions regarding carrying
firearms on park property, and local governments cannot enact legislation that
contradicts or overrides that language. The new law goes into effect in 17 days, and
this proposal simply makes the Code in compliance with State law.
Councillor Sanders stated that she understands they are under pressure by the State to
make this change, but she is opposed to it, because she believes that local
governments should have the right and authority to regulate firearms in their own
communities.
Chairman McQuillen asked if there is the option to do this or not, and if it has to be
done. Councillor Rivera said that if the Code is not changed, it would stand in contrast
to the State law. General Counsel Robert Elrod stated that as of July 1st, the city’s
Code would be invalid whether it was changed or not. The danger in not changing the
Code language to make it compliant is that all enforcement regarding firearms might be
considered unenforceable by the court if, even in part, the local Code violates State law.
Chairman McQuillen said that it seems to be State mandated to change it.
Councillor Vaughn said that, while he agrees with Councillor Sanders’ sentiment, this
Council is compelled to act in order to insure that laws are enforceable. Councillor
Vaughn moved, seconded by Councillor Rivera, to send Proposal No. 161, 2011 to the
full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation.
Councillor Gray asked what happens if the Council does not pass this proposal. Mr.
Elrod said that the State statute says that any provision enacted before June 30, 2011

Rules and Public Policy Committee
June 13, 2011
Page 2
becomes void. If the Council chooses not to pass this proposal, they would have
existing law on the books that violates that statute, and then the question becomes how
much of that provision is unenforceable because one part of it is unenforceable.
Councillor Vaughn said that it is this body’s duty to administer written local ordinances,
and if those ordinances become unenforceable, they should either take them off the
books or re-write them to comply with the law.
The motion to send Proposal No. 161, 2011 to the full Council with a “Do Pass”
recommendation carried by a vote of 6-1, with Councillor Gray casting the negative
vote.
PROPOSAL NO. 157, 2011 - amends the Code to license and regulate tow businesses
that engage in non-consensual towing and to place requirements and restrictions on the
manner in which non-consensual towing may be performed
Adam Collins, administrator of the Bureau of License and Permit Services, Department
of Code Enforcement (DCE), introduced Nicole Randol, DCE Deputy Director
overseeing administration and finance, licenses and permits, and logistics. Mr. Collins
said that the administration has received a number of complaints regarding nonconsensual towing from private parking lots related to lack of signage, excessive tow
and storage fees, difficulty with vehicle redemption hours, and towing of vehicles to
areas outside of Marion County. He said that they have been working with Councillors
to review reasonable best practices, and are looking at this issue in a narrowly tailored
way related to the problems and complaints they have received. He said that Proposal
No. 157, 2011 deals with non-consensual tows within the Consolidated City. If the tow
originated in another county or excluded city, it is not covered under these regulations.
He said that towing companies under contract with the city are also covered. He said
that DCE has tried to design this regulation along the lines of other like businesses and
industries that they regulate, such as taxis, limousines, and horse-drawn carriages. He
said that there are standard measures the department takes with each of these license
carriers. He provided a brief powerpoint presentation for Committee members. {Clerk’s

Councillor Sanders asked if someone operating a business in Hamilton County would
have to be licensed by Marion County to provide tows within the County. Mr. Collins
responded in the affirmative. Councillor Sanders referred to the written authorization

Rules and Public Policy Committee
June 13, 2011

component. She said that if she lived in an apartment complex and came home from
work at 2:00 a.m. and found another car parked in her parking space, she would
normally just call to have the car towed. However, with this new language, it looks like a
tenant could not call to get a car towed unless there was an authorized agent there to
sign for the tow. Councillor Vaughn said that this is correct, unless per the apartment
lease, the landlord allows a tenant to be the authorized agent for their parking space.
Councillor Rivera asked if this provision was included to limit tow trucks from just
randomly driving by and towing vehicles. Mr. Collins said that this provision was
included so that the owner of the lot will know when cars are towed. He said that they
are not banning the surveillance by towing companies of privately owned lots, but are
making sure vehicles are being towed legitimately.
Councillor Vaughn agreed that this provision poses a unique problem for apartment
complexes, and perhaps the language can be adjusted somewhat to meet their specific
needs. He said that there are typically three types of tows that occur: 1) an emergency
tow, such as in the event of a fire, the blocking of a fire hydrant, or inaccessibility to a
handicapped space; 2) an abandoned vehicle, which is usually first tagged and then
towed; and 3) a vehicle that is parked in a space registered to someone else for their
use. He said that this last type is the tricky one, and he is open to suggestions for
language to address this. He said, however, that they want to avoid the abrigation of
the property rights from the owner to the towing companies. He said that this proposal
is far from perfect, and he is open to ideas, but they do not want to abrigate that
enforcement responsibility to the towing company itself, because towing companies
could possibly be financially motivated to take possession of someone’s property in that
instance.
Councillor Sanders said that she does not disagree with that, however, it is a tricky
situation. If the property owner were to give tenants the authority to have cars towed,
then nothing could prevent a tenant from taking personal revenge on a neighbor with
whom they may be angry and having their car towed for unrelated issues. She said that
she is not sure this can be controlled easily through an ordinance. Councillor Vaughn
said that if an apartment has a specific spot that is theirs and they arrive home at 2:00
a.m. to find someone in their space, there must be some process in place, or a number
that they call to facilitate a tow. This proposed language just puts that responsibility as
the intermediate contact upon the property owner’s shoulders.
Councillor Lutz said that in his private law practice, he represents a towing company.
Although this ordinance does not benefit his client or himself in any way, he wanted to
disclose that relationship. He asked if this ordinance will apply to cars parked illegally in
the City-County Building, as he often arrives in the garage to find someone else parked
in his space. Councillor Rivera said that the authority to tow in this building lies solely
with the Sheriff’s Department.

Rules and Public Policy Committee
June 13, 2011
Page 4
Chairman McQuillen asked if there is anything in the language to prevent a property
owner from having a shared contact person for an apartment complex. He said that
some apartment owners have a concern that this would add a financial burden to have
an employee on site 24/7 who is not affiliated with the tow company. Mr. Collins said
that there is nothing to prohibit shared contact personnel, but the contact cannot be
affiliated with the tow company, because this again creates the possibility of a financially
motivated tow.
Councillor Cockrum asked in the event of two vehicles being involved in an accident,
and subsequently being deemed non-serviceable and removed to a nearby service
station parking lot, who has the authority to have those vehicles moved. Councillor
Vaughn said that the business owner of the service station could have those vehicles
removed once they have been tagged and notified that the investigation is complete.
Councillor Gray asked if the property owners would then have to hire someone to work
at these parking lots who would have the authority to call the towing company, but they
could not be affiliated with any such towing company. Mr. Collins stated that this is
correct.
Chairman McQuillen asked with regards to the payment types slide, if there are some
towing companies that currently only accept cash. Mr. Collins responded in the
affirmative.
Councillor Sanders asked how current fees relate to the current practice and what the
going rate for towing and storage is at this time. Mr. Collins said that the fee cap
provided in the proposal is on the high end of the rates currently being charged, and a
majority of local towing companies are below that threshhold. Councillor Sanders said
that the storage rate seems low compared to some of the incidents she has heard about
and the gouging that is taking place with some residents. Mr. Collins said that the
gouging is the reason for creating a market standard. Councillor Vaughn said that there
is currently no standard, and some continuity in this area needs to be provided. He said
that he asked DCE to look at similar sized jurisdictions and whether or not they capped
fees, and if so, at what amount. He said that they looked at Cincinnati, St. Louis,
Louisville, D.C. and a few others to come up with these amounts, and the majority of
local tow companies found these amounts to be reasonable. Councillor Sanders said
that setting a cap, however, will likely mean that anyone now operating at a $110 rate,
will raise their rate to the $150 cap.
Councillor Gray asked if this will eliminate an individual having to come to the CityCounty Building to retrieve their cars. Mr. Collins said that those required to come to
the City-County Building are involved in a different type of tow. Ms. Randol said that
this proposal only covers non-consensual towing from private lots.

Rules and Public Policy Committee
June 13, 2011
Page 5
Councillor Rivera said that he also did some of his own research in places like
Colorado, Austin, and New Jersey, and found these rates to be pretty reasonable and
standard.
Mr. Collins said that the record keeping will help with regard to investigation of
complaints about illegal towing. With regard to licensing fees, DCE engaged an
actuarial firm to determine the actual costs for administrating the fee, as is done with all
fees handled by DCE. He said that higher charges for those companies with additional
operators are necessary, because monitoring more drivers causes more administrative
work.
Councillor Sanders asked if she is a resident and her car is towed and she wants to
appeal that it was towed illegally, who she would call. Mr. Collins said that as with all
licensed entities, they do not want to immediately move to adjudication. He said that
the tenant should first go to the company, as many companies have been very
responsible and rectified the situation if a car indeed was towed illegally or in error. If
that does not produce the results the tenant desires, they can contact DCE or the
Mayor’s Action Center (MAC) to appeal. They would then check up on the incident and
contact that petitioner with their findings. Councillor Sanders asked if DCE’s number
will be published anywhere in the material a person receives when their car is towed.
Mr. Collins said that they have talked about various options to getting that information
out to the public in a way that is most effective. Councillor Sanders said that she would
suggest that they allow individuals to contact DCE directly, instead of going through the
MAC. She said that often a constituent is sent from the MAC to their Councillor, who
then has to contact DCE, and then get back with the constituent. By that time, the
constituent becomes very frustrated that they are getting bounced around, and
providing direct contact would possibly help alleviate some of that frustration.
Councillor Cockrum referred to page four of the proposal in Sec. 995-302 (a) and said
that this does seem to place an additional financial impact on the owner. He asked if
instead, some type of gating with a key code could be used. With respect to Sec. 995306 (b) (3), the way the language reads might imply that there are no storage fees
assessed at all, instead of making it clear that no storage fees would be charged for the
holiday on which the towing company was closed.
Councillor Cockrum moved, seconded by Councillor Vaughn, to “Amend” Proposal No.
157, 2011 to add the words “for the holiday” at the end of sub-item (3). The motion
carried by a vote of 7-0.
Councillor Rivera asked if there is anything in the proposal with regard to city vehicles,
such as a police car parking on a person’s property. Mr. Collins said that there are
provisions for emergency vehicles, but this is a good point, and they need to make sure
this is clear. Councillor Rivera asked what the process is for the towing company to
inform the police staff regarding where vehicles are towed. Ms. Randol said that this
would be a question best asked of the auto desk staff, and she will research this issue.

Rules and Public Policy Committee
June 13, 2011
Page 6
Councillor Rivera said that this is a concern, as often government is slow to process
vehicles in a timely manner, and they do not always have knowledge of the exact
location of a car if a person goes to redeem it rather quickly. He said that this service
should be provided in the least painful way.
Councillor Gray asked if this requires background checks on the business owners or the
drivers. Mr. Collins said that it only requires background checks of the drivers, and is
limited to driving under the influence (DUI) convictions and convictions of violent crime
in the last five years. Councillor Gray asked if this is something the towing company
would need to keep on record. Mr. Collins said that, as the licensor, DCE would keep
these on file in case of an audit.
Councillor Vaughn said that in drafting this ordinance, they received input from DCE, the
local towing association, and the community. He said that he believes they are 90%
there in terms of coming up with an acceptable proposal. He said that this is really a
supplement to the State law that regulates towing, and asked, as there have been
complaints that some of the towing companies do not follow the State law, if this
proposal would tie the issuance and renewal of their licenses to filling out the proper
forms and complying with local and State laws. Mr. Collins said that there is nothing
specific that ties those pieces together, but all licensees have the obligation to follow
State and Federal law, as well as local regulations. Although this may be implied, a
license can be revoked for those violating criminal law. Councillor Vaughn said that it
would make sense to also add some provisions regarding immoveable and inoperable
vehicles, as there is some indication that this is not being policed or enforced as it
should. He said that although it may be an obvious statement of fact, he would like to
see language added that licensees are required to follow all State and Federal laws
regarding towing, as well.
Councillor Lutz said that he has some concerns about the five-year rule. He said that if
someone has paid their debt to society, their driving privileges have been restored and
they have been released from probation or parole, he does not understand why they
should not be allowed to drive a tow truck. Mr. Collins said that they researched other
jurisdictions, and this corresponds with the city’s own provisions for taxi drivers. In
hauling a truck that size with a vehicle behind it, they feel that best practices are
needed.
Councillor Sanders asked where the language is included that requires background
checks and who is responsible for performing the checks. Councillor Lutz said that this
language is found in Sec. 994-204 on page four of the proposal. Mr. Collins said that
owners would have the option to go through the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police
Department (IMPD) downstairs for around $10, or they could do like some taxi
operators, who pay an additional $5 to get results in a few hours rather than waiting a
week or more. Councillor Sanders said that the proposal does not specifically state who
requests the background check. Councillor Lutz said that he believes it is included in
the application section of the proposal. Chairman McQuillen said that the application

Rules and Public Policy Committee
June 13, 2011
Page 7
language is in Sec. 995-203 (c). Councillor Sanders said that it just seems to be
inferred, but nothing specific is mentioned. Mr. Collins said that he agrees, and they
can review this language and address that issue.
Chairman McQuillen called for public testimony at 6:30 p.m.
Lynn Sullivan, Indiana Apartment Association, said that they own and manage over
200,000 apartment communities, with 70,000 in Marion County. She thanked the
committee for hearing their concerns. She added that there is still one issue that
concerns them, as apartment owners. She referred to the requirement that the owner
or their representative be present at the time of tow. She said that many of their
complexes have permit parking, and tow operators are hired to patrol their lots after
hours. They are contracted to tow unauthorized vehicles, people parked illegally in
handicapped spots, or vehicles parked in fire lanes or elsewhere that might present a
safety issue. She said that most of their communities do not have employees or
representatives on site in the middle of the night. As the proposal is currently
presented, they would have to hire additional staff or send someone out in the middle of
the night to authorize each tow. She said that they are not opposed to the proposal as
a whole, but they employ responsible tow companies for their many varied apartment
communities; and they are very careful not to tow away residents in error, as they would
have a bigger issue if they lost their residents. She said that there are also safety
issues involved if the residents have no place to park and have to park in areas that are
not legitimate parking spaces. She said that giving one resident the authority to have
another resident’s vehicle towed might become an even bigger issue and is not a good
idea. She said that maybe some language could be drafted to somehow authorize
specific tow companies and require photos for proof of illegal parking.
Lisa Zender, Zender Family Partnership, said that they own and manage over 900
apartments, and in downtown have 600 spaces on 15 private parking lots. She said
that these spaces are reserved strictly for permit parking, and they have contracted with
Last Chance Wrecker to handle patrols after 11:00 p.m. and tow anyone without a valid
parking permit. She said that the service the towing company provides insures that
their residents have a place to park at night. She said that as the proposal is written, it
would raise operating costs for apartment owners in order to provide personnel to
authorize a tow in the middle of the night, and this would, in turn, force them to raise
parking rates for residents. She added that all of their private lots have the tow
company name and phone number posted so that anyone who had their vehicle towed
would know exactly where to go to get their car. She said that if this proposal is
approved, the city would be taking their rights away to remove illegally parked vehicles
on their private lot.
Councillor Rivera asked how many tows are performed in the course of a month. Ms.
Zender said that maybe 20 cars a month are towed, depending on the functions going
on.

Councillor Vaughn said that before they go too far down this road, he wants to explain
that this proposal is in response to bad business citizens. Unfortunately, sometimes
bad actors make for bad laws. He said that it is likely that this initial effort is
overreaching and punishes some good actors out there. He said that many of the tow
companies with representatives here tonight follow the laws and conduct business well,
but unfortunately, some bad actors make action necessary. He said that they want to
show sensitivity to the concerns of apartment owners and they do not want to be overly
burdensome. This proposal comes about as a reaction to a lot of complaints coming
out of low-income, subsidized apartment complexes. Many residents in these areas do
not speak English well and are without recourse and feel they are being taken
advantage of. He said that this is a legitimate issue raised by the apartment complex
owners that needs to be reconciled, and they want the proposal to be a help to Broad
Ripple and Downtown, but they also want to protect those areas where residents
depend on a car for their paycheck and live week to week. Councillor Vaughn said that
it is not his desire to put an undue financail burden on the good guys, and he wants to
continue to work on the language. However, he believes the total delegation of towing
authorization should not be given to those who have a financial interest in the tow. He
said that he wants to make sure the apartment owners and public understand where
they are coming from with these new regulations and the reasons for proposing them.
Ms. Zender asked for an example of an improper tow. Councillor Vaughn said that
there have been a variety of instances, such as a tenant with a new or different car who
was not able to get a sticker on their car because the apartment office was not open.
The owner had applied for a permit, but had not yet received it. Sometimes the fees for
towing and stowage and getting the car back were upwards of $1,000, especially if they
also had to miss work because of lack of transportation or to go get their vehicle during
certain business hours. He said they are willing to work on the proposal more to
address concerns, but there has to be some measure that seeks to prevent improper
tows.
Councillor Lutz asked if most of the complexes have on-site security. Ms. Sullivan said
that some have courtesy officers, but they are not always readily available. Ms. Zender
said that some of their lots do, but not all of them, especially those downtown.
Adam Van Rooy, Van Rooy Properties and chairman of the board for the Indiana
Apartment Association, said that their properties issue permits to residents companywide. He said that the way Sec. 955-302 is written, the owner would have to be present
to tow. This is much easier said than done. Most of their properties do not have 24hour employees. They have 6,000 apartment units in Indiana, with 1,800 downtown
and 25 of those do not even have a leasing agent on site, as they are managed out of
the corporate office. Having to hire someone to be on site 24/7 is completely
cumbersome. Those parking in their lots without permits should be towed in a timely
manner in order to benefit their residents, and their tows are not illegal. He said that
this language needs to be adjusted to allow for towing of non-permitted vehicles without
authorization.

Rules and Public Policy Committee
June 13, 2011
Page 9
Councillor Rivera asked how this is handled in other states where Mr. Van Rooy has
properties . Mr. Van Rooy said that the residents understand the permit process and
the first thing they do when they get a new car is get a permit, as they do not want their
vehicles towed. He said that they very seldom tow a resident, and the towing agencies
they employ do not arbitrarily tow vehicles, and only tow those not paying rent in their
buildings without valid permits. He said that this is pretty much handled the same in all
the states where they manage properties.
Mike Holt, manager of Indy Towing, said that they agree with the licenses, signage, and
prohibition of kickbacks to owners. He thanked Councillor Vaughn and city
representatives for sitting down with the towing industry representatives and hearing
their concerns. He said that they share the apartment complexes’ opinion, as they
contract with them in good faith. If they perform illegal tows, the apartment owners
would cancel their contract. They usually are informed if a resident has a new car and
does not yet have a permit. He said that owners would be pressured to sign a liability
waiver. If someone stole a car, that car would be turned over to the city, and in order to
retrieve it, identification is required. He said that tow companies should also be allowed
to ask for identification. He said that setting a maximum fee would mean that they
would have to come back in five to ten years possibly to adjust that fee. Councillor
Vaughn said that a mechanism has been built in to allow the Code Enforcement board
to adjust that rate, so that it does not have to come back through this burdensome
process. Mr. Holt said that they agree with the fees, but Indiana law requires them to
notify the Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV) that a vehicle has been towed, and certified
letters are sent, after a 48-hour period. He said that they should be allowed to charge a
processing fee, especially when they have to do extra research to find out who owns a
towed vehicle, as they have to pay to access Indiana records. He said that he would
further suggest that Sec. 995-102 define parking lot towing at 13,000 pounds or below.
He said that there is more labor involved with bigger vehicles, like tractor trailers, dump
trucks or other vehicles, and therefore charges for those types of tows should possibly
be greater. He said that he would like to see other qualifications added.
Dr. Joe Kielor, citizen and downtown business owner, said that he lives downtown and
works on Massachusetts Avenue and can empathize with what others have been
saying. He said that there are many signs prohibiting illegal parking, and although he
pays $1,300 a month for his space, every day there is someone in his spot. He said
that he has 10 spots with the business he owns, and he also pays for those parking
spaces. He said that before he employed Last Chance, he was having to go out and
make people move every single day himself. He said that if the city wants to keep
businesses downtown, then they need to protect them. He said that he does not have
the money to pay for a pass code system to be put in, and there should not be cars on
his lot in the middle of the night, and if there are, it becomes a safety issue. He said
that there is no graffiti on their building, thanks in part to the towing contract, and while it
may seem like a little thing, he is trying to be a responsible part of the community. He
said that people often blatantly disregard the signs and rules, and he has often even

Rules and Public Policy Committee
June 13, 2011
Page 10
told violators in Spanish that they cannot park in a space, and they pretend not to
understand and come and park again in the same spot the next day.
Jim Olmstead, Olmstead Wrecker, said that if they accept credit cards or debit cards,
the vehicle owner could stop payment on the transaction after they get the vehicle back.
Councillor McQuillen said that this is the risk of every business owner. Mr. Olmstead
said that they would have to eat such a cost with a capped fee. Councillor McQuillen
asked if they could build that cost into their fee model. Mr. Collins said that they cannot
charge an additional fee for a credit card payment. Mr. McDermott, Office of
Corporation Counsel, stated that the maximum fee was formulated to take into account
anything else that might occur with regard to costs. He said that one of the complaints
is that people get nickeled and dimed with additional fees for towing, processing,
storage, etc. Councillor McQuillen said if a company charged $110 for their service
currently, and had to add the service of taking credit cards, then they could raise their
fees to the $150 maximum to compensate for any credit card fees.
Mr. Olmstead said that he works for some gas stations, with four to five parking spots,
and generally, the employee on duty calls and signs for the tow. He asked if they can
still sign for the tow. Councillor Vaughn said that they can still sign for it if they are
authorized. Mr. Olmstead suggested that when a company pays to be licensed as a
wrecker service, possibly they could register all the properties they tow for up front with
their license information, so that anyone who tows that is not licensed to tow from that
particular property could be violated or investigated. He said that if a tenant comes to
them and can show that their vehicle was improperly towed, they will make it right
immediately and release the vehicle with no fees. He said, however, that the majority of
complaints come from people who are parked illegally and should not be there to begin
with. Councillor Vaughn said that he does not disagree that often bad actors make bad
law, and they only want to protect those who are being taken advantage of by those bad
actors. He said that he has been towed twice, both times legally, and he deserved it;
but improper tows are what this proposal is trying to address. He said that he is more
than willing to work on the language of the proposal to address some valid concerns
raised this evening.
{Clerk’s Note: Councillor Cockrum left at 6:54 p.m.}
Mary Lucht, citizen, said that she was improperly towed at an apartment complex. She
said that from her experience, towing fees are excessive. If her car was wrecked, it
would cost $80 to tow the car to a repair shop, yet the towing companies charge a
person $145 for a non-consensual tow, which is substantially more than the actual cost
of the tow. She said then they are assessed $30 immediately off the lot. She said that
she would appreciate having access to someone to whom she could complain, as now
her only recourse is small claims court. Councillor Vaughn said that they asked DCE to
look at other cities like Cincinnati, Lousville, and D.C., as well as two in Texas. All of
those companies charged between $140 and $160, so they set the fee at an average
rate to split the difference. He said that they also asked the towing companies to submit

Rules and Public Policy Committee
June 13, 2011
Page 11
their charges, and most were between $110 and $190, so $150 seemed reasonable.
Companies, however, could charge less than that, as that is the maximum. Ms. Lucht
asked if they had access to itemized costs. Councillor Vaughn said that they did, and
many showed actual itemized tow receipts.
{Clerk’s Note: Councillor Gray left at 6:59 p.m.}
Councillor Vaughn moved, seconded by Councillor Rivera, to “Postpone” Proposal No.
157, 2011 until July 5, 2011. Councillor Vaughn said that he would have preferred to
vote the proposal out of Council at its June 27th meeting, but he believes they are 90 to
95% of the way there, and thinks it is prudent to postpone for one meeting. He said that
Councillors Hunter and Lutz and the Apartment Association also have some concerns
that need to be addressed. The motion carried by a vote of 6-0.
There being no further business, and upon motion duly made, the Rules and Public
Policy Committee was adjourned at 7:02p.m.
Respectfully Submitted,

ADMINISTRATION AND FINANCE COMMITTEE
The Administration and Finance Committee of the City-County Council met on Tuesday,
August 3, 2004. Chairwoman Jackie Nytes called the meeting to order at 5:30 p.m., with
the following members present: Vernon Brown, Becky Langsford, Lynn McWhirter, and
Lincoln Plowman. Absent were Steve Talley and Joanne Sanders. Representing Council
staff were Kent Burrow, Chief Financial Officer, and Cherrish Pryor, Legislative and
Public Affairs Director.
Chairwoman Nytes asked for consent to begin with Proposal No. 440, 2004 at the request
of Judge David Shaheed. Consent was given.
PROPOSAL NO. 440, 2004 – determines the need to lease approximately 1,888 square
feet of space at 251 East Ohio Street for use by the Marion Superior Court as office space
Judge Shaheed, Civil Court 5, said this proposal has no fiscal impact on the County. State
law requires that all agencies in the City-County Building that seek to have business
offices outside the building must have the lease and proposal come before the Council.
He said since 1998 they have had a drug treatment program and recently have expanded
the program with assistance from the Indiana Criminal Justice Institute. The grant
continues to fund the drug treatment court but also provides funding for two people to
assist with re-entry. He said currently about 1,100 offenders come back from the
Department of Corrections to Marion County on an annual basis. Half of those people are
monitored through the Community Transition Program. The grant will allow them to add
125 additional people that will be monitored through the court. He said the case manager
will assist offenders with issues of housing, job placement, health needs, etc. The purpose
of the program is to help offenders with re-entry into the community with less trouble and
with consideration of public safety. He said the lease is necessary because they have two
additional staff and the City County Building can no longer accommodate the drug
treatment staff.
Councillor McWhirter asked why there will be no cost to the County. Judge Shaheed said
they were able to get funding from the Department of Corrections that will cover the cost
of the lease and the one-time cost of moving. Councillor McWhirter asked if the
Department will continue to fund the lease. Judge Shaheed said they have a grant for the
next four years.
Chairwoman Nytes asked how long the lease is. Judge Shaheed said it is a four-year
lease. Chairwoman Nytes asked if they have determined that the owner of the building
does not have a conflict of interest in the lease. Judge Shaheed replied in the affirmative.
Councillor McWhirter moved, seconded by Councillor Brown, to send Proposal No. 440,
2004 to the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. This motion carried by a
vote of 5-0.

PROPOSAL NO. 438, 2004 – determines the need to lease approximately 3,700 square
feet of space at 51 South New Jersey Street for use by the Department of Public Safety,
Indianapolis Police Department, as helicopter hangar space and office space
Mike Green, Contracts/Project Manager, Department of Public Safety, said they are
already at the location of 51 South New Jersey Street. The old lease could not be
extended and a new lease had to be created. He said they are increasing storage space by
430 feet, but the cost per square foot will remain the same.
Councillor McWhirter asked if the increase of the lease is already in their budget. Mr.
Green said the cost is in their budget for 2004 and 2005.
Chairwoman Nytes asked how long the lease is. Mr. Green said the lease is for two years.
Councillor McWhirter moved, seconded by Councillor Brown, to send Proposal No. 438,
2004 to the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. This motion carried by a
vote of 5-0.
PROPOSAL NO. 439, 2004 – determines the need to lease approximately 4,270 square
feet of office space at 300 East Fall Creek Parkway North Drive for use as general office
space by the Department of Public Safety, Indianapolis Fire Department
Ernest Malone, Chief of Fire Prevention, Indianapolis Fire Department (IFD), said
currently the Fire Prevention office is located at 620 N. Sherman Drive, they were
approved for three additional inspectors and simply are out of space. He said the office
space at 300 East Fall Creek Parkway will give them an additional 1,400 square feet of
space for their staff and storage. He said they would also like to create a Marion County
Resource Center, where they will have books, manuals, videos, etc. for other Fire
Departments and agencies to use for research. He said the building will be multi-service
with full security and handicapped accessible. He said this proposal will be funded by a
grant with no fiscal impact and the lease is for four years.
Councillor Brown said their current location is not very accessible and the new location
will give them more room to grow and financially is a great deal.
Coucncillor McWhirter asked if they looked at other locations. Mr. Malone said that they
looked at many locations and the average price was between $13 and $15 per square foot.
He said at the proposed location they can negotiate a flexible lease if changes were
needed. Councillor McWhirter asked if any additional money will be needed down the
road. Mr. Malone said they do not expect any additional cost. Councillor McWhirter
asked how the research library will be funded. Mr. Malone said they already have some
of the materials through grants, and all other needs will be done through their funds.

Councillor McWhirter moved, seconded by Councillor Plowman, to send Proposal No.
439, 2004 to the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. This motion carried by
a vote 5-0.
PROPOSAL NO. 441, 2004 – approves a transfer of $142,060 in the 2004 Budget of
Voter’s Registration (County General Fund) to fund the cost of printing poll books
Cathline Mullin, Voter Registration, read from Exhibit A.
Councillor McWhirter asked how often they print poll books. Ms. Mullin said they print
them twice a year for both primary and fall elections. Councillor McWhirter asked if the
poll books were budgeted. Ms. Mullin said they did budget for the poll books, but the
price to print the poll books is very expensive. Councillor McWhirter asked from where
the $107,000 in personal services is coming. Cindy Mowery, Auditor’s Office, said there
are 14 positions in the Voter Registration Office with currently only 12 employees. This
is where the $107,000 is coming from.
Councillor Brown asked if the office is going to be able to underspend. Ms. Mullin said
this year they need the money but next year there is no election.
Councillor Plowman asked what the total price of the poll books is. Ms. Mullin said she
does not have the exact total and will get that information to him. Ms. Mowery said the
$142,060 that is being asked to be transferred is relatively close to the total of the poll
books.
Chairwoman Nytes asked if the poll books were underbudgeted. Ms. Mowery replied in
the affirmative and said Voter Registration sent out postcards to voters that was an
unanticipated expense. Chairwoman Nytes asked if perhaps the number of precincts
were to decrease, would this help in the cost of poll books. Ms. Mullin said that some of
the cost is due to the number of precincts, and the decrease in precincts could help in
cost.
Councillor McWhirter moved, seconded by Councillor Brown, to send Proposal No. 441,
2004 to the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. This motion carried by a
vote of 5-0.

Budget Hearing
Overview-City Controller
Barbara Lawrence, City Controller, explained the budget overview presentation (Exhibit
B, see file). Some highlights of the presentation include:

Administration and Finance Committee
August 3, 2004
Page 5
•

The city of Indianapolis has identified a new tenant, AAR Airline Services to take
a majority of the space at the United Airline Hub. Simon Property Group is going
to be building a new headquarters in downtown Indianapolis. On the south side, a
new housing development is being built.

•

The proposed budget continues to fund all basic services (police and fire services,
sewers, economic development, sidewalks, parks, etc.) residents expect from the
City and also continues to fund arts. The budget does not have any salary
reductions, and is funded with no tax increases.

•

The proposed 2005 budget will total $542.7 million. The budget was broken down
by projected revenues and expenditures. In expenditures, a majority of that money
is to assure public safety. Ms. Lawrence said that the assuring of Public Safety
and the Department of Public Safety may have different budget numbers because
this budget overview is more function-based than departmental-based.

•

The proposed 2005 budget will be using $46.2 million of fund balance to make
this budget work. Ms. Lawrence said the City will continue to decrease the
amount of funds taken from fund balance by their ongoing budget cutting and
oversight efforts.

•

Ms. Lawrence said if not for the increases in public safety, the budget net would
be down in 2005. The increases in public safety are due to an attempt to prevent
an outbreak in pension costs to public safety. Other departments are relatively
flat. The increase in the Department of Public Works is due to contractual
increases at the Waste Water treatment plant, and the department will be under a
new stormwater permit.

•

Ms. Lawrence said the cost to provide City services overwhelmingly consist of
wages and benefits, especially in public safety. Most City workers not in a public
safety area are under a wage freeze. The boost in Character 01 expenses are
driven by contractual obligations in public safety. Nearly half of the Character 01
increase is from police and fire pensions. Some of the cost in Character 01 is also
from health care premiums for all City workers. Character 02 increases represent
the rising cost of petroleum.

•

Ms. Lawrence said with the budget cuts that were made, there really is only one
area left where cuts can be made and that is in salaries and benefits.

•

Most of the new revenue used to fund the proposed 2005 budget is from pension
stabilization accounts. Ms. Lawrence said the County Option Income Tax (COIT)
is projected to stay the same for 2004 and 2005. She said the COIT may decline
by $4 million dollars, but she has not reflected it in the budget until she has
certification.

Administration and Finance Committee
August 3, 2004

•

The Arrestee Processing Center was not included in the 2004 budget. It was added
by a fiscal ordinance in January, 2004. The center will be at the same funding
level for 2005 that it is for 2004.

•

There is a decrease in the Workers Compensation (Comp) program by reducing
the amount that the City departments contribute to this fund. The City was able to
make this reduction by relying on a fund balance in the Workers Comp program.
The reduction in the Wellness program was due to slightly being over-budgeted.

•

There was a reduction in the Department of Metropolitan Development (DMD)
budget, under Line Item 380, Grants and Subsidies. Ms. Lawrence said that there
was not actually a reduction in the amount of federal grants but an adjustment in
grants.

•

In the proposed 2005 budget revenues, the property tax levy is expected to
increase in growth by 1% in solid waste and fire service districts and 2% in other
service districts. Ms. Lawrence said under fees and charges in 2005 revenues,
there is a $10 million decline between 2004 and 2005. The City is taking out a
one-time loan from the sanitary district of $10 million and the money will be split
evenly between the police and fire districts. This is allowed by the Indiana Code.

•

The police and fire pension increase is about $10.7 million, and the vast majority
of that comes from the pre-1977 program, which is the unfunded program.
Roughly $8.3 million of the pension increase represents payments to retirees hired
before 1977.

•

Ms. Lawrence said that it is imperative to have a pension stabilization account to
manage public safety pension obligations and to prevent affecting public safety
day-to-day operations and to protect the benefits of public safety officers. She
said this account is proposed to be funded initially by pension obligation bonds.
She said the pension obligation bonds will be sent to the Council for introduction
at the August 23, 2004 meeting.

•

The projected proposed fee increases will be over $400,000 including an increase
in Controller’s Office licenses, parking meter violations, parks fees, and DMD
accelerated inspections.

Councillor McWhirter asked where the revenue comes from to support the pension
stabilization fund. Ms. Lawrence said this would be the account that would be funded
with the bond issuance. Councillor McWhirter asked if there is a pension fund now. Ms.
Lawrence responded in the negative. Councillor McWhirter asked where the $21.7
million shortfall comes from. Ms. Lawrence said it is unfunded in terms of the 2005
budget. They have to factor in pension obligations and then the funding they have to find,
which is projected to be $22 million. Councillor McWhirter asked why gas tax revenues
would be down. Jeff Seidenstein, Budget Manager, Controller’s Office, said they over-

Administration and Finance Committee
August 3, 2004
Page 7
budgeted in 2004 and are expecting less tax next year. Ms. Lawrence said gas taxes are
about 30 cents a gallon and not a percentage tax. Councillor McWhirter asked when
COIT will be certified. Ms. Lawrence said it can happen at any time. Councillor
McWhirter asked why federal grants are going down. Ms. Lawrence said it is more a
matter of County adjustments, making better use of the money, than actually losing
grants. Mr. Seidenstein said a majority of the decease is coming from DMD. They are
doing a better job in spending their grants and project they will have less carry over
revenue in 2005. Councillor McWhirter asked what is the $17 million difference in fund
balance from 2004 to 2005. Ms. Lawrence said this is representing the difference in the
projected fund balance and the budgeted fund balance. Councillor McWhirter asked
about the increase in inspections fees. Ms. Lawrence said these fees are paid by regulated
businesses through the Controller’s Office.
Councillor Langsford asked what percentage of parking violations fines are actually
collected. Mr. Seidenstein referred to a representative of the Office of Corporation
Counsel that said the collection rate on parking tickets is about 51%. Councillor
Langsford asked who is included in the contractual salaries. Ms. Lawrence said police,
fire, workers from Public Works, and Parks workers. Councillor Langsford asked if these
employees will be under the salary freeze. Ms. Lawrence responded in the negative.
Councillor Plowman asked what the process of determining fees is. Ms. Lawrence said in
some fees they factor in the cost they accrue and for others it is looking at the market. It
depends on the fee. Councillor Plowman said he has an issue with paying to get into a
park when citizens have already paid with their tax dollars to help fund the parks. Ms.
Lawrence said other than seating fees there was no increase to parks. She said the only
park that charges admission is Eagle Creek Park.
Councillor McWhirter asked if the police and fire pensions are self funded. Ms.
Lawrence said the City pays 24% of their pension. Councillor McWhirter asked when
things will stabilize with retirees. Ms. Lawrence said around the year 2025. Councillor
McWhirter asked what is involved in the DROP Plan. Ms. Lawrence said the Deferred
Retirement Option Plan (DROP) allows a firefighter or police officers to determine when
they are going to retire, and then a lump sum is set aside towards their pension.
Chairwoman Nytes said the DROP plan was designed with expectations that it would
assist some communities across the State to better plan for the rates of retirement, and in
some communities a way to encourage experienced firefighters to stay on longer.
Office of the Mayor
Mike O’Connor, Chief Deputy Mayor, said that the Mayor’s Office actually has the same
amount of Full Time Equivalent (FTEs) positions for the calendar year 2004 and 2005;
two people have started job sharing this year. He said they drop two FTEs from the
budget year 2003 to 2004. He said Character 010, Personal Service was the only increase
in the budget, due primarily to increased pension and health care costs in the City and

Administration and Finance Committee
August 3, 2004
Page 8
County. The increase for Character 010, Personal Service was $5,581. He said in every
other category they have cut the budget. The overall budget cut in the Mayor’s Office is
2.5% lower than last year’s budget.
Chairwoman Nytes asked due to the budget cuts if they anticipate any changes in their
program. Mr. O’Connor responded in the negative and said they will be able to continue
their services and programs in the Mayor’s Office. Chairwoman Nytes asked if there are
any salary increases. Mr. O’Connor responded in the negative and said there will be no
increases or cuts to salaries.
Councillor McWhirter asked how did they get the total FTEs for 2005, if they have two
employees job sharing. Mr. Seidenstein said the Mayor’s Office actually has another parttime position in the budget that is not filled. Mr. O’Connor said FTEs do not necessarily
equal people; because the time being worked by the job share is more than one FTE they
had to take two full FTEs. Councillor McWhirter asked if the employees who job share
still have the same salary. Mr. O’Connor responded in the affirmative. Councillor
McWhrter asked if both of the employees who job share have benefits. Mr. O’Connor
said only one employee that is job sharing receives benefits. Councillor McWhirter asked
if the other employee required benefits, would they be entitled to benefits. Mr. O’Connor
said this is one reason why they took two FTEs just in case the other employee would
desire benefits.
Indianapolis Marion County Public Improvement Bond Bank
Bob Clifford, Executive Director, explained Exhibit C (see file). Some highlights of the
presentation include:
•

The purpose of the Bond Bank was to develop infrastructure, promote education,
and assist in economic development.

•

The Bond Bank’s budget is not included in the City’s budget. The bond bank
organization is self-funded. They charge a fee for the work they do on different
transactions, and that funds their operations.

•

The Bond Bank’s special projects manager and special counsel is actually the
economic development for the City.

•

The Bond Bank’s budget cycle starts in September, after they see what the City
and County is proposing. This helps them to know what projects they will be
involved in throughout the coming year.

Jennifer Weflen, Deputy Director, explained the Bond Bank’s accomplishments
(included in Exhibit C). Some highlights of the presentation include:

Administration and Finance Committee
August 3, 2004
Page 9
•

In November 2003, the Bond Bank closed $20 million in Indy Roads Revenue
Bonds to fund construction.

•

2004 Series E – Fall Creek Place is the homeownership zone. This was
refinancing of short term debt that was issued in 2001. The bonds that were issued
for infrastructure work for Fall Creek Place will be repaid by a Housing Tax
Increment Financing (TIF).

•

The deal for Series G – Sanitation bonds was made through a State Revolving
Fund (SRF).

Councillor McWhirter asked what the difference in Union Station’s Operations expenses
was from 2003 to 2004. Mr. Clifford said there were more occupants in Union Station,
resulting in less money needed out of their budget. Councillor McWhirter asked where
the money from net income from operations goes. Mr. Clifford said the money is used to
pre-fund projects before they issue the debt.
Chairwoman Nytes asked with the Charter Schools fund will there be more of a moral
obligation than a general obligation from the City. Mr. Clifford said it would be a moral
obligation.
Office of Internal Audit
Mike Humphreys, Administrator, said they have nine staff members that are budgeted in
their office. Their budget request for 2005 has a 2.2% decrease of about $15,601 under
their 2004 budget. He said the majority of their increases in their budget will be reflected
in Character 010, Personal Services, due to pension and insurance increases. He said the
majority of their decreases will be found in Character 030, Other Services and Charges,
in Line Item 329, Travel and Mileage, and in Line Item 335, Information Technology.
He said their level of services the office will provide are:
•
•
•
•

complete 25 operational audits in the City departments
complete 18 follow-up reviews of prior operational audits
complete 16 management requests/special reviews during the year
complete 15 areas of assistance associated with the annual City external auditor
examination of financial statements and federal grants programs.

Chairwoman Nytes said the Council has a proposal that is currently under study that will
extend the services of the office of Internal Audit to some of the County agencies as well
as some of the City agencies.
Office of Corporation Counsel (City Legal)
April Sellers, Deputy Corporation Counsel, gave an overview of the Office of
Corporation Counsel found in Exhibit D (see file). Kim Diller, Financial Manager,

Administration and Finance Committee
August 3, 2004
Page 10
explained the Corporation Counsel’s budget also found in Exhibit D. Some highlights of
the budget include:
•

The Corporation Counsel’s proposed 2005 budget with internal charges has
increased by 3.4% due to a decrease in their internal charges.

•

Without the internal charges and looking at Characters 01-04, their operating
budget has decreased by 3.2%.

•

In Character 01, Personal Services, their main decrease is in salaries by $56,021,
due to reorganizations in their department.

•

In Character 03, Other Services and Charges, their main decrease is in
Information Technology by $78,346.

•

In Character 04, Properties & Equipment, compared to revised, they are asking
to increase by $8,500. Ms. Diller said there are computers in the office that have
Windows 95 and 98 that need upgraded and they would like to replace eight
computers in 2005.

•

In Character 05, Internal Charges, the decrease is due to the operating budget
decreasing the chargebacks Therefore, if they are not spending as much, they
cannot charge back as much.

•

The internal charges are also based on the amount of time spent on each City or
County department agency. The Corporation Counsel is spending a little more
time on County agencies, and because their funds come from the same fund of
the Corporation Counsel they cannot charge back to them.

•

The Corporation Counsel receives revenue from parking violations, where they
will see an increase in 2005 due to the proposed increase in parking violations
fines.

Chairwoman Nytes asked if other City departments are funded under the same fund as
County. Ms. Diller said they are all not funded from the consolidated County General
Fund. Chairwoman Nytes asked if they have tracked what the charges would be if they
did charge the County agencies. Ms. Diller responded in the affirmative. Chairwoman
Nytes asked if the Council could see that information. Ms. Diller said she has that
information broken down by departments and will get that information to the Council.
Office of Controller
Barbara Lawrence, City Controller, said in addition to compiling the City budget, the
Controller’s Office is the licensing division of the City of Indianapolis. The Controller’s
Office is also the home of the one-stop-shop, where organizations and groups apply for

Administration and Finance Committee
August 3, 2004
Page 11
any permit for special events. She said in their proposed 2005 budget they maintain the
same amount of FTEs in the Controller’s Office. She said Character 010, Personal
Services, is projected to decline about 0.5%. Character 020, Materials and Supplies, is
projected to decline about 23.8%. She said their major budget decrease is in Character
030, Other Services and Charges, which primarily represents technology charges. Their
overall budget is declining about 6.7%, or $711,451, from 2004 to 2005.
Councillor McWhirter asked why they are reducing Line Item 383, Third Party Contracts
by $2 million. Ms. Lawrence said this due to the one-time IndyGo issuance made through
the Controller’s Office.
Chairwoman Nytes asked if Line Item 335, Information Technology, would be found in
other City agencies’ budgets. Ms. Lawrence said there would be a Line Item,
Information Technology, but it would be more application developments. Mr.
Seidenstein said in the Controller’s Office they pickup the vast majority of the City’s
share of technology costs for the City departments. The City departments received a
small cost to help cover their share of the help desk and internet charges.
Deborah Green, Purchasing administrator, said Character 020, Materials and Supplies;
Character 030, Other Services and Charges; and Character 040, Properties and
Equipment all proposed a decrease in the 2005 budget. Character 010, Personal Services,
has a slight increase, due to reorganization in the Purchasing Office. Ms. Green said they
are currently working on making upgrades to their website, to enable vendors to
download their documents. This will save on their postage costs, paper cost, and labor.
Ms. Green said they are working hard to get the County trained on the policies and
procedures of purchasing.
Chaiwoman Nytes asked how they approached making changes in contracts without
adding more people. Ms. Green said they had the opportunity to make changes in the
vendor registration process as the result of the enhancement of their website. Therefore,
they were able to combine the duties of that position with their front desk positions.
Chairwoman Nytes asked when positions change, does the job description go back
through an evaluation process. Ms. Green said the job description goes back to the
Human Resources Division that factors the position.

ADMINISTRATION AND FINANCE COMMITTEE
The Administration and Finance Committee of the City-County Council met on Tuesday, August
22, 2006. Chair Joanne Sanders called the meeting to order at 5:07 p.m. with the following
members present: Paul Bateman, Vernon Brown, Lynn McWhirter, Jackie Nytes, and Lincoln
Plowman. Becky Langsford arrived shortly thereafter. Bart Brown, Chief Financial Officer,
represented Council staff.
Chair Sanders asked for consent to move Voters Registration after County Surveyor, and County
Administration and County Commissioners under the Office of County Auditor. Consent was
given.
PROPOSAL NO. 386, 2006 - appoints Brenda Rising-Moore to the City-County Administrative
Board
Ms. Rising-Moore said she has worked in small business for most of her adult life and she has
worked in accounting and office management. She said she watched the Council meetings on
Channel 16 and thinks the Council’s work is interesting. Ms. Rising-Moore said she is originally
from Canada, but is a naturalized American citizen and has lived in Indiana since the age of 9.
She stated that she has three children and took a sabbatical four years ago to assist her youngest
child through high school. Ms. Rising-Moore said she looks forward to doing community work
again.
Councillor Nytes moved, seconded by Councillor McWhirter to send to Proposal No. 386, 2006
to the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried by a vote of 6-0.
Chair Sanders stated that the committee has a guest clerk, Cherrish Pryor, for the meeting
because the original clerk, NaTrina Moffett, gave birth to a baby boy on Monday, August 21,
2006. Chair Sanders and the committee wished Ms. Moffett and family well.
BUDGET HEARING (A copy of the 2007 budget book is on file in the Council’s Office.)
County Recorder
Dale Brewer, Chief Deputy and Suzanne Taylor, Fiscal Deputy presented the County Recorder’s
budget on behalf of Wanda Martin who was unable to attend.
Chair Sanders asked if there were new pages to the budget. Kim Diller, Financial Manager,
Office of Finance and Management (OFM), said the only corrections were in the County
Auditor’s budget section and the remaining budgets were correct.
Mr. Brewer said the only major change from 2006 to 2007 was an increase in Health Insurance
under Character 1. He said there was also an increase in Information Services Agency (ISA)
charges under Character 3. He said some money was moved around within Character 3. The
moved decreased the travel line item, Subcharacter 312, by $20,000. The Maintenance

Administration and Finance Committee
August 22, 2006
Page 3
Agreement, Subcharacter 349, accounted for $15,000 of the funds and Postage, Subcharacter
310, accounted for the remaining $5,000.
Chair Sanders asked for a list of those who traveled in the Recorder’s Office. Mr. Brewer said
he and the County Recorder travel to conferences.
Councillor Nytes asked for information on what the Recorder’s Office is responsible for and
what outcomes will be achieved in 2007. Mr. Brewer said all documents that come into the
office are archived. He said the Recorder’s Office wanted to go online with electronic recording
in 2006, but since technology is not advancing fast enough, the project is still in a ‘study’ mode.
Mr. Brewer said the project will not be complete this year, but it is something that the next
Recorder could implement. He said the software is available, but it has not been used enough to
have a full understanding of how it will work in the Recorder’s Office.
Councillor Nytes asked for clarification on the number of documents that are projected to be
filed with the Recorder’s Office next year. Mr. Brewer said it depends on the buying boon,
refinancing, new homebuilding, deeds, mortgages, assignments, and releases that go through the
office. He said 2003 was the banner year for recording, and the number has decreased slightly.
Mr. Brewer said 2006 would be the lowest year since 2003 for recordings. He said it is hard to
predict the number of transactions that will take place next year.
Councillor Nytes asked if all of the money requested in the Recorder’s budget was coming from
the County Recorder’s Perpetuation Fund and not from the County General Fund. Mr. Clifford
answered in the affirmative and said the office was funded in the same manner for 2006.
Councillor Nytes asked for the funds available in the Perpetuation Fund. Mr. Clifford said the
projection is approximately $7M by the end of 2007. He said it has been a growing fund
balance. Councillor Nytes asked if the fund balance would fall below the Recorder’s budget
even if there were not a housing boon next year. Mr. Brewer answered in the affirmative. Ms.
Taylor said the Recorder’s Office could be maintained by the Perpetuation Fund for 3 or 4 years.
Councillor Brown asked for an explanation of Subcharacter 440. Ms. Taylor said most of the
large computer equipment is purchased from that line item. She said money was appropriated
last year to purchase a piece of a computer system and not a complete new system, but that has
not occurred. Councillor Brown asked if the funds were for the new property system. Ms. Diller
answered in the negative, and said the purchase is separate from the property system, and would
be exclusively for the Recorder’s Office. She said that if the system were purchased from the
2006 appropriations then the funds would not be needed in the 2007 budget. She said the
Recorder’s Office is budgeting for next year so the money could not revert to the fund balance.
Chair Sanders asked for the effect of ISA’s purchases on the Recorder’s Office. Mr. Clifford
asked Chair Sanders if she meant the purchase of computers and laptops. Chair Sanders
answered in the affirmative. Mr. Clifford said the new computer equipment is a document
management system that would be a permanent storage location for documents which is outside
of ISA’s responsibilities.

Administration and Finance Committee

Page 4
Mr. Brewer asked Chair Sanders if they should discuss the proposed amount. Chair Sanders
said she spoke with Ms. Diller and Ms. Diller would make sure the numbers are correct. Mr.
Clifford said Mr. Brewer was referring to the overestimation of revenue that the Office of
Finance and Management (OFM) had calculated for the Recorder’s Office. He said
approximately $500,000 applies to the General Fund.
County Surveyor
Mary Catherine Barton, County Surveyor, said for 2007 she is asking for $427,466.32 from the
County General Fund which is less than the $454,434.00 for 2006. She said $171,676.00 is
being proposed from the Surveyor’s Perpetuation Fund for 2007 which is also less than the
$207,146.00 for 2006. Ms. Barton said her budget is less than last year and will save the
taxpayers money. She said her total budget amount for 2007 is $599,142.32.
Ms. Barton said that since taking office in 2005 she has assured the citizens of Marion County
there is no feather bedding in the Surveyor’s Office. She said the office had ten employees when
she took over and now there are seven employees doing the work of ten people. Ms. Barton said
that last year she requested that her staff receive a raise to cover the inflation from the last five
years and she hopes they would get a 3% pay raise this year. Ms. Barton said no one in her
office receives a 37.5 hours per week paycheck while at the same time receiving a check as a
Township elected official. She said no one in her office transports family members and the
public in county vehicles. Ms. Barton said she purchased a personal car to conduct her work and
she is not reimbursed for her transportation expenses.
Ms. Barton said her office is in good shape and she is an attorney, teacher, business owner, and
political and human rights activist.
Chair Sanders asked why professional services, Subcharacter 361, was reduced from $68,000 in
2006 to $25,000 in 2007 and asked for the contracts issued by the Surveyor’s Office. Ms. Barton
said she would get back to the committee regarding the reduction in professional services and
contracts issued, but noted that there are few contracts let. Ms. Barton said there are over 100
surveyors in Marion County.
Chair Sanders asked if the reduction in health insurance was due to the decreased number of
employees. Ms. Barton answered in the affirmative.
Councillor Brown asked if the overall budget was a 9% decrease. Ms. Barton answered in the
affirmative. Councillor Brown said he appreciates the reduction in her budget and stated she is
doing an outstanding job.
Mr. Clifford said the numbers input by the Surveyor’s Office were the numbers used by the
OFM in the proposed budget. The OFM only made changes in the ISA charges and possibly rent
charges. He said the Surveyor proposed the reductions in their budget.

Administration and Finance Committee
August 22, 2006
Page 5
Bart Brown, Council’s Chief Financial Officer, asked the Surveyor to double check the budget to
ensure that Professional Services, Subcharacter 361, is not cut to the point that it would hinder
work in 2007.
Councillor Nytes pointed out that funds in Other Services & Charges, Subcharacter 390, have not
been spent this year.
Voter Registration
Kyle Walker and John Riordan, Board Members, presented the Voter Registration budget.
Mr. Walker said the 2007 budget is similar to the 2006 budget. He said there is a slight increase
in Character 2 because of printing. Character 3 has some significant shifting, but the total for the
Character only increased from $391,347 in 2006 to $438,580 for 2007. Mr. Walker said the shift
in Character 3 represents a change in the way their computer system is used. Historically, the
computer system was leased. In 2006, the office purchased a different voter file which caused a
reduction in lease payments because Voter Registration now uses its own equipment.
Unfortunately, the change in vendors also increased printing cost, but the two amounts offset
each other.
Mr. Walker said there is an increase in Capital, Character 4, which could be used for additional
printers or office equipment that may be needed in 2007. He said there is a slight increase in
Health Insurance, Subcharacter 71, due to options chosen by the employees.
Chair Sanders asked if Character 1 would accommodate a 3% salary increase for employees.
Mr. Walker answered in the negative and added that an increase is needed. Chair Sanders
inquired about underspending in Character 1 as of June 30, 2006. Mr. Walker said the
underspending occurred due to transition in staff. He said Character 1 spending for 2006 would
be close to its appropriated amount by the end of this year, and next year Character 1 will be
spent at its full amount.
Councillor Nytes said some constituents have complained about turnaround time for processing
voter registration. She asked for some of the performance challenges that are facing the office
because there seems to be backlog issues. Mr. Walker said the backlog issues are being taken
care of, but the biggest problem came from a court order that required Voter Registration to
complete certain tasks throughout the summer. He said focusing on the court order resulted in a
slower turnaround time for voter registration acknowledgement notices. Mr. Walker said
overtime will probably be authorized to get caught up before the election.
Mr. Brown stated that the Voter Registration Office should work with the OFM to ensure that
there is enough money budgeted in Character 1 to cover Health Insurance which will be
overspent by approximately $20,000 this year.
Ms. Diller said Voter Registration has requested additional appropriations for 2006, and if
additional costs occur in 2007, there will be an adjustment in the 2007 proposed budget to
accommodate the needed amount.

Administration and Finance Committee
August 22, 2006
Page 6
Chair Sanders asked for the additional amount requested for 2006. Ms. Diller said the amount is
for $102,000.32 and $15,000 of that is for overtime.
Mr. Walker said overtime is needed every year, because the office does not want to increase the
number of permanent people on staff.
County Auditor
Marty Womacks, County Auditor and Terry Nelson, Chief Deputy presented the budget and
distributed a handout. (See Exhibit A on file in the Council’s Office along with the original set
of minutes.)
Ms. Womacks said this would be her last presentation to the committee because her term as
County Auditor will end in 2006.
[Clerk’s Note: Councillor Becky Langsford arrived at 5:40 p.m.]
Ms. Womacks said the Auditor’s Office has the following major divisions; Administration which
includes payroll and settlement, accounting, and real estate. She said the Administration
Division oversees the office budget by tracking expenses and paying bills. The Division is also
working on a system upgrade and is responsible for city and county payroll. It also distributes
approximately $1.5 billion to 50 taxing units each year.
Ms. Womacks said the Accounting Division monitors county expenditures for all county
agencies, provides accounting procedures for county agencies at this time and issued 97,113
checks totaling $229.3 million in 2005. The number of checks issued does not include payroll,
investments, loan repayments and settlement checks.
Ms. Womacks said the Real Estate Division interacts with the public most often. The Division
verifies property tax deductions and exemptions, processes refunds for appeals, and administers
the tax sale which recovered approximately $4.4 million last year. She said the Auditor’s Office
has looked into outsourcing the tax sale process, and although 77 counties in Indiana use an
outside vendor, it was found that the Auditor’s Office was best equipped to handle the process.
Ms. Womacks said the Division is currently evaluating a new property tax system, and that
approximately 80,000 transactions take place each year because of properties that are transferred.
She said the Endorsement Fee Fund can grow because each time a transaction takes place there is
a $5.00 charge that goes into the Fund. She stated that the survivorship affidavit does not require
the $5.00 fee.
Ms. Womacks said the office implemented an automatic sales disclosure filing system which will
become effective on October 1, 2006. She said the office would be rearranged so the public can
access terminals to complete their filings. Ms. Womacks said the office changed the filing
system because the State of Indiana now requires that all Assessors file disclosure forms with the
state electronically.

Administration and Finance Committee
August 22, 2006
Page 7
Ms. Womacks said there is an additional $10,000 for the Homestead Deduction for 2007. She
said the deduction would increase from $35,000 to $45,000. She said the reduction is for one
year.
Ms. Womacks said her office has 27 full-time employees (FTE) and a proposed budget of
$951,502 for 2007. She said funds would be needed to cover the cost of employees that might be
added to her staff if the court rules that the County Auditor’s Office should be responsible for
Accounts Payable and Payroll and not the OFM. She said the 2007 budget amount would be
$1,290.253 if Accounts Payable and Payroll become a part of her office and do not remain with
the OFM. Ms. Womacks said Supplies, Character 2, was reduced $5,000.
Ms. Womacks said under Other Services and Charges, Character 3, ISA charges were reduced by
$6.7 million because the OFM distributed ISA changes to each county agency. In the past, the
Auditor’s Office handled all of the ISA charges for the county agencies. She said postage,
advertising and printing was increased by $66,510 to accommodate additional expenses for tax
sales. Ms. Womacks said the Welfare debt of $35 million and the Department of Corrections
(DOC) charges of $19.8 million are being paid off.
Ms. Womacks said the office started a wellness program which is incorporated into the budget.
The amount for pension under Character 1 is incorrect. She said it is public employees
retirement fund (PERF) costs which should be 3% greater than what is in the budget. She
indicated that the amount would be corrected.
Chair Sanders asked for an explanation of special pay/compensation. Ms. Womacks said special
pay /compensation happens when the county rewards an employee if they do not receive county
health insurance. Chair Sanders asked if it applies to all county agencies. Ms. Womacks
answered in the affirmative.
Councillor McWhirter asked if the $19.8 million is the Department of Corrections (DOC)
amount owed for 2006 or the amount for this year and previous years. She said the current
charges for DOC are being put into the court’s budget and the $19.8 million is only the debt.
Councillor McWhirter asked if ongoing costs would be put in the Court’s budget. Mr. Clifford
said an agreement was made to have the $56 million debt, which accrued from 2001 to mid2005, paid back through a special debt service charge pending the outcome of a court case
against the State regarding the DOC charges. He said the debt service charge was first collected
in 2006 and will be collected until 2008. After 2008, all of the previous charges will be paid off.
Councillor McWhirter asked if the $19.8 million goes towards the $56 million. Mr. Clifford
answered in the affirmative. Councillor McWhirter asked if charges are incurred one year and
then paid for in the following year. Ms. Womacks said the county is billed twice per year in
June and October. Councillor McWhirter asked if the amount due was current for June 2006 and
where the figure is located. Mr. Clifford said it was located in the court’s 2007 budget.
Councillor McWhirter asked if the $35 million welfare debt was a one time payment or ongoing.
Mr. Clifford said it is a one-time payment.

Administration and Finance Committee
August 22, 2006
Page 8
Chair Sanders asked if the DOC charges were located under Subcharacter 390. Ms. Womacks
answered in the affirmative. Chair Sanders asked for the breakdown of the remaining amount.
Mr. Clifford said he is not sure what the money is used for but it is a part of the annual request
and it is consistent with the amount from previous years. Mr. Nelson said contracts, such as the
one with Valet Title Services that does title work for the tax sale, Capital Cities which provides
advice to the Administration Board regarding the deferred compensation plan, Maximus that
does annual reviews of expenses for government reimbursement, Barnes and Thornburg which
does legal work, and individuals that do computer and accounting services are a part of the
Subcharacter.
Chair Sanders asked if the Auditor’s Office uses computer vendors other than ISA. Mr. Nelson
answered in the affirmative and said there were two people who provided services. Chair
Sanders asked why. Mr. Nelson said the major reason is their expertise. He said one person is
an expert on tax increment financing (TIF), and the other person works throughout the office and
handles time sensitive requests. Chair Sanders asked if the services were technical support. Mr.
Nelson answered in the negative and said all technical support comes from ISA.
Councillor Nytes asked if the budget could accommodate a 3% salary increase. Ms. Womacks
answered in the negative. Ms. Diller said the Character 1 budget for 2007 is based on current
payroll expenses. She said the Auditor’s Office is making it through this year’s budget with
reduced staff and turnover. Ms. Diller said there is also underspending in other areas such as
health insurance. She said the 2007 budget is based on what is needed to fund the current
payroll. Chair Sanders asked if the amount includes vacancies that need to be filled. Ms. Diller
answered in the affirmative. Councillor Nytes asked if any of the county agencies included the
3% salary increase in Character 1. Ms. Womacks answered in the negative and said she wishes
the amount could be included in the budget. Councillor Nytes said she agrees and stated that the
Council needs to know if there is room to provide for salary increases.
Mr. Clifford said the city and county budgets do not include an increase for employees that are
not represented by a bargaining unit. He said it is anticipated that the adjustment would occur
during the reconciliation phase of the budget process. Mr. Clifford said the OFM decided to not
factor in an increase for any department or agency because the city had funds to factor in a 3%
increase, but the county did not. Mr. Clifford said as the budget process moves forward the
OFM will try to identify funds to accommodate a 3% salary increase for employees not
represented by a bargaining unit. He said they are moving forward with the assumption that the
OFM will find the money for county employees. Mr. Clifford said since the county has
separately elected officials, the OFM anticipates moving the pay scale forward by 3% for each
pay grade, however, elected officials will be able to allocate the 3% as they see fit. He said some
elected officials think more funds should go to the lower paid employees.
Councillor Nytes asked for the amount it would take to give a raise to county employees. Mr.
Clifford said the amount is approximately $5 million for city and county employees. Councillor
Nytes asked if it were for non-bargaining unit employees. Mr. Clifford answered in the
affirmative and said the city accounts for $1.6 million of the amount, while the county needs the

Administration and Finance Committee
August 22, 2006
Page 9
remaining amount. He said the city and county has approximately the same number of
employees, but the city has more employees represented by a bargaining unit.
Councillor Nytes asked if the budget assumes anything on other contracts. Mr. Clifford
answered in the negative.
Ms. Womacks said it is always a struggle to find the money to do what needs to be done.
Councillor Nytes said the situation is complicated, because non-represented employees have not
received a raise in years, so it is difficult to find some justice for the employees.
Councillor Nytes asked if Maintenance and Licensing, Subcharacter 349, was a one-time
expenditure for 2006. Ms. Womacks said the amount is transferred to ISA.
Councillor Nytes asked if Refunds, Awards & Indemnities, Subcharacter 376, was transferred to
the departments that had the liability. Mr. Nelson answered in the affirmative and said that
process started in 2006. Councillor Nytes asked if each department was responsible for
settlements or lawsuits brought against them. Ms. Womacks answered in the affirmative.
Councillor Nytes said that was a good direction to take and it makes a lot of sense.
Councillor Nytes said that the Auditor’s handout refers to the city, but there was no verbal
reference to the city in the Auditor’s presentation. Councillor Nytes asked if that was due to the
fact that things are still being worked out with the OFM. Ms. Womacks answered in the
affirmative. Mr. Clifford said the Accounts Payable and Payroll money is currently in the
OFM’s budget, but would be moved to the Auditor’s budget depending on the outcome of the
court case. He said the effect to the overall budget would be zero.
Councillor Brown asked for an explanation of Professional Services, Subcharacter 361. Ms.
Womacks said it was for an audit this year, and the cost will be transferred to the OFM next year.
Councillor Brown inquired about the line item’s low balance. Mr. Clifford said the money was
encumbered. Ms. Womacks said the encumbered funds may not be expended, but they are
encumbered because of contractual responsibilities. Councillor Brown asked if the line item was
reduced because the audit will be the responsibility of the OFM next year. Mr. Clifford
answered in the affirmative and said there will be a corresponding increase in the OFM’s budget.
Councillor Bateman asked for an explanation of the increase in Printing Services, Subcharacter
341. Ms. Womacks said there is an anticipated shortfall in 2006 for printing due to the tax sale.
She said a new federal law requires the Auditor’s Office to notify more people about tax sales.
Ms. Womacks said the office transferred funds in 2006 to accommodate the increased number of
notification of tax sales.
Chair Sanders asked for a breakdown of Subsidies, Subcharacter 380. Ms. Womacks said $1
million is for Noble and the remaining is distributed to mental health agencies. Chair Sanders
asked if the Fair, and Soil and Water were included. Mr. Nelson answered in the affirmative.
Chair Sanders asked for a breakdown and said there appears to be an increase. Ms. Diller said
the increase is for the mental health contribution, because the state law determines the amount

Administration and Finance Committee
August 22, 2006
Page 10
based on the percentage of the maximum tax levy. She said Soil and Water gets $132,000,
Noble Center gets $1 million, and the Fair Board gets $80,000.
Ms. Womacks said the rest is distributed among five mental health providers. Ms. Diller said the
budget for the mental health providers is $3,981,144. Mr. Clifford said that amount is 4% higher
than 2006. He said the funding is a percentage of the General Fund. Chair Sanders asked why
the amount budgeted for Subcharacter 380 was $5,320,144. Ms. Womacks said Soil and Water,
the Noble Center, and the Fair Board is included in the amount.
Chair Sanders asked where funding for the Marion County Cooperative Extension is located.
Mr. Clifford said the agency went before the Council’s Community Affairs committee. Chair
Sanders asked if their budget was included in Subcharacter 380. Ms. Diller said they have a
separate budget. Mr. Clifford said their budget can be found in the Community Affairs portion
of the budget book.
Councillor Nytes asked if unemployment compensation were a part of the Auditor’s budget
because it is countywide expense. Ms. Womacks answered in the affirmative. Councillor Nytes
asked how unemployment compensation is handled by the city. Ms. Diller said it is allocated
among the departments. Ms. Womacks said the Controller is hopeful that the same thing might
happen on the county side. Mr. Nelson said the program is administered by the city’s human
resources department.
Councillor Brown thanked Ms. Womacks for her hard work and dedication to government.
Chair Sanders asked if bonuses would be given out in the Auditor’s Office this year. Ms.
Womacks answered in the negative.
Chair Sanders asked for the status of reconciliation. Mr. Steve Dyson, Accounting Deputy said
they are working with the Treasurer’s Office to reconcile. He said entries have been made and
now the reconciled items need to be identified. Chair Sanders asked through what date the
reconciliation would be completed. Mr. Dyson said until December 2005. Chair Sanders asked
for the reconciliation status for the period between January 1, 2006 and June 30, 2006. Mr.
Dyson said most of the corrections have been done for what is called “month 13” of FAMIS. He
said once those corrections are done, they will automatically go into a new beginning balance for
2006. Mr. Dyson said if no major errors occur in 2006 then the reconciliation will go month-tomonth and will be quickly caught up for 2006. Chair Sanders asked for the projection date of
when the reconciliation will be caught up and if it would be done by the end of September 2006.
Mr. Dyson answered in the negative and said 2005 reconciliation should be complete by the end
of August and then month-to-month reconciliation will begin. He said the County General Fund,
and the State and Federal Grants Funds are the most difficult. The others are relatively easy to
reconcile.

County Administrator
Ms. Womacks said the County Administrator’s budget is similar to the past. She said
countywide expenses are paid from this budget such as auto insurance, workers compensation
claims, and property insurance.
Councillor Nytes asked if the County Administrator’s budget should continue to be a separate
budget since it only has funds budgeted in five categories. Ms. Diller said the budget has been
cut back and there has been discussion about dealing with the County Administrator’s budget as
a non-departmental budget.
County Commissioners
Ms. Womacks said County Commissioners in Marion County have a role that is different from
Commissioners in the other 91 counties. She said the Commissioners include the County
Auditor, Assessor, and Treasurer. Ms. Womacks said County Commissioners oversee the
township trustee relief appeal hearings. She said the hearings are the most important thing
funded in the budget and are held on a weekly basis. Ms. Womacks said earlier this year the
Council approved a transfer from Character 1 to Character 3 to pay a part-time person to conduct
the hearings. She said County Commissioners also oversee surplus property, which is property
that has gone through a tax sale and the County Commissioners take title of the property. Ms.
Womacks said the County Commissioners also oversee the Guardian Home which has a separate
budget from the County Commissioners. She said the County Commissioners do not oversee
roads, streets, and bridges, nor do they pay bills like other County Commissioners in Indiana.
Councillor Nytes asked if the County Commissioner’s budget, not the County Commissioners
position, could be eliminated if fiscal responsibility is moved to another agency. She said that
assigning the County Commissioners budget to an existing budget would simplify things in the
long run. Ms. Womacks said the hearings are already organized by the Auditor’s staff.
Councillor Nytes said the reason for consolidating the County Administrator’s budget and the
County Commissioner’s budget into other budgets is because it will show the real structure of
government in Marion County. She said the County Commissioners in Marion County no longer
serve a significant purpose. Ms. Womacks said overseeing the Guardian Home is a major
responsibility for the Marion County Commissioners. Councillor Nytes said she also has a
suggestion on how the Guardian Home should be handled. Ms. Womacks agreed.
Soil and Water Conservation District
Mark Cox, board member and Ron Lauster director passed out materials (See Exhibits B, C, D
on file in the Council Office along with the original set of minutes.) and gave the presentation.
Mr. Cox said the Soil and Water Conservation District (SWCD) has been in existence since 1969
to serve Marion County and help landowners with land use issues, drainage, soil erosion, and
water quality. He said SWCD provides technical assistance to landowners and educational

Administration and Finance Committee
August 22, 2006
Page 12
information regarding natural resources in the county. He said the SWCD is a state unit of
government, but the primary part of their budget comes from the city and county. The state
provides few funds to the budget. Mr. Cox said SWCD works closely with local government,
organizations and landowners. He said the SWCD goes onto private land to help landowners
regarding natural resource issues. The City, County and State primarily work on public lands.
Mr. Cox said the SWCD forms a good conservation partnership with local, state and federal
governments.
Mr. Cox said SWCD is asking for a budget of $160,000 for 2007. He said the biggest budget
item this year is office space because the SWCD will now pay rent. He said in past years, rent
was provided through the US Department of Natural Resources (USDNR). He said the USDNR
has cut back on funding which has forced them to pick up the cost. Mr. Cox said SWCD would
like to give a 3% salary increase to its employees. He said office expenses have also increased.
Mr. Cox said they are trying to raise money through tree sales and they are pursuing state and
federal grant dollars to offset some of the budget shortfall.
Chair Sanders said that some budgets are being maintained at last year’s levels. She asked if
SWCD had plans for who should be approached for rent. Mr. Laster said they have been looking
at several locations. He said they are renegotiating with their current facility. Mr. Laster said
they were looking at another space, but the hidden costs made the rental fee higher than what is
currently being paid. Chair Sanders asked if there were a current source for the funding. Mr.
Laster answered in the negative. He said in the past the federal government provided rent as a
part of their in-kind contribution, but since they had reductions, the federal government is asking
local entities to pick up some of the cost. He said this is happening all over the country. Chair
Sanders asked if the federal government has withdrawn other in-kind contributions. Mr. Laster
said it has been rent and some telephone expenses. He said USDNR is trying to reduce their
overhead. Mr. Laster said they are still providing technical assistance and the person that covers
Marion County also covers Hendricks County.
Councillor Nytes asked for an explanation of the report that Councillors receive from SWCD and
how review sites are determined. Mr. Laster said the Department of Metropolitan Development
(DMD) has requirements and the Indiana Department of Environmental Management has passed
down reviews of stormwater and erosion control which is referred to as Rule 5. He said DMD is
uncomfortable doing some stormwater reviews. DMD asked them to review and comment on
erosion sites and the precautions that developers take as it relates to erosion control. He said
Rule 5 states that anything over one acre of disturbance must have an erosion control plan. Mr.
Laster said that there are three types of letters sent out that are related to erosion. One letter
states the site was reviewed and no problems were found, another states problems were found
and need to be corrected by working with DMD. The last letter states there are some serious
problems and if the problems are not worked out the site may be referred to IDEM for further
action. Mr. Laster said the report that the Councillors receive generally identifies sites where
there is not a major problem. He said that Councillors like getting the letters because it allows
them to know what is happening in their neighborhood.

Administration and Finance Committee
August 22, 2006
Page 13
Councillor Nytes asked if Marion County was the service area for SWCD. Mr. Laster answered
in the affirmative. Councillor Nytes stated that since they are a part of state government they
cannot be consolidated into another agency or department. Mr. Cox said consolidation has been
discussed but their employees are not city or county employees. He said the employees are paid
through the district, so they do not have any retirement or health insurance from the city or
county. Councillor Nytes said the function of SWCD has a lot of overlap with the Department of
Public Works (DPW) and DMD. She said maybe one day there could be some efficiencies if
SWCD were joined with DPW or DMD.
Mr. Cox said they are working on a memorandum of understanding with the Cities of Lawrence
and Speedway to do their work. Mr. Cox said they are a natural resource agency and there is an
issue of where they fit in the overall government structure.
Ms. Diller said last year the OFM proposed a zero budget for SWCD, thinking that DMD and
DPW could do the work, but after speaking with both departments it was realized that DMD and
DPW need SWCD, and they are good partners with the city agencies. She said OFM did not
think about moving the SWCD into DMD and DPW.
Councillor Nytes said it should be looked at from a financial standpoint and a physical
standpoint. She said many of their phone calls and emails are probably to the staff of DMD and
DPW and everyone could benefit from having SWCD closer. Councillor Nytes said she is not
sure that the city’s rent would be less than the $14,000 per year they are currently paying, but the
association should be looked at because it might be an opportunity to do something better for
SWCD and also provide more benefits to the city and county.
County Treasurer
Mike Rodman, treasurer and Tom Creasser, chief deputy gave the presentation (A copy of the
presentation, Exhibit E, is on file in the Council’s Office along with the original set of minutes.)
Mr. Rodman said the job of the Treasurer’s Office is to collect and account for taxes. He said
they try to follow all state and local laws. The Treasurer’s Office also provides clear and concise
tax information to citizens. Once taxes are collected, the Treasurer’s Office tries to get the
highest yield when investing the money. Mr. Rodman said Mr. Creasser has been successful in
exceeding the revenue that was budgeted. Last year, revenue almost doubled the amount
expected. The increased amount was due to the implementation of a competitive bidding process
for banks that were interested in doing business with the Treasurer’s Office. Mr. Rodman said
that once the money is collected the office distributes the money. He said earlier in the year the
committee was provided with an analysis of how the funds are received and where the funds are
allocated.
Mr. Rodman said the Treasurer’s Office prints 600,000 property tax bills that are mailed to
homeowners and businesses. He said 154,000 tax information notices are mailed to homeowners
that have their taxes escrowed by a mortgage company. Mr. Rodman said the information
notices are mailed to homeowners; because it is important for them to know their tax liability.
He said the office receives a lot of calls from homeowners with questions regarding their escrow

Administration and Finance Committee
August 22, 2006
Page 14
account. Mr. Rodman said 322,000 bills and files are sent to various mortgage servicers. He
said that Mr. Creasser was successful in lowering the cost of printing in 2005. In 2006, printing
costs were decreased by an additional $22,983, even though postal rates increased. Mr. Rodman
said when postal rates increase in 2007 it will be a challenge to stay within budget.
Mr. Creasser gave the following breakdown of how property tax collections were paid by
property owners in the spring 2006:
 Credit Cards $2,069,177
at
0.4%
 Automatic Debt$6,713,177

1.2%
 At Banks

 By mortgage servicers
$132,317,635 at
24.5%
 Lock box (mail)
$281,203,704 at
52.1%
Mr. Creasser said the Treasurer’s Office also collects fees for assessments by the City of
Indianapolis and Excluded Cities. Those are:
 Stromwater
$8,175,614 – City of Indianapolis
 Solid Waste Fee
$4,290,014 - City of Indianapolis
 Health and Hospital Corp.
$312,557
 Sewers
$639,224 (DPW and Excluded Cities)
 Weeds
$170,400 (DPW and Excluded Cities)
 DMD
$185,747
Mr. Creasser said that the Treasurer’s Office would like property taxpayers who escrow through
the Treasurer’s Office to use the automated debiting process once there is a new property system.
That would allow the Treasurer’s Office to collect money earlier and invest it earlier.
Chair Sanders asked if Excluded Cities compensates the Treasurer’s Office for collections. Mr.
Creasser answered in the negative.
Councillor McWhirter asked how the Treasurer’s Office corrects the shortfalls in the escrow
accounts that they handle. Mr. Rodman said the Treasurer’s Office has a good idea of what the
escrow amount should be. He said they prefer to collect a little more than the actual amount so
there is a cushion for any possible shortfall. Mr. Rodman said if people paid monthly and
directly, then the money would be invested sooner. He said some property taxpayers round their
tax bills up, and those additional dollars go into a surplus account for the taxpayers. Mr.
Rodman said the taxpayer can request that the money be applied to the next tax bill or be
refunded. He said only ¼ of taxpayers have their payments escrowed.
Mr. Rodman said some mortgage companies cause a problem when they submit a check with a
stack of escrow bills, but the amount of the check does not balance with the amount of the
escrowed bills submitted to the Treasurer’s Office. Mr. Rodman said if a shortfall occurs, a
problem is created because there is no way to determine whose escrow bill was not paid in full
and who should be assessed a penalty.

Administration and Finance Committee
August 22, 2006
Page 15
Mr. Rodman said taxpayers, particularly elderly taxpayers on fixed income, want to pay on a
monthly basis because they receive their pension and social security checks on a monthly basis.
He said it is hard for them to put a little money aside each month to save up for a lump payment
because emergencies may arise and they would need to used the money for the emergency.
Mr. Rodman said they have a lot of incorrect addresses on file and therefore, a lot of mail is
returned. He said if they had a new property system, the Treasurer’s Office would be able to
correct addresses. Currently, the Treasurer’s Office cannot make an address correction, and that
is frustrating to the homeowner. The current property tax system only allows Township
Assessors to make address corrections. Mr. Rodman said if the Treasurer’s Office could make
address corrections, then money would be saved and it would save taxpayers from getting into
arrears.
Mr. Creasser said in the month of June over $688 million was distributed by the Treasurer’s
Office.
Mr. Creasser said when people pay by credit card they are assessed a fee by the credit card
company. The sliding scale average fee was 3.38%, but now it is a fixed rate of 3% that the
taxpayer must pay. He said the amount goes to the vendor and the Treasurer’s Office does not
get involved with the transactions, although the Treasurer’s Office was instrumental in getting a
lower rate for the taxpayers. Mr. Creasser said they believe the amount will be lowered again.
Mr. Creasser said the number of banks that will accept tax payments has also increased.
Mr. Rodman said some financial institutions were not on the approved list of banks to receive
taxpayer deposits. He said they worked with those banks to get them approved by the state.
Councillor McWhirter asked if there was an additional fee for paying banks and if banks were
compensated for receiving payments. Mr. Rodman said each bank has their own policy. Some
banks do not charge their customers for the service and some banks do.
Councillor Nytes asked for the current system used to correct addresses. Mr. Rodman said a
form must be filled out for an address correction and the form is placed in a box for the
Township Assessors to make the change. He said some taxpayers have found it difficult to get
their address corrected by the Township Assessor, and there is not a direct penalty to Township
Assessors if an address is not changed. Mr. Rodman said he is not suggesting there should be a
penalty, but there is not a benefit to the Township Assessors to ensure that bad addresses are
corrected. Mr. Rodman said that some Township Assessors do a good job when it comes to
correcting addresses. Councillor Nytes said she has a constituent that has been trying for three
years to get their address corrected.
Mr. Rodman said they manually research over 600 parcels each month that may be up for
foreclosure and a Sheriff’s sale. The office also researches property records on over 6,000
government employees in Marion County to ensure they are not delinquent on their property tax
bills. If an employee is delinquent there is a procedure for taking the money from their
paycheck.

Administration and Finance Committee
August 22, 2006
Page 16
Mr. Rodman said over 10,000 demand notices and 5,000 clerk judgment letters are mailed from
the office.
Mr. Rodman said the Treasurer’s Office conducts the property tax sales. He said the sales
normally last for three days. Mr. Rodman said his office distributes information and keeps a
record of the people that attend the sales. He said 1,150 properties were sold in 2005, and $4.4
million, over expenses, was collected. Mr. Rodman said there are over 4,000 properties that
were certified to the County Auditor that will be eligible for sale on September 21, 2006. He
said the sale is a way to raise money that is needed for the General Fund.
Mr. Rodman said the County Commissioners sell county owned surplus property and make
appointments to various boards.
Mr. Rodman said the Treasurer’s Office has two people that handle bankruptcies and attend
hearings to ensure that the County’s interest in the property is protected. He said the office also
does clearances for anyone that needs a permit or license. Mr. Rodman said they make sure that
people seeking a clearance are current on their property taxes.
Mr. Rodman said in 2005, the amount of work sent to the collection agency was increased and
the amount collected was $2.4 million which is a 125% increase from 2004. Mr. Creasser said
five people on staff spend all of their time answering the phone. He said as it gets closer to the
payment date the number of calls increase. Mr. Creasser said the office also receives phone calls
for bankruptcy and collections.
Mr. Creasser said that in 2005 the Treasurer’s Office made over $7.7 million in interest. In
2006, that amount was $6.7 million by August 22. He said the increase is due to increased rates,
and bank specials. Mr. Rodman said some banks are offering good rates that are not being
published to the public.
Mr. Creasser said Character 1 increased by nearly $100,000 due to Health Insurance. He said
Character 3 increased due to the number of bills that may be printed next year. He said printing
was a shared expense by other county agencies, but the cost will now be in the Treasurer’s
budget. He said it also increased because Postage, Subcharacter 310, will increase next year.
There are also Warrant Agreements, Subcharacter 349, for the cashier system that must be
maintained. Mr. Creasser said under Professional Services, Subcharacter 361, an attorney is
used for bankruptcies, and an accountant is used for financial services. He said some bonds are
not covering all their expenses, and Family and Children Services costs are higher than
anticipated.
Councillor Nytes asked for an explanation for staff turnover in 2006. Mr. Rodman said someone
moved out of the state and some people got jobs with the State of Indiana. Cindy Land, deputy
treasurer, said some temporary people that worked as seasonal cashiers were terminated and that
may account for the turnover rate. She said there is not a high turnover rate for full time
employees. Mr. Rodman said a few people left, but they have tried to keep the experienced staff,

Administration and Finance Committee
August 22, 2006
Page 17
because they know how the office operates and they know the customers. Mr. Creasser said two
people left this year. One retired and the other left because of marriage. He said there are 28
people on the staff.
Councillor Brown asked for an explanation of Interest, Subcharacter 379. Mr. Creasser said the
interest rates next year will be higher and the Family and Children Services tax anticipation
bonds need to be higher because the second half of 2006 does not cover the cost. Mr. Rodman
said the budgeted amount for 2006 was not enough. Mr. Creasser said the expense was picked
up during the second half of 2005. Mr. Clifford said the Family and Children Fund was
underbudgeted at the beginning of the year and the OFM did not seek bonds for the $35 million
shortfall until late Spring. He said Family and Children Services caused the early draw down of
all tax money and that caused the interest expense to increase. Mr. Clifford said interest rates are
expected to be higher in 2007. Mr. Rodman said the interest was previously in the County
Auditor’s budget and was placed in the County Treasurer’s budget the latter part of 2005. Mr.
Clifford said another appropriation was made, but it is not reflected in the 2006 budget because
of delays.
Councillor Nytes asked if Subcharacter 379, for $529,000, would be revised again to reflect the
added appropriation. Mr. Clifford answered in the affirmative.
Councillor Brown asked for an explanation of TMA. Mr. Rodman said his administration was
not involved with the initial negotiations. He said the program was sold to Township Assessors
with the understanding that for every $4 collected, $3 would stay with the local unit of
government. Mr. Rodman said it has not worked out that way. He said TMA billed $5 million,
$4 million has been collected and $1 million was refunded. Mr. Rodman said it has not cost the
County, but it has not turned out to be a good deal for local government.
Councillor McWhirter asked if TMA had completed its work in Marion County. Mr. Rodman
said they are not a part of the contract. The nine Township Assessors signed the contract. Chair
Sanders said additional questions should be referred to the Township Assessors when they
present their budgets.
Election Board
Doris Ann Sadler, Marion County Clerk, and Chari Burke, chief deputy presented the budget.
Ms. Sadler passed out a copy of the budget request (See Exhibit F on file in the Council’s Office
along with the original set of minutes).
Ms. Sadler said that more money is needed for new things that are happening at the Election
Board. She said the last three and a half years have been active with items such as new voting
machines and new federal laws. Ms. Sadler said nothing major is scheduled for 2007, but that
does not mean the State Legislature will not require changes during the 2007 session of the
General Assembly, which will require additional funds. She said the budget for 2007 is almost
identical to the 2006 budget. Ms. Sadler said there is a difference between the 2006
appropriations and the 2006 request. She said they are working with the OFM to finish funding
the November 2006 election. Mr. Sadler said the 2007 budget is similar to budgets from the

Administration and Finance Committee
August 22, 2006
Page 18
past. She said it was difficult to put the budget together this year because spending was not
known in some areas and money was used from the County Clerk’s budget to cover the budget
challenges of the Election Board while the funding issue for the November 2006 is being
resolved.
Mr. Sadler said the transportation and machine delivery budget is less than requested this year,
because the election vendor did not have the electronic ballots ready to use for the machines for
persons with disabilities. She said any leftover money would be needed for the 2007 elections.
Councillor Nytes asked who produced the Election Board’s budget that was distributed at the
meeting and a correlation between it and the budget in the budget book (A copy of the 2007
budget book is on file in the Council’s Office). Ms. Sadler the last column of the handout with
the title “2007 OFM” should be in the budget book.
Chair Sanders said she could not locate Special Pay/Compensation, Subcharacter 50, on the
Clerk’s handout. Mr. Clifford said it was located on page 3 of the handout under Election Day
Preparation.
Councillor Nytes asked if another level was added to the budget that was handed out. Ms. Sadler
answered in the affirmative.
Ms. Sadler said there was one $90,000 appropriation for 2006 to cover part of what was needed
to get through the year. She said the Election Board still needs approximately $385,000 through
the end of year.
Councillor Nytes asked why the budget did not have enough money for the 2006 elections since
everyone knew the elections were going to happen. Ms. Sadler said when the budget was
approved last year, the Election Board was aware that it was not enough to fund the 2006
elections. Mr. Clifford said the budget was put together in 2005 and the 2006 budget was based
on the previous year expenses. He said the OFM probably did not include everything. Ms.
Sadler said she thinks the 2005 numbers were used, but there were no elections in 2005. She
said what was requested for 2006 greatly outweighed what was spent in 2005 and by the time the
budget was produced it was too late to change the numbers and it was decided to address the
shortfall later.
Councillor Nytes asked if the shortfall was known ahead of time. Ms. Sadler answered in the
affirmative and said there was a discussion on the shortfall. Councillor Nytes asked if there
would be an additional appropriation before November. Ms. Sadler said she hoped to have the
appropriations by then.
Ms. Diller said the OFM is working the Election Board to figure out the amount needed. She
said $90,000 has been added to Character 1 because of transfers from other characters. Ms.
Diller said they wanted to see what was left from the May 2006 elections and now they will
analyze the budget to see what additional dollars are needed. Ms. Sadler said they predict an
additional $385,000 is needed to get through the end of the year.

Councillor Nytes asked if the issue would be resolved and the money accounted for before the
Council votes on the final budget. Ms. Diller answered in the affirmative.
Mr. Brown asked if any contracts need to be made prior to the election. Ms. Sadler said most of
the printing will happen before the election and other services will be billed on a contractual
basis after the election.
Chair Sanders asked if there was any compensation from ES&S to offset some of the election
expenses. Ms. Sadler said there was a $2 million settlement in 2005 for previous issues. She
said the Election Board is pursuing monetary compensation for problems that occurred in the
May 2006 primary. Ms. Sadler said the Secretary of State also announced a settlement with
ES&S for the entire state, but Marion County will still pursue its own compensation from ES&S
because the State’s settlement does not cover all of the damages suffered in Marion County. She
said a dollar amount has been assessed to some of the damages, such as temporary employees
that were hired to do work, but sat idle. Ms. Sadler said some damages are hard to assess a
dollar amount, such as the inability of the machines to read Washington and Decatur Township
School Board ballots. She said they are working with the Office of Corporation Counsel on the
issue.
Chair Sanders asked if the Secretary of State’s settlement covers other counties. Ms. Sadler said
the lawsuit included Marion County and problems in other parts of the state, but it did not
include monetary returns to Marion County for its services that were paid out of pocket.
Councillor Bateman asked what is being done to educate the public on the new Voter ID law.
Ms. Sadler said there is no program in place for educating the public, but the Secretary of State’s
Office has a funded program in which there is a mailer and television commercial on the issue.
She said there is nothing budgeted, but some public service announcements are being aired over
the radio. Ms. Sadler said a lot of time has been spent educating poll workers on the issue.
Chair Sanders asked if the poll workers are predominately inspectors and judges that worked in
previous elections. Ms. Sadler answered in the affirmative and said it also included clerks.
Chair Sanders asked if there would be a similar program for the November 2006 poll workers.
Ms. Sadler said there would be a video for the inspectors, and the Office of Voter Registration
would assist with clerk’s training. She said clerk and judge training is now mandatory. She said
her staff would assist with the judge’s training and a lot of time would be spent on the Voter ID
law.
Councillor Nytes asked for an explanation of staff turnover. Ms. Sadler said the Election Board
had six staff positions and the number was reduced to four in 2005. She said one employee has
left, because there will be a new Clerk after the November 2006 election. Ms. Burke said that
temporary and seasonal workers might also be a part of the turnover rate. Councillor Nytes said
that is probably the case, because the report indicates that there were 14 people terminated from
January to August. Ms. Sadler said temporary workers are hired from an agency and part-time
workers are sometimes hired, so those terminations were probably included in the number. Ms.

Burke said the employees are included on the payroll so they can be terminated at the end of the
election season.
Councillor Nytes asked if there were any residuals from the movie regarding Marion County’s
election process. Ms. Sadler answered in the negative.
Ms. Sadler distributed a spreadsheet (See Exhibit G on file in the Council’s Office along with the
original set of minutes.) on the loan payments for the voting machines. She said not much has
changed, but the State still owes Marion County $2.2 million which would be the last payment
of federal funds. She said the payment was held because of the Secretary of State’s investigation
of ES&S. Ms. Sadler said they should get the check on August 24, 2006. She said once the
check is received a payment will be made on the loan and then the OFM and the Bond Bank will
be responsible for making the remaining payments. Mr. Clifford said the $2.2 million will not
go to the General Fund, but will be used to pay on the debt for the new voting machines.
Ms. Burke said one side of the spreadsheet shows the balance with a contribution from the
County and the other side shows the balance on the loan without a contribution from the County.
Councillor Nytes asked if there is a request being made in the Election Board’s budget for a
payment in 2007. Ms. Sadler answered in the negative. Ms. Diller said over the last two years,
the Election Board has come back to the Council to ask for additional appropriations. She said
funds have been received from the State to make the payments.
Councillor Nytes said she was comfortable with the payment arrangement for the voting
machines when the federal government provided some funds to cover the cost; however, since
that money will be exhausted, there is a concern for how the outstanding amount of the loan will
be repaid. Councillor Nytes asked for the amount that will be due in 2007. Ms. Sadler said $4
million remains for the life of the loan. Ms. Sadler said when the machines were purchased, it
was anticipated that the County’s non-election year dollars, which is typically $1.5 million,
would be used to pay down the loan as well as an additional $450,000 appropriation every year.
She said the County Auditor did not agree with the appropriation and the additional $450,000 has
not been funded.
Councillor Nytes said the County Clerk and the County Auditor did not want the appropriation in
their budget, so it was not appropriated. Ms. Sadler said she did not have a problem with the
money in her budget because that is where it should have been funded. Mr. Clifford said at one
point the County was to be reimbursed $9 million out of $11 million from the state and federal
government. He said the amount of reimbursement has fallen short of that amount. Mr. Clifford
said the County Clerk and the Bond Bank are considering other options to get more money back.
He said there would be a multi-million dollar balance when the note needs to be renewed, and it
is likely that it will be financed and added to a tax debt service at that time. He said that will not
be done now because there is still hope that the County will get more money back, and there is
still the issue of the Department of Family and Children Services (DFCS) loan that will be levied
as a debt service tax rate. He said after 2007 the DFCS issues should be over and that will be the
time to pick up the Election Board debt.

Councillor Brown thanked Ms. Sadler for her service as the County Clerk and her work on the
Criminal Justice Planning Council (CJPC). He said the CJPC came up with some solutions to
public safety issues and that was important. Councillor Brown said that he hopes she is allowed
to stay on the CJPC after her term as County Clerk ends.
Ms. Sadler said she hopes to stay involved through her capacity as vice president of the Bar
Association.
Ms. Sadler said the movie on the elections in Marion County portrays Indianapolis positively.
She said Indianapolis has received a lot of positive comments from around the country as it
relates to the movie. She said the movie is non-partisan and it shows people working together to
run the election. Ms. Sadler said the movie also shows that elections are very difficult and they
lack sufficient poll workers. She said a lot of people did not know that elections need volunteers.
Marion County requires 5,000 volunteers for its election.
CONCLUSION
With no further business pending, and upon motion duly made, the Administration and Finance
Committee of the City-County Council was adjourned at 7:30 p.m.
