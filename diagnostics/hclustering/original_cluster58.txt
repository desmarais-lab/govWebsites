Landlord and Tenant Relations
 
The information provided here and in the Landlord-Tenant Relations Booklet are
provided as a courtesy of the Elkhart Human Relations Commission and it is
provided forinformation purposes only. Please contact an attorney for legal
advice.
 
What are my Responsabilities?
As a landlord you should:
    * Deliver the rental premises to a tenant in compliance with the lease
      agreement, and in safe, clean and habitable condition.
    * Comply with all health and housing codes applicable to the rental
      premises.
    * Make all reasonable efforts to keep common areas of a rental premises
      clean and proper condition.
    * Provide and maintain appliances, elevators, electrical, plumbing,
      heating/venting/air conditioning and sanitary systems in a rental
      premises in good and safe working condition, if provided on premises at
      time of lease agreement.
 
As a tenant you should:
    * Comply with all obligations imposed on a tenant by applicable provisions
      of health and housing codes.
    * Keep the areas of the rental premises occupied or used by the tenant
      reasonably clean.
    * Use appliances, elevators, electrical, plumbing, heating/venting/air
      conditioning and sanitary systems in a reasonable manner.
    * Refrain from defacing, damaging, destroying, impairing, or removing any
      part of the rental premises.
    * Comply with all reasonable rules and regulations in lease agreement. If
      lease agreement is amended, tenant shall also comply to those rules and
      regulations.
    * Ensure that each smoke detector installed in the rental premises remains
      functional.
 
What is a Lease Agreement?
A lease agreement are the rules you agree to live by while renting a dwelling.
It can be a written or an oral agreement. A lease is alegally binding document,
which contains rights and responsibilities of the landlord and the tenant.
 
A lease should contain the following:
    * Address of dwelling unit
    * Names and signatures of the landlord and the tenant(s)
    * The starting and ending dates of lease
    * The amount of rent
    * Pet deposit/pet rent
    * When rent is due and late fees
    * Who pays the utilities
    * The amount of any deposit and the conditions for return of the deposit
    * The name of the person who is responsible for repairs and damages to the
      property
    * A description of the condition of the property at the time the tenant
      moves in and when the tenant moves out
    * A list of all persons that will be living in the dwelling
    * Repair and maintenance responsibilities
A good lease will contain all of these things but does not have to contain all
of them to belegally binding by the parties. Be sure you understand the lease
before you sign it.
 
How much Deposit can a landlord charge?
There are no rules in the State of Indiana governing how much deposit landlords
can charge. Normally landlords charge one (1) month&rsquo;s rent or first and
last month&rsquo;s rent.
 
Can a landlord charge a Pet Rent and Pet Deposit?
Yes. There is no law prohibiting a landlord from charging an extra fee as a pet
depositor prohibiting a landlord from charging an extra fee each month for a
pet. This additional fee may be considered pet rent. There are no rules that
state how much landlords can charge and the pet deposit and/or the monthly pet
rent may also be NON-REFUNDABLE. Be sure you understand the terms of lease
before you sign it or verbally commit to it.
 
The pet rent/deposit may be:
    * non-refundable
    * in addition to your security deposit
    * unrealistic
    * permitted by state law
    * MAY NOTbe charged if you have a service animal (certified for your
      disability). Exemptions exist.
    * any amount agreed to by you and your landlord  
    * non-discriminatory
    * based on size of pet
    * based on number of pets
    * based on type of pet
 
What is a Service or Support Animal?
Service animals are animals that have been trained to perform tasks that assist
people with disabilities. Service animals may also be referred to as assistance
animals, assist animals, support animals, or helper animals. Service or support
animals are not pets.
 
Move-In and Move-Out Checklist
Before you move intoa rented Home or Apartment, be sure to do a walk through
with the owner or property manager. Why? Because when you move out, the
landlord may attempt to charge you for "damages" to the unit. What defines
damages is often contested and the tenant, unless they have a move-in-checklist
and pictures, may lose out in court.
When you move outa general rule of thumb to remember- are you leaving the unit
in the same condition as when you moved in? Again take pictures and have the
landlord or property manager agree to the condition. Same when you leave.
A landlord can only withhold for damages in amounts that are deemed reasonable
for the damage claimed. If a defect existed before you moved in, you should not
be charged for that particular problem. The importance of pictures and a move-
in checklist cannot be stressed enough. Normal wear and tear is vague term and
means different things to different people. As a landlord or tenant you should
protect yourself.
 
Do I need to save my receipts?
Yes, a receipt is your protection should the landlord claim that you are behind
in your rent and takes you to Small Claims Court to evict you. You should
always pay your rent by check or money order. If you pay in cash, be sure to
have the landlord give you a signed and dated receipt.
 
Can my landlord enter my dwelling at any time?
No, unless the landlord has a court order or if the tenant has abandoned or
surrendered the property. The landlord may enter the property without notice in
case of an emergency that threatens the safety of the occupants or the
property. The landlord does have the right to have a key to your dwelling and
to inspect for damages you may have caused. The landlord shallNOT abuse the
right of entry or use the right of entry to harass a tenant. The landlord
shallgive a tenant reasonable written or oral notice of the landlord&rsquo;s
intent to enter the property and may enter only at reasonable times.
 
Does a landlord have to provide a functional smoke detector?
Yes. The landlord shall require the tenant to admit in writing that the rental
unit is equipped with a functional smoke detector when the tenant moves in.
This agreement cannot bewaived in the rental agreement or a separate writing.
 
Do I need renters&rsquo; insurance?
No, but it is a good idea. Renters&rsquo; insurance is available for covering
your personal property at reasonable rates. The landlord is not responsible for
your personal belongings in case of fire, theft, etc. Contact an insurance
agent for information.
 
Can my landlord raise my rent, change or end the lease?
Unless otherwise provided for in a written lease, a landlord is required to
give a tenant at least thirty (30) days&rsquo; written notice before modifying
the rental agreement, including any changes in the amount of rent.
 
If my rent is late, can I be charged a late fee?            
Yes, if it is stated in your lease. If you have paid rent late in the past and
the landlord has accepted it without charging a late fee, the landlord must
notify you in writing when the lease is renewed that late payments will result
in a late fee being charged and the amount to be paid as a late fee.
 
Can I be evicted if I can only pay part of my rent?
Yes, you agreed to pay all of your rent on time. If you fail to do so, you are
breaking the lease and can be evicted.
 
If my landlord refuses to fix things, can I withhold part of my rent?
No, with very few exceptions. You should seek legal advice. All of the
following must happen:
    * You must notify the landlord preferably in writing of the repairs
      necessary, keep a copy of the letter, and turn a copy of the letter over
      to Code Enforcement Officials at 229 S. Second Street (City Municipal
      Building) if the property is located within the city limits.
 
The landlord must make necessary repairs if:
    * Stated in the lease.
    * By saying, he/she will make the repairs (have a witness to prove this).
    * By sending someone to make the repairs.
    * By being told by Code Enforcement Officials to make the repairs.
 
You should give the landlord time to make the necessary repairs and keep your
rent current.
 
Can my landlord take my personal property out of my home or prevent me from
getting my property if I do not pay my rent?
No, under the law, your landlord generally cannot take or dispose of your
personal property for any reason, even if you have not paid your rent or have
violated your lease in some way. There are exceptions to this rule. Your
landlord may be able to take or dispose of your personal property if: Your
landlord has a court order that allows him/her to take or dispose of your
property; or you sign an agreement with your landlord separate from your lease
that your landlord may hold your property freely offered in exchange for the
landlord not evicting you; or there is a mobile home park lien on your
property; or if the rented property has been abandoned by the tenant.
 
If your landlord keeps your belongings, you should immediately demand their
return. You should go get them quickly if the landlord offers to return them.
If they are not returned, you might be able to sue your landlord to have them
returned. You should consult an attorney as soon as possible to determine your
legal rights if your landlord is holding your personal property.
 
Can my landlord lock me out of my home?
No, your landlord cannot change the locks, install a dead bolt, or do anything
to prevent you from entering your home, UNLESS your landlord has a court order
allowing them to do so. One exception to this rule is if you have not paid or
offered to pay your rent AND your home has been abandoned. You have abandoned
your home if the circumstances reasonably show that you have given up
possession.    
 
What are the reasons my landlord can evict me?
Even if your rent is current, the landlord may evict you for the following
reasons:
    * If you willfully and severely damage the property.
    * Break the terms of the lease.
    * If you do not have a written lease, the landlord may end the lease with
      only one (1) rent period&rsquo;s warning: If you pay weekly, one (1)
      week&rsquo;s notice; if you pay monthly, one (1) month&rsquo;s notice,
      etc.
                                                                                              
How can my landlord evict me?
The landlord must take you to court. Also, you must receive notice of any legal
action taken by your landlord against you.
The landlord need only show that you are behind in your rent. If the landlord
goes through Small Claims Court, you will receive notice by certified mail or
delivery by the sheriff. There will be a date for you to appear in court; if
you do not show up; the landlord automatically wins. You will be allowed to
present evidence in court (This is why you save your receipts). If you cannot
be in court at the time you are ordered to appear, contact the court before the
date and request a new court date.
 
Can my landlord shut off my utilities if I have not paid the rent?
No, not unless your landlord has a court order allowing him/her to shut off
your utilities, or you have abandoned your home. However, your landlord can
shut off your electricity, gas, water, or other essential services if there is
an emergency, to make repairs, or for necessary construction. The landlord also
cannotremove the doors, windows, fixtures, or appliances from your home.
 
Can my landlord terminate my lease as a victim of certain crimes?
No. A landlord may not terminate, refuse to renew, refuse to enter into a lease
or retaliate against a tenant solely because a tenant, applicant, or a member
of the tenant&rsquo;s or applicant&rsquo;s household is a protected individual.
 
What is a protected individual?
A protected individual is one who is a victim or alleged victim of a crime
involving domestic or family violence, a sex offense or a stalking offense
andhas received a civil order for protection or a restraining order issued by
the court.
 
Does my landlord have to change my locks if a court issues a protection/
restraining order?
Yes. You must provide the landlord a written request and the copy of the court
order. The landlord has no later than forty-eight (48) hours to change the
locks if the individual restrained from contact with the tenant does not reside
at the same property. The landlord has no later than twenty-four (24), if
individual restrain does reside in the same property.
The tenant shall be responsible for reimbursing the landlord for the actual
expense incurred for changing the locks. If the landlord fails to change the
locks and the tenant changes the locks, the landlord shall reimburse the tenant
for the actual expense incurred in changing the locks.  
 
What can I do if my landlord has wrongfully locked me out of my home or shut
off my utilities?
You can ask your local Small Claims Court for an emergency order telling your
landlord to let you back in your home or restore your utility service. You must
file a sworn written statement that tells the court exactly what your landlord
has done, or threatened to do, and what damages, inconveniences, and costs you
have suffered because of your landlord&rsquo;s actions. When you ask for an
emergency order, the court must set an emergency hearing within three (3)
business days.
 
What will happen at the emergency hearing?
At the hearing, you can get an emergency order returning your home to you and
preventing your landlord from committing further violations. If the court finds
probable cause that your landlord has threatened to or has locked you out,
removed doors, windows, fixtures, or appliances, or shut off your utilities,
AND you will suffer immediate and serious damage, you can be granted an
emergency hearing.
 
The court also can make other orders, depending on your situation, and set
another hearing to award damages or to order the return of any of your property
that your landlord has taken.
 
Can my landlord get an emergency order too?
Yes, your landlord can get an emergency order if he/she proves that there is
probable cause to believe you have committed or threatened to commit waste to
your home and they have suffered immediate and serious damage due to your
actions. Waste does not include failing to pay your rent. Your landlord can get
an emergency order that tells you to move from your home or stop committing
waste to your home.
 
My landlord got an emergency order evicting me, but I did not know about the
hearing. Is there anything that I can do?
When a landlord asks for a hearing and order, the court clerk must give you
notice of the date, time, and place of the hearing. If you do not get notice of
the hearing, you can ask the court to set aside the emergency order and give
you a new hearing. If you are in this situation, you should contact a private
attorney or your local legal services office.
 
Under what circumstances can my landlord keep my deposit?
    * You have not paid all of your rent up to the time you move.
    * You have caused damage beyond normal wear and tear.
    * The dwelling is very dirty when you move out.
    * You have not paid all utilities due that are your obligation to pay.
 
The landlord has forty-five (45) days after you move out to return either your
full deposit or an itemized list of damages and the amount of damages claimed.
You must give the landlord a written notice of your forwarding address.
 
Your deposit may be used to pay for the damages claimed by the landlord. If
there is a refund remaining after any damages are assessed to you, then the
landlord must pay that to you within that forty-five (45) day period. This list
must be sent to you with payment for the amount of your deposit that was not
withheld for damages.
 
If I move before my lease has ended, do I still have to pay rent?
If you agreed to rent a dwelling until a certain date and you move out prior to
that date, the landlord may charge you rent if the dwelling remains empty. The
landlord must make a reasonable effort to rent the dwelling.
 
Does my landlord have to renew my lease if my rent is current and I want to
stay?
No, the landlord is not obligated to rent to you beyond the date agreed. If
there is no written lease, the landlord must give you one (1) rent
period&rsquo;s notice prior to ending the lease. If you have a year-to-year
lease with no ending date, the landlord must give you three (3) months&rsquo;
notice to end the lease.
 
What should I do if my rental property does not meet minimum housing standards?
If the property is within the City of Elkhart, contact Code Enforcement at
(574) 294-5471 between 8:00 a.m. &ndash; 5:00 p.m. weekdays. If you have
requested that repairs be made for your safety and the landlord refused to make
needed repairs, contact Code Enforcement Officials. Do not wait until you are
being evicted to report violations.
 
Who should I contact about any lease noncompliance disputes?
For any disputes regarding non compliance with Indiana Landlord-Tenant
Relations IC 32-31such as evictions or noncompliance with the lease terms and
conditions. A landlord or tenant must go through their Small claims court. For
all residents living in Elkhart County contact the Elkhart County Small Claims
court, 315 S. 2nd Street, Elkhart, IN 46516 at (574) 523-2305.

ADMINISTRATION AND FINANCE COMMITTEE
The Administration and Finance Committee of the City-County Council met on Tuesday,
June 8,2010. Chairwoman Marilyn Pfisterer called the meeting to order at 5:31 p.m.
with the following members present: Bob Cockrum, Susie Day, Maggie Lewis, Barbara
Malone, and Joanne Sanders. Representing Council staff was Chief Financial Officer
Jim Steele. Jackie Nytes was absent.
PROPOSAL NO. 147.2010 - approves the Mayor's appointment of Manuel Mendez as
the Director of the Office of Audit and Performance
Mr. Mendez said that six sigma is a methodology to perform process improvement
activities throughout the city and county using statistical analysis. He said that he has
been involved with six sigma engagements for seven years, and he is a certified black
belt. He said that he enjoys coming to work, doing process improvement projects, and
training people on the process. Six sigma is one of those activities that can provide
assistance that will bring a lot back to the city and county, and it can occur more rapidly.
Councillor Malone asked if Mr. Mendez will work with other corporations outside of the
city and county. Mr. Mendez said that he has engaged with the courts and the

Coroner's Office. He said that he is also supporting an improvement project for Develop
Indy. He said that he will go and help any organization if it will benefit the city and
county.
Councillor Sanders asked if Mr. Mendez is restricted by ordinance, to the number of
audits that can be done per division. Mr. Mendez answered in the negative. He said
that he can go into any city or county agency to perform an audit.
Councillor Malone moved, seconded by Councillor Day, to send Proposal No. 147,2010
to the full Council with a "Do Pass" recommendation. The motion carried by a vote of 6o.
PROPOSAL NO. 148. 2010 - determines the need to lease approximately 11,500
square feet of office space at 5519 West 38th Street for use as a Marion Superior Court
probation office

Judge David Certo, Marion Superior Court, said that they have been talking about
relocating the Northwest Probation Office for a long time. He said that he is committed
to providing a proposal that is the best possible location, while understanding that there
will always be some legitimate concerns about what probation would propose to do.
Judge Certo said that he recently received additional information about this lease, and
he asked for it to be postponed until the next committee meeting.
Councillor Day moved, seconded by Councillor Malone, to "Postpone" Proposal No.
148,2010 until June 29, 2010. The motion carried by a vote of 6-0.

PROPOSAL NO. 167.2010 - determines the need to lease approximately 18,209
square feet of space at 3910 Culligan Avenue for use by the Indianapolis Metropolitan
Police Department
William Benjamin, Deputy Chief, Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department (IMPD),
and Darryl Pierce, Assistant Chief of Police, explained the lease agreement, which is
attached as Exhibit A.
Major Pierce said that Proposal No. 167, 2010 is to approve a lease that would house
dozens of police personnel, which are currently located at the Guardian Home on a
temporary basis. He said that next month, that facility will no longer be available and
this facility has enough space to house their personnel. He said that they have a longterm lease agreement that will run for 10 years, and the cost per square foot is starting
at $5.75.
Councillor Sanders asked how much space is currently being used at the Guardian
Home. Chris Dahike, IMPD, said they use 12,000 square feet. Councillor Sanders said
that this is another example of where they should have used the Space Allocation
Committee.
Councillor Lewis asked who negotiated the new lease. Major Pierce said that the
landlord and the Deputy Director of Public Safety, Jonathan Mays negotiated the lease.
He said that this facility is sufficient for what IMPD needs for personnel, and the location
is ideal for some of the strategic things that they will be doing over the next few years.
Chairwoman Pfisterer asked if the Office of Corporation Counsel was involved in the
leasing process. Major Pierce answered in the affirmative.
Councillor Malone said that the entire process of leasing a building is unacceptable, and
there needs to be a better process for city and county agencies. She said that the
purpose for this proposal is just to vote on what has already been completed.
Chairwoman Pfisterer asked if there is any idea regarding how much the utilities will
cost. Major Dahike said that this building is currently an empty warehouse and does not
exist in that format, so he is not sure what the utilities will be. He said that when doing
the build-out, the contractors will attempt to be as green as possible, which should help
with the utility cost.
Councillor Malone asked what the cost of the build-out is. Taylor Minch, Cassidy Turley
Commercial Real Estate Agency said that the build-out expenses will be somewhere in
the area of $300,000. He said that the owner will pay for that up front and amortize that
cost into the lease expense over the term.
Chairwoman Pfisterer asked if this is the reason for the rise in cost of the lease over the
term. Mr. Minch said that it is part of the reason. He said that this is a stair-step

Administration and Finance Committee
June 8, 2010

agreement, which starts off with a lower initial cost and then rises over the length of the
lease. Mr. Minch said that IMPD putting office space in an industrial building is a wise
decision, because it greatly reduces the cost. He said that office space is much more
expensive than industrial building space. He said that the other part of that is that there
are not a lot of models like this proposal, and this is the reason why they cannot
estimate the utility cost.
Councillor Lewis asked how the location was selected. Major Pierce said that they had
an IMPD officer assigned to go out in the county and locate properties that would be
sufficient and then find the best location for the cost, compared to the other locations.
He said that this officer has her real-estate license. Councillor Lewis asked who would
be responsible for the build-out. Mr. Minch said that the owner will be responsible for
contracting and managing the build-out.
Councillor Sanders asked what the current cost of leasing is at the Guardian Home.
Major Dahike said that IMPD is not paying rent; however, their funding is being used to
maintain the building. He said that in the previous building, IMPD was paying $1 a year,
and now they are paying $135,000 a year in maintenance. Councillor Sanders asked if
this lease will require additional appropriation in the IMPD budget. David Reynolds, City
Controller, said that this lease's cost fits within IMPD's current budget.
Councillor Malone referred to page three of the lease where it says the tenant will pay
the taxes. She said that IMPD is a tax-exempt entity and asked why this statement is
in the lease. Mr. Minch said that as part of the negotiations, Deputy Director Mays
made certain that the tax rates were discounted in the amount of pro-rated taxes for that
square footage.

Councillor Day moved, seconded by Councillor Cockrum, to send Proposal No. 167
2010 to the full Council with a "Do Pass" recommendation. The motion carried by a
vote of 4-2, with Councillors Lewis and Malone casting the negative votes.
Councillor Sanders said that she voted in favor of this ordinance because she
understands the time constraints IMPD is under. She said that she still has concerns
about the leasing process overall within the city and county. Major Pierce said that
IMPD is willing to help with making the process better, because there will be other lease
properties coming up this year that will come before the Council.

Mr. Reynolds said that they are very excited to be able to bring this proposal to the
committee. He said that this ordinance is asking for the funding for the Enterprise
Resource Planning (ERP) project.
Aaron Hood, Project Director, gave an update on Proposal No. 168,2010, which is
attached as Exhibit B. Some key points include:

.
.

.
.
.
.

.

.

ERP is a comprehensive, fully-integrated computer software solution to replace
the City/County's current legacy business systems.
The ERP initiative is a government process improvement project which is
supported by technology. It is not a technology project.
The Implementation modules and tools include human capital management
applications, financial applications and productivity and integration tools.
The Project Cost components are broken down into three categories:
infrastructure, external implementation services, and internal implementation
services.
The total cost of this project is estimated at $18.8 million over a five-year period.
The premise study shows that the current system is 40 years old, with five
mainframe applications, four different human resource systems, and 1100
shadow system spreadsheets and databases.
The tangible benefits of the $18.8 million over a five-year period include a $5.7
million in savings coming from increased productivity and personnel attrition.
Some intangible benefits include an increased information visibility, greater
standardization and flexibility, and also greater employee satisfaction.

Mr. Reynolds said that Proposal No. 168,2010 is requesting $7.95 million in
appropriations to fund the project in 2010 and 2011.
Councillor Cockrum asked if the Cloud Computing would be affected by the ERP
project. Glen Baker, Chief Information Officer, Information Services Agency (ISA), said
that ERP would impact this project because in some ways Cloud Computing means
hosting and supporting your systems outside of your domain or data center. He said
that part of the project is to have the ERP system hosted by Zanett, the implementation
partner, at their facilities. He said that they chose to do that, because it is the preferred
environment that is not currently supported internally. He said that the city would have
had to procure the hardware from scratch and would have been an outlay over
$200,000.
Councillor Sanders asked if the $5.6 million in 2012 is a reflection of recouping some of
the up-front cost for this project. Mr. Reynolds answered in the affirmative. He said that
they will start seeing some of the benefits, but there will be a need for some level of
additional funding in 2012 to complete the project. He said that it will just be a matter of
how many of the benefits have been realized. Councillor Sanders asked if all of the
consulting companies went through the request for proposal (RFP) process. Mr.
Reynolds answered in the affirmative.

Administration and Finance Committee

Councillor Malone asked if the State of Indiana's encompass system is similar to the
ERP system. Mr. Reynolds said that they are similar because they are both produced
by Oracle PeopleSoft Software. He said that the state's system is a case study to
show what not to do when coming up with a new system. He said that it was not the
fault of the software, but it was driven by the wrong reasons. Councillor Malone asked if
the funds for the contract of $2 million that was appropriated last year for expenses
related to contracts and lawyers have been exhausted. Mr. Reynolds said that it will be
completely exhausted because $852,000 of that appropriation is needed in order to fund
2010 and 2011. Councillor Malone asked if her firm was paid out of this appropriation.
Mr. Reynolds answered in the affirmative.

ChairwomanPfisterer asked if the $7.95 million will fund the first two years. Mr.
Reynolds answered in the affirmative. Chairwoman Pfisterer asked if there are any
funds designated for upgrades to the new system. Mr. Baker said that ISA will
implement the latest version of Oracle PeopleSoft Software and would not anticipate
that they would have to upgrade that software until after the implementation period,
which will go into 2013. He said that even at that point, there would be a three-ta-five
year time period which would be normal for this level of software for major releases.
Chairwoman Pfisterer asked if all of the agencies enterprise-wide were on board with
the new ERP system. Mr. Reynolds said that all of the agencies have been exposed to
the ERP systems, but not all have bought into the idea. He said that the role of the
Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA) is classified as Change
Management, which will help agencies with the change and help with resolution
mitigation. Chairwoman Pfisterer asked if the proposal included the $1.5 million budget
item for 2011. Mr. Reynolds answered in the negative.
Councillor Cockrum moved, seconded by Councillor Sanders, to send Proposal No.
168, 2010 to the full Council with a "Do Pass" recommendation. The motion carried by
a vote of 6-0.
There being no further business, and upon motion duly made, the meeting was
adjourned at 6:40 p.m.
Respectfully Submitted,

Marilyn Pfisterer, Chairwoman

Elkhart Human Relations Commission
The City of Elkhart's Human Relations Commission is the local civil rights
enforcement agency where complaints and issues are investigated and
researched regarding discrimination in housing and employment based on:
â Race/Color
â National Origin

Tim Neese, Mayor

â Familial Status (housing only)

States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).
The Commission staff is available as a resource to area businesses at no

housing for property owners, managers and other staff members as well as
tenants. We also provide assistance in formulating non-discriminatory housing
policies and procedures.

Notes
Housing Discrimination

Landlords may select prospective tenants based on any criteria, as long as
their decisions comply with fair housing laws and are based on legitimate
business criteria. For example, a landlord is entitled to reject someone with
poor credit history, insufficient income, or past criminal behavior. A valid
occupancy policy limiting the number of people per rental unit- one that is
based on health and safety standards- is a basis for refusing tenants.
Landlords must adhere to the same application standards and requirements
for all tenants.
Landlords may not take any of the following actions based on the above
protected categories.
1. Refuse to rent a dwelling;
2. Print or publish any notice or advertisement that suggest a preference on
a group characteristics;
3. Setting different terms, conditions, privileges for the rental of a dwelling;
4. Refusing to accommodate the needs of disabled tenants, such as
allowing service animals;
5. Provide different housing services or facilities.
6. Terminate a tenancy for a discriminatory reason.
If you feel that you have experienced discrimination while trying to rent
a home or apartment, you can file a complaint with the
Elkhart Human Relations Department.

FAIR HOUSING ACT

NOTES

Title VIII of the federal Fair Housing Act of 1968 as amended prohibits
discrimination in housing based on sex, race, color, religion, national
origin, disability, familial status (presence of children under the age of
18). A disability includes a physical or mental impairment, such as
blindness, mental retardation, chronic alcoholism, and AIDS or its related
complexes.

When you move out a general rule of thumb to remember- are you leaving the
unit in the same condition as when you moved in? Again take pictures and have
the landlord or property manager agree to the condition. Same when you leave.
A landlord can only withhold for damages in amounts that are deemed
reasonable for the damage claimed. If a defect existed before you moved in,
you should not be charged for that particular problem. The importance of
pictures and a move-in checklist cannot be stressed enough. Normal wear
and tear is vague term and means different things to different people. So
protect yourself.
A lease agreement are the rules you agree to live by while renting a dwelling.
It can be a written or an oral agreement. A lease is a legally binding document,
which contains rights and responsibilities of the landlord and the tenant.
A lease should contain the following:
ï· address of dwelling unit
ï· Landlord & tenant(s) names and signatures
ï· the starting and ending dates of lease
ï· the amount of rent
ï· pet deposit/pet rent
ï· when rent is due and late fees
ï· who pays the utilities
ï· the amount of any deposit and the conditions for return of the deposit
ï· the name of the person who is responsible for repairs and damages
