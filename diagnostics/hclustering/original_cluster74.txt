Indianapolis area and over 300 counties nationwide will no longer be in attainment.
Mr. Aaron Childs went over a graph and fact sheet. Mr. Child stated that since the standard is lower
now, it is more likely that we will have more days in the "unhealthy" category, as far as the air
quality index is concerned.

division is to maintain an air monitoring network, forecast ozone and PM 2.5, and provide daily
forecasts on a call-in phone line and website.
Ms. Carlson went over the Enforcement portion of the Air Quality Program. The Enforcement
division is to bring violators into compliance, conduct asbestos inspections, and conduct Section 105
activities, including: complaint response, major source particulate surveillance, auto and gasoline

INDIANAPOLIS AIR POLLUTION CONTROL BOARD
CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS

_____________________________________________________________________________________
RE: STAFF REPORTS – November 2007, Monthly Activities Report
(Air Monitoring Activities Report)
Mr. Aaron Childs provided an update to the Board on the Air Monitoring Activities Report for November,
2007. There were thirteen (13) days in which the air quality was in the good category and seventeen (17)
days when it was in the moderate category. The moderate days were a result of fine particle readings.
The ozone readings were in the good range the entire month.
(Permit Activities Report)
Ms. Amanda Hennessy updated the Board based on the Permit Activities Report for November, 2007. In
November, there were fifteen (15) new applications received; and sixteen (16) decisions were issued. Active
permit load is in the 80’s. Staff strives to keep this in the 60’s. The higher permits load is due to the number
of applications received in September and October. Priority is given to applications that are waiting to
construct.
(Stationary Source Compliance Activities)
Mr. Matt Mosier updated the Board on the Compliance Activities Report for November, 2007. In
November, there were fifteen (15) inspections conducted and two (2) sources were flagged as a result of
those inspections. These were flagged for a variety record keeping and work practice issues. There was
one (1) stack test conducted, which did not result in a flag.
(Notice of Violation/Agreed Judgment Activities Report)
Ms. Cheryl Carlson updated the Board on the Enforcement Activities Report for November, 2007. During the
month of November, two (2) Notices of Violation (NOVs) without referral, three (3) NOVs with referral, and
three (3) warning letters were issued. Ms. Carlson summarized the NOV report.
The Board inquired about the number of dates of violation for Tiffany Lawn and Garden Supply, Inc. Ms.
Carlson stated she is working with the Pike Township Fire Department (PTFD). Each day listed on the report
is counted as a violation and are the days on which the PTFD responded to 4931 Robinson Road regarding
open burning. OES was just recently notified of the problem because of a change of staff within the PTFD but
are now working with them on this and any future open burning incidents within Pike Township.
(Planning)
Mr. Dave Foster informed the Board that the Planning Group is planning to bring at least five (5) regulations
before the Board over next three (3) months to bring the City’s regulations more current with the state rules.
These regulations include 2, 8, 14, 17 and 20. At this time, there is no plan to have an Ordinance Review
Committee meeting prior to the February 14, 2008 meeting.

RE: STAFF REPORTS – February 2009 - Monthly Activities Reports

PRELIMINARY MINUTES – April 9, 2009
INDIANAPOLIS AIR POLLUTION CONTROL BOARD INFORMATIONAL SESSION
CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS

______________________________________________________________________________
(Air Monitoring Activities Report)
Mr. Aaron Childs provided an update to the IAPCB on the Air Monitoring Activities Report for
February 2009. There were nine (9) days in which the air quality standard was moderate and
nineteen (19) days in which the air quality standard was good. There were zero (0) days in
which the air quality was considered unhealthy for sensitive groups. Mr. Childs added data to
the PM2.5 table to indicate the attainment of the three year average.
Mr. Dick Van Frank, Improving Kinds Environment (IKE), pointed out the peaks on the PM2.5
graphs. Mr. Childs stated he would check to see if there were any significant events that could
have caused the peaks and report back to the IAPCB.
(Permit Activities Report)
Mr. Matt Mosier updated the IAPCB on the Permit Activities Report for February 2009. There were
three (3) applications received, eight (8) sent to Public Notice and fourteen (14) permits issued. Five
(5) of the issued permits were issued by the Office of Environmental Services. The transition of
permits to IDEM has been completed.
The IAPCB asked if the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) has been
providing reports on the permits. Mr. Mosier stated the City is currently receiving the same
information as in the pass. Ms. McCabe asked if the City has been reviewing the draft permits and
providing feedback to IDEM if necessary. Mr. Mosier stated that he is currently reviewing them and
will continue to do so. The IAPCB would like the City to continue to review the permits and report
to the IAPCB if questions, comments or concerns are not being addressed by IDEM.
Mr. Rick Martin commented that it is crucial that the City follow these permits before they are
issued not only for rule applicability but most importantly that the permits have language in them
that meets not only the federal and state rules but incorporates the City’s regulations and that the
permit conditions be enforced if not by IDEM but by the City. It is important that the permits issued
to sources in Marion County include all requirements to ensure the City of Indianapolis meets all of
the air quality standards for whatever they want to attain in the future. It is crucial to that the City of
Indianapolis to follow those standards and follow whether or not the permits and the enforcement
that IDEM has taken over will ultimately attain and achieve those standards because the citizens of
Indianapolis need that. It is important that the City not only meets the current air quality standard
but also plans for the future of changes that may occur with the air quality standard.
Mr. Martin stated that he was employed by the City when it did meet attainment for all national Air
Quality Standards. The important thing to remember is that the standards are always changing and
always getting tighter to improve air quality and to protect public health. It is an error to believe
that since the standard is currently being met that all is well because there is always a change in the
standards and there will always be additional work that needs to be done to ensure attainment. For a
city the size of Indianapolis, to not have some type of method to follow that and protect its citizens,
is hard to believe.

______________________________________________________________________________
(Stationary Source Compliance Activities)
Mr. Matt Mosier updated the IAPCB on the Compliance Activities Report for February 2009. In
February, there were fourteen (14) inspections conducted and four (4) stack tests completed of
which no violations were discovered.
(Notice of Violation/Agreed Judgment Activities Report)
Ms. Cheryl Carlson updated the IAPCB on the Enforcement Activities Report for February 2009.
During the month of February, five (5) Notice of Violation (NOVs) without referral, two (2) NOV
with referral, one (1) warning letter, and two (2) tickets were issued. There were also three (3)
source conferences held. She stated that staff are still in the process of completing all of the
referrals from the Compliance Section.
Staff met with Metalworking Lubricants consultants regarding the NOV for visible emissions
notation issues. A meeting to discuss this violation as well as the odor issues has been scheduled for
May. If there is no resolution, an Administrative Hearing for both will be held May 21, 2009. The
IAPCB asked if IDEM has been involved. Ms. Carlson stated only through the LEPC.
Ms. Carlson summarized the NOV report for February 2009. Mr. Van Frank asked who will be
handling open burning and fugitive dust in the future. Ms. Carlson responded that the City would
be.
(Planning)
Ms. Monica Dick provided an update to the IAPCB and regarding the air monitoring around schools.
There is an USEPA website, www.epa.gov/school air, where information can be obtained. There
will be monitoring in Pittsboro, Warsaw, and East Chicago in Indiana. EPA Region V mentioned
the current monitoring being done in southwest indy and does not plan to place additional monitors
in this area. The website mentions things that can be done around the schools and reducing idling is
one of the items on the list. This works well with IKE’s and the City’s initiatives on the Smart
Schools Don’t Idle Program.
Ms. McCabe mentioned an announcement from EPA regarding grants coming to Indiana for diesel
retrofits. Ms. Dick responded that the City has done as much as they can with the retrofit grants.
However, the City does plan on seeking grants through the Clean Cities Grants for purchasing new
vehicles with the pollution prevention devices already installed.
Ms. Dick along with Mr. Josh Miles from Miles Design LLC gave a presentation on the new
Knozone website. The goals and objectives are to increase awareness of the Knozone mission and
action steps, encourage positive action steps, increase corporate partnership through the Central
Indiana Clean Air Partnership (CICAP) program, and create a web-centric campaign that provides
information regarding pubic health, environmental health, and positions Indianapolis as a sustainable
city to attract businesses and economic development.

community to consider key environmental influences on Indiana water quality and human health.
Mr. Bill Beranek asked if the IAPCB has written letters to the staff that have lost their jobs as a
result of non renewal of the state contract. Dr. Daly stated that it has not been done but is an
excellent idea. Letters will be drafted and signed my the IAPCB members.

RE:

RE:

ANNOUNCEMENTS

Dr. Daly solicited announcements. Mr. Richard Wise announced that the City is currently in the

Public Meeting that was held on February 5, 2009. There will be a Memorandum summarizing the
meeting sent to those who requested it and other interested parties.
Ms. Janet McCabe asked if the City has looked into whether there is legal basis to challenge the
Indiana Department of Environmental Management’s (IDEM’s) decision not to renew the contract
with Indianapolis. Ms. Stephanie Roth stated she would forward the question to Mr. Chris Cotterill,
Corporation Counsel for the City of Indianapolis, and have a response for the IAPCB at the next
meeting.

February 12, 2009 – APPROVED AS PRESENTED – April 9, 2009
INDIANAPOLIS AIR POLLUTION CONTROL BOARD
CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS

______________________________________________________________________________
Mr. Wise stated that a response to the letter the IAPCB sent to Mayor Ballard regarding the City’s
Air Pollution Control Program is forthcoming.
RE: APPROVAL OF MINUTES
Dr. Daly solicited modifications for the minutes for the January 8, 2009 meeting. There were no
modifications. Ms. McCabe made a motion that the Minutes be adopted as presented. Ms. Russell
seconded the motion and said motion carried.
RE: STAFF REPORTS – December 2008 - Monthly Activities Reports
(Air Monitoring Activities Report)
Mr. Aaron Childs provided an update to the Board on the Air Monitoring Activities Report for
December 2008. There were twenty-one (21) days in which the air quality standard was
moderate and ten (10) in which the air quality standard was good. There were zero (0) days in
which the air quality was considered unhealthy for sensitive groups. Mr. Childs also provided a
2009 Annual Report for Air Monitoring.
It was asked if the State has submitted a request to the United States Environmental Protection
Agency (USEPA) for redesignation of the PM2.5 standard. Mr. Childs stated he will check with
IDEM to see if the request has been made and report back to the IAPCB.
Mr. Richard Van Frank asked if it is known why there were lower air quality readings in 2008
and if plant closings and gas prices have anything to do with the lower readings. Mr. Childs
stated that no actual studies have been done but stated that these could be some of the reasons for
the lower readings in 2008.
(Permit Activities Report)
Mr. Anh-Tuan Nguyen updated the Board on the Permit Activities Report for December 2008. In
December, all new applications were sent to the state. There was one (1) that was sent to Public
Notice, and one (1) was proposed to the EPA. There were seven (7) permits issued. Approximately
half of the current permit applications have been sent to IDEM as a result of the transition.
Mr. Nguyen provided a 2008 annual report of permit activities. There were 108 applications
received; thirty-six (36) of which were combined and 121 permit decisions were made.
The Board inquired if this information will continue to be reported. Mr. Wise stated that the City are
still communications with IDEM on how this information will be reported.
Ms. Maggie McShane made a motion that IDEM continue to report information regarding permit,
compliance and enforcement activities to the IAPCB on a monthly basis. Mr. Bill Brown seconded
the motion and said motion carried.
Mr. Brown asked that after the transition occurs if a meeting can be held with Corporation Counsel

2

February 12, 2009 – APPROVED AS PRESENTED – April 9, 2009
INDIANAPOLIS AIR POLLUTION CONTROL BOARD
CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS

______________________________________________________________________________
to determine what exactly the IAPCB can request from IDEM. Ms. Roth stated she would provide
IAPCB’s request to Mr. Cotterill. The Board also asked if clarification of what the ordinance will
mean after the transition and if there are possibly any legal ramifications involving the IAPCB, City
or themselves personally because of the discrepancies between the City ordinance and the State
rules. Again, this question will be directed to Mr. Cotterill.
Dr. Daly requested a legal opinion on the IAPCB’s role in the changing of the current ordinance
since the IAPCB is the legislative body that usually begins the process to any changes to the
ordinance. Mr. Brown asked if the Corporation Counsel has looked at the ordinance to see what
changes will need to be made to the ordinance. Ms. Roth sated she would pass along the IAPCB’s
questions.
(Resolution for Matthew Senseny)
Dr. Daly read a resolution from the IAPCB for Mr. R. Matt Senseny for his time as an IAPCB
member and former Counsel for the Board.
(Stationary Source Compliance Activities)
Mr. Matt Mosier updated the Board on the Compliance Activities Report for December 2008. In
December, there were nine (9) inspections conducted and one (1) source was flagged as a result
of those inspections. There were four (4) stack tests completed of which no violations were
discovered.
Mr. Mosier provided a 2008 annual report of compliance activities. Staff conducted 111
unannounced source inspections in 2008. There were thirty-nine (39) sources flagged as a result of
those inspections; thirty-one (31) were flagged for failure to log/perform compliance monitoring;
five (5) were flagged for failure to take corrective action for exceeding a compliance monitoring
parameter; eight (8) were flagged for exceedance of regulatory requirement or limit; and one (1)
was flagged for failure to obtain proper permit approval. There were also thirty-nine (39) stack tests
observed with zero (0) violations.
(Notice of Violation/Agreed Judgment Activities Report)
Ms. Cheryl Carlson updated the Board on the Enforcement Activities Report for December 2008.
During the month of December, one (1) Notice of Violation (NOVs) without referral, three (3) NOV
with referral, and four (4) warning letters were issued. Ms. Carlson summarized the NOV report for
December 2008.
Staff met with Metalworking Lubricants in January to discuss resolution of the two (2) unresolved
NOV’s. The City’s proposed agreement for the odor NOV is no longer valid due to the transition of
the permit to the IDEM. The City will have to revise the proposed agreement to ensure the
continued operation of the odor control equipment. The NOV for the missing visible emission
notations will be resolved soon.
The Board asked if the City will continue to resolve enforcement actions past the transition period

ending February 28, 2009. Ms. Carlson stated it is her understanding that the City will continue to
pursue enforcement actions for violations discovered prior to February 28, 2009, even if the action is
not filed until after that date. The City will continue to communicate with IDEM of all enforcement
actions taken against permitted sources in Marion County.
The Board is concerned that “problem sources” will not have to comply with the local requirements
in their permit and thus render the City’s previous actions ineffective. Also, the IAPCB believes that
sources may be waiting out the transition period so that the current permit requirements will no
longer be valid. The City will still be able to pursue enforcement on a local level, but will be losing
its ability to incorporate a compliance action into a permit.
Ms. Carlson provided a 2008 annual report of enforcement activities. There were ninety-five (95)
warning letters, forty (40) NOV’s without referral and forty-seven (47) NOV’s with referral issued
in 2008. In 2008, a total of $125,840.00 in penalties was assessed in addition to a Supplemental
Environmental Projects (SEP) of $10,600.00. The City has collected all the penalties with the
exception of approximately $10,000.00.
Ms. Carlson responded to a question regarding the City’s SEP policy that was asked at the last
meeting. She distributed a copy of the policy and stated that the State had recently revised their
policy. The City was going to revise the policy to be consistent with State policy; however, due to
changes in the OES Administrator position and IDEM’s decision not to renew the local agency
contract those changes were never completed. However, had a source wanted to undertake a SEP in
lieu of a monetary penalty, the City would have adhered to the State’s policy.
Ms. McCabe stated due to discussions over the past months regarding possible implications of local
activities going over to IDEM, Improving Kids Environment (IKE) has been comparing the number
of enforcement actions that have been taken in Marion County verses other counties, such as Lake
and Allen Counties that are currently under IDEM’s management. Information is still being
gathered and compared. However, it has been preliminarily determined that the City of Indianapolis
has taken far more enforcement actions than these other counties. Ms. McCabe explained the
reasons for this are most likely due to the more frequent inspections and her impression that the
number of times the City of Indianapolis felt that there were clear violations of environmental
regulations is higher than IDEM.
Dr. Daly stated that IDEM has made it clear in that their intent is to no longer inspect sources
annually but to inspect some sources once every two years and to cut other activities by 25%.
Mr. Brown asked under penalties that are assessed to sources by IDEM in Marion County if the
money will come back to Marion County. Ms. Carlson stated no, that IDEM will collect penalties
from their actions which go to the State’s fund. He also asked if the City will have any input on
actions IDEM takes on sources in Marion County. In past experience it has been only been in
special circumstances that IDEM will consult the local municipalities.
Mr. Van Frank wanted to know if IDEM will take enforcement actions for fugitive dust violations.
Ms. Carlson stated that it is one of those areas that need to be determined what the City’s role will
be. Mr. Van Frank is concerned that the City may lose attainment status of the PM2.5 standard if

______________________________________________________________________________
current levels of enforcement are not maintained. He also voiced concern that the permit violations
will not be enforced in the same manner as they currently are under the local program and feels that
sources will not be held to the conditions in their air permits.
Mr. Achgill voiced a concern that the current ordinance and regulations may be inappropriate given
the change in management of the Marion County air program.
Ms. McCabe proposed that the Board provide recommendations to the City-County Council on what
the IAPCB believes should be maintained in Marion County and what role the City should continue
to provide to citizens in Marion County. The IAPCB concurred that an Ordinance Review
Committee meeting should be scheduled next month to begin discussions on what revisions will
need to be done to the current ordinance.
(Planning)
Ms. Monica Dick stated that Knozone Program is still going through changes. There will be a new
website with educational information on PM2.5 as well as ozone. The website will be more of a
virtual site to target audiences of all types but especially school age children. The website will be
having a soft launch in March 2009, with a hard launch following in April 2009. Staff has decided
not to do a telephone survey concerning the awareness of the program. In the past, telephone
surveys have demonstrated an approximate awareness rate of 80%. Once the new website has been
on line for a few years and with other new outreach ideas in place, the City will perform another
telephone survey to ensure the air quality awareness is the same or improved.
RE: UNFINISHED BUSINESS
Dr. Bill Beranek inquired what are the next steps and the plan for an air quality program in Central
Indiana. He stated that Marion County has always been just in or just out of attainment for different
air pollution criteria. Being on the border line for attainment has already impacted some economic
development in Marion County. He is concerned that economic development will suffer more
because if a City falls into nonattainment, businesses will not grow and new businesses will not
come to Indianapolis or even Central Indiana. Dr. Beranek feels the City of Indianapolis should lead
Central Indiana to its future of air quality for economic development. He also feels the smaller air
quality issues such as those that are coming from residents should be handled on a local level. Mr.
Van Frank agreed with Dr. Beranek and added that not only for economic development but for
public health as well.
RE: NEW BUSINESS
Dr. Daly solicited any new business. There was none.
RE: ADJOURNMENT
Dr. Daly moved to adjourn the meeting. Mr. Brown made a motion for adjournment. Ms. Russell
seconded the motion. The next Indianapolis Air Pollution Control Board meeting will be on March
12, 2009, at 9:30 A.M. in Room 107 of the City-County Building.

RE: STAFF REPORTS – January 2009 - Monthly Activities Reports
(Air Monitoring Activities Report)
Mr. Aaron Childs provided an update to the Board on the Air Monitoring Activities Report for
January 2009. There were seventeen (17) days in which the air quality standard was moderate
and fourteen (14) days in which the air quality standard was good. There were zero (0) days in
which the air quality was considered unhealthy for sensitive groups.
Mr. Childs stated beginning January 1, 2009 sampling began daily at the South West Street site.
This site typically has the highest readings and when readings are consistently high, sampling is
done daily instead of every three (3) days.
Mr. Child also included a list of all of the air monitoring sites that will be running in 2009.
There were no changes from 2008.
(Permit Activities Report)
Mr. Anh-Tuan Nguyen updated the Board on the Permit Activities Report for January 2009. In
January, all new applications were sent to the state. There were four (4) sent to Public Notice and
three (3) permits issued. The transition of permits to IDEM has been completed.
(Stationary Source Compliance Activities)
Mr. Matt Mosier updated the Board on the Compliance Activities Report for January 2009. In
January, there were nine (9) inspections conducted and four (4) stack tests completed of which
no violations were discovered.
(Notice of Violation/Agreed Judgment Activities Report)
Ms. Cheryl Carlson updated the Board on the Enforcement Activities Report for December 2008.

January 2009.
(Planning)
Ms. Monica Dick updated the Board on the attainment and nonattainment designations. She
presented a timeline for the re-designation as attainment for the annual PM 2.5 standard. It is
anticipated to have a designation of attainment by the end of 2009. There is a proposed designation
of nonattainment for the 24-hour PM 2.5 standard. Prior to the designation being finalized, EPA
plans on publishing a parallel rule making that will modify the boundaries for non-attainment which
will effectively designate Central Indiana as attainment. The State submitted the Governor’s
recommendation for non-attainment of the 2006 Ozone Standard. EPA’s final designations for the
2006 Ozone Standard will occur March 2010.

RE: UNFINISHED BUSINESS
Mr. Kyle Walker provided an update to the IAPCB on the future of the Air Quality Program for
Indianapolis. The current functions of the Office of Environmental Services will be divided into
several areas. The Department of Public Works Engineering will acquire all of the water and land
functions of OES. The Office of Sustainability will acquire the Air Program. This will consist of air
monitoring, technical resource for the IAPCB, and air planning. The City plans to maintain their
Knozone and CICAP programs. The OES Enforcement Section will move to the Office of Code
Enforcement. There will be a reduction in force which will affect twelve (12) OES staff members.
It is the City’s intention to put together a working group to address the new air quality program and

Dr. Daly stated that it is the IAPCB’s intention to maintain its current function as a regulatory
Board. Clarification is still needed on new processes.
RE: NEW BUSINESS
Ms. Janet McCabe met the new USEPA administrator. There was an article regarding air toxics
around schools that caused worry to many people. The new USEPA administrator stated EPA plans
to put together a very robust program for air quality testing around schools. Ms. Dick stated she
would check into this and report back to the IAPCB.

INDIANAPOLIS AIR POLLUTION CONTROL BOARD
CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS

______________________________________________________________________________
RE: STAFF REPORTS – July & August 2008, Monthly Activities Reports
(Air Monitoring Activities Report)
Mr. Aaron Childs provided an update to the Board on the Air Monitoring Activities Report for
July 2008 and August 2008. In July, there were ten (10) days in which the air quality was in the
good category, nineteen (19) in which the air quality was in the moderate category, and two (2)
days which the air quality was in the unhealthy for sensitive groups category. On July 17th and
18th, 2008 there were high ozone and fine particle readings.
There was discussion regarding the new 8-Hour Standard for ozone. It was at eighty five parts
per billion (85 ppb) and has been decreased to seventy-five parts per billion (75 ppb). The new
standard is now in effect. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) will
make the attainment/non-attainment designations in the year 2010.
The Board inquired which months historically have the highest readings for ozone and
particulate. Mr. Childs stated that June and July usually have the highest readings for ozone.
High readings for particulate usually occur in the months of June, July, January and February. It
is possible the Annual Standard for fine particles will be attainable; however, it is most likely
that the City will be in non-attainment for the 24-Hour Standard for fine particulates.
In August, there were sixteen (16) days in which the air quality was in the good category, and
fifteen (15) in which the air quality was in the moderate category.
(Permit Activities Report)
Mr. Anh-Tuan Nguyen updated the Board based on the Permit Activities Report for July and
August, 2008. In July and August, there were twenty-one (21) new applications received, ten (10)
went to Public Notice, five (5) were proposed to the EPA. There were twenty (20) decisions issued.
The Permit section is maintaining its work load by utilizing a contractor, and other OES staff
members outside of the air permit section. Mr. Nguyen stated that they are three (3) vacancies and is
in the process of filling one (1) position. Mr. Nguyen also stated that he is in the process of
renewing the contract for the companies that are currently assisting with the issuance of decisions.
(Stationary Source Compliance Activities)
Mr. Matt Mosier updated the Board on the Compliance Activities Report for July and August
2008. In July there were eleven (11) inspections conducted and four (4) sources were flagged as
a result of those inspections. Quemteco, Asphalt Materials, Major Tool & Machine, and MarZane were all flagged for record keeping issued. There was one stack test completed.
In August there were twelve (12) inspections conducted and six (6) sources were flagged as a
result of those inspections. Commercial Finishing and Irving Materials were all flagged for
record keeping issued. Parts Cleaning Technologies and Rieth-Riley were flagged for work

practices. Insituform Technology was flagged for installing equipment prior to approval. There
were three (3) stack tests completed.
(Notice of Violation/Agreed Judgment Activities Report)
Ms. Cheryl Carlson updated the Board on the Enforcement Activities Report for July and August
2008. During the month of July, there were three (3) Notice of Violations (NOVs) without referral,
five (5) NOVs with referral, and two (2) warning letters issued.
During the month of August, there were seven (7) Notice of Violations (NOVs) without referral,
four (4) NOVs with referral, and six (6) warning letters issued.
Ms. Carlson summarized the NOV report for July and August 2008.
The Board inquired how the penalty processes are applied within school districts. Ms. Carlson
stated the intention of the penalty is assist with educating the schools to avoid future violations and
maintain safe work practices in the schools.
Mr. Dick Van Frank inquired if Best Antique Polishing was completely out of business. Ms. Carlson
responded that Best Antique Polishing went out of business and has been purchased by a new party
and is no longer operated by the owner who is in violation.
Mr. Van Frank also inquired about two penalties that were assessed for Gradex Excavating and Hunt
Paving that were used for the City’s Knozone Program. Ms. Carlson stated that the State of Indiana
allows the City to resolve cases and apply penalties outside the standard measures for incidents such
as dust violations. The penalty was applied to the Knozone Program to bring awareness to air
pollution instead the penalty going into the City’s general fund. This measure is not a Supplemental
Environmental Project (SEP).
Mr. Van Frank inquired about the Metropolitan School District (MSD) of Washington Township
SEP. Where did the money go and who benefits from it? Ms. Carlson said that the SEP for MSD
Washington Township is money that the school system must incur and then provide documentation
on how the money was spent. They must comply with the tasks outlined in their compliance
agreement. If the agreement is not met, a monetary penalty will be due to the City, by the school
district. Ms. Carlson stated that the State has recently modified their SEP Plan. Violators are now
eligible for one-for-one projects. Ms. Carlson will obtain a copy of the updated SEP Plan for the
Board.
(Planning)
Ms. Monica Dick stated that once the 2006 PM 2.5 standard and AQI Standard match up, it is
expected that there will be an increased number of Knozone Action Days called during the summer
and winter months.
The City of Indianapolis has recently re-launched the Central Indiana Clean Air Partnership
(CICAP) website. CICAP is a Knozone related program for businesses, to help educate employees

about air pollutants and what they can do to help. The CICAP Program just celebrated its 1st Year
Anniversary in August.
The Knozone Program is participating in the “Read to Achieve” with the NBA and Pacers. By the
end of the season, there will be approximately thirty (30) schools participating in this program. The
Knozone program is trying to find materials that are related to air pollution, to educate these schools.
There was discussion regarding the “Smart Schools Don’t Idle” Program. The EPA grant that
Improving Kids Environment obtained and works in partnership with Knozone will end at the end of
December. There are currently four (4) more schools in the process of enlisting in this program.
Ms. McCabe stated that the Greater Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce has a Green Business
Recognition Program. In order to be considered to be a “green business” they must sign up for the
CICAP program.
Ms. McCabe stated that the City convened a Central Indiana Air Quality Advisory Group
(CIAQAG) a few years ago. She inquired if this group still exists, or if it needed to be brought back
together? Mr. Achgill stated that he was involved with this group and that once the group
accomplished what it was set out to do that they decided to meet biannually. There was discussion
about the duties and interests of the CIAQAG. One of the primary topics discussed within this
group was fine particulates. Dr. Daly tasked Ms. McCabe to look into the possibility of assembling
a group of people who have a vested interest in the Central Indiana air quality.
RE: UNFINISHED BUSINESS
Dr. Daly solicited any unfinished business. There was none.
RE: NEW BUSINESS
(Resolution)
A resolution for Mr. Timothy Method for his services with the Indianapolis Air Pollution
Control Board was read by Dr. Daly.
(Other)
Mr. Bruce Wallace asked that staff provide the updated Chapter 511 which includes the new
language for the composition of the IAPCB. Ms. Dick stated the City’s website is in the process
of being updated and converted. Once the new site is approved the updated regulations will be
available via the website.

CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS

______________________________________________________________________________
Mr. Brian Sandstrom updated the Board on the Compliance Activities Report for June 2008. In
June, there were eleven (11) inspections conducted and five (5) sources were flagged as a result
of those inspections. Cryovac, Inc., Hanson Aggregates Midwest, and IDS Blast Finishing were
flagged for record keeping, while Rolls Royce and Visteon Automotive Systems were flagged
for work practice issues. There were a number of stack tests completed from, March 2008
through June 2008, and there were no violations flagged as a result.
(Notice of Violation/Agreed Judgment Activities Report)
Ms. Cheryl Carlson updated the Board on the Enforcement Activities Report for June 2008. During
the month of June, there were three (3) Notice of Violations (NOVs) without referral, three (3)
NOVs with referral, and four (4) warning letters were issued. Ms. Carlson summarized the NOV
report for March 2008 through June 2008. Resolved cases consist of: Citizens Thermal Energy,
Alloy Architectural Products, Card-Chem Industries, Eagle Valley, John E. Hall, Indiana Heart
Hospital, Indianapolis Power & Light, Marathon Oil Company, National Railroad Passenger
Corporation, Shelby Materials, Suburban Steel Supply Company, T & M Associates, Tiffany Lawn
& Garden Supply, TIN, Inc., and W. R. Beach. These cases have been resolved by the hearing
officer, Ms. Darla Williams.
There was discussion held about Tiffany Lawn. They have changed their work practices and are
now keeping smaller inventory piles, rotating the mulch more often and keeping smaller heights of
piles.
Mr. Richard Van Frank questioned Ms. Carlson on some outstanding and pending Administrative
Hearings. Mr. Van Frank stated the following: “Best Antique Polishing Company, the hearing was
scheduled in November of 2007, then it drags on and is rescheduled for February 21, 2008, and now
it’s rescheduled for September of 2008…Brothers Mold Remediation, originally scheduled May 17,
2007 awaiting hearing officer’s judgment. It’s been fifteen (15) months. Residential Properties
Construction, it’s been more than a year since the hearing was held and awaiting hearing officer’s
decision. What’s the hold up?”
Ms. Carlson answered Mr. Van Frank by stating that Best Antique Polishing has now been resolved,
although they were scheduled for a hearing in the following week. Best Antique Polishing is no
longer in business, and has not been in business for almost a year. From February until now, we did
not have a Hearing Officer from January through June of 2008. There was a hearing held with the
previous Hearing Officer, on Brother’s Mold Remediation and Residential Properties Construction.
However, no judgment was received from the Hearing Office. The new Hearing Officer is currently
resolving this issue. Both of these companies are now out of business as well.
Mr. Van Frank Stated “Justice delayed is justice denied. It would be nice if as much attention is
paid to enforcement actions as are paid to getting permits issued…When I see some of these
penalties…I can’t help but wonder how much money they are saving by not complying to
regulations, because they know the fine is going to be so small that it’s cheaper to pay a fine than it
is to comply with regulations.”

There were several events promoting the Knozone Program in June and July. Staff are teaming up
with the Indiana Fever to promote the Knozone Program and are working with Improving Kids
Environment on “Smart Schools Don’t Idle”.
Ms. Janet McCabe added that on top of the “Smart Schools Don’t Idle” program, Douglas
MacArthur Elementary School has become a pilot school for another program called “Fly a Flag for

what the city itself can do to be more energy efficient.
Mr. Method also announced that he will be leaving the Office of Environmental Services to work
at the Indianapolis Airport Authority.
Ms. McCabe inquired about the status of the contract with the State of Indiana. Mr. Method
noted that at this time, the state is still working on the contract draft.
Mr. Van Frank requested to call the Board’s attention to three recently published articles in the
“Journal of Environmental Health”. The first article was about the correlation of cardiac arrest
and fine particulate matter in patients in Indianapolis, Indiana. The second article was about
ambient ozone concentrations causing increased hospitalization for asthma in children. The third
article was about the effects of pollutants caused by fossil fuels on children.

______________________________________________________________________________
RE: STAFF REPORTS – July & August 2008, Monthly Activities Reports
(Air Monitoring Activities Report)
Mr. Aaron Childs provided an update to the Board on the Air Monitoring Activities Report for
July 2008 and August 2008. In July, there were ten (10) days in which the air quality was in the
good category, nineteen (19) in which the air quality was in the moderate category, and two (2)
days which the air quality was in the unhealthy for sensitive groups category. On July 17th and
18th, 2008 there were high ozone and fine particle readings.
There was discussion regarding the new 8-Hour Standard for ozone. It was at eighty five parts
per billion (85 ppb) and has been decreased to seventy-five parts per billion (75 ppb). The new
standard is now in effect. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) will
make the attainment/non-attainment designations in the year 2010.
The Board inquired which months historically have the highest readings for ozone and
particulate. Mr. Childs stated that June and July usually have the highest readings for ozone.
High readings for particulate usually occur in the months of June, July, January and February. It
is possible the Annual Standard for fine particles will be attainable; however, it is most likely
that the City will be in non-attainment for the 24-Hour Standard for fine particulates.
In August, there were sixteen (16) days in which the air quality was in the good category, and
fifteen (15) in which the air quality was in the moderate category.
(Permit Activities Report)
Mr. Anh-Tuan Nguyen updated the Board based on the Permit Activities Report for July and
August, 2008. In July and August, there were twenty-one (21) new applications received, ten (10)
went to Public Notice, five (5) were proposed to the EPA. There were twenty (20) decisions issued.
The Permit section is maintaining its work load by utilizing a contractor, and other OES staff
members outside of the air permit section. Mr. Nguyen stated that they are three (3) vacancies and is
in the process of filling one (1) position. Mr. Nguyen also stated that he is in the process of
renewing the contract for the companies that are currently assisting with the issuance of decisions.
(Stationary Source Compliance Activities)
Mr. Matt Mosier updated the Board on the Compliance Activities Report for July and August
2008. In July there were eleven (11) inspections conducted and four (4) sources were flagged as
a result of those inspections. Quemteco, Asphalt Materials, Major Tool & Machine, and MarZane were all flagged for record keeping issued. There was one stack test completed.
In August there were twelve (12) inspections conducted and six (6) sources were flagged as a
result of those inspections. Commercial Finishing and Irving Materials were all flagged for
record keeping issued. Parts Cleaning Technologies and Rieth-Riley were flagged for work

practices. Insituform Technology was flagged for installing equipment prior to approval. There
were three (3) stack tests completed.
(Notice of Violation/Agreed Judgment Activities Report)
Ms. Cheryl Carlson updated the Board on the Enforcement Activities Report for July and August
2008. During the month of July, there were three (3) Notice of Violations (NOVs) without referral,
five (5) NOVs with referral, and two (2) warning letters issued.
During the month of August, there were seven (7) Notice of Violations (NOVs) without referral,
four (4) NOVs with referral, and six (6) warning letters issued.
Ms. Carlson summarized the NOV report for July and August 2008.
The Board inquired how the penalty processes are applied within school districts. Ms. Carlson
stated the intention of the penalty is assist with educating the schools to avoid future violations and
maintain safe work practices in the schools.
Mr. Dick Van Frank inquired if Best Antique Polishing was completely out of business. Ms. Carlson
responded that Best Antique Polishing went out of business and has been purchased by a new party
and is no longer operated by the owner who is in violation.
Mr. Van Frank also inquired about two penalties that were assessed for Gradex Excavating and Hunt
Paving that were used for the City’s Knozone Program. Ms. Carlson stated that the State of Indiana
allows the City to resolve cases and apply penalties outside the standard measures for incidents such
as dust violations. The penalty was applied to the Knozone Program to bring awareness to air
pollution instead the penalty going into the City’s general fund. This measure is not a Supplemental
Environmental Project (SEP).
Mr. Van Frank inquired about the Metropolitan School District (MSD) of Washington Township
SEP. Where did the money go and who benefits from it? Ms. Carlson said that the SEP for MSD
Washington Township is money that the school system must incur and then provide documentation
on how the money was spent. They must comply with the tasks outlined in their compliance
agreement. If the agreement is not met, a monetary penalty will be due to the City, by the school
district. Ms. Carlson stated that the State has recently modified their SEP Plan. Violators are now
eligible for one-for-one projects. Ms. Carlson will obtain a copy of the updated SEP Plan for the
Board.
(Planning)
Ms. Monica Dick stated that once the 2006 PM 2.5 standard and AQI Standard match up, it is
expected that there will be an increased number of Knozone Action Days called during the summer
and winter months.
The City of Indianapolis has recently re-launched the Central Indiana Clean Air Partnership
(CICAP) website. CICAP is a Knozone related program for businesses, to help educate employees

about air pollutants and what they can do to help. The CICAP Program just celebrated its 1st Year
Anniversary in August.
The Knozone Program is participating in the “Read to Achieve” with the NBA and Pacers. By the
end of the season, there will be approximately thirty (30) schools participating in this program. The
Knozone program is trying to find materials that are related to air pollution, to educate these schools.
There was discussion regarding the “Smart Schools Don’t Idle” Program. The EPA grant that
Improving Kids Environment obtained and works in partnership with Knozone will end at the end of
December. There are currently four (4) more schools in the process of enlisting in this program.
Ms. McCabe stated that the Greater Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce has a Green Business
Recognition Program. In order to be considered to be a “green business” they must sign up for the
CICAP program.
Ms. McCabe stated that the City convened a Central Indiana Air Quality Advisory Group
(CIAQAG) a few years ago. She inquired if this group still exists, or if it needed to be brought back
together? Mr. Achgill stated that he was involved with this group and that once the group
accomplished what it was set out to do that they decided to meet biannually. There was discussion
about the duties and interests of the CIAQAG. One of the primary topics discussed within this
group was fine particulates. Dr. Daly tasked Ms. McCabe to look into the possibility of assembling
a group of people who have a vested interest in the Central Indiana air quality.
RE: UNFINISHED BUSINESS
Dr. Daly solicited any unfinished business. There was none.
RE: NEW BUSINESS
(Resolution)
A resolution for Mr. Timothy Method for his services with the Indianapolis Air Pollution
Control Board was read by Dr. Daly.
(Other)
Mr. Bruce Wallace asked that staff provide the updated Chapter 511 which includes the new
language for the composition of the IAPCB. Ms. Dick stated the City’s website is in the process
of being updated and converted. Once the new site is approved the updated regulations will be
available via the website.

RE: STAFF REPORTS – June 2008, Monthly Activities Reports

(Permit Activities Report)
Mr. Anh-Tuan Nguyen updated the Board based on the Permit Activities Report for June, 2008. In

______________________________________________________________________________
Mr. Brian Sandstrom updated the Board on the Compliance Activities Report for June 2008. In
June, there were eleven (11) inspections conducted and five (5) sources were flagged as a result
of those inspections. Cryovac, Inc., Hanson Aggregates Midwest, and IDS Blast Finishing were
flagged for record keeping, while Rolls Royce and Visteon Automotive Systems were flagged
for work practice issues. There were a number of stack tests completed from, March 2008
through June 2008, and there were no violations flagged as a result.
(Notice of Violation/Agreed Judgment Activities Report)
Ms. Cheryl Carlson updated the Board on the Enforcement Activities Report for June 2008. During
the month of June, there were three (3) Notice of Violations (NOVs) without referral, three (3)
NOVs with referral, and four (4) warning letters were issued. Ms. Carlson summarized the NOV
report for March 2008 through June 2008. Resolved cases consist of: Citizens Thermal Energy,
Alloy Architectural Products, Card-Chem Industries, Eagle Valley, John E. Hall, Indiana Heart
Hospital, Indianapolis Power & Light, Marathon Oil Company, National Railroad Passenger
Corporation, Shelby Materials, Suburban Steel Supply Company, T & M Associates, Tiffany Lawn
& Garden Supply, TIN, Inc., and W. R. Beach. These cases have been resolved by the hearing
officer, Ms. Darla Williams.
There was discussion held about Tiffany Lawn. They have changed their work practices and are
now keeping smaller inventory piles, rotating the mulch more often and keeping smaller heights of
piles.
Mr. Richard Van Frank questioned Ms. Carlson on some outstanding and pending Administrative
Hearings. Mr. Van Frank stated the following: “Best Antique Polishing Company, the hearing was
scheduled in November of 2007, then it drags on and is rescheduled for February 21, 2008, and now
it’s rescheduled for September of 2008…Brothers Mold Remediation, originally scheduled May 17,
2007 awaiting hearing officer’s judgment. It’s been fifteen (15) months. Residential Properties
Construction, it’s been more than a year since the hearing was held and awaiting hearing officer’s
decision. What’s the hold up?”
Ms. Carlson answered Mr. Van Frank by stating that Best Antique Polishing has now been resolved,
although they were scheduled for a hearing in the following week. Best Antique Polishing is no
longer in business, and has not been in business for almost a year. From February until now, we did
not have a Hearing Officer from January through June of 2008. There was a hearing held with the
previous Hearing Officer, on Brother’s Mold Remediation and Residential Properties Construction.
However, no judgment was received from the Hearing Office. The new Hearing Officer is currently
resolving this issue. Both of these companies are now out of business as well.
Mr. Van Frank Stated “Justice delayed is justice denied. It would be nice if as much attention is
paid to enforcement actions as are paid to getting permits issued…When I see some of these
penalties…I can’t help but wonder how much money they are saving by not complying to
regulations, because they know the fine is going to be so small that it’s cheaper to pay a fine than it
is to comply with regulations.”

(Planning)
Ms. Monica Dick stated at the end of May, 2008, the State of Indiana sent designation
recommendations to the U.S.E.P.A. for non-attainment of the particulate matter 2.5 twenty-four (24)
hour standard. It is expected that the State designations will be made by the end of August.
There were several events promoting the Knozone Program in June and July. Staff are teaming up

Mr. Method announced that the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM)
visited OES for an annual review of the Air Quality Programs such as finance, compliance,
asbestos, compliance and enforcement.
Mr. Method also stated that the City of Indianapolis has appointed a “Green Commission” to
assist the city’s overall sustainability efforts. The Department of Public Works is establishing an
“Office of Sustainability” to coordinate across all city departments and to assist in focusing on
what the city itself can do to be more energy efficient.
Mr. Method also announced that he will be leaving the Office of Environmental Services to work
at the Indianapolis Airport Authority.
Ms. McCabe inquired about the status of the contract with the State of Indiana. Mr. Method
noted that at this time, the state is still working on the contract draft.
Mr. Van Frank requested to call the Board’s attention to three recently published articles in the
“Journal of Environmental Health”. The first article was about the correlation of cardiac arrest
and fine particulate matter in patients in Indianapolis, Indiana. The second article was about
ambient ozone concentrations causing increased hospitalization for asthma in children. The third
article was about the effects of pollutants caused by fossil fuels on children.
RE: ADJOURNMENT
Dr. Daly moved to adjourn the meeting. Mr. Senseny made a motion for adjournment. Mr. Achgill

PRELIMINARY MINUTES – February 12, 2009
INDIANAPOLIS AIR POLLUTION CONTROL BOARD
CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS

______________________________________________________________________________
Mr. Wise stated that a response to the letter the IAPCB sent to Mayor Ballard regarding the City’s
Air Pollution Control Program is forthcoming.
RE: APPROVAL OF MINUTES
Dr. Daly solicited modifications for the minutes for the January 8, 2009 meeting. There were no
modifications. Ms. McCabe made a motion that the Minutes be adopted as presented. Ms. Russell
seconded the motion and said motion carried.
RE: STAFF REPORTS – December 2008 - Monthly Activities Reports
(Air Monitoring Activities Report)
Mr. Aaron Childs provided an update to the Board on the Air Monitoring Activities Report for
December 2008. There were twenty-one (21) days in which the air quality standard was
moderate and ten (10) in which the air quality standard was good. There were zero (0) days in
which the air quality was considered unhealthy for sensitive groups. Mr. Childs also provided a
2009 Annual Report for Air Monitoring.
It was asked if the State has submitted a request to the United States Environmental Protection
Agency (USEPA) for redesignation of the PM2.5 standard. Mr. Childs stated he will check with
IDEM to see if the request has been made and report back to the IAPCB.
Mr. Richard Van Frank asked if it is known why there were lower air quality readings in 2008
and if plant closings and gas prices have anything to do with the lower readings. Mr. Childs
stated that no actual studies have been done but stated that these could be some of the reasons for
the lower readings in 2008.
(Permit Activities Report)
Mr. Anh-Tuan Nguyen updated the Board on the Permit Activities Report for December 2008. In
December, all new applications were sent to the state. There was one (1) that was sent to Public
Notice, and one (1) was proposed to the EPA. There were seven (7) permits issued. Approximately
half of the current permit applications have been sent to IDEM as a result of the transition.
Mr. Nguyen provided a 2008 annual report of permit activities. There were 108 applications
received; thirty-six (36) of which were combined and 121 permit decisions were made.
The Board inquired if this information will continue to be reported. Mr. Wise stated that the City are
still communications with IDEM on how this information will be reported.
Ms. Maggie McShane made a motion that IDEM continue to report information regarding permit,
compliance and enforcement activities to the IAPCB on a monthly basis. Mr. Bill Brown seconded
the motion and said motion carried.
Mr. Brown asked that after the transition occurs if a meeting can be held with Corporation Counsel

2

PRELIMINARY MINUTES – February 12, 2009
INDIANAPOLIS AIR POLLUTION CONTROL BOARD
CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS

______________________________________________________________________________
to determine what exactly the IAPCB can request from IDEM. Ms. Roth stated she would provide
IAPCB’s request to Mr. Cotterill. The Board also asked if clarification of what the ordinance will
mean after the transition and if there are possibly any legal ramifications involving the IAPCB, City
or themselves personally because of the discrepancies between the City ordinance and the State
rules. Again, this question will be directed to Mr. Cotterill.
Dr. Daly requested a legal opinion on the IAPCB’s role in the changing of the current ordinance
since the IAPCB is the legislative body that usually begins the process to any changes to the
ordinance. Mr. Brown asked if the Corporation Counsel has looked at the ordinance to see what
changes will need to be made to the ordinance. Ms. Roth sated she would pass along the IAPCB’s
questions.
(Resolution for Matthew Senseny)
Dr. Daly read a resolution from the IAPCB for Mr. R. Matt Senseny for his time as an IAPCB
member and former Counsel for the Board.
(Stationary Source Compliance Activities)
Mr. Matt Mosier updated the Board on the Compliance Activities Report for December 2008. In
December, there were nine (9) inspections conducted and one (1) source was flagged as a result
of those inspections. There were four (4) stack tests completed of which no violations were
discovered.
Mr. Mosier provided a 2008 annual report of compliance activities. Staff conducted 111
unannounced source inspections in 2008. There were thirty-nine (39) sources flagged as a result of
those inspections; thirty-one (31) were flagged for failure to log/perform compliance monitoring;
five (5) were flagged for failure to take corrective action for exceeding a compliance monitoring
parameter; eight (8) were flagged for exceedance of regulatory requirement or limit; and one (1)
was flagged for failure to obtain proper permit approval. There were also thirty-nine (39) stack tests
observed with zero (0) violations.
(Notice of Violation/Agreed Judgment Activities Report)
Ms. Cheryl Carlson updated the Board on the Enforcement Activities Report for December 2008.
During the month of December, one (1) Notice of Violation (NOVs) without referral, three (3) NOV
with referral, and four (4) warning letters were issued. Ms. Carlson summarized the NOV report for
December 2008.
Staff met with Metalworking Lubricants in January to discuss resolution of the two (2) unresolved
NOV’s. The City’s proposed agreement for the odor NOV is no longer valid due to the transition of
the permit to the IDEM. The City will have to revise the proposed agreement to ensure the
continued operation of the odor control equipment. The NOV for the missing visible emission
notations will be resolved soon.
The Board asked if the City will continue to resolve enforcement actions past the transition period

3

PRELIMINARY MINUTES – February 12, 2009
INDIANAPOLIS AIR POLLUTION CONTROL BOARD
CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS

______________________________________________________________________________
ending February 28, 2009. Ms. Carlson stated it is her understanding that the City will continue to
pursue enforcement actions for violations discovered prior to February 28, 2009, even if the action is
not filed until after that date. The City will continue to communicate with IDEM of all enforcement
actions taken against permitted sources in Marion County.
The Board is concerned that “problem sources” will not have to comply with the local requirements
in their permit and thus render the City’s previous actions ineffective. Also, the IAPCB believes that
sources may be waiting out the transition period so that the current permit requirements will no
longer be valid. The City will still be able to pursue enforcement on a local level, but will be losing
its ability to incorporate a compliance action into a permit.
Ms. Carlson provided a 2008 annual report of enforcement activities. There were ninety-five (95)
warning letters, forty (40) NOV’s without referral and forty-seven (47) NOV’s with referral issued
in 2008. In 2008, a total of $125,840.00 in penalties was assessed in addition to a Supplemental
Environmental Projects (SEP) of $10,600.00. The City has collected all the penalties with the
exception of approximately $10,000.00.
Ms. Carlson responded to a question regarding the City’s SEP policy that was asked at the last
meeting. She distributed a copy of the policy and stated that the State had recently revised their
policy. The City was going to revise the policy to be consistent with State policy; however, due to
changes in the OES Administrator position and IDEM’s decision not to renew the local agency
contract those changes were never completed. However, had a source wanted to undertake a SEP in
lieu of a monetary penalty, the City would have adhered to the State’s policy.
Ms. McCabe stated due to discussions over the past months regarding possible implications of local
activities going over to IDEM, Improving Kids Environment (IKE) has been comparing the number
of enforcement actions that have been taken in Marion County verses other counties, such as Lake
and Allen Counties that are currently under IDEM’s management. Information is still being
gathered and compared. However, it has been preliminarily determined that the City of Indianapolis
has taken far more enforcement actions than these other counties. Ms. McCabe explained the
reasons for this are most likely due to the more frequent inspections and her impression that the
number of times the City of Indianapolis felt that there were clear violations of environmental
regulations is higher than IDEM.
Dr. Daly stated that IDEM has made it clear in that their intent is to no longer inspect sources
annually but to inspect some sources once every two years and to cut other activities by 25%.
Mr. Brown asked under penalties that are assessed to sources by IDEM in Marion County if the
money will come back to Marion County. Ms. Carlson stated no, that IDEM will collect penalties
from their actions which go to the State’s fund. He also asked if the City will have any input on
actions IDEM takes on sources in Marion County. In past experience it has been only been in
special circumstances that IDEM will consult the local municipalities.
Mr. Van Frank wanted to know if IDEM will take enforcement actions for fugitive dust violations.
Ms. Carlson stated that it is one of those areas that need to be determined what the City’s role will
be. Mr. Van Frank is concerned that the City may lose attainment status of the PM2.5 standard if

4

PRELIMINARY MINUTES – February 12, 2009
INDIANAPOLIS AIR POLLUTION CONTROL BOARD
CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS

______________________________________________________________________________
current levels of enforcement are not maintained. He also voiced concern that the permit violations
will not be enforced in the same manner as they currently are under the local program and feels that
sources will not be held to the conditions in their air permits.
Mr. Achgill voiced a concern that the current ordinance and regulations may be inappropriate given
the change in management of the Marion County air program.
Ms. McCabe proposed that the Board provide recommendations to the City-County Council on what
the IAPCB believes should be maintained in Marion County and what role the City should continue
to provide to citizens in Marion County. The IAPCB concurred that an Ordinance Review
Committee meeting should be scheduled next month to begin discussions on what revisions will
need to be done to the current ordinance.
(Planning)
Ms. Monica Dick stated that Knozone Program is still going through changes. There will be a new
website with educational information on PM2.5 as well as ozone. The website will be more of a
virtual site to target audiences of all types but especially school age children. The website will be
having a soft launch in March 2009, with a hard launch following in April 2009. Staff has decided
not to do a telephone survey concerning the awareness of the program. In the past, telephone
surveys have demonstrated an approximate awareness rate of 80%. Once the new website has been
on line for a few years and with other new outreach ideas in place, the City will perform another
telephone survey to ensure the air quality awareness is the same or improved.
RE: UNFINISHED BUSINESS
Dr. Bill Beranek inquired what are the next steps and the plan for an air quality program in Central
Indiana. He stated that Marion County has always been just in or just out of attainment for different
air pollution criteria. Being on the border line for attainment has already impacted some economic
development in Marion County. He is concerned that economic development will suffer more
because if a City falls into nonattainment, businesses will not grow and new businesses will not
come to Indianapolis or even Central Indiana. Dr. Beranek feels the City of Indianapolis should lead
Central Indiana to its future of air quality for economic development. He also feels the smaller air
quality issues such as those that are coming from residents should be handled on a local level. Mr.
Van Frank agreed with Dr. Beranek and added that not only for economic development but for
public health as well.
RE: NEW BUSINESS
Dr. Daly solicited any new business. There was none.
RE: ADJOURNMENT
Dr. Daly moved to adjourn the meeting. Mr. Brown made a motion for adjournment. Ms. Russell
seconded the motion. The next Indianapolis Air Pollution Control Board meeting will be on March
12, 2009, at 9:30 A.M. in Room 107 of the City-County Building.

RE: UNFINISHED BUSINESS
(IDEM/OES Local Agency Agreement)
Dr. Daly explained that IDEM and OES have mutually agreed to extend the current contract through
February 28, 2009 and summarized the timeline laid out in the Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU). After February 28, 2009, many permitting, compliance, enforcement and air monitoring
activities will be transferred to IDEM.
Mr. Dan Murray stated that at this time, February 28, 2009, should be the final completion date for
the IDEM/OES Local Agency Agreement. He also stated the IDEM believes it is the right of all
local agencies to have an air program that goes beyond that of what the State requires.
Mr. Tom Rarick inquired about where the City and State are in the transition. Each Section Manager
provided and update.
Mr. Mosier stated the Compliance Section is still doing all compliance functions laid out in the
contract and at the end of the transition, IDEM will assume all compliance activities.

previously assigned to OES have been re-assigned to IDEM, and OES is working on the remaining
permits.

through to completion, by the City, even after February 28th.
Mr. Childs stated all air monitoring functions are still being performed by OES and will be until
February 28th. Transitioning air monitoring is more complicated due to equipment and software
issues. OES and IDEM will be meeting to discuss these details. It still has not been determined
Indianapolis will maintain some type of air monitoring program independent from the state.
Ms. Dick stated the City will maintain the Knozone and CICAP programs, even after February 28th.
There was lengthy discussion with Mr. Murray, the IAPCB, OES staff and interested parties
regarding IDEM’s decision including many questions concerning Marion County’s air quality
future. This meeting and other IAPCB meeting can be viewed in their entirety by visiting

______________________________________________________________________________
RE:

ANNOUNCEMENTS

Dr. Daly solicited announcements. Mr. Timothy Method announced that the EPA released a new
Ozone Air Quality Standard, established on March 12, 2008 and is to take effect soon. Mr. Method
provided a Fact Sheet and other handouts with information on these revisions. The last revision to
the Ozone Air Quality Standard was made in 1997, which Indianapolis met in 2007. The new 8hour ozone standard is being lowered to 0.075 parts per million. With the new standard in place, the
Indianapolis area and over 300 counties nationwide will no longer be in attainment.
Mr. Aaron Childs went over a graph and fact sheet. Mr. Child stated that since the standard is lower
now, it is more likely that we will have more days in the "unhealthy" category, as far as the air
quality index is concerned.
RE: APPROVAL OF MINUTES
Dr. Daly solicited modifications for the minutes for the February 14, 2008 meeting. There were no
modifications. Dr. Daly left the approval of the minutes open until the next Board meeting where a
quorum is present.
RE: STAFF REPORTS – January 2008, Monthly Activities Reports
(Air Monitoring Activities Report)
Mr. Childs provided an update to the Board on the Air Monitoring Activities Report for January
2008. There were nineteen (19) days in which the air quality was in the good category and
twelve (12) days when it was in the moderate category. The highest fine particle reading for
January was 26.9 micrograms per cubic meter. The air monitoring group maintains one monitor,
on Harding Street, throughout the year to continually monitor ozone; all other monitors turn on
April 1st. Mr. Childs included a list of the monitoring locations for 2008 in his report.
(Permit Activities Report)
Ms. Amanda Hennessy updated the Board based on the Permit Activities Report for January, 2008.
In January, there were twelve (12) new applications received, twenty-three (23) decisions were
issued, and seven (7) were cancelled, combined or withdrawn. Four (4) permits went to public
notice, of which two (2) were FESOP renewals, one (1) was a MSOP, and one (1) was a Title V
review.
(Stationary Source Compliance Activities)
Mr. Matt Mosier updated the Board on the Compliance Activities Report for January 2008. In
January, there were seven (7) inspections conducted and one (1) source was flagged as a result of
those inspections. Willoughby Industries was issued a violation letter for failing to label a
degreaser with the proper operating instructions. There were two (2) stack tests conducted, none
of which were flagged.

______________________________________________________________________________

(Notice of Violation/Agreed Judgment Activities Report)
Ms. Cheryl Carlson updated the Board on the Enforcement Activities Report for January 2008.
During the month of January, there were zero (0) Notice of Violations (NOVs) without referral,
three (3) NOVs with referral, and seven (7) warning letters were issued. Ms. Carlson summarized
the NOV report. Bluff Road Clean Fill Site, Eagle Valley, Indianapolis Newspapers, Mar-Zane,
OmniSource Corporation, and W.R. Beach are all new additions to the NOV report. Cases that were
resolved in January are Cryovac Rigid Packaging and E & B Paving. At this time, there is no
Administrative Hearing Officer, so Administrative Hearings are currently at a stand-still.
(Planning)
Ms. Monica Dick passed out a packet of Air Program Goals for 2008. The packet covered
contractual goals that the city has with IDEM. Ms. Dick briefly went over the main components of
the contract.
Mr. Childs went over the Air Monitoring portion of the Air Quality Program. The Air Monitoring
division is to maintain an air monitoring network, forecast ozone and PM 2.5, and provide daily
forecasts on a call-in phone line and website.
Ms. Carlson went over the Enforcement portion of the Air Quality Program. The Enforcement
division is to bring violators into compliance, conduct asbestos inspections, and conduct Section 105
activities, including: complaint response, major source particulate surveillance, auto and gasoline
tanker inspections, and process requests for variances and air curtain destructors.
Ms. Hennessy went over the Permits portion of the Air Quality Program. The Permits division is to
draft, review and issue non-NSR construction permits and operation permits.
Ms. Dick went over the Planning portion of the Air Quality Program. The Planning division is to
submit contract evaluation reports, financial reports and invoices.
Mr. Mosier went over the Compliance portion of the Air Quality Program. The Compliance division
is to inspect sources and observe stationary emission source stack test.
Ms. Amanda Shipman highlighted major grant initiatives for 2008. Major grant highlights include
Hybrids, Municipal Fleet Diesel Retrofit Initiative, the Knozone Program and the gas can exchange.

Mr. Salman inquired about how the Air Program Goals would impact the city's budget. Mr. Method
stated that all of these programs are basically points of emphasis and will take place using existing
staff and for programs that require more funds, a grant is typically obtained. Mr. Method stated that
overall the city budget is being lowered.

______________________________________________________________________________
RE: UNFINISHED BUSINESS
Dr. Daly solicited any unfinished business. Mr. Richard Van Frank stated that there is no quorum
and two vacancies on the Board, one of which has been vacant for a year. Previously, Mr. Van
Frank had been informed that after the election, the vacant position would be filled. Mr. Van Frank
noted that it is now after the election and the vacancy still needs filled. Mr. Van Frank stated that if
the positions were filled, then possibly there would be a quorum. Dr. Daly asked that someone get
an updated list of who is currently on the Board and when their term ends.
RE: NEW BUSINESS
Dr. Daly solicited any new business. Mr. Tom Glass inquired about disposing of tree limbs. The
Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department (IMPD) recently put out a newsletter stating that limbs
should be put out with heavy trash pick-up. Mr. Glass stated that if it were not for that newsletter,
he would not know how to dispose of tree limbs and he thinks that someone needs to inform the
public of the proper way to dispose of these limbs.
There was discussion about the consumption of oil and how air quality will be affected in the future.
There was also discussion about alternative fuels and electricity resources, which will help with air
quality and water quality.
RE: ADJOURNMENT
Dr. Daly moved to adjourn the meeting. Mr. Achgill made a motion for adjournment. Mr. Salman
seconded the motion. The next Indianapolis Air Pollution Control Board meeting will be on April
10, 2008, at 9:30 A.M. in Room 107 of the City-County Building.

______________________________________________________________________________
RE: STAFF REPORTS – January 2009 - Monthly Activities Reports
(Air Monitoring Activities Report)
Mr. Aaron Childs provided an update to the Board on the Air Monitoring Activities Report for
January 2009. There were seventeen (17) days in which the air quality standard was moderate
and fourteen (14) days in which the air quality standard was good. There were zero (0) days in
which the air quality was considered unhealthy for sensitive groups.
Mr. Childs stated beginning January 1, 2009 sampling began daily at the South West Street site.
This site typically has the highest readings and when readings are consistently high, sampling is
done daily instead of every three (3) days.
Mr. Child also included a list of all of the air monitoring sites that will be running in 2009.
There were no changes from 2008.
(Permit Activities Report)
Mr. Anh-Tuan Nguyen updated the Board on the Permit Activities Report for January 2009. In
January, all new applications were sent to the state. There were four (4) sent to Public Notice and
three (3) permits issued. The transition of permits to IDEM has been completed.

anticipated to have a designation of attainment by the end of 2009. There is a proposed designation
of nonattainment for the 24-hour PM 2.5 standard. Prior to the designation being finalized, EPA
plans on publishing a parallel rule making that will modify the boundaries for non-attainment which
will effectively designate Central Indiana as attainment. The State submitted the Governor’s
recommendation for non-attainment of the 2006 Ozone Standard. EPA’s final designations for the
2006 Ozone Standard will occur March 2010.

______________________________________________________________________________
Ms. Dick provided an update to the IAPCB regarding the mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases.
There is a proposed regulation as well as a PowerPoint presentation available on the USEPA
website.
RE: UNFINISHED BUSINESS
Mr. Kyle Walker provided an update to the IAPCB on the future of the Air Quality Program for
Indianapolis. The current functions of the Office of Environmental Services will be divided into
several areas. The Department of Public Works Engineering will acquire all of the water and land
functions of OES. The Office of Sustainability will acquire the Air Program. This will consist of air
monitoring, technical resource for the IAPCB, and air planning. The City plans to maintain their
Knozone and CICAP programs. The OES Enforcement Section will move to the Office of Code
Enforcement. There will be a reduction in force which will affect twelve (12) OES staff members.
It is the City’s intention to put together a working group to address the new air quality program and
revisions to the City Ordinance pertaining to air quality.
Dr. Daly stated that it is the IAPCB’s intention to maintain its current function as a regulatory
Board. Clarification is still needed on new processes.
RE: NEW BUSINESS
Ms. Janet McCabe met the new USEPA administrator. There was an article regarding air toxics
around schools that caused worry to many people. The new USEPA administrator stated EPA plans
to put together a very robust program for air quality testing around schools. Ms. Dick stated she
would check into this and report back to the IAPCB.
RE: ADJOURNMENT
Dr. Daly moved to adjourn the meeting. Mr. Brown made a motion for adjournment. The next

RE:

ADOPTION OF AGENDA

Dr. Daly solicited modifications to the Agenda. Mr. Dennis Achgill made a motion that the Agenda

RE:

ANNOUNCEMENTS

Dr. Daly solicited announcements. Mr. Richard Wise announced that the City is currently in the

Public Meeting that was held on February 5, 2009. There will be a Memorandum summarizing the
meeting sent to those who requested it and other interested parties.
Ms. Janet McCabe asked if the City has looked into whether there is legal basis to challenge the
Indiana Department of Environmental Management’s (IDEM’s) decision not to renew the contract
with Indianapolis. Ms. Stephanie Roth stated she would forward the question to Mr. Chris Cotterill,
Corporation Counsel for the City of Indianapolis, and have a response for the IAPCB at the next

PRELIMINARY MINUTES – February 12, 2009
INDIANAPOLIS AIR POLLUTION CONTROL BOARD
CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS

______________________________________________________________________________
Mr. Wise stated that a response to the letter the IAPCB sent to Mayor Ballard regarding the City’s
Air Pollution Control Program is forthcoming.
RE: APPROVAL OF MINUTES
Dr. Daly solicited modifications for the minutes for the January 8, 2009 meeting. There were no
modifications. Ms. McCabe made a motion that the Minutes be adopted as presented. Ms. Russell
seconded the motion and said motion carried.
RE: STAFF REPORTS – December 2008 - Monthly Activities Reports
(Air Monitoring Activities Report)
Mr. Aaron Childs provided an update to the Board on the Air Monitoring Activities Report for
December 2008. There were twenty-one (21) days in which the air quality standard was
moderate and ten (10) in which the air quality standard was good. There were zero (0) days in
which the air quality was considered unhealthy for sensitive groups. Mr. Childs also provided a
2009 Annual Report for Air Monitoring.
It was asked if the State has submitted a request to the United States Environmental Protection
Agency (USEPA) for redesignation of the PM2.5 standard. Mr. Childs stated he will check with
IDEM to see if the request has been made and report back to the IAPCB.
Mr. Richard Van Frank asked if it is known why there were lower air quality readings in 2008
and if plant closings and gas prices have anything to do with the lower readings. Mr. Childs
stated that no actual studies have been done but stated that these could be some of the reasons for
the lower readings in 2008.
(Permit Activities Report)
Mr. Anh-Tuan Nguyen updated the Board on the Permit Activities Report for December 2008. In
December, all new applications were sent to the state. There was one (1) that was sent to Public
Notice, and one (1) was proposed to the EPA. There were seven (7) permits issued. Approximately
half of the current permit applications have been sent to IDEM as a result of the transition.
Mr. Nguyen provided a 2008 annual report of permit activities. There were 108 applications
received; thirty-six (36) of which were combined and 121 permit decisions were made.
The Board inquired if this information will continue to be reported. Mr. Wise stated that the City are
still communications with IDEM on how this information will be reported.
Ms. Maggie McShane made a motion that IDEM continue to report information regarding permit,
compliance and enforcement activities to the IAPCB on a monthly basis. Mr. Bill Brown seconded
the motion and said motion carried.
Mr. Brown asked that after the transition occurs if a meeting can be held with Corporation Counsel

2

PRELIMINARY MINUTES – February 12, 2009
INDIANAPOLIS AIR POLLUTION CONTROL BOARD
CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS

______________________________________________________________________________
to determine what exactly the IAPCB can request from IDEM. Ms. Roth stated she would provide
IAPCB’s request to Mr. Cotterill. The Board also asked if clarification of what the ordinance will
mean after the transition and if there are possibly any legal ramifications involving the IAPCB, City
or themselves personally because of the discrepancies between the City ordinance and the State
rules. Again, this question will be directed to Mr. Cotterill.
Dr. Daly requested a legal opinion on the IAPCB’s role in the changing of the current ordinance
since the IAPCB is the legislative body that usually begins the process to any changes to the
ordinance. Mr. Brown asked if the Corporation Counsel has looked at the ordinance to see what
changes will need to be made to the ordinance. Ms. Roth sated she would pass along the IAPCB’s
questions.
(Resolution for Matthew Senseny)
Dr. Daly read a resolution from the IAPCB for Mr. R. Matt Senseny for his time as an IAPCB
member and former Counsel for the Board.
(Stationary Source Compliance Activities)
Mr. Matt Mosier updated the Board on the Compliance Activities Report for December 2008. In
December, there were nine (9) inspections conducted and one (1) source was flagged as a result
of those inspections. There were four (4) stack tests completed of which no violations were
discovered.
Mr. Mosier provided a 2008 annual report of compliance activities. Staff conducted 111
unannounced source inspections in 2008. There were thirty-nine (39) sources flagged as a result of
those inspections; thirty-one (31) were flagged for failure to log/perform compliance monitoring;
five (5) were flagged for failure to take corrective action for exceeding a compliance monitoring
parameter; eight (8) were flagged for exceedance of regulatory requirement or limit; and one (1)
was flagged for failure to obtain proper permit approval. There were also thirty-nine (39) stack tests
observed with zero (0) violations.
(Notice of Violation/Agreed Judgment Activities Report)
Ms. Cheryl Carlson updated the Board on the Enforcement Activities Report for December 2008.
During the month of December, one (1) Notice of Violation (NOVs) without referral, three (3) NOV
with referral, and four (4) warning letters were issued. Ms. Carlson summarized the NOV report for
December 2008.
Staff met with Metalworking Lubricants in January to discuss resolution of the two (2) unresolved
NOV’s. The City’s proposed agreement for the odor NOV is no longer valid due to the transition of
the permit to the IDEM. The City will have to revise the proposed agreement to ensure the
continued operation of the odor control equipment. The NOV for the missing visible emission
notations will be resolved soon.
The Board asked if the City will continue to resolve enforcement actions past the transition period

3

PRELIMINARY MINUTES – February 12, 2009
INDIANAPOLIS AIR POLLUTION CONTROL BOARD
CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS

______________________________________________________________________________
ending February 28, 2009. Ms. Carlson stated it is her understanding that the City will continue to
pursue enforcement actions for violations discovered prior to February 28, 2009, even if the action is
not filed until after that date. The City will continue to communicate with IDEM of all enforcement
actions taken against permitted sources in Marion County.
The Board is concerned that “problem sources” will not have to comply with the local requirements
in their permit and thus render the City’s previous actions ineffective. Also, the IAPCB believes that
sources may be waiting out the transition period so that the current permit requirements will no
longer be valid. The City will still be able to pursue enforcement on a local level, but will be losing
its ability to incorporate a compliance action into a permit.
Ms. Carlson provided a 2008 annual report of enforcement activities. There were ninety-five (95)
warning letters, forty (40) NOV’s without referral and forty-seven (47) NOV’s with referral issued
in 2008. In 2008, a total of $125,840.00 in penalties was assessed in addition to a Supplemental
Environmental Projects (SEP) of $10,600.00. The City has collected all the penalties with the
exception of approximately $10,000.00.
Ms. Carlson responded to a question regarding the City’s SEP policy that was asked at the last
meeting. She distributed a copy of the policy and stated that the State had recently revised their
policy. The City was going to revise the policy to be consistent with State policy; however, due to
changes in the OES Administrator position and IDEM’s decision not to renew the local agency
contract those changes were never completed. However, had a source wanted to undertake a SEP in
lieu of a monetary penalty, the City would have adhered to the State’s policy.
Ms. McCabe stated due to discussions over the past months regarding possible implications of local
activities going over to IDEM, Improving Kids Environment (IKE) has been comparing the number
of enforcement actions that have been taken in Marion County verses other counties, such as Lake
and Allen Counties that are currently under IDEM’s management. Information is still being
gathered and compared. However, it has been preliminarily determined that the City of Indianapolis
has taken far more enforcement actions than these other counties. Ms. McCabe explained the
reasons for this are most likely due to the more frequent inspections and her impression that the
number of times the City of Indianapolis felt that there were clear violations of environmental
regulations is higher than IDEM.
Dr. Daly stated that IDEM has made it clear in that their intent is to no longer inspect sources
annually but to inspect some sources once every two years and to cut other activities by 25%.
Mr. Brown asked under penalties that are assessed to sources by IDEM in Marion County if the
money will come back to Marion County. Ms. Carlson stated no, that IDEM will collect penalties
from their actions which go to the State’s fund. He also asked if the City will have any input on
actions IDEM takes on sources in Marion County. In past experience it has been only been in
special circumstances that IDEM will consult the local municipalities.
Mr. Van Frank wanted to know if IDEM will take enforcement actions for fugitive dust violations.
Ms. Carlson stated that it is one of those areas that need to be determined what the City’s role will
be. Mr. Van Frank is concerned that the City may lose attainment status of the PM2.5 standard if

current levels of enforcement are not maintained. He also voiced concern that the permit violations
will not be enforced in the same manner as they currently are under the local program and feels that
sources will not be held to the conditions in their air permits.
Mr. Achgill voiced a concern that the current ordinance and regulations may be inappropriate given
the change in management of the Marion County air program.
Ms. McCabe proposed that the Board provide recommendations to the City-County Council on what
the IAPCB believes should be maintained in Marion County and what role the City should continue
to provide to citizens in Marion County. The IAPCB concurred that an Ordinance Review
Committee meeting should be scheduled next month to begin discussions on what revisions will
need to be done to the current ordinance.
(Planning)
Ms. Monica Dick stated that Knozone Program is still going through changes. There will be a new
website with educational information on PM2.5 as well as ozone. The website will be more of a
virtual site to target audiences of all types but especially school age children. The website will be
having a soft launch in March 2009, with a hard launch following in April 2009. Staff has decided
not to do a telephone survey concerning the awareness of the program. In the past, telephone
surveys have demonstrated an approximate awareness rate of 80%. Once the new website has been
on line for a few years and with other new outreach ideas in place, the City will perform another
telephone survey to ensure the air quality awareness is the same or improved.
RE: UNFINISHED BUSINESS
Dr. Bill Beranek inquired what are the next steps and the plan for an air quality program in Central
Indiana. He stated that Marion County has always been just in or just out of attainment for different
air pollution criteria. Being on the border line for attainment has already impacted some economic
development in Marion County. He is concerned that economic development will suffer more
because if a City falls into nonattainment, businesses will not grow and new businesses will not
come to Indianapolis or even Central Indiana. Dr. Beranek feels the City of Indianapolis should lead
Central Indiana to its future of air quality for economic development. He also feels the smaller air
quality issues such as those that are coming from residents should be handled on a local level. Mr.
Van Frank agreed with Dr. Beranek and added that not only for economic development but for
public health as well.
RE: NEW BUSINESS
Dr. Daly solicited any new business. There was none.
RE: ADJOURNMENT
Dr. Daly moved to adjourn the meeting. Mr. Brown made a motion for adjournment. Ms. Russell
seconded the motion. The next Indianapolis Air Pollution Control Board meeting will be on March
12, 2009, at 9:30 A.M. in Room 107 of the City-County Building.

WIBC Remotes
An estimated $14,000 or 148 spots were provided as earned media
from WIBC.
A live remote promotion was purchased for an electric lawn
mower give-a-way and 1 on air interview was granted during
the broadcast.
Several additional live remote promotions were purchased
including 4 Backyard BBQ’s 5 on air interviews resulted from the
sponsorship.

Fever Read to Achieve
5 schools were visited and Knozone information was distributed
at each school. The schools included Maplewood Elementary,
Holy Cross Central School, St. Joan of Arc School, Raymond Park
Middle School, and Southport High School. The program reached
approximately 625 Indianapolis Students.
As a result of the Fever Read to Achieve sponsorship we enrolled
Holy Cross Central School in the Smart Schools Don’t Idle (SSDI )
Program. This school then provided an educational meeting with
staff at the school, distributed and collected a parents pledge not
to idle, designated a no idling parent drop off and pick-up area
in addition to distributing educational material in English and
Spanish.

Pacers Read to Achieve
Knozone in partnership with Improving Kids’ Environment will
attend 24 reading time out events and promote the Smart Schools
Don’t Idle Program (SSDI ). Air quality curriculum and Idle Free
Zone signs are being offered. Several
activities are being provided in both English
and Spanish.
The Read to Achieve event includes
exposure to 2250 students and perhaps 100
or so teachers. So far this season, over 15
schools have been visited by Knozone
and Improving Kids’ Environment.
Several of those schools are
currently involved with SSDI and all
attended schools have expressed an
interest in signing up for SSDI.

CICAP ACCOMPLISHMENTS
New Brand Identity for CICA P
New IndyCICAP.org site continues online sign up for users, increases user
friendliness, allows partners to manage commitments through a password
protect system, and features tools for the administrator to manage signups
CICA P has 130 plus members, a 260% increase. And nearly $12,000 has
been collected during the current contract in CICAP sponsorships, a 200%
increase from June of last year.

Proposed Mandatory Greenhouse Gas
Reporting Rule
Rule and website addressed at March Air Board
http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/emissions/ghgrulemaking.html
Regulated pollutants as proposed
o Fluorinated Gases - HFCs, PFCs, & SF6
o Nitrous Oxide
o Methane
o Carbon Dioxide
In general, the proposed rule calls for suppliers of fossil fuels or industrial greenhouse
gases, manufacturers of vehicles and engines, and facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons
or more of GHG emissions per year to submit annual reports to EPA
The first annual report would be submitted to EPA in 2011, for the calendar year 2010,
except for vehicle and engine manufacturers, which would begin reporting for model year
2011
EPA would be responsible for verifying the data
There will be two public hearings for this proposal. EPA encourages those who wish to
attend or give public comments, to register on-line in advance of the hearing. EPA will
web stream both public hearings. The meeting information pages will be updated with
this information as it becomes available.

______________________________________________________________________________
(Notice of Violation/Agreed Judgment Activities Report)
Ms. Cheryl Carlson updated the Board on the Enforcement Activities Report for November 2008.
During the month of November, there was one (1) Notice of Violation (NOVs) without referral, one
(1) NOV with referral, and one (1) warning letter issued. Ms. Carlson summarized the NOV report
for November 2008.
Dr. Daly inquired if the City of Indianapolis is still issuing NOVs and pursuing enforcement actions.
Ms. Carlson stated that the City is still issuing NOVs and will pursue enforcement actions through
their completion.
Mr. Bruce Wallace inquired if Ms. Carlson had an updated copy of the updated Supplemental
Environmental Projects (SEPs). Ms. Carlson stated that she would bring a copy to the next meeting
and also post it on the website.
Mr. Van Frank asked Ms. Carlson if Masco Support Services and Metalworking Lubricants were
trying to wait out the process of IDEM taking back the Air Program?
Ms. Carlson stated that Masco Support Services currently has submitted a permit application to
change its permit. The city is unable to resolve an action without the correct permit being issued.
In regards to Metalworking Lubricants, Ms. Carlson stated to her knowledge they have no intention
on waiting out the process.
(Planning)
Ms. Monica Dick stated that the Knozone Program is still participating with the “Read to Achieve”
Program, and the “Smart Schools Don’t Idle” Program. Ms. Dick stated that children can call the
Central Library and have a book read to them over the phone by an Indianapolis Pacer.
Ms. McCabe stated that a teacher from St. Monica’s has contacted her and their school wants to
participate in the “Smart Schools Don’t Idle” Program. The students will decide which actions the
school is going to take to help reduce idling. Ms. McCabe stated that “Smart Schools Don’t Idle”
would not have been as successful without the help and support of the City of Indianapolis.
Ms. Dick also stated The Central Indiana Clean Air Partnership (CICAP) is teaming up with the
Greater Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce “Green Business Program”.

______________________________________________________________________________
RE: UNFINISHED BUSINESS
(IDEM/OES Local Agency Agreement)
Dr. Daly explained that IDEM and OES have mutually agreed to extend the current contract through
February 28, 2009 and summarized the timeline laid out in the Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU). After February 28, 2009, many permitting, compliance, enforcement and air monitoring
activities will be transferred to IDEM.
Mr. Dan Murray stated that at this time, February 28, 2009, should be the final completion date for
the IDEM/OES Local Agency Agreement. He also stated the IDEM believes it is the right of all
local agencies to have an air program that goes beyond that of what the State requires.
Mr. Tom Rarick inquired about where the City and State are in the transition. Each Section Manager
provided and update.
Mr. Mosier stated the Compliance Section is still doing all compliance functions laid out in the
contract and at the end of the transition, IDEM will assume all compliance activities.
Mr. Nguyen stated all new permit applications are assigned to IDEM, half of the permits that were
previously assigned to OES have been re-assigned to IDEM, and OES is working on the remaining
permits.
Ms. Carlson stated any enforcement actions that occur prior to February 28, 2009 will be followed
through to completion, by the City, even after February 28th.
Mr. Childs stated all air monitoring functions are still being performed by OES and will be until
February 28th. Transitioning air monitoring is more complicated due to equipment and software
issues. OES and IDEM will be meeting to discuss these details. It still has not been determined
Indianapolis will maintain some type of air monitoring program independent from the state.
Ms. Dick stated the City will maintain the Knozone and CICAP programs, even after February 28th.
There was lengthy discussion with Mr. Murray, the IAPCB, OES staff and interested parties
regarding IDEM’s decision including many questions concerning Marion County’s air quality
future. This meeting and other IAPCB meeting can be viewed in their entirety by visiting
http://indianapolis.granicus.com/ViewPublisher.php?view_id=27.
Mr. Bill Beranek requested that a public meeting be held by the City to address any comments or
concerns regarding the air quality.
RE: NEW BUSINESS
Dr. Daly solicited any new business. There was none.

Dr. Daly solicited modifications to the Minutes for the November 8, 2007 meeting. There were no

RE: STAFF REPORTS – October 2007, Monthly Activities Report
(Air Monitoring Activities Report)
Mr. Aaron Childs provided an update to the Board on the Air Monitoring Activities Report for October,
2007. There were nineteen (19) days in which the air quality was in the good category and twelve (12)
days when it was in the moderate category. The moderate days were a result of fine particle readings.
The ozone readings were in the good range the entire month. Mr. Childs will provide a year end report of
Air Quality Readings next month.
(Permit Activities Report)
Ms. Amanda Hennessy updated the Board based on the Permit Activities Report for October, 2007. In
October, there were fifteen (15) new applications received; and eleven (11) decisions were issued. Ms.
Hennessy stated that in order for IDEM to improve their process for applications, they have made changes to
their process for renewal applications. Staff should see some changes in the way renewal applications are
processed in the next few months. IDEM is also in the process of finalizing a change to the MSOP and
FESOP renewal terms. They are currently renewed every five years. With the change, they will be renewed
every ten years. The initial MSOP and FESOP permit term will remain at five years.
(Stationary Source Compliance Activities)
Mr. Matt Mosier updated the Board on the Compliance Activities Report for October, 2007. In October,
there were fourteen (14) inspections conducted and four (4) sources were flagged as a result of those
inspections. Indianapolis Airport Authority, AAR Air Craft Services, Bunge, Inc., and Metal Working
Lubricants were flagged for a variety record keeping and work practice issues. There was one (1) stack
test conducted, which did not result in a flag. Staff are on track for completing all inspections for 2007.
Ms. Cheryl Carlson commented on the flag for Metal Working Lubricants. She stated that a referral has
been received and the majority of the violations are for shift requirements to take visual emissions during
a shift. The new the permit model requires visual emission to be taken once a day so it may end up not
being an enforcement action.
(Notice of Violation/Agreed Judgment Activities Report)
Ms. Cheryl Carlson updated the Board on the Enforcement Activities Report for October, 2007. During the
month of October, twelve (12) Notices of Violation (NOVs) without referral, eight (8) NOVs with referral,

Dr. Daly solicited announcements. Mr. Timothy Method announced that the EPA released a new
Ozone Air Quality Standard, established on March 12, 2008 and is to take effect soon. Mr. Method
provided a Fact Sheet and other handouts with information on these revisions. The last revision to
the Ozone Air Quality Standard was made in 1997, which Indianapolis met in 2007. The new 8hour ozone standard is being lowered to 0.075 parts per million. With the new standard in place, the
Indianapolis area and over 300 counties nationwide will no longer be in attainment.
Mr. Aaron Childs went over a graph and fact sheet. Mr. Child stated that since the standard is lower
now, it is more likely that we will have more days in the "unhealthy" category, as far as the air
quality index is concerned.
RE: APPROVAL OF MINUTES
Dr. Daly solicited modifications for the minutes for the February 14, 2008 meeting. There were no
modifications. Dr. Daly left the approval of the minutes open until the next Board meeting where a

Mr. Childs provided an update to the Board on the Air Monitoring Activities Report for January
2008. There were nineteen (19) days in which the air quality was in the good category and
twelve (12) days when it was in the moderate category. The highest fine particle reading for
January was 26.9 micrograms per cubic meter. The air monitoring group maintains one monitor,
on Harding Street, throughout the year to continually monitor ozone; all other monitors turn on
April 1st. Mr. Childs included a list of the monitoring locations for 2008 in his report.
(Permit Activities Report)
Ms. Amanda Hennessy updated the Board based on the Permit Activities Report for January, 2008.
In January, there were twelve (12) new applications received, twenty-three (23) decisions were
issued, and seven (7) were cancelled, combined or withdrawn. Four (4) permits went to public
notice, of which two (2) were FESOP renewals, one (1) was a MSOP, and one (1) was a Title V
review.
(Stationary Source Compliance Activities)
Mr. Matt Mosier updated the Board on the Compliance Activities Report for January 2008. In
January, there were seven (7) inspections conducted and one (1) source was flagged as a result of
those inspections. Willoughby Industries was issued a violation letter for failing to label a
degreaser with the proper operating instructions. There were two (2) stack tests conducted, none

Ms. Cheryl Carlson updated the Board on the Enforcement Activities Report for January 2008.
During the month of January, there were zero (0) Notice of Violations (NOVs) without referral,
three (3) NOVs with referral, and seven (7) warning letters were issued. Ms. Carlson summarized
the NOV report. Bluff Road Clean Fill Site, Eagle Valley, Indianapolis Newspapers, Mar-Zane,
OmniSource Corporation, and W.R. Beach are all new additions to the NOV report. Cases that were
resolved in January are Cryovac Rigid Packaging and E & B Paving. At this time, there is no
Administrative Hearing Officer, so Administrative Hearings are currently at a stand-still.
(Planning)
Ms. Monica Dick passed out a packet of Air Program Goals for 2008. The packet covered
contractual goals that the city has with IDEM. Ms. Dick briefly went over the main components of
the contract.
Mr. Childs went over the Air Monitoring portion of the Air Quality Program. The Air Monitoring
division is to maintain an air monitoring network, forecast ozone and PM 2.5, and provide daily
forecasts on a call-in phone line and website.
Ms. Carlson went over the Enforcement portion of the Air Quality Program. The Enforcement
division is to bring violators into compliance, conduct asbestos inspections, and conduct Section 105
activities, including: complaint response, major source particulate surveillance, auto and gasoline
tanker inspections, and process requests for variances and air curtain destructors.
Ms. Hennessy went over the Permits portion of the Air Quality Program. The Permits division is to
draft, review and issue non-NSR construction permits and operation permits.
Ms. Dick went over the Planning portion of the Air Quality Program. The Planning division is to
submit contract evaluation reports, financial reports and invoices.
Mr. Mosier went over the Compliance portion of the Air Quality Program. The Compliance division
is to inspect sources and observe stationary emission source stack test.
Ms. Amanda Shipman highlighted major grant initiatives for 2008. Major grant highlights include
Hybrids, Municipal Fleet Diesel Retrofit Initiative, the Knozone Program and the gas can exchange.

Mr. Salman inquired about how the Air Program Goals would impact the city's budget. Mr. Method
stated that all of these programs are basically points of emphasis and will take place using existing
staff and for programs that require more funds, a grant is typically obtained. Mr. Method stated that
overall the city budget is being lowered.

______________________________________________________________________________
RE: UNFINISHED BUSINESS
Dr. Daly solicited any unfinished business. Mr. Richard Van Frank stated that there is no quorum
and two vacancies on the Board, one of which has been vacant for a year. Previously, Mr. Van
Frank had been informed that after the election, the vacant position would be filled. Mr. Van Frank
noted that it is now after the election and the vacancy still needs filled. Mr. Van Frank stated that if
the positions were filled, then possibly there would be a quorum. Dr. Daly asked that someone get
an updated list of who is currently on the Board and when their term ends.
RE: NEW BUSINESS
Dr. Daly solicited any new business. Mr. Tom Glass inquired about disposing of tree limbs. The
Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department (IMPD) recently put out a newsletter stating that limbs
should be put out with heavy trash pick-up. Mr. Glass stated that if it were not for that newsletter,
he would not know how to dispose of tree limbs and he thinks that someone needs to inform the
public of the proper way to dispose of these limbs.
There was discussion about the consumption of oil and how air quality will be affected in the future.
There was also discussion about alternative fuels and electricity resources, which will help with air
quality and water quality.
RE: ADJOURNMENT
Dr. Daly moved to adjourn the meeting. Mr. Achgill made a motion for adjournment. Mr. Salman
seconded the motion. The next Indianapolis Air Pollution Control Board meeting will be on April
10, 2008, at 9:30 A.M. in Room 107 of the City-County Building.

November, there were fifteen (15) new applications received; and sixteen (16) decisions were issued. Active
