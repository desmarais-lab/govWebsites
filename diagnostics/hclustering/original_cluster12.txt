Home &gt; BUTTIGIEG TO DEDICATE BYERS SOFTBALL COMPLEX AT ST. CLAIR PARK
===============================================================================
***** BUTTIGIEG_TO_DEDICATE_BYERS_SOFTBALL_COMPLEX_AT_ST._CLAIR_PARK [1] *****

Mayor Pete Buttigieg will host a ribbon cutting and dedication for the Byers
Softball Complex at St. Clair Park, 1300 S. Mayflower Rd., formerly known as
Belleville Softball Complex, on Friday, July 8 at 6 pm before league play
tonight.
‚ÄúThe dedicated service of the Byers Family and Phil St. Clair has ensured
that residents of all ages can share in a high-quality, exciting softball
experience with world-class facilities,‚Äù Mayor Buttigieg says. ‚ÄúRenaming
the complex in their honor will enshrine their efforts for generations to
come.‚Äù
The Byers Family has helped build softball¬ in South Bend for nearly 70 years.
John Byers, Sr. was one of the city‚Äôs first softball commissioners, serving
from 1948 to 1955. His son, John Byers, Jr., in turn was softball commissioner
from 1981 to 2007. Under his leadership, league play grew from 96 teams to 286
teams. The complex also began hosting national tournaments, including
exhibition tours for USA Softball Women‚Äôs National Team in 2000, 2004, and
2008. John Byers, Jr. also has worked for the past 20 years as the facility‚Äôs
ground manager, overseeing field and complex maintenance.
St. Clair served as Director of Parks and Recreation from 1993 to 2015. He
helped oversee construction of the complex, which includes five softball
fields, a full concession stand, and maintenance center. The complex was also
selected to host the 2015¬ International Softball Congress World Tournament.

-

experience a tax increase of 100% or more over their 2002 tax obligation
currently actively serving in the U.S. military
eligible for the age exception
over the age of 65 and has an adjusted gross income of $25,000 or less
under the age of 65 and only source of income is Social Security Disability.

Councillor McWhirter asked how many people take advantage of this opportunity. Mr.
Rodman said 236 people have qualified for the plan.
Councillor Nytes said that most people may pay for their property taxes through their
mortgage payment which is being made on a monthly basis.
Councillor Brown moved, seconded by Councillor McWhirter, to send Proposal No. 39,
2006 to the full Council with a ‚ÄúDo Pass‚Äù recommendation. The motion carried by a vote
of 4-0.
PROPOSAL NO. 40, 2006 - approves an increase of $708,457 in the 2006 Budget of the
Marion County Assessor, Center Township Assessor, Decatur Township Assessor,
Franklin Township Assessor, Lawrence Township Assessor, Perry Township Assessor,
Perry Township Assessor, Pike Township Assessor, Warren Township Assessor,
Washington Township Assessor, and Wayne Township Assessor (Property Reassessment
Fund) to pay for expenses that were not provided for in the original 2006 approved
budget
Kim Diller, Office of Finance and Management, said there is a technical amendment to
Proposal No. 40, 2006. She said the total amounts of the increase in each of the
Assessors‚Äô budget is $857,539 and this amount is incorrect in the digest and in Section 2
of the proposal (Exhibit B, attached).
Councillor McWhirter moved, seconded by Councillor Brown, to ‚ÄúAmend‚Äù Proposal No.
40, 2006. The motion carried by a vote of 4-0.
Paul Ricketts, Lawrence Assessor, represented the township assessors and said they all
have worked hard with the Office of Finance and Management to make this budget work.
He said the reason for this proposal is there was an advertised budget that was released
before the assessors could sit down to adjust their budgets and the reassessment needed to
be reinstated in the budget.
Ms. Diller said during the budget process the Office of Finance and Management
assumed that all the appropriations for 2005 of the reassessment fund would be spent.
She said it was after the advertisement that the assessors figured out the actual number
that would be underspent in the budget. Ms. Diller said the assessors underspent the
reassessment budget by $1.1 million.

Ricketts said the money has to be distributed by taxing district but they are waiting for
more audits to come through. Councillor Brown asked if an update will be given to the
committee on what money was found in each district. Mr. Rickets replied in the
affirmative.
Bart Brown, Chief Financial Officer, asked if additional revenue that was collected in
past years will go toward the 102% excess levy. Cindy Land, Treasurer‚Äôs Office, said
unfortunately no unit collected 102% of their levy. She said the average collection of the
levy for the County in 2005 was around 96 ‚Äì 97%.
Acting Chair Nytes clarified that of the taxes that were planned to support the budgets,
the County only collected 97% of that money. Ms. Land replied in the affirmative and
said the law in the past did not allow the assessments to include appeal value of
assessments. She said there is a proposed law to have the language put back into law to
allow the County to account for appeals on reassessment. Acting Chair Nytes asked if
the problem with collecting levy is grounds for an excessive levy appeal. Ms. Land said
it would need to be looked into but she believes it can be done.
Councillor McWhirter moved, seconded by Councillor Plowman, to send Proposal No.
40, 2006 to the full Council with a ‚ÄúDo Pass as Amended‚Äù recommendation. The motion
carried by a vote of 4-0.
Discussion of the impact of the elimination of Inventory Tax ‚Äì referred to this committee
from February 1, 2006 Economic Development Committee meeting
Acting Chair Nytes stated that the purpose of this presentation is to discuss the impact of
losing the inventory tax as part of the assessed valuation next year.
Bart Brown, Chief Financial Officer, gave a presentation on the elimination of the
Inventory Tax (Exhibit C, see Council files). Some of the key points were:
‚Ä¢

The Inventory tax makes up a certain percentage of the net assessed valuation in
each of the following districts:
1) Indianapolis Police District 6.7%
2) Indianapolis Fire District 5.5%
3) Indianapolis Solid Waste 4.9%
4) Indianapolis Consolidated City 4.9%

‚Ä¢

The percentage of inventory tax per township:
1) Pike 6.3%
2) Washington 3.7%
3) Lawrence 2.9%
4) Wayne 5.6%
5) Center 5.1%

‚Ä¢

Warren 8.4%
Decatur 2.7%
Perry 4.5%
Franklin 2.8%

Possible options the Council has are:
1) Raise rates and try to hold levies flat
2) Cut levies as offset
3) Pass County Economic Development Income Tax (CEDIT), in form of
Homestead Credit

Acting Chair Nytes asked if every government unit that has a tax rate is going to have to
make a decision on whether to raise rates or hold the levies flat. Mr. Brown replied in the
affirmative. Acting Chair Nytes asked if the Council is the only government unit that has
the authority to create CEDIT, which in this case would be used as a Homestead Credit.
Mr. Brown replied in the affirmative and said the offset would only affect homeowners.
Mr. Brown stated that they anticipated $16 million needed in Homestead Credit, which
equals one percent of income tax.
Councillor McWhirter asked if the $16 million is City and County money. Mr. Brown
said the $16 million anticipates all tax rates from all local units. He said the money does
not go to the local units, but to help the homeowner pay their tax bill.
Acting Chair Nytes stated that if the Homestead Credit is passed, other local units of
government will still need to make the decision to raise rates or cut services.
Councillor McWhirter asked how much money will be raised if the rate is increased to
2.5%. Mr. Brown said about $40 million at the current levels. Councillor McWhirter
asked where the remainder of the money would go. Bob Clifford, City Controller, said
you can only raise the rate to provide Homestead Credit, which is $16 million.
Councillor Brown asked if another tax is needed to make up for the loss of inventory tax.
Mr. Clifford said the State will allow you to increase the rate paid by the homeowner.
Tom Langdoc, Wayne Township Director of School/Community Services, explained the
inventory assessed in Wayne Township and the School District (Exhibit D, attached). He
said Wayne Township would lose $8.8 million in tax dollars and the school district would
lose $5.5 million. He said since inventory tax will be lost, rates will need to be increased
as a result of increases on houses in the township.
Dennis Tackitt, Wayne Township School Chief Financial Officer, described each of the
local tax-supported funds (Exhibit E, attached). He said in the General Fund the revenue
per student is established by the Department of Education and money that is not raised
through property taxes is supposed to be raised by the State through their basic grant.
Mr. Tackitt said they have some concern due to the limited funding available to the State

Administration and Finance Committee
February 9, 2006
Page 7
and the ability for the State to increase appropriations to absorb money that is no longer
raised locally. He said Wayne Township is at risk to lose 33 teachers. Mr. Tackitt said in
the Capital Projects Fund, revenue should not be lost but would mean raising local
property taxes to offset the loss of inventory tax. He said the potential inventory tax loss
in Wayne Township is $4.5 million.
Acting Chair Nytes asked if the school board has a preference on how they would want to
handle the inventory loss. Mr. Langdoc said he cannot speak on the school board‚Äôs
behalf, but the State has given authority to the school board to raise taxes to make up for
the shortfall that they did not provide.
Councillor McWhirter asked if 33 teachers were to be laid off, what it means to the
school system. Mr. Langdoc said this would be a bigger discussion but it would probably
mean elimination of programs.
Sue Swayze, representative of the Greater Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce, said the
Council should take into consideration how the Homestead Credit affects homeowners
and renters. She said there are other hits that are coming against the property tax that
may effect the decision on whether to increase the property tax. She said there is the
trending, the property tax replacement freeze, and the real estate credit that is against the
property tax. Ms. Swayze said this issue is going to take some decision making and
vision, and, is happy to see the discussion started.
Acting Chair Ntyes said one of the options is to adopt CEDIT because it would allow the
Council to offer a Homestead Credit to the homeowners that are going to be impacted by
the possible increase in property taxes. She said to adopt CEDIT the Council would have
to act on very short timeline.
CONCLUSION
With no further business pending, and upon motion duly made, the Administration and
Finance Committee of the City-County Council was adjourned at 6:30 p.m.
Respectfully submitted,

Jackie Nytes, Acting Chair

Mayor Ballard Announces Innovative Partnership with Citizens Energy Group
Utilities to Remain Local and Publically Owned; More Than $425 Million in Funding
Anticipated for Infrastructure Improvements
Indianapolis, IN ‚Äì Mayor Greg Ballard signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) today to
transfer the City of Indianapolis‚Äô water and wastewater utilities to Citizens Energy Group (Citizens),
a public charitable trust operating like a not-for-profit for community benefit.
‚ÄúWith this agreement, I am rejecting private ownership of our water and wastewater system while
embracing the benefits that come from private sector efficiency and expertise, and putting water and
wastewater utilities under a public trust,‚Äù Mayor Ballard said. ‚ÄúWe look forward to working with the
City-County Council and the IURC to complete the transfer and realize benefits for utility customers
throughout Central Indiana.‚Äù
Pending negotiation of final agreement and Board of Waterworks, Board of Public Works, CityCouncil Council and IURC approval, the City will receive more than $425 million in connection with
the transfer of the utilities to Citizens. Upon receipt of necessary approvals and negotiation of final
agreements, the City will receive a $262.6 million payment from Citizens ($170.6 paid at closing and
$92 million paid on October 1, 2011), plus up to an additional $50 million from the wastewater
general fund that will remain with the City upon the transfer of the wastewater system.
In addition, the proposed transfer will increase the annual payment in lieu of property taxes (PILOT)
as a result of the significant capital spending associated with the Wastewater System. The City will
monetize the increase of PILOT payments in the form of a bond issuance with anticipated proceeds
of $140 million, with such proceeds used by the City to fund necessary infrastructure improvements
(with Citizens assuming the obligation to pay the increased PILOT). In addition, Citizens agrees to
assume approximately $1.5 billion of City debt (combined debt of waterworks and wastewater).
‚ÄúThis is a big win for the City of Indianapolis. It represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to
minimize future utility rate increases and to provide much-needed funding for deteriorating
infrastructure such as streets, bridges and sidewalks,‚Äù Mayor Ballard said. ‚ÄúToday, we took an
important first step toward greatly improving quality of life for our residents, while encouraging job
creation and economic growth in our community for many years to come.‚Äù

Mayor Ballard Announces Innovative Partnership with Citizens Energy Group

The MOU culminates more than seven months of transparent study and public deliberation by City
officials and the Mayor‚Äôs Infrastructure Advisory Commission. Last July, the City issued a Request
for Expression of Interest (REI) asking qualified firms to provide ideas and solutions to the
infrastructure challenges facing the City, while identifying potential efficiencies in the operation of
the water and wastewater utilities. Citizens was selected from 24 local, national and international
companies responding to the REI.
"While it is clear that there are several review and approval processes ahead, the arrangement being
announced with Citizens appears to be consistent with the criteria and advice we have provided to the
mayor and his staff concerning the water and wastewater utilities," said William Blomquist, chair of
the Infrastructure Advisory Commission and dean of the School of Liberal Arts at IUPUI. "Among
the most important goals are that ratepayers see smaller future increases, the utilities are managed
well for the long term, and the City gains some capital with which to address pressing infrastructure
needs."
Carey Lykins, President & CEO of Citizens Energy Group, said the proposed utility transfer is a
historic moment for the greater Indianapolis community. ‚ÄúMore than a century ago, civic leaders,
including Colonel Eli Lilly, put our community‚Äôs natural gas system into the Citizens Public
Charitable Trust to protect it from sale to profit-making corporations and the uncertainties of
changing political forces. The transfer proposed today heeds the lessons of history by keeping our
community‚Äôs water and wastewater systems in the hands of the people, so they can be managed for
their benefit,‚Äù Lykins said.
Citizens estimates that by the year 2025 combined water and wastewater rates will be 25 percent
lower under its ownership compared to other options available to the City. Lower water and
wastewater rates will be achieved through an estimated $40 million in annual savings available by
combining operations of the water utilities with Citizens‚Äô gas, steam and chilled water systems.
Currently, the water system is governed by the Board of Waterworks and operated in a partnership
with Veolia Water. The wastewater system is governed by the Board of Public Works and operated
in a partnership with United Water.
After the transfer, the water and wastewater utilities will be governed by the Citizens Energy Group
Board of Directors, a non-partisan body that focuses on the needs of customers and the community.
Further accountability will be assured because utilities under Citizens are regulated by the Indiana
Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC), and other agencies including the Indiana Department of
Environmental Management and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
‚ÄúWe know customers want low rates and outstanding service. Citizens has been rated among the best
utilities in the Midwest for customer satisfaction and operational excellence. Veolia and United are
experienced operators as well, and we anticipate they will continue to play significant roles in the
operations of the water and wastewater utilities. We look forward to working closely with Veolia and
United on the future operations of the utilities with a focus on ensuring service quality, while
confirming operating synergies,‚Äù Lykins said.
Moving forward, Citizens is committed to both utility and community investments. Citizens will

make investments in utility infrastructure to ensure system reliability and compliance with federal
environmental mandates, including the City‚Äôs Consent Decree with the U.S. EPA. Specifically,
Citizens will invest the necessary resources to address the City's combined sewer overflow problem
that leads to the pollution of the White River and other streams.
Citizens has put nearly $50 million of revenue from non-utility companies it owns back into the
community over the past decade to fund gas customer rate reductions, low-income energy assistance,
home weatherization programs, neighborhood redevelopment projects and donations to a wide range
of non-profit organizations.
The Mayor intends to file legislation for the utility transfers with the Indianapolis City-County
Council on April 16. In addition to approval by the City-County Council, the utility transfer must be
approved by the Board of Water Works, the Board of Public Works and the Indiana Utility
Regulatory Commission. Full approval would likely take place in late 2010.
The City‚Äôs water system currently serves more than 300,000 households in Marion County and the
six surrounding counties. The wastewater system serves more than 230,000 households, mostly in
Marion County. Citizens provides natural gas, steam and chilled water service to more than 266,000
customers in the Indianapolis area.
To obtain further input on the utility transfers, the City plans to hold public meetings throughout
Indianapolis. More information about the utility transfers and the schedule for public meetings will
be available at www.indy.gov/utilities or by calling 317-327-4MAC.

**** [are you sure] ****
*** We know you love your pet. Many times situations seem beyond your control,
situations that make you feel helpless. 25% of people make a choice to give up
their pet for economic reasons. Please consider your options before making such
a big decision. ***
***   WHAT IS THE REAL ISSUE: Food, Housing, Vet costs, Behavior? Help is out
there. ***
[food_help]     [pet_friendly_housing]     [pitbullfriendly]    [vet_care]    
[Behavior_help]
*** We don't want you to have to bring your family pet to us, but we are here
if you need
help and will be sure to handle your situation confidentially and with great
care. ***
 
In certain circumstances, assistance may be available through our coalition
partners, the Allen County SPCA. The Allen County SPCA&rsquo;s Pet_Promises
Program has limited funding to help keep pets in the home. Applicants will need
to qualify for assistance. Call 260.744.0454 ext. 205 to inquire.
*** Q. How do I Relinquish an Animal to Fort Wayne Animal Care &amp; Control.
If you have made the decision to relinquish your animal, please print and fill
out either our [pdf]cat_surrender_profile or [pdf]dog_surrender_profile and
remember to bring it with you when you bring in your pet. The more information
we have on your pet, the better able we are to determine potential placement.
***
*** There are several options: ***
    * Bring the animal into the shelter during normal business hours. There is
      no fee for relinquishing an animal to our department.
    * If the animal is a stray, you may call for an Animal Control Officer to
      pick up the animal. Officers are available seven days a week from 6am-
      1am. They are also available for emergency call out at other times.
    * If the animal is a stray, you may hold the animal in your home and file a
      found report with our office. Call 427-1244 (choose menu option 7).
      Reporting the animal is required to allow the owner a better chance of
      locating their lost pet. They will go through these reports each time
      they visit the shelter. You will also need to bring the animal to the
      shelter during normal business hours to allow us to scan the pet for a
      microchip. You may continue to hold the animal at your home. After thirty
      days from the filing the found animal report, if the owner does not claim
      the animal, you will become the legal owner. Remember, the animal must be
      presented to the shelter for microchip scanning prior to legal ownership.
***  Q. How Long Are Animals Held at the Shelter? ***
    * An animal turned in by its owner is immediately the property of the city
      and may go into the adoption program pending suitability and space, or
      may be humanely euthanized for cause.
    * A stray animal is held by the department for a minimum of three business
      days, the first day does not count if the animal arrived during business
      hours. Weekends and holidays are not considered in the count. For
      example, if your pet is picked up on a Wednesday after 11am, it will be
      available for the owner to claim until 5:30pm on Monday. After the three
      business days, the city owns the animal and may then:
          o evaluate the animal for our adoption program.
          o evaluate the animal for transfer to a rescue partner agency
          o humanely euthanize the animal in the event of advanced illness,
            aggression, or other cause as deemed necessary.
An injured stray animal will be medically evaluated and may be humanely
euthanized to prevent further suffering prior to the end of the legal holding
period according to the city ordinance.
We hope owners will take the time to look for their lost pets and keep current
identification on their animals at all time. A microchip is a great investment!
If an animal has identification, the owners are notified immediately and when
possible, pets may be returned directly to their homes.
*** Q. How Long Are Adoption Animals Held? ***
We are happy to say that adoption animals have no time frame for being held.
They will remain in the adoption program until adopted. Only under rare
curcumstances is an adoption animal removed from the program. Even then, the
animal may receive additional assistance to then be returned to the program.

Councillor Clay moved, seconded by Councillor Oliver, to send Proposal No. 345, 2014, to
the full Council with a ‚ÄúDo Pass‚Äù recommendation. The motion carried by a vote of 8-0.
PROPOSAL NO. 21, 2015 - appropriates $202,730 in the 2015 Budget of the Marion
Superior Courts (Federal Grants and Drug Free Community Funds) to cover personnel
assigned to the Veterans Treatment, Re-Entry, and Drug Treatment Courts, funded by the
Justice Assistance Grant and Drug Free Marion County
Lisa Bentley, Assistant Director of Finance, Marion Superior Court (MSC), stated that the
proposal will fix technical issues that developed with PeopleSoft during the 2015 Budget
process. The proposal appropriates grants that have already been received, including the
amendment to the 2015 Budget. The grants were awarded during the last quarter of 2014
and will affect the Veterans Treatment, Re-Entry, and Drug Treatment Courts, as well as the
Drug Free Community Fund.
Mr. Brown asked whether MSC has been able to use other appropriations to get through the

need to provide assistance to people leaving the Indiana Department of Corrections (DOC)
and reentering the community. He stated that he believes the re-entry approach is a better
alternative to probation; however, it costs more, due to its intensiveness.
Councillor Simpson moved, seconded by Councillor Scales, to send Proposal No. 21, 2015, to
the full Council with a ‚ÄúDo Pass‚Äù recommendation. The motion carried by a vote of 8-0.

Superior Court, Marion County Sheriff, Community Corrections, Marion County
Prosecutor, Public Defender Agency, Forensic Services Agency, Marion County Coroner,
and the Department of Public Safety, IMPD and Animal Care and Control Divisions (IMPD

Ad Litem Funds) for various public safety initiatives

Public Safety and Criminal Justice Committee
January 21, 2015
Page 5
Matt Kimmick, Interim Controller, OFM, stated that the proposal appropriates the
additional Public Safety Income Tax (PST) dollars that have been received due to the rate
increase that was approved by the Marion County Income Tax Council. He added that each
agency will speak to their proposed appropriation.
Chair Moriarty Adams welcomed the Marion Superior Court (MSC).
Ms. Patterson stated that during the budget process, MSC needed roughly $1.2 million for
salaries; however, it was not included in the introduced budget. She stated that their portion
of the proposal gives them $1.693 million, which allows all full-time equivalent (FTE)
employees to be fully funded outside of the 27th pay for 2015. The additional funding will
be used to fund the Guardian Ad Litem (GAL) Fund.
Councillor Freeman asked Mr. Kimmick to explain the rationale behind how the revenue
from the PST was divided. Mr. Kimmick stated that the City of Indianapolis and Marion
County received approximately $27 million from the PST. The City received $16 million
and the County received $11 million. Of the $16 million, $7.1 million is being appropriated
to fund 115 additional IMPD officers. Once those dollars were allocated, OFM, Council
leadership and the Council CFO reviewed the requests for additional funding, and allocated
the funds accordingly.
Councillor Simpson stated that the Council knew during the 2015 Budget process that the
agencies would return before the respective committees to request additional funding once
the budget process ended. He stated that supports the passage of the proposal, as it helps
agencies fill financial needs.
[Clerk‚Äôs note: Councillors Hunter and Oliver left at 6:37 p.m.]
Chair Moriarty Adams then welcomed the Marion County Sheriff‚Äôs Office (MCSO).
Colonel Louis Dezelan stated that $7.56 million of the proposal will affect MCSO. Of that,
$6.7 million is not new funding; rather it funds the budget that has already been passed. It is
a reallocation from the County General Fund. The additional $1.1 million will fund benefit
and retiree costs, and the salaries of deputies, civilians and detention deputies.
Chair Moriarty Adams then welcomed the Marion County Community Corrections
(MCCC).
John Deiter, Executive Director, MCCC, stated that MCCC was placed on probation by
DOC in June, 2014, due to the lack of field visits. Because of the appropriation from the
2015 budget, MCCC went from conducting only nine home visits in January, 2014, to
conducting 1,089 home visits in November, 2014. He stated that their goal is to continue to
conduct a higher number of visits throughout the year. He then introduced Myra Ross, CFO
for MCCC, and Jennifer Gray, Deputy Director of Programming for MCCC.

Public Safety and Criminal Justice Committee
January 21, 2015
Page 6
Ms. Gray stated that MCCC will receive $630,361 of the proposed appropriation, which
will provide funding for a Chief Deputy Director, six community supervision managers, one
risk assessment administrator, offices supplies and fuel costs, as well as additional medical
costs, increased Information Services Agency (ISA) costs and increases to the offender bed
contract. Ms. Ross stated that the amendment requests to add two Alerts Specialists and an
Evening Monitor, as stated in Exhibit A.
Councillor Simpson moved, seconded by Councillor Clay, to send ‚ÄúAmend‚Äù Proposal No. 22,
2015, as stated in Exhibit A. The motion carried by a vote of 6-0.
Chair Moriarty Adams then welcomed the Marion County Prosecutor‚Äôs Office (MCPO).
Laurel Judkins, Chief Counsel, MCPO, stated that the $735,267 that is being appropriated was
previously requested in the 2015 proposed budget and will allow the agency to continue its daily
operations.
Chair Moriarty Adams then welcomed the Marion County Public Defender Agency (MCPDA).
Deborah Green, Chief Operating Officer (COO), MCPDA, stated that the appropriation of
$273,038 will be used to restore the agency‚Äôs 2014 levels. Aaron Atwell, Financial Manager,
MCPDA, stated that $208,000 is a cut from the 2014 budget, and an additional $65,000 is being
requested to fund a Terminating Parental Rights/Child In Need of Services (TPR/CHINS)
attorney due to an increase in filings for TPR/CHINS.
Chair Moriarty Adams asked where the funding will be placed. Mr. Atwell stated that the fully
fund their Character 01 model.
Chair Moriarty Adams then welcomed the Marion County Forensic Services Agency (MCFSA).
Larry Schultz, Deputy Director, MCFSA, stated that the agency is seeking an appropriation of
roughly $520,000, which will be used to hire additional crime scene specialists, purchase
supplies, and cover the cost of various services.
[Clerk‚Äôs note: Councillor Robinson left at 7:06 p.m.]
Chair Moriarty Adams then welcomed the Marion County Coroner‚Äôs Office.
Alfie Ballew, Chief Deputy Coroner, Coroner‚Äôs Office, stated that in December, 2014, she sent a
memo to the Councillors requesting $121,760 to purchase new vehicles for the agency. In total,
the agency is requesting $216,442 to cover field investigations, pathology and toxicology
services, as well as to cover the costs replacement vehicles. She stated that because the agency is
deteriorating, they are looking to purchase eight Chevrolet Volt electric vehicles.
Councillor Simpson asked the number of heroin-related deaths in 2014. Ms. Ballew stated that
she has not received the final report, but will submit it to the Council once it becomes available.

Public Safety and Criminal Justice Committee
January 21, 2015
Page 7
Councillor Mascari stated that the agency should check into another vehicle, as the Volt can be
costly.
Councillor Clay asked if the Volt will fit the needs of the agency. Ms. Ballew affirmed.
Councillor Freeman stated that the agency needs to request the type of vehicle that is truly
needed, rather than accept the only vehicle that is being offered.
Mr. Kimmick stated that the agency will need to pay $5,000 for each vehicle, adding that the
agency will then be required to pay a $28 daily rental fee for each vehicle, which incorporates
maintenance and fuel costs.
Chair Moriarty Adams asked if the vehicles are capable of transporting decedents. Ms. Ballew
stated that a removal service is responsible for transporting decedents. She added that the agency
requested a van to transport larger decedents; however, that request was denied due to a lack of
funding.
Chair Moriarty Adams then welcomed the Marion County Clerk‚Äôs Office (MCCO).
Myla Eldridge, County Clerk, MCCO, stated that the agency is requesting $200,000 for
personnel costs and postage. She stated that out of the $200,000, $175,000 will be used to pay
the salaries of their current staff; and $25,000 will be used to pay for postage, as it is the Clerk‚Äôs
statutory duty to pay for mailings sent to parties of law suits, jury summons, and court
notifications.
Chair Moriarty Adams then welcomed the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department.
Bryan Roach, Deputy Chief, IMPD, stated that IMPD is requesting roughly $7.1 million from the
PST to cover the cost of 115 police officers. The appropriation will help fund two recruit classes
in 2015, which will consist of 60 to 65 recruits in May and 40 to 45 recruits in October or
November. The cost is an estimate of roughly $125,000 per officer, which includes training,
equipment, and salaries. The appropriation allows the department to compensate for its attrition
rate, as well as increase the number of officers.
Councillor Freeman asked how many recruits go through the academy each year. Deputy Chief
Roach stated that roughly 140 recruits go through the academy each year. Councillor Freeman
stated that hiring 115 officers instead of 140 is beyond maddening.
Chair Moriarty Adams asked Deputy Chief Roach the number of officers that will retire in 2015.
Deputy Chief Roach stated that he does not have the exact amount; however, the average is 47
officers per year. Chair Moriarty Adams asked if the net gain of officers includes the 115 new
officers. Deputy Chief Roach responded in the negative, stating that the net gain is 68 officers.
Councillor Simpson asked what is done with the funding when officers retire. Deputy Chief
Roach stated that $5 million was budgeted in anticipation of numerous retirees in order to hire 50

Public Safety and Criminal Justice Committee
January 21, 2015
Page 8
new officers. Councillor Simpson stated that the Council agreed to raise the PST in order the
provide funding to hire more officers, not pay for replacing retirees or other officers who have
left the department. He stated that 115 officers need to be hired, in addition to the 47 officers that
need to be replaced.
Chair Moriarty Adams asked Mr. Kimmick to discuss the property tax revenues. Mr. Kimmick
stated that the property tax do not affect the City. He added that the appropriated $7.1 million
will only be used to hire the 115 new officers. Councillor Simpson stated that the proposal is not
honest, because the 47 officers that are expected to leave the department are not being replaced.
He stated that the proposal is misleading to taxpayers.
Councillor Freeman stated that he does not agree with allocating money to other agencies when
the money should be used to hire and replace IMPD officers. He suggested that the committee
postpone the proposal to allow more time to discuss the needs of IMPD.
Chair Moriarty Adams then welcomed Animal Care and Control (ACC).
Dennis Papenmeier, Chief, ACC, stated that the agency is requesting an additional appropriation
of $500,000 to cover costs for additional staffing, which will consist of certified veterinarian
technicians, animal care technicians, and upgrading the full-time veterinarian position. The
appropriation will also cover costs associated with food, medical supplies, kennel management
training, and additional veterinarian contractual services.
Councillor Scales asked if the ACC efficiency team has given a dollar amount related to the
needs of the agency. Chief Papenmeier stated that the team gives a series a recommendations;
however, DPS and ACC met to add dollar amounts to as many of the recommendations as
possible, which is approximately $1.5 million to-date.
Councillor Freeman moved, seconded by Councillor Simpson, to ‚ÄúPostpone‚Äù Proposal No.
22, 2015, until February 18, 2015. The motion carried by a vote of 5-1, with Councillor
Mascari casting the negative vote.
With no further business pending, and upon motion duly made, the Public Safety and Criminal
Justice Committee of the City-County Council was adjourned at 8:29 p.m.
Respectfully submitted,

Mary Moriarty Adams, Chair
Public Safety and Criminal Justice Committee

Shamus Patton found guilty of felony forgery
New sentence will be served in addition to current
sentence from 2010 shooting during Indiana Black Expo
(Indianapolis, Ind.) -- Marion County Prosecutor Terry Curry announced today that a jury has found
Shamus Patton guilty of six counts of Forgery (C Felonies) for falsifying the signatures of business
managers on work release documents. The jury returned the verdict on Thursday evening after a
one-day trial.
According to the probable cause affidavit, Patton was serving an executed sentence through the
Indiana Department of Correction at a work release facility where inmates are allowed passes to
leave the facility to search for employment. During June 2013, Patton signed out of the facility to
perform job searches. Patton submitted Daily Employer Contact Sheets to the facility for each pass
with forged supervisor signatures from multiple businesses.
‚ÄúWe fully support re-entry programs and encourage offenders to take advantage of opportunities to
regain employment while transitioning from incarceration. However there is no chance of success if
the offender is not genuinely participating.‚Äù Prosecutor Terry Curry stated. ‚ÄúWe will not tolerate
anyone gaming the system as Mr. Patton attempted to do, and we will continue to hold accountable
those who abuse these opportunities while they are serving their sentence.‚Äù
Patton was convicted in 2011 when he pleaded guilty to thirteen charges for his role in a downtown
shooting during the 2010 Indiana Black Expo. In August 2011, he was sentenced to 16 years, eight
to be served in the Indiana Department of Correction, two to be served in Community Corrections
and six suspended.
A sentencing in the case is scheduled for May 22, 2014, at 1:30 p.m. in Court 5. Patton is continuing
to serve the executed sentence from his 2011 conviction and may be ordered to serve the six year
suspended sentence from that case. The sentence from the new conviction and any potential
suspended sentence ordered to be served from the 2011 conviction must be served consecutively.
A second Forgery case is pending against Patton related to additional allegations of falsified
signatures on work release documents believe to have occurred in May and June 2013. That case is
set for a pre-trial conference on May 22, 2014.
A charge of a crime is merely an accusation, and the defendant is presumed innocent until and
unless proven guilty.
