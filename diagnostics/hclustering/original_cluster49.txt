city would own the vehicles at
the end of the term The city can make an annual
payment as opposed to monthly
payments The average life of a police vehicle in Rising Sun has been 6 to 8 years
On average the cost to purchase and outfit a police car

annually is between 25
and 30
000 depending on the type and brand of vehicle Through this plan we
would be able to finance four vehicles approximately 86

Until the

past couple of years the police s
department riverboat budget had
enough funds in it to purchase
replace a vehicle each year Due to the rising cost of
insurance and other personal services our riverboat budget had to be cut in order
to be in line with the 7 portion allotted to the police
department We have
approximately 4500 in our line item for vehicles I would request the rest of the
funds come from council to make up the difference Initially I would request
slightly more than the annual payment price due to outfitting the vehicles but once
they are outfitted with lights sirens emergency equipment etc the annual
request would remain constant Right now I am looking at purchasing a
cost
Dodge Charger and three Dodge Durangos The SUV is actually cheaper than the
traditional

police

sedans

I will do some more research on this issue for the March
meeting and have
hard numbers for council to consider I will also obtain other estimates from

different

some

dealerships I believe in the long run this could save the city and the police
department a few thousand dollars It would also possibly be a cost savings by
having four new cars under warranty

quotation for the portable generator per our
conversations We have listed generators rated at 125KW through 200KW based on
information given by the air conditioning company and the Cummins sizing program
The sizing program recommended a 150KW generator which is normally a very

his experience with his equipment Another supplier was using a 125KW with an
oversized alternator We choose to quote the following units for your review As you can
see the price difference from 125KW to 200KW is not substantial This should allow

•
•
•

June 1, 2015

The lift station is recommended by City Utilities Engineering.
The elevation of a proposed service area is too low to be served by
an existing, on- or off-site, gravity sewer.
The proposed sanitary lift station has been determined to be a cost
effective alternative to an on- or off-site gravity sewer through a life
cycle cost analysis.

SA8.05 Lift Station Hydraulic Design
1. Pumping Capacity
The pumping capacity shall be calculated as follows:
=


,

Where:
Q = pumping rate, gallons per minute (gpm)
Design Flow in gallons per day (gpd) = ADF*4

Use Average Daily Flow as determined in Chapter SA5 –Sewer Design.
Each pump in a duplex station shall have a pumping capacity of Q.
City Utilities Engineering may require the pumping capacity to be
increased or decreased, if deemed necessary.
2. Initial Pumping Capacity
Because proposed improvements may only be a portion of the lift
station build-out service area, City Utilities Engineering may allow or
require the pumping capacity to be reduced for the proposed
improvements if the following conditions are met:
•
•

The area of the proposed improvements is less than 50% of the lift
station build-out service area.
The required Pumping Capacity for the proposed improvements is
less than 50% of the required Pumping Capacity for the lift station
build-out service area.

At a minimum, each pump shall be sized to accommodate the Design
Flow of the proposed improvements plus 20%.
Meeting the above criteria does not guarantee a reduction will be
allowed.
The specific equipment requirements and allowable reductions will be
at the discretion of City Utilities Engineering. Only the pumps, motors,
and relevant control panel equipment will be considered for allowable
reductions. The wet well, valve and meter vaults (if required), piping,
valves, and force main shall be sized for the lift station build-out service
area.
3.

Total Dynamic Head Calculations
The Total Dynamic Head (TDH) shall be calculated for the pumping
capacity of the lift station.
The TDH is the sum of the static head, friction losses and minor losses for
a given pumping rate in a defined pumping system. TDH shall be
calculated as follows:

June 1, 2015

 = ℎ + ℎ + ℎ

Where:
TDH = Total Dynamic Head, feet
ℎ = Static Head, feet

ℎ = Piping friction losses, feet

ℎ = Minor losses, feet

The above variables shall be calculated as follows:
ℎ = Static Head, feet

•

Static Head = Force Main Discharge Elevation – Pump Off Elevation
When the high point in a force main is not at the discharge elevation,
the elevation of the high point shall be evaluated to determine if the
pump performance characteristics are adversely affected.
•

ℎ = Piping friction losses, feet
Piping friction losses shall be calculated using the following Hazen
Williams formula for friction loss:
ℎ = 10.44

Where:

D = inside pipe diameter, inches
Q = pumping rate, gpm
C = pipe roughness coefficient (100, 120, & 140)*
L = force main length, feet
* A roughness coefficient of C = 120 shall be used to determine
the friction losses at the Operating Point. However, due to
changing force main conditions over time, the ℎ and the TDH
shall also be calculated using C = 100 at the Pump Off elevation
and C = 150 at the Pump On elevation.
Minor losses are due to pipe fittings and shall be calculated as follows:
ℎ =

Pump Selection
•

The pump capacity and system TDH, as calculated previously, shall
be used to create the system curve when selecting the pump model.
The operating point is defined as the point where the designed
system curve (C = 120 at Design Flow) intersects the pump
manufacturer’s performance curve.

•

The pump, motor, and impeller shall be non-overloading
throughout the entire operating range for all roughness coefficients.

•

The system head curves for each roughness coefficient shall be
plotted on the pump performance curve to determine the operating
characteristics.

•

Plot the pump curve in parallel in the case where both pumps, or
multiple pumps are allowed to operate simultaneously.

•

The operating point shall fall within the envelope between 70% and
120% of the pump manufacturer’s Best Efficiency Point (BEP), based
on flow rate. For example, it the selected pump has a BEP of 300
gpm at 50’ TDH, the designed system curve should intersect the
manufacturer’s pump performance curve somewhere between 210
gpm and 360 gpm regardless of TDH. If the system curve intersects
the pump performance curve outside of that range, a different
pump should be evaluated.

•

Engineering judgment may be used when evaluating pump
alternatives. If justified, City Utilities Engineering may require a
different operating point or an alternate pump to be used.

the wet well
01 =Absolute vapor pressure of the liquid at the pumping
temperature
2 = The vertical distance between the surface of the
liquid in the wet well and the centerline of the pump
 = Friction losses in the suction piping

Net Positive Suction Head Required ()*+, )is the minimum pressure
required at the suction port of the pump to keep the pump from
cavitating.
)*+, is a function of the system and must be calculated, whereas
)*+3 is a function of the pump and must be provided by the pump
manufacturer. The ratio of )*+, to )*+3 shall be greater than or
equal to 1.5.

and motor assembly for inspection and service. The system shall not
require a person to enter the wet well to remove the pump and motor
assembly. Two rails of corrosion resistant stainless steel, or other
approved material, shall be provided for each pump. The guide rails
shall be positioned and supported by the pump mounting base. The
guide rails shall be aligned vertically and supported at the top by
attachment to the access hatch frame. One intermediate stainless steel
guide rail support is required for each 20-feet of guide rail length.

V = required capacity (gallons)

0/ = minimum time of one pumping cycle (minutes) from start to start.
(Ideally 0/ = 15 minutes, but 12 minutes ≤ 0/ ≤ 30 minutes is
acceptable in certain instances).
Q = pump capacity (gpm); use peak flow for lift station build-out service

station build-out service area average flow.
The wet well volume shall be based on a maximum drawdown range of
4-feet.
2.

Buoyancy
Buoyancy shall be analyzed on the wet well to determine whether
additional methods of restraint are necessary. Mechanical equipment,
water weight, and other temporary loads shall not be included in the
analysis. A minimum safety factor of 1.25 shall be used.
Buoyancy force, opposing force and factor of safety shall be computed
as follows:
•
•

•
•

June 1, 2015

Buoyancy Force = (Displaced Volume) X (Unit Weight of Water)
Opposing Force = Weight of Barrels + Weight of Bottom Slab +
Weight of Top Slab + Net Weight of Saturated Soil Over Bottom Slab
Extension + Any Additional Constraints (excluding electrical and
mechanical components).
Factor of Safety = (Opposing Force) / (Buoyant Force) > 1.25.
If the factor of safety is not > 1.25, restraint measures shall be
employed. City Utilities shall be consulted in these instances.

Book 3 Chapter SA8
Lift Station and Force Main Design

Combination Air Release/Vacuum Valves
Air release valves are generally to exhaust pockets of air accumulated
during operation and air vacuum valves are to exhaust or admit air
during filling or draining of the force main. Consequently, an air release
valve shall be placed at high points in the force main to prevent air
locking. Long, horizontal runs and changes in slope may require
combination air release/vacuum valves. Low points may require air
vacuum valves. The location of any type of air valve shall be discussed
with City Utilities Engineering prior to design. Combination air valves
shall be used as a basis of design for all points along a force main.

5.

Metering Equipment
In cases where metering is required, consult with City Utilities
Engineering for orientation of meter, type of meter and readout
requirements.

Book 3 Chapter SA8
Lift Station and Force Main Design

Force mains shall be designed to enter the gravity sewer system at a
point not more than 2- feet above the flow line of the receiving
manhole.
Tracing wire shall be specified for all force mains.

2. Force Main Pressure and Surge Analysis (Water Hammer)
Surge or water hammer is an increase in pressure in a pipe caused by a
sudden change in velocity (i.e. stopping or starting a pump or closing of
a valve). The maximum surge pressure encountered is a function of
wave velocity, a , as follows:
5=

4660

9:
71 + 8 ;< => 1/2

Where
a = wave velocity
k = fluid bulk modulus (300,000 psi for water)
d = pipe inner diameter (inches)
E = modulus of elasticity of pipe (400,000 psi for PVC,
24,000,000 psi for ductile iron, 111,000 psi for polyethylene)
t = pipe wall thickness (inches)
The maximum surge pressure, P, is computed as follows:
*=

(5$)
2.31'

Where P = surge pressure (psi)
V = maximum change in velocity
g = acceleration due to gravity (32.2 ft/s)
a = wave velocity
Total pressure is computed by the following formula:
Total Pressure = Maximum Surge Pressure + Static Pressure = P + ℎ
The total pressure must be less than the rated pressure, including surge
allowance, of the pipe.
3. Hydrogen Sulfide Prevention/Odor Control
The need for hydrogen sulfide prevention and/or odor control shall be
considered when the detention time in the force main is greater than 6
hours. When hydrogen sulfide prevention and/or odor control is
warranted, City Utilities Engineering shall be consulted prior to design of
control measures.
A chemical container located at the lift station site with chemical feed to
the wet well may be required.

BUILDING PROTECTION

The areas outside of the work area shall be protected at all times. The use of negative pressure in the
work area is one measure of protection that the contractor shall maintain.
1. A negative air pressure differential of at least 0.02 inches of water column, relative to ambient
outside ambient air pressure, shall be maintained at all times throughout the contained area
during the work to ensure that air inside of the work area does not filter back and enter the
building’s spaces outside of the work area. Instrumentation, such as a manometer (with a
readable tape) for measuring the pressure differential shall be provided and maintained by the
contractor for each work area.
2. Once the contained area is established, the negative air pressure system shall operate
continuously, 24 hours a day, until final air clearance criteria have been met.
3. The contractor shall be responsible for cleaning spaces outside and adjacent to the work area
where lead dust is observed.
The contractor shall install and operate a sufficient number of filtration machines to completely change
the air in the work area at least four times per hour. The contractor shall submit verification that the
intended machines will be sufficient. Contractor shall also have on site one spare filtration machine for
each five machines (or fraction thereof) that are planned to be used on the project.
1.17.

WORK AREA PREPARATION (for aggressive demolition and renovation)

The contractor shall perform the following steps, in the order that they appear, to prepare the work area:
1. Establish the work area (s) with the placement of Separation Barriers. These barriers, such
as temporary walls, ceilings, and floors that are necessary for enclosing the work area, shall
be erected and inspected and approved by the Government’s Environmental Consultant prior
to performing any other work.
2. Demarcate the Work Area and post appropriate signs.
3. Post Caution Signs meeting the requirements of 29 CFR 1926.62. Caution signs shall be
posted to permit a person to read the sign and then take the necessary protective measures
in order to avoid personal exposure before entering a work area.
4. Shut Down and Lock Out electric power to the work areas. “Shut Down and Lock Out Power”
means to switch off every electrical circuit breaker serving power or lighting circuits which run
to, or through, the work area. Label circuit breakers with tape over the breakers with the
notation “DANGER, Circuit being worked on” Lock the electrical panel or door with separate
locks, one for the contractor’s supervisor and one for the Property Manager/Project Manager.
5. Provide temporary power and lighting to the work area. Power to and for the work area shall
be brought in from outside the area through ground-fault circuit interrupters at the source.
6. Shut down and isolate heating, cooling, and ventilation air systems to prevent dispersal of
dust and fibers from the work area into other areas of the building.
7. Seal off all openings to windows, corridors, doorways, skylights, ducts, grills, diffusers, and
any other penetrations of the work areas, with six mil plastic or equivalent sheeting sealed
with tape. Also seal seams in system components that pass through the work areas.
8. Clean moveable objects within the proposed work area using HEPA filtered equipment and/or
wet cleaning methods using water with a phosphate-containing detergent or trisodium
phosphate (TSP), or a phosphate-free lead-dissolving detergent and remove the objects from
work areas to a temporary location.
9. Utilize the “top-down” cleaning method to clean the designated work area prior to lead
mitigation activities. Prior to cleaning, remove the contents of any cabinet, shelves, and
removable miscellaneous materials within the “Designated Work Area”.

Construct the Worker’s Decontamination Enclosure System and ensure that there is hot and
cold running water in each shower enclosure and that the water temperature is controllable
by the shower user.
Cover the floors and walls of the proposed work areas with plastic sheeting sealed with duct
tape. Us a minimum of two layers of six mil plastic or equivalent on the floors (no plastic on
the floors is required when the project includes removal of lead-based paint from the floor)
and one layer of four mil plastic sheeting or equivalent on walls. Cover floors first so that
plastic extends at least 12 inches up the walls, then cover walls with plastic sheeting to the
floor level, thus overlapping the floor plastic by a minimum of 12 inches. Seams shall be
staggered.
Remove and clean ceiling mounted objects such as light fixtures, electrical tracks, ventilation
equipment, and other items that were not previously sealed off, that interfere with the work.
Maintain emergency and fire exits from the work area. Spray paint the wall plastic with red
paint using arrows to indicate the direction to the exits from the work area. Each wall of the
containment area must have a directional arrow painted on it. After the wall plastic is
removed, paper signs with red arrows shall be affixed to each interior wall showing the
direction to the work area exits.
Collect lead waste daily and accumulate the waste in appropriate containers.
If at any time water, visible emissions or breaches in the containment are detected, the work
inside of the work area shall cease until the source of the emissions or the breeches are
repaired.

from the work site or area and wet wipe the containers to ensure that there is no residual
contamination. Containers that have been cleaned shall be moved out of the work site or
area into a designated storage area.
12.
Carefully place the containers into the truck or dumpster used for disposal.
13.
Ensure that all waste is transported in covered vehicles to a landfill approved by its State
to accept lead waste.

1.19.2.

Hazardous Waste.
1.
The waste must be tested to determine if it is a hazardous waste. The entire waste stream
(e.g., rags, collected dust, disposable coveralls, filters, etc) must be analyzed. LBP waste
that meets the definition of special waste is hazardous if it has a concentration of lead
equal to or greater than 5.0 mg/l as determined by the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching
Procedure (TCLP). In addition, other parameters must be below the regulatory limits for
toxicity and other characteristics and listings. The handling and disposal of hazardous
waste must be conducted in accordance with applicable State laws and the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulations applicable to the activity being
conducted.
2.
If the generator/contractor determines that the LBP waste is hazardous, then the waste
must be treated prior to disposal at a facility permitted by the EPA to receive the waste.
The treatment technology that is used is stabilization. The treatment of hazardous LBP

14

1.20.

waste must render the waste non-hazardous prior to disposal at a properly permitted
facility.
Hazardous LBP waste may not be stored on-site for greater than 90 days (or 180 days for
a small-quantity generator; 270 days for a small-quantity generator that transports his/her
waste greater than 200 miles) without a RCRA permit.
If the special waste is determined to not be a hazardous waste, the waste may be certified
by the generator to be just solid waste provided it does not exhibit certain characteristics.
The generator of the special waste may certify the waste, if the waste passes the paint
filter test (is not a liquid), does not contain PCBs, is not a hazardous waste, is not
regulated asbestos-containing material, does not result from shredding recyclable metals,
and is not former hazardous waste rendered non-hazardous. Documentation of the
certification must be maintained by the generator and supplied to the Project Manager. If
the special waste is certified, it may be handled as general refuse and no manifest or
additional recordkeeping requirements are applicable.
