Race/Color Discrimination
Race discrimination involves treating someone (an applicant or employee)
unfavorably because he/she is of a certain race or because of personal
characteristics associated with race (such as hair texture, skin color, or certain
facial features). Color discrimination involves treating someone unfavorably
because of skin color complexion.
Race/color discrimination also can involve treating someone unfavorably
because the person is married to (or associated with) a person of a certain
race or color or because of a person’s connection with a race-based
organization or group, or an organization or group that is generally
associated with people of a certain color.
Discrimination can occur when the victim and the person who inflicted the
discrimination are the same race or color.

Race/Color Discrimination & Work Situations
The law forbids discrimination when it comes to any aspect of employment,
including hiring, firing, pay, job assignments, promotions, layoff, training,
fringe benefits, and any other term or condition of employment.

Race/Color Discrimination & Harassment
It is unlawful to harass a person because of that person’s race or color.
Harassment can include, for example, racial slurs, offensive or derogatory
remarks about a person's race or color, or the display of racially-offensive
symbols. Although the law doesn’t prohibit simple teasing, offhand
comments, or isolated incidents that are not very serious, harassment is
illegal when it is so frequent or severe that it creates a hostile or offensive
work environment or when it results in an adverse employment decision
(such as the victim being fired or demoted).

Consent Decree Ends EEOC Race Discrimination Lawsuit Against
Battaglia Distributing
CHICAGO - A federal district judge has entered a $735,000 consent decree resolving a race harassment
lawsuit brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), EEOC v. Battaglia
Distributing Corp., U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, in Chicago.
The EEOC had charged that Battaglia, a grocery wholesaler and manufacturer, tolerated a workplace
that was racially hostile to its African-American dock workers. The company is located on South
Ashland Avenue in Chicago.
Based upon the findings of an EEOC administrative investigation managed by Chicago Acting District
Director Julie Bowman, the lawsuit alleged that since at least 2007, black employees had been
harassed due to their race, including being subjected to racial slurs, such as the "N-word," by
co-workers and managers. The suit also alleged that management failed to take action against the
harassment despite complaints from employees.
Under the terms of the decree which was entered Nov. 10, 2014, Battaglia will pay $735,000 to a group
of current and former African-American employees. Among other relief provided under the decree,
Battaglia will also have to provide its managers with training on Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,
which prohibits racial discrimination on the job, and report regularly to the EEOC on any complaints it
has received, as well as provide other data to demonstrate that it has not retaliated against any of the
participants in the litigation.

HRC Sponsors Training Event
On November 7, 2014, the Human Rights Commission held a training at the Charles Martin Center.
Ethel Harmon, State and Local Coordinator from the Indianapolis District Office of the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission, trained on disability and sex discrimination with an emphasis on
pregnancy and LGBT issues.
Philip Shelton, Director of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity from the Indianapolis Office of Housing
and Urban Development, trained on affirmatively furthering fair housing.
Race/Color Discrimination continued
The harasser can be the victim's supervisor, a supervisor in another area, a co-worker, or someone who
is not an employee of the employer, such as a client or customer.

Race/Color Discrimination & Employment Policies/Practices
An employment policy or practice that applies to everyone, regardless of race or color, can be illegal if it
has a negative impact on the employment of people of a particular race or color and is not job-related
and necessary to the operation of the business. For example, a “no-beard” employment policy that
applies to all workers without regard to race may still be unlawful if it is not job-related and has a
negative impact on the employment of African-American men (who have a predisposition to a skin
condition that causes severe shaving bumps).

Human Rights Service Award
presented to Jose A. Alvarez
On April 12, 2013, the Human Rights Commission held
its 24th Annual Scholarships and Awards Luncheon.
Jose A. Alvarez received the Human Rights Service
Award. Until recently, Mr. Alvarez was the Diversity
Officer and Manager of the Multicultural Access Group
(Staff Interpreters) for Saint Joseph Regional Medical
Center where he had been since 2006. Prior to joining
Saint Joseph Regional Medical Center he was a vice
president for commercial lending for various local

Indiana University of South Bend.
Throughout his career, Jose has endeavored to give of himself to the

those less fortunate, not just to elevate them, but also based on his belief
that we are only as good as the least of us. He received many well
wishes upon his departure from Saint Joseph Regional Medical Center.

The Facts About Age Discrimination
Age discrimination involves treating someone (an applicant or employee)
less favorably because of his age.
The Age Discrimination in
Employment Act (ADEA) only forbids age discrimination against people
who are age 40 or older. It does not protect workers under the age of 40,
although some states do have laws that protect younger workers from age
discrimination.

EEOC Update: U.S. Supreme Court Denies United
Airlines Petition
Seventh Circuit Decision that Employees With Disabilities Need Not Compete For
Reassignment Stands
WASHINGTON - In a closely watched case, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a written order
denying air transportation giant United Airlines' petition for high court review of a disability
discrimination lawsuit brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
(EEOC). This means the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeal's Sept. 7, 2012 decision will stand,
holding that "reasonable accommodation" under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) may
require employers to provide employees with disabilities with "reassignment to a vacant position"
when the employee cannot be accommodated in his or her current position. (EEOC v. United
Airlines, 1:10-CV-01699, U.S. Dist. Court, No. Dist. of Illinois; EEOC v. United Airlines, No.
11-1774. 7th Cir.)
The EEOC's lawsuit charged that United violated the ADA by requiring workers with disabilities
to compete for vacant positions for which they were qualified and which they needed in order to
continue working. The company's practice frequently prevented employees with disabilities
from continuing their employment with the company. The Seventh Circuit reversed the dismissal
of the EEOC's disability discrimination lawsuit and found that "the ADA does indeed mandate
that an employer appoint employees with disabilities to vacant positions for which they are
qualified, provided that such accommodations would be ordinarily reasonable and would not
present an undue hardship to the employer."
Human Rights Service Award continued
Scholarship Awards were presented to Erica Johnson of New Tech High School, Calla Norman
of Riley High School and Alaina Myers of Penn High School.
Age Discrimination continued
worker over a younger one, even if both workers are age 40 or older. Discrimination can occur
when the victim and the person who inflicted the discrimination are both over 40.
The law forbids discrimination when it comes to any aspect of employment, including hiring,
firing, pay, job assignments, promotions, layoff, training, fringe benefits, and any other term or
condition of employment.
It is unlawful to harass a person because of his or her age. Harassment can include, for
example, offensive remarks about a person's age. Although the law doesn't prohibit simple
teasing, offhand comments, or isolated incidents that aren't very serious, harassment is illegal
when it is so frequent or severe that it creates a hostile or offensive work environment or when it
results in an adverse employment decision (such as the victim being fired or demoted).

Sparks Restaurant to Pay $56,000 and Provide
Injunctive Relief in EEOC Retaliation Lawsuit
A federal district court has ruled that Sparx Restaurant of Menomonie, Wis., must
pay back pay and interest to a former employee who was fired in retaliation for
complaining about a racist display in the workplace, the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission (EEOC) announced. Added to damages already awarded
by the jury in the case, the EEOC will have recovered an aggregate of more than
$56,000 for the former employee. The court also enjoined Sparx from engaging in
similar conduct and required training of Sparx's owner and other managers.
In its lawsuit, the EEOC had charged that Sparx fired an employee because he
complained about an offensive display in the restaurant, which included a dollar
bill with a noose around George Washington's neck, and drawings of a man on
horseback and a hooded figure with "KKK" written on his hood. The employee,
who was a cook in the restaurant, was fired three weeks after he complained
about the figure.
Following the EEOC initiating this action, Sparx Restaurant (which was
incorporated as Northern Star Hospitality) closed, and subsequently, a Denny's
franchise, which was incorporated as North Broadway Holdings, began operating
in the same space. The EEOC amended its suit to allege that the action was against
Northern Star Hospitality, North Broadway Holdings, Inc., and Northern Star
Properties, LLC (which owned the property in which the restaurants operated),
which were a single employer for purposes of liability and relief in this case. After
an evidentiary hearing, the district court ruled for the EEOC on this issue.
A jury found in September 2013 that the defendants fired the employee in
retaliation for his complaint, and that his firing had been done with reckless
disregard of his federally protected rights. The jury awarded the employee
$15,000 in damages for emotional distress.

RACE-RACISM
Do we still have a problem?
By GlendaRae Hernandez, Commissioner
For fourteen years the Commission has offered people the opportunity to join a discussion, in a small circle of
participants from different backgrounds, of this very issue. With the help of two trained facilitators for two
hours a week over six weeks, those who sign up are given a safe space to explore the nature of the problem
today and steps that can be taken to make a difference.
This year during February/March, thirty people have been a part of one of three Study Circles offered. Some
have returned from previous years as they enjoy interacting with new people. Many are new to the
experience. Several of these were recruited through the kickoff event which is called "The Little Taste of
Peace". In connection with the Martin Luther King Holiday on the Saturday evening before, people come
together for a short discussion similar to the one they would encounter in a Study Circle, also with
facilitators. Then they enjoy the desserts and the finger foods brought in by the participants and join in an
informal conversation with the new people they have just met. Having experienced just a taste of what a
conversation on race could involve, they are offered the opportunity to sign up for one of the discussion
groups. This year was the best attendance so far with one hundred twenty-four persons coming together on
January 18 at the First United Methodist Church in downtown South Bend.

Human Rights Awareness Day Recognition Luncheon
and Fair Housing Workshop
The South Bend Human Rights Commission and the administrations of the Cities of South Bend and
Mishawaka will once again sponsor a Human Rights Luncheon and Workshop on Friday, April 25th at the
Century Center. This year’s speaker is Todd Schurz, President and CEO, Schurz Communications, Inc. This
year’s theme is Coming Together: How Has the Media Helped to Advance Human Rights Issues?
This event will once again attempt to educate all interested participants concerning human and civil rights
issues in our communities with a workshop prior to the luncheon. The workshop will include fair housing
education conducted by Merlyn Brown and Claudia Nichols of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development. We will recognize individuals and organizations during the luncheon that have demonstrated
a commitment to the field of human rights/relations in our communities with awards in Housing,
Employment, Education and regarding the Americans with Disabilities Act. The workshop is from 8:30 a.m. –
11:15 a.m. and is free and open to the public. Three scholarships will be awarded to high school students
residing in South Bend or Mishawaka who were winners of an essay contest.
For more information, please contact Fred Harris at 574.235.9356

Continued from front page
In an order dated January 27, 2014, the defendants' motion to set aside the verdict was rejected, and back
pay and interest was awarded of more than $41,000. Under the court's order, the back pay and interest will
be increased by 15 percent to account for increased tax liability to Miller by receiving his wage loss in a lump
sum. Further information about the EEOC is available on its website at www.eeoc.gov.
