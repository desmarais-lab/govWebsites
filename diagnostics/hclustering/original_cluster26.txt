NTS:  Coordinate Contract Drawings with Section 2.1.a.2 below.  The location and type of joint required shall be clearly stated on the Contract Drawings. 
Joints shall be as specified in the Contract Documents.  If not specified, provide flanged joints for exposed piping and push-on or mechanical joints for buried piping.  Provide couplings on pipe with plain or grooved ends where shown or where approved by Engineer.
Ductile Iron Pipe, Joints, and Fittings:
NTS:  Flanged pipe is not for buried installation. Also outside coatings for above ground installations are not recommended if pipe is to be painted. Edit Section "1" and "1.a." below to suit project.
Flanged Pipe: Fabricate in accordance with AWWA C115.
NTS:  Insert the required pressure ratings in the following section(s); coordinate with installation specification to determine the required pressure rating with corresponding nominal thickness from Table 1 in ANSI/AWWA C115.  AWWA C115 flanged pipe has a maximum working pressure rating of 250 psi.  Higher pressure ratings (up to 350 psi or higher) are available when using special gaskets (having molded annular rings)  that have been performance tested; consult with the ductile iron pipe manufacturers for additional information and edit gasket specifications below.  The thicknesses listed in the table correspond to special thickness Class (STCL) 53 for pipe diameter three-inch through 54-inch diameter.  For 60- and 64-inch diameter, the thicknesses correspond to Pressure Class 350.  Because flanged joints are not normally used for buried piping, edit/remove this paragraph if appropriate.
Pressure Rating: As specified in on Contract Drawings.  If not otherwise specified, 3 inch to 12 inch diameter pipe shall be a minimum Pressure Class 350 in accordance with AWWA C150. Water main pipe with a diameter larger than 12 inch shall be a minimum Pressure Class 250 in accordance with AWWA C150.
Non-Flanged Pipe: Conform to AWWA C151 for material, pressure, dimensions, tolerances, tests, markings, and other requirements.
Pressure Class: 
3 inch diameter through 12 inch diameter shall be a minimum Pressure Class 350 in accordance with AWWA C150.

Pressure Testing
1.
2.

Under no circumstances shall HDPE pipe be pressure tested when the
temperature of the pipe is above 80 degrees Fahrenheit.
HDPE pipe holds pressure by developing stress in its walls, thus the pipe
will increase slightly in diameter when under high pressures. The
procedure for pressure testing HDPE main should take in account the
expansion of the HDPE main. The recommended procedure is to:
a. Initially pressurize the main to the standard test pressure (150 psi) and
let a majority of the main expansion take place, which should occur in
2 – 3 hours.
b. After the above expansion time period, the main should be pressurized
again to test pressure (150 psi) and the Pressure Test is conducted for
the two (2) hour period. The HDPE pipe will continue to expand
during the test itself and the following table contains maximum
allowances for this expansion.
