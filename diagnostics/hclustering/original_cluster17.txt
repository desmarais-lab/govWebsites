EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The inspection, evaluation and recommendations in
this document are based on the accepted premise
that the Taggart Memorial, gateway to Riverside
Park, with some modification, can become a valued
and useful component of the contemporary civic
fabric of this city while still honoring the past legacy
of a visionary and progressive businessman and
politician, Thomas Taggart. In its current condition
the Memorial is in a near state of ruin, creating
danger to a public who may be tempted to explore.
Evidence of vandalism is extensive. Loose and
detached limestone blocks, spalling concrete, broken
and missing limestone balustrade detract from
the noble intentions of civic commemoration. The
fountain, which has not operated in years, never met
minimum operating standards expected for public
fountains, making its fate as flower bed, unfortunate,
but readily understandable. Compounding the decay
of this monumental gateway are a series of decisions
and actions begun in 1915 that have compromised the
surrounding grounds and the Memorial’s seamless
integration within the lush regional character of
Riverside Park.

To turn this rare monumental legacy into an
indispensable feature of not only Riverside Park
but central Indiana, this document recommends
the renovation of the Memorial and broadening
the discussion about reconfiguring the surrounding
grounds. The core elements of the Memorial will
be restored and rebuilt to embrace universal ADA
accessibility and a state-of-the-art fountain system
with an associated sculptural program will be
installed to create an artistic vision missing in the
original abbreviated design.
The cost forecast for immediate stabilization
and safety measures directly associated with the
Memorial and the fenced perimeter:
Fiscal Year: $45,220.00
The cost forecast for Phase One renovation
and construction associated with the Memorial
Colonnade, Platform, Fountain, new ADA access and
a narrowly defined site:
Fiscal Year: $1,292,523.00 (Option One)			
				
$1,289,173.00 (Option Two)



I NTRODUCTION
Indianapolis Parks and Recreation has
partnered with the Central Indiana
Community Foundation, Historic Landmarks
Foundation of Indiana and the State of Indiana
to investigate and evaluate the actions
and costs necessary to restore the Thomas
Taggart Memorial in Riverside Park. Sadly,
the memorial and it’s component pieces have,
over the past 18 years, suffered accelerated
vandalism and weathering, threatening Indy
Parks with the potential loss of a significant
historic and cultural legacy. To prevent
this loss the City has sought the advice of
a team of preservation specialists to better
understand the history behind the creation
of the memorial, it’s existing condition and a
renovation strategy. The scope of this project is
limited to the memorial colonnade, platform,
east fountain, and immediate surroundings.
Issues beyond this narrow confinement were
to be addressed by later surveys.

GOALS:
With this understood, the primary goals the project
team hope to achieve with this document are:
1. Identify the components necessary to stabilize
and restore the Taggart Memorial;
2. Define the parameters for the restoration and
upgrade of the East Fountain;
3. Provide solutions for universal ADA access to
the Memorial;
4. Suggest proactive maintenance essential for the
memorial to endure;
5. Propose a greater vision, a glimpse of the
memorial’s future; and,
6.	Outline proposed actions and associated costs
for a Phase One renovation.
This document is intended to be used by Indy Parks
and Recreation and it’s partners as a tool for fund
raising and guidance for the Phase One construction
documentation and renovation, and for any future
phases deemed necessary to bring the Taggart
Memorial back into the cultural and recreational life
of the community.



EVALUATION TEAM:
Thomas Taggart loomed large over the progressive politics and civic improvements of Indianapolis at the turn
of the last century. That legacy was recognized by his supporters and family in the stone memorial colonnade
built in Riverside Park, Taggart’s enduring gift of nature to the citizens of Indianapolis. This memorial, dedicated
in 1931, is now in need of restoration that demands an equal measure of respect and love once so visibly
demonstrated by a grateful community.
In response to this need, we have brought together a team of design professionals with a demonstrated
commitment to our cultural and architectural heritage. Our team is knowledgeable in the field of renovation/
restoration and is both creative and sensitive in our approach to the specialized needs of historic sites and
structures.

Architecture:

Jacobs Pannicke Architects, Inc. brings a focused
and practical approach to the preservation and
restoration of the built environment. With over
forty five years combined firm experience specializing
in the area of historic preservation, Jacobs Pannicke
Architects, Inc. is knowledgeable in the Secretary
of the Interior’s Standards for Historic Preservation,
appropriate restoration techniques and methodology
as well as historic construction technology that
will be vital to the future viability of the Taggart
Memorial. Familiarity and experience working with
municipalities, INDOT, not-for-profit agencies and
other organizations with preservation/restoration
projects will be of benefit to the renovation process
of the Taggart Memorial.

Structural Engineering:

Lawson Elser, Inc. has extensive experience with
the unique structural challenges presented by
historic structures. Their ability to provide building
investigation services and define sympathetic and
creative solutions to structural issues is apparent
through their experience with a variety of historic
building types. Lawson Elser, Inc. has been involved
in investigating and providing structural solutions
for hundreds of existing buildings, many of which are
historic in nature.



Landscape architecture:

Eric Fulford, NINebark, Inc. has demonstrated a strong
commitment to the individual character of historic
Midwest sites and knowledge of fountains as is
proven by the depth and variety of works completed
over the last 2 decades, including the recent Historic
Fountain Restoration Scoping Document for Indy
Parks.

Introduction
PROCESS:
The project team developed a methodology for inspection and evaluation of the memorial and fountain to
assure a thorough and comprehensive analysis of the existing conditions using the Secretary of the Interior’s
Standards for Rehabilitation. The process included:

Research:

Historical document research was undertaken to
determine what information was available regarding
the memorial and its context. Indy Parks provided
original site drawings from the Ball State University
College of Architecture and Planning Archives along
with time-lapse aerial views that depict changes to
the site over time.
Newspaper archives were searched for narrative
descriptions of the park, memorial and events that
were occurring in Indianapolis during the time of
construction.
Historical photos research uncovered several images
of the memorial over time that depicts changes to
the surrounding context and the memorial itself.
All of these research finds were studied to understand
the intent and execution of the original design and
its changes over time. By studying the images, it
was hoped that clues to construction details could
be determined and replicated if required, especially
in regards to the fountains and landscaping of the
immediate site.

Measured Drawings:

Project team members completed detailed field
measurements of the memorial structure and
fountain and developed base plans, elevations and
details for the memorial structure in AutoCAD format
that could be utilized for the scoping document
investigation and subsequent design work.

Existing Condition Photography:

The memorial, immediate site and context were
photographed in its current condition as a base line
record of conditions to be utilized for analysis and to
provide visual reference for the scoping document.

Visual Inspection:

The project team completed a visual inspection of
the structure noting deficiencies. This fieldwork
provided the basis for understanding the structure,
its deficiencies and strengths, areas or items that
required invasive testing or investigation were
also identified. The visual inspection included the
excavation of a portion of the fountain bowl and
foundation; review of the exterior platform, the
memorial and the subterranean vault spaces within
the memorial platform. The visual inspection was
completed from the ground and by utilizing a
mechanical lift to allow for up close viewing of each
stone of the memorial.

Invasive Investigation:

Areas of the structure were further investigated
by invasive means. Mortar joints were excavated
and brick backing was removed in limited areas to
determine anchorage and back-up structural systems
and their condition. Instrumentation such a boroscope and metal detectors were utilized to determine
the location, quantity and condition of stone anchor
ties where they were not readily visible because of
existing deterioration of the stone masonry. The
cement plaster ceiling was also penetrated to allow
for visual inspection of its support system and
evaluation of its anchorage system.

Consultation:

The project team met on a regular basis to review
findings and develop consensus on recommendations
for the restoration of the structure and the inclusion
of new features for the memorial such as the
introduction of new lighting, accessibility and
interpretive items.
The project team consulted with masonry contractors
to determine potential costs and to obtain outside
opinions as to a restoration procedure.
The
recommendations of outside experts were considered
as recommendations and the cost magnitude studies
were developed for the scoping documents.

STABILIZATION:

COST

The magnitude of the restoration of the memorial
and the length of time that may be required to secure
funding determined the need for a stabilization
plan that could be implemented immediately. In
reviewing the existing conditions during the field
investigation, the project team identified tasks that
should be undertaken immediately to prevent further
deterioration of the structure. As the structure
continues to deteriorate, potential rehabilitation
costs continue to increase.

The project team consulted with several sources
to develop a reasonable cost magnitude forecast
for both the stabilization and the restoration of
the memorial including replacement of missing or
damaged elements, the development of handicap
accessibility items for the memorial and the addition
of new features. Issues requiring stabilization or repair
were identified and repair or replacement concepts
were developed. These unit costs were derived from
contractor’s current bid data and historical bid data.

The project team identified work items that could
be completed for relatively limited cost and would
have the greatest impact on the long-term viability
of the structure. These items are listed separately
in the Actions and Strategies and the Potential Cost
Magnitude.
The project team strongly recommends that these
work items be completed as soon as possible to
prevent the further deterioration of the structure.

ADA COMPLIANCE
An absolute requirement to any future embrace of
the memorial by all citizens is addition of universal
access to all facets of the memorial, including the
platform, colonnade and fountain, as well as parking
and pedestrian walkways. This is not only common
sense, but it is a legal obligation recently clarified with
the newly promulgated Americans with Disabilities
Act Accessibility Guidelines developed by the
Federal Access Board. To promote universal access
the project team has outlined several approaches,
intended for Phase One, that offer solutions that also
respect the historic appearance and functional fabric
of the Taggart Memorial.

H ISTORY
To thousands of men and women
who had come under the spell of his
personality the passing of Thomas
Taggart will bring moisture to the
eye, a swelling to the throat, a
lowering of voice, indications of a
sense of personal sorrow.
       mmm

Architecture in any country is the joint product of
a designer with a skill in engineering and a client
with a skill in money-making. Becoming a client
manifests a strong desire to assert oneself publicly,
a desire seldom conscious but nonetheless very
powerful. A client and a designer create a sort
of joint persona. They express what they both
want the public to think of them - resulting in
the art of impression.
		

Architecture and Money: Roger Kennedy

He was a mighty factor in politics,
business, finance, government,
but a mightier friend to those who
merited and received his friendship.
The immigrant boy who became a
maker of Presidents, the penniless
youth who amassed millions,
grip the imagination. History was
made during the years when he
struggled from the depths to the
heights, and he helped to make
that history.
His contribution to the growth of
this city, which he adopted as his
own, was almost infinite in its
influence. He proved himself the
equal to the giants of a day when
giants counted in our national
affairs. He outlived, as he overtowered, those he met in the great
field of politics. He was the last
of a generation which impressed
itself indelibly upon the making of
our history. Here was a man.

Obituary . 7 March 1929 The Indianapolis Times

A WAY OF LOOKING AT THINGS

HOMAS TAGGART and his progressive political
Tsupporters
were successful businessmen who shared

a strong commitment to public service. So it is not
surprising that men like George Marott, Samuel
Rauh, Arthur Brown, Dr. Carleton McCulloch, John
Madden, and William Mooney came together to
form the core of the Taggart Memorial Association,
in the mid-1920’s, to assert Taggart’s twin legacies
of recreation (from the French Lick Springs Hotel to
Riverside Park) and public service (from the Mayor of
Indianapolis to National Chairman of the Democratic
Party). The progressive ideals these men shared
and their desire to shape a lasting public tribute to
Taggart found fertile ground in the Indianapolis of
their times.

T ho mas Tag g ar t, c 189

Art and architecture, in the service of politics, became
a strong force in Indianapolis during the City Beautiful
Movement. From 1890 to 1930 the city became host
to a pageant of statues and memorials celebrating
its political sons, including Colfax, Morton, Lincoln,
Hendricks, and Harrison, and erected a series of
significant public monuments dedicated to the
ordinary citizenry, from the Soldiers and Sailors
Monument, to the Indianapolis Public Library, and
the World War Memorial. These collective efforts
provided a public spirit and iconography from which
the Taggart Memorial arose.

powerful influence for any classically trained
architect would have been the garden follies and
pavilions documented throughout world history
and exemplified in 16th century Persian and Mughal
gardens or the Italian gardens of the Renaissance.
These leisure pavilions, which offered graceful,
contemplative and colonnaded environments from
which to view the surrounding gardens, also served
as destinations that terminated views both distant
and linear (as from Burdsal Parkway) and close and
intimate (as viewed from the former lagoon, west of
the memorial). But for a memorial and/or gateway to
exist, there needs to be reason.

George Kessler, Landscape Architect . St. Louis

For the Taggart Memorial that reason found roots
in the greater vision that George Kessler lent to
Riverside Park in 1913, as Landscape Architect to the
Indianapolis Board of Park Commissioners, and in
the business and political friends of Taggart himself.
Sadly, Kessler’s vision of drawing the White River
into Riverside at Burdsal Parkway, creating a gateway
of three bridges, statuary, and staircases down to the
river and the park’s lagoons, suffered a serious blow
from the devastating floods that same year. What
followed was the construction of a massive flood
control system that doomed many City Beautiful
bridges built the previous decade over the White
River. Part of that project was a tall, earthen levee
that separated the eastern portion of Riverside Park
from the river, thus preventing the dramatic gateway
originally envisioned by Kessler. Into that breech
stepped a group of citizen-patrons.

Something occurred during a birthday dinner given
by George Marott in December 1925, that gave rapid
rise to actions by Taggart’s closest friends to rechristen Riverside Park as Tom Taggart Park in tribute
to his vision and public service in Indianapolis. By
September 1926 Taggart’s friends received approval
from the Indianapolis Board of Park Commissioners
to purchase sixteen heavy bronze markers to mark
all sixteen entrances to the newly renamed park.
The following year, in 1927, the Taggart Memorial
Association was born and discussions began with
the Park Commissioners about building a larger
testimonial to Taggart’s legacy. This reached a serious
level of discussion by the early summer of 1929,
following the death of the man himself in March, when
a series of memorial arches were proposed to be built
over all entrances to Taggart Park, including the golf
courses and the municipal nursery. Ultimately this
was deemed too extravagant and by mid-July 1929
select members from the Memorial Association,
Mayor L. Ert Slack, Paul Brown (the county surveyor),
and members of the park board visited the park and
selected Burdsal Parkway as the only memorial
entrance to what was now to be known as Thomas
Taggart-Riverside Park.

THE CLASS OF 1931
It was a remarkable year even as Indianapolis entered
the deepening economic crisis that would be known
as the Great Depression. As President Hoover and
other leading industrialists predicted a return to
prosperity, the Park Commissioners and the Mayor of
Indianapolis were driven by dwindling tax revenues
to slash the annual park budget from nearly $170,000
to almost $70,000, layoff some 100 park workers,
and force a 15% wage cut on remaining staff.
Yet even in this economic gloom as the memorial
neared completion, Indianapolis celebrated the
“Class of 1931”, through the dedication of a series
of significant buildings, which still contribute to the
unique streetscape of our city.
These buildings reflected changing architectural
fashions, yet continued a tradition of building
structures that could last centuries. Imagine the
band of brothers these buildings make: The Circle
Tower Building stepping gently back from Monument
Circle; an imposing American Central Life Insurance
Building fronting Fall Creek and Meridian Street; Perry
Field, now fondly remembered as Bush Stadium; the

Taggart Memorial.

History

HUMBLE LAD WHO ROSE HIGH
“Speaking into amplifiers erected near the
beautiful arch at the gateway to the park, high
officials of the state and city, regardless of their
political affiliations, joined in giving eulogy to the
man who had urged purchase of the farm land
that became Taggart-Riverside Park. Governor
Harry Leslie, Mayor Reginald Sullivan, and
George Marott reminded the 300 who attended
that sadness and solemnity should not dominate
the service. Rather there were expressions of hope
that the arch would inspire children to emulate
the beautiful deeds that had made Taggart
famous. Children of School No. 44 sang at the
opening of the services and children from the
Emerson Grove Women’s Club presented a flower
pageant spelling Taggart’s name. The wreaths
in the form of letters were placed at the base of
the colonnade, while Michael Foley, former park
board commissioner, presided and Bishop Joseph
Francis gave the invocation and benediction.”
Monday 15 June 1931, Indianapolis News

Buried on the last page of the News and the Daily
Times, and not even reported in the Indianapolis
Star, the Sunday dedication of the Taggart Memorial
was overshadowed by the heavy press coverage,
banquets and cheering throngs of Hoosiers of the
extended visit to the city by President Herbert Hoover
and his wife. Even more local press coverage was
later given to the Hoover’s planned dedications of

memorials raised over the tombs of the late President
Warren Harding in Marion, Ohio and Abraham
Lincoln in Springfield, Illinois. So with little fanfare
the Taggart Memorial gateway began service to the
community. While Sheridan’s plantings matured
around the memorial neither his proposed informal
concrete-lined fountain/lagoon nor rock gardens
west of the colonnade were never fully realized. A
simpler earthen version of the lagoon was eventually
built, but was later modified with the addition of an
island with three small footbridges. The lagoon was
modified yet again in 1940 when large quantities
of bank shrubbery and the bridges were removed.
Photographs of the colonnade during this period
note the addition of three small, water spouting frogs
mounted on the upper basin of the east fountain.
Following World War II detailed records of further
proposed changes or administrative attitudes toward
the memorial are absent from archived files.

BUILDING . SITE . FOUNTAIN

INSPECTION & EVALUATION
Two historic and significant events
continue to define the character of the
land on which the memorial firmly
rests; the visionary and controversial
1897 purchase of the farmland property
now associated with Riverside Park
by Mayor Thomas Taggart and his
progressive political supporters; and the
destructive flood of 1913 which led to the
alteration of River Boulevard within the
park and the construction of a massive
flood protection system of levees and
free-flow bridges along the White River
between 1915 and 1938. Both events
combined with political and economic
considerations ultimately led to the siting
of the memorial we view today.

BUILDING
GENERAL OBSERVATIONS:
The architecture of the Taggart Memorial speaks
to a bygone age early in the 20th Century that
commemorated notable citizens and historic
moments in our history with vestiges of classical
Roman monuments. Much had changed since the
reign of Caesar Augustus, yet architects still paid
homage to Rome, to ensure the memory lived on.
Strong with symbolism these stone edifices were
meant to mark the landscape as milestones or
gateways for centuries, reminding future generations
of the deeds and legacies of the past. The stone details
and architectural vocabulary so carefully crafted
on this memorial has distant roots in the Italian
Renaissance and in the eye-popping 1893 Chicago
Worlds Fair, birthplace to the American Beaux-Arts
or City Beautiful Movement. A Movement that many
business and community leaders felt complimented
the L’Enfant inspired radial grid layout of Indianapolis
designed by Alexander Ralston. The Taggart Memorial
perhaps represents, from that Movement, the purest
expression of roman/renaissance commemorative
architecture in Central Indiana. Certainly this
significant form of architecture and the Taggart
legacy warrants it’s protection and renovation by all
those concerned.

FOUNDATION:
The foundation for the memorial is made up of
reinforced, cast-in-place concrete walls and piers.
The foundation walls are visible from three locations:
inside the subterranean vault, at the perimeter grade
line and also from behind base stones that have
fallen from the structure. Within the subterranean
vault, cast concrete square piers support each of the
twenty limestone columns above the deck. There
are also cast concrete walls around the perimeter
of the two memorial towers. The south tower
provides the only access via a metal ladder from the
memorial level to the subterranean vault. All areas
of the subterranean vault have dirt floors with an
approximate head clearance of 6 feet to 8 feet.

The foundation was visually inspected at both the
outside perimeter above grade and from within the
subterranean vault. Overall, the foundation, where
visible, appears to be in fair condition. However,
in several areas, voids around the aggregate at the
wall faces, suggest that the concrete may have been
inadequately mixed or placed in its forms. Areas of
spalling, cracking and some exposed corroded steel
reinforcing were also observed indicating additional
deterioration, primarily due to water infiltration.
Water infiltration has also caused efflorescence on the
interior face of the concrete walls in many locations
as well as on the underside of the platform slab. This
water infiltration is causing the subterranean vault
ambient air to be very damp and humid.

vault. Note wall cracks.

Inspection & Evaluation

At the NW corner of the platform, a portion of the
foundation wall is exposed due to missing limestone
panels. The concrete at this location is severely water
damaged spalled and is indicative of a more extreme
level of concrete deterioration in the foundation of
the platform. It is possible that once the limestone
panels around the base of the platform are removed,
other areas of deterioration of this severity may be
found.
The exterior face of the foundation is clad in
limestone blocks approximately 4 inches thick by
38 inches long by 15 inches tall. The blocks are
set on a concrete ledge and laid in a running bond
pattern. The stones are affixed to each other and
are anchored to the concrete foundation wall with
some mortar and also with at least two mild steel
anchors per panel. Behind the stone panels are scrap
stone shims that maintain the distance between the
concrete foundation wall and the back face of the
stone. The mild steel anchors have severely corroded
due to water infiltration and many of these anchors
are missing entirely. The lack of secure anchorage
and infiltration of water have caused many of the
stones to heave and several to detach from the ledge.
Some of the stone blocks are missing or have fallen
into the adjacent grass. These conditions are such
that it is recommended that all stone panels on the
base of the memorial be removed, reset or replaced.
Note that the below grade footings were not
visible. There does not appear to be any significant
settlement distress to suggest that the footings or the
sub-grade have structural problems, however, since
the footings were not open to direct examination,
their condition can only be generally evaluated by
examining the condition of the visible portions of the
structure bearing upon these footings.

PLATFORM:
On top of the foundation is a flat slab of cast-inplace concrete supported by cast-in-place concrete
beams, all with steel rebar reinforcing. This concrete
platform forms the walking surface of the memorial.
The platform and memorial are accessed by two
concrete stairways with limestone finish surfaces
on the east elevation. The concrete deck slab is
approximately 5-½” thick and has steel reinforcing,
some of which is exposed due to corrosion from
water infiltration.

Exposed and severely corroded rebar as seen at a platform
beam from within the subterranean vault.

Exposed and severely corroded rebar as seen under the 		
platform slab from within the subterranean vault

The platform was visually inspected at both the
outside perimeter above grade and within the
subterranean vault. Where exposed, the steel
reinforcing of the concrete deck slab and support
beams is severely corroded. This is the result of
years of exposure to water infiltration and the lack
of waterproofing and maintenance to the deck over
it’s lifetime. There is also visible efflorescence and
water staining on both the underside of the deck and
beams and also on the interior side of the foundation
walls which is further evidence of excessive water
infiltration. Additionally, the top walking surface of
the platform is severely spalled, cracked and in some
areas, the surface of the concrete is largely gone.
This surface deterioration has created an uneven and
unsafe condition for pedestrian traffic.
The original concrete slab pour provided for control
joints in the slab along the center line of the memorial
columns to limit stress cracking. Some of these
joints have opened up, the original joint sealant is
missing and as such, the joints are now allowing
water infiltration to the subterranean vault.
At the center of the platform, the memorial floor
changes to limestone blocks set on top of the
concrete slab, creating a step up onto the area
between the columns. These blocks generally appear
to be in good condition, but some have shifted
somewhat, probably due to water infiltration. The
joints between these blocks have opened in some
locations and plant growth has developed. In a
few locations, the limestone blocks have chipped or
cracked.

Inspection & Evaluation
MEMORIAL COLONNADE:
On top of the platform sits the memorial colonnade.
It is composed of two identical end towers (each two
stories tall) located at the north and south ends of
a five bay wide arched colonnade composed of twin
limestone columns with carved Tuscan order capitals
supporting each arch.
The memorial was visually inspected primarily
from the platform. A mechanical lift was utilized
to inspect some areas of the upper portions of
the memorial. Limited invasive investigation was
required to determine the condition of the stone
anchorage for the limestone panels that make up the
skin of the memorial.
Limestone balustrade.

The perimeter of the platform was once defined by
a limestone balustrade much of which has been
vandalized, removed or deteriorated beyond repair.
The balustrade is composed of limestone balusters
inset in round recesses at the top and bottom rails;
and a profiled limestone top cap rail. At regular
intervals, large limestone blocks interrupt the rail
and carved stone scuppers allow water to drain off
the platform and spill onto grade. The joints at these
scuppers have also deteriorated allowing water to
run into the joints and cause further damage to the
stonework, anchors, and concrete structural frame.
An inventory of remaining pieces was completed to
help guide the replacement effort.

The groin-vaulted ceiling inside the colonnade is
constructed with cement plaster on wire lath hung
from a metal substructure. The plaster ceiling
between the arches is in fair condition with some
minor surface cracking and major water staining.
Two holes were cut into the ceiling to allow for a

visual examination of the support structure. From
these two holes, the ceiling suspension wires and
steel channels were found to have suffered significant
corrosion caused by water infiltration from a leaky
roof. There are also steel beams that run in the eastwest direction that help support the ceiling and tie
the structure together. These steel members also
exhibit corrosion caused by water infiltration from
the roof.
A projecting limestone cornice caps the top of the
memorial. The overhang is accented by a carved
dentil molding located just under the projecting
stone. Above the projection, a short parapet wall
outlines the roof and allows for flashing of the roof
membrane. The head joints at this area of stone
masonry have opened up, allowing water penetration
into the wall cavity.

Inspection & Evaluation

The remainder of the memorial is clad in smooth
limestone blocks with an intricately carved cornice
and casing at the window and door openings. All
limestone is installed over a multi-wythe brick
masonry backup. The stone is anchored to the brick
backup with mild steel anchor ties. Most of the
limestone mortar joists are tight. It appears that the
memorial has been re-pointed in the past. There are
three distinct mortars visible in the stone joints: the
original mortar - a very soft, white colored mortar
with some coarse aggregate; a pointing mortar
in a color that does not match the original; and a
very hard Portland cement based mortar that was
applied most recently to various joints. The Portland
cement, an inappropriate mortar type, while very
hard, is applied in a very thin layer, so it has not
caused significant damage to the stone.

Typical window and door cornice.

In general, the stonework of the towers and
archways still has very tight joints and is in fair to
good condition. Only a limited number of stones at
the upper corners have shifted - most likely due to
water infiltration from the cornice and roof. Some
degree of weathering of the surface of the stone was
noticed in several locations, especially at the upper
areas of the memorial.
There is noticeable efflorescence on the surface of the
limestone panels, especially on the upper surfaces
of the memorial. This efflorescence appears to be
the result of the open head joints at the cornice and
the resulting water intrusion into the upper portions
of the walls. There is dark colored water staining
on several of the stone columns, caused by water
running down the inside face of the arch walls and
then down the columns from roof leakage.

Cornice on the east side showing efflorescence.

A metal detector was used in the investigation to
scan the stone face, revealing that typically, most
stones have only two anchors at diagonal corners.
Investigation of anchors exposed by removal of
mortar from stone joints was made with a borescope
revealing that the steel anchors have some corrosion,
but are in much better condition than the foundation’s
stone anchors. It is likely that the tightness of the
mortar joints have helped prevent excessive water
infiltration around the anchors and as such they
were largely protected from excessive corrosion.

TOWERS:
Within the south tower, a section of back-up brick
was removed to expose one of the steel limestone
panel anchors in it’s entirety. The area of brick
removed was water damaged and was already in
need of removal and replacement. The anchor in this
location was found to be more severely corroded
than others examined by borescope. This is likely
due to the presence of excessive water infiltration at
this location of the tower. The roof appears to have
leaked and sent water down the inside of the east
face of the tower wall, along the brick surface. At
this location, the brick mortar is washed away and
this is allowing water to penetrate the wall system.
This explains the more severe corrosion of the steel
anchor at this particular location.
Above the archway on the east and west facades
are carved words, declaring: “THOMAS TAGGART
RIVERSIDE PARK”. On the north and south facades
are inset panels above the windows with additional
dedicatory text reading:
On the north tower:
“TO THOMAS TAGGART LOVER OF MANKIND
WHOSE FORESIGHT MADE POSSIBLE THIS PARK”
and the south tower:
“ERECTED BY THE CITY AND HIS FRIENDS AS A
TRIBUTE TO HIS VISION AND SERVICE”

Inspection & Evaluation

The solid rectangular volumes of the two towers
provide a strong anchor to the delicate archways
between. The towers have concrete floors at the
first and second levels. A concrete roof deck spans
the entire memorial. The existing built-up roofing
is in very poor condition and is the source of much
of the deterioration of the memorial. The roof has
a drain at each tower, both of which are clogged
and in poor condition. A roof access at the south
tower is also in very poor condition and is missing
a cover at the access opening. Inside the towers
are metal ladders that provide access to the upper
floor. The south tower ladder provides access to
the subterranean level as well. The ladders are in
poor condition with significant corrosion. The
tower interiors are unfinished and the brick backup is
exposed. Water infiltration from the roof and open
windows has caused deterioration of the mortar
joints. The water has also compromised the plaster
ceiling attached to second floor and roof slab. This
is especially noticeable on the east wall of the south
tower. It is apparent that water has run down the
surface of the brick for many years and has washed
away much of the mortar.

The towers have limited punched openings that
allow some light into the structure. At the second
floor of the inside elevation steel window sashes
are protected behind metal bars. These windows
provide daylight to the second floor tower space. All
glass has been broken out of all windows however
the original metal sash and frames remain.
The first and second floors within the towers are
made of cast concrete with steel angles framing the
access openings at each level. The steel angles are
partially embedded in the slab concrete and partially
exposed. These angles have suffered significant and
readily visible corrosion due to exposure. Because
they are partially embedded, the full extent of the
deterioration is not certain however, it is likely that
these would need to be removed and replaced with
galvanized steel angles or beams. The condition
of the concrete floor slabs is not clear. There is
deterioration of the plaster attached to the bottom
of the slabs. It is recommended that these floors
be removed and replaced with steel beams and open
floor metal grating for air and light circulation.
On the south and north elevations opposite the
doors are large window openings that provide
daylight to the first floor of each tower. The metal
sash windows have had all glass broken out. The
metal frames are also deteriorated. A steel grid
of security bars is attached to the wall to prevent
access through the windows. At the point where
the steel grid is anchored to the wall around the
window, corrosion and the subsequent expansion of
the steel has damaged the stone and brick, especially
on the south elevation of the south tower.

Inspection & Evaluation

Below the second floor windows are large three panel
doors that provide access to each tower. The steel
frame, bronze-clad doors have been severely damaged
by vandals and by attempts to secure the doors in a
closed position. The doors have been screwed to the
metal frames. Two panels have been broken out of
the south door, the steel frame is corroded and the
panel stops have been removed and thrown into the
subterranean vault. This door has been completely
covered by a plywood board screwed to the metal
frame. Above each door are transom windows, also
protected by a metal grille. All glass has been broken
in both transoms.
There are steel angle iron lintels over the punched
window openings that occur in the towers at each
end of the memorial. These lintels have suffered
some corrosion due to exposure to the elements.
The corrosion has caused some masonry damage at
the bearing points in a few locations. The corrosion
does not appear to pose an immediate structural
problem, however, it is recommended that these
be removed and replaced with galvanized angles at
some stage of the restoration.
The structure did have electrical service that provided
some power outlets and lights in the towers. The
power supply has been abandoned and all devices
and lights are removed or damaged. The exposed and
embedded conduits have severely deteriorated due
to rust and corrosion. It is assumed that the entire
existing electrical system will need to be abandoned.
No architecturally significant light fixtures were
apparently associated with the original construction
of the memorial.

CONCLUSIONS:
Overall, the structural condition of the memorial
and platform appears to be fair to good. However,
there are several structural issues that exist and
are largely caused by poor craftsmanship, water
infiltration, vandalism and deferred maintenance.
It is recommended that these be addressed in the
restoration of the structure. These include:
A. Deterioration of metal anchors that tie the
limestone blocks to the foundation wall at the
base of the structure,
B. Deterioration of the cast-in-place concrete
foundation walls due to poor workmanship,
inferior concrete and water infiltration,
C. Deterioration of the platform’s concrete deck due
to water infiltration and poor workmanship.
D. Deterioration of the concrete beams that support
the concrete deck due to water infiltration.
E. Deterioration of the roof membrane, allowing
water infiltration to enter the structure and
deteriorate the steel support system for the
cement plaster ceiling and other steel anchor
members,
F.

Deterioration of the roof drainage system,
including roof drains clogged by debris and drain
pipes broken within the structure,

G.	Open joints at the cornice, allowing water
infiltration into the wall cavity,
H. Damaged and missing pieces of limestone caused
by vandalism and deferred maintenance.
I.

Damaged windows and doors caused by
vandalism and attempt to prevent entry to the
towers.

J.

Deterioration of the steel lintels over the
windows due to exposure to the elements.

K. Deterioration of the brick in some locations

INSPECTION & EVALUATION
SITE
The surprised and puzzled looks
were almost universal when
discussion turned towards the
Taggart Memorial, folks who have
had businesses for decades along
the 16th Street corridor, or been
active in the arts or culture of our
city, asked who and where. Even a
White River greenway interpretive
sign fails to mention the memorial,
though plainly visible from the trail.
This invisibility is compounded
when the memorial itself fails to
educate, inform, or display any
likeness of the person honored.
What memorial? Where in Riverside
Park? Who was Taggart? Why
did they build a monument there?
Why should we care? These are a
sample of the questions we heard
from others while we conducted
our investigation. The legacy and
celebrated memory of Taggart
hoped for by the builders of the
memorial is all but absent today.

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS:
There is a forlorn and pushed-aside quality to the
memorial originally meant to serve as one of several
gateways to the park. However, even in the site’s
pre-1994 condition with the original cross drives and
surrounding remnant landscape intact, the memorial
never seemed a beckoning destination nor offered
a memorable processional sense of arrival. The
urge then, as now, is to drive by and not stop. The
major 1994 site development related to the Riverside
Recreation and Aquatic Center only served to
mutilate the historic setting, and further weakened
the memorial’s relationship to either people or the
park. Little remains of Sheridan’s overall landscape
design intent, let alone Kessler’s grand vision. The
time line found on the following page outlines the
primary historic events and decisions that have had
significant impact on the use, and perception of the
memorial.

alignment of the drives with Burdsal Parkway
as Kessler proposed; and 2, employed
earthen causeways instead of bridges, as
Kessler proposed, to span the low land
between White River Parkway/levee and
Riverside Drive, which created an isolated
low land, made the proposed lagoons
unnecessary, and caused a permanent divide
between the golf course and recreational area.

APPROACH TO SITE:
The memorial is approached from three adjacent
roadways, White River Parkway - East Drive, Riverside
Drive, and Burdsal Parkway. White River Parkway
passes 350 feet west and Riverside Drive 700 feet
east of the memorial; neither offer focused views to
the memorial from speeding vehicles. In addition,
the White River Parkway, located atop a 14 foot
tall flood control levee, is 6 feet higher in elevation
than the earthen platform on which the memorial
sits. Lastly, an unnamed divided road extends west
from Burdsal Parkway across Riverside Park, just
south of the memorial, to connect with White
River Parkway. This tight, awkward cross drive, the
result of 1994 Recreation Center modifications, has
further degraded any opportunity for a sequenced
procession to and past the memorial, requiring
instead a drivers’ full concentration negotiating it’s
narrow, uncomfortably curved lanes.

Secondly, the memorial’s construction 24
feet south of the center line of the broad
Burdsal esplanade deviates from the dictates
of traditional design principles which
would expect long approaching views of
the memorial from Burdsal’s north drive,
westbound traffic. Point in fact, this does not
occur until a driver nears Riverside Drive. This
unsatisfactory gateway situation grew from
locating the memorial within an existing dual
roadway/causeway to White River Parkway
that was not aligned with Burdsal Parkway.
If the drive alignment had been corrected
before the construction of the memorial
in 1930, it might have been more visible to
oncoming traffic.

SURROUNDING DEVELOPMENT AND IMPROVEMENTS:
South Grove Golf Course borders the south, Riverside
Park Recreation and Aquatic Center is to the north,
to the west the White River Greenway Trail shares
the flood control levee with White River Parkway
- East Drive, while a diverse Riverside residential
neighborhood anchors the eastern boundary. Most
damaging to the memorial’s gateway status were
‘improvements’ made in 1994 which removed the
sweeping northern cross drive and associated earth
causeway; drastically altered the alignment of the
sweeping south cross drive; inappropriately sited
a large contemporary playground adjacent to the
memorial; and allowed a poorly considered placement
of plantings east of the memorial.

Viewed from the west the memorial is not visible
from either the banks of the White River or Coffin
Golf Course, primarily because of the flood control
levee and heavy invasive undergrowth and trees
found along the river shoreline adjacent to the
memorial.

Photographic evidence from newspapers in 1931
and in the photo collection of the Indiana Historical
Society suggests that this proposed landscape
was planted. Conceptually the plan responded to
the symmetry of the memorial through the use of
mirrored, free form groupings of trees, shrubs and
perennials flanking either end of the memorial while
focusing views to both the west and east. Although
it remains unclear whether Sheridan was in active
collaboration with Burns & James - Architects, the
planting design indicates that the memorial was
intended to be framed by a layered and complex
landscape typical of the parks during that time
period. The original landscape plan suggested the
following plants (names and spelling as found on
1931 Sheridan drawing):

Evergreen Shrubs
Pfitzer Juniper
Savin Juniper
Tamarisk Juniper
Mugho Pine

View east from the roof of the memorial to Burdsal Parkway.

LANDSCAPE:
Lawn, typical of the landscape around the recreation
center, sweeps around the memorial interrupted by
a scattering of maturing oaks, pines, ash, and dawn
redwood in the depression west of the memorial that
was once the reflecting basin/lagoon designed by
Sheridan. The east fountain is flanked with overgrown
evergreen shrubs, with the upper and lower basins
backfilled with soil and planted with ornamental
perennials, grasses, and sedges. A scraggly collection
of small, poor quality oaks line the heavily revised
roadway from Riverside Drive, which, if allowed to
mature, would obstruct views to the memorial. None
of the current plants date from the proposed 1931
Lawrence Sheridan landscape plan.

The predominant use of evergreen plant material
around the memorial may have been a reflection of
earlier reforestation efforts within Riverside Park that
heavily favored evergreen trees and shrubs. Knowing
little, however, of Sheridan’s background and training
it might also be simply his standard design approach
to buildings in park settings.

DRAINAGE AND GRADING:

The site east of the memorial is essentially flat with
earth filled 6 to 8 inches higher against the outer
fountain basin than originally intended or graded. 8
feet west of the memorial’s earthen building platform
slope falls rapidly away to the former location of
the reflecting basin. Surface storm water seems to
generally flow away from the memorial, except in an
uneven and depressed area adjacent to the steps at
the SE corner of the memorial. The memorial’s paved
concrete platform drains to the surrounding ground
through a series of lovely, but poorly functioning
limestone scuppers.

ACCESS:

View northeast to recreation center from memorial roof.

The broad concrete platform which supports the
colonnade has, historically, only been accessed
by two sets of solid limestone steps at the east
corners of the memorial.
Beyond the expected
weathering, these steps have accumulated a host
of failed patches, chipped tread noses and several
of the solid limestone pieces are broken. In spite
of this, they remain in remarkably good condition.
Both flanking wing walls, however, suffer the same
deterioration and anchor failure observed around the
entire perimeter of the platform.
Currently no universal access exists either to the
platform or the colonnade. There are no sidewalks,
ADA accessible or otherwise connecting the
memorial to the recreation center and its parking
lots. There are no accessible sidewalks linking the
existing asphalt walk along the remaining cross drive
to the memorial. There is no trail link between the
memorial and the White River Greenway Trail.
Two sets of solid limestone stairs flank the platform level.

Inspection & Evaluation
HISTORIC REMNANTS:

A visual survey beyond the east fountain indicates
little remaining original historic fabric, other than the
deteriorated limestone paver walkways leading from
the SE & NE stairs on the memorial and the irrigation
valve pits, west of the memorial. No archaeological
survey or investigative probes were conducted for
this study. Baist Property Atlas maps, dating from
1916 through 1941, show no other structures around
this site. Historic photos from the Indiana Historical
Society show the changing nature of the landscape
and indicate the style of light fixtures found within
the park prior to 1940, all of which were removed in
the distant past.

PARKING:

There is no parking for either vehicles or bicycles,
directly associated with the memorial. There is ample
parking associated with the recreation center 300
feet to the north, but as noted earlier, it is not linked
to the memorial with paved walks, ADA accessible
or otherwise.

SITE LIGHTING:

No physical evidence or documentation was found
indicating that the memorial was ever illuminated
either with flood lights or other decorative lighting. It
is probable that ambient light from the original, 1926
single luminaries from the National Family style of
streetlights, manufactured by Union Metal, washed
unevenly over the memorial much as it does today
from the current cobra-head aluminum streetlights.

CONCLUSIONS:

Nothing about the current site contributes to this
memorial’s intended role as a gateway or cultural
destination. Awkwardly located, with no strong
visual connection to the river, and never fully
integrated into the daily flow of park users, the
memorial, even restored, is in danger of being made
irrelevant to contemporary and future generations of
citizens and visitors. This realization suggests that:

H.		 Commissioned works of public art and a
considered approach to interpretation should
be actively pursued in the initial Phase One
construction to help engage new generations
about who Taggart was and why we should care.
At a minimum the commissioned works should
enhance the memorial as a cultural destination
advancing the Mayor’s overall cultural tourism
initiative.

A.		 Traffic circulation around the memorial needs 		
major reconsideration and visioning.

I.		 Parking, which promotes direct access to the
memorial, is needed to make this cultural site a
legitimate destination.

B.		 Kessler’s original vision for this small piece of
Riverside Park, is still relevant, especially the
integral link between the White River and the
park; the use of bridges that link, not divide areas
of the park; and the use of inter-related water
ways that link different use areas of the park.
C,		 White River needs to play a more prominent
relationship with the memorial.
D.		 Inappropriate contemporary improvements need
to be removed.
E.		 Pedestrian access to and within the memorial
needs to be encouraged and universal.
F.		 Any new landscape needs to be clean, simple
relying prominently on trees and lawn that
require minimum attention and maintenance.
Re-creation of Sheridan’s planting plan is not
recommended for both aesthetic and maintenance
considerations. Planting such an intensity of
closely spaced evergreen trees and shrubs has
led to safety and security issues, even in modern
landmark status landscapes designed 40 years
ago, whose maturing landscapes have created
dark, often uninviting places where people feel
uncomfortable.
G.		 Non-intrusive, contemporary site lighting
solutions to improve the evening visibility of
the memorial needs careful consideration and
encouragement.

INSPECTION & EVALUATION
FOUNTAIN

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS:
Two water features were originally conceived by the
designers to front both the east and west facades
of the memorial. The west fountain, an informal
reflecting basin, was a more modest and self
contained version of the ambitious River stream
basin and bridge system, conceived by Kessler in
the 1913 plan for the park. Photographic evidence
indicates that this basin was not constructed as
detailed in Sheridan’s 1931 plan, with concrete sides
and bottom, and that instead a simpler earthen
pond was constructed and then modified over time,
including the addition of a large island in the center.
Eventually the entire feature was buried beneath 4 to
6 feet of backfill.
For the purpose of this inspection, only the east
fountain, a formal extension of the architecture,
will be considered, for which no original design/
construction drawings have been located.

FOUNTAIN DISPLAY
The original fountain display, as we understand it,
was simplistic, perhaps a reflection of worsening
economic conditions and limited funding.
Photographs from the early 1930’s indicate three
basic water effects. First, a large outer reflecting
pool; second, a scalloped weir cascade, and finally
three individual smooth bore nozzles that sent long
arching jets of water into the reflecting pool. A later
1939/40 photograph show these nozzles replaced
with three cast metal squatting frogs.

Evidence of each planned effect are still visible in the
surviving built fabric. Due to the limited excavations
conducted and the absence of any documentation, it
is assumed there was no fountain illumination.

Presently these frogs are missing, the feed lines are
plugged, and both basins are backfilled with a 1012 inch seam of sand and gravel, topped by a 10-18
inch layer of top soil and converted into planting
beds. The plantings disguise the original intent of
the Memorial Association and designers for a classic,
formal relationship between architecture and water.

FOUNTAIN BASIN/STRUCTURE

Upper basin

B.		 Measured pool depths for the upper and lower
basins are 20 inches and 24 inches, respectively.
As a result, both basins exceed current watersafety codes for new fountains, which restrict
water depths to 12 inch, any depth greater is
subject to codes that govern swimming pools.
C.		 The concrete structure appears solid with no
observable settlement or displacement.
D.		 The plaster wall and pool coat, where exposed by
exploratory trenches, appear in remarkably good
condition.
E.		 There are no broken or missing limestone caps or
facing pieces on either basin. General condition of
the stone appears fine with only slight weathering
and discoloration. Detailing for the upper basin is
both beautiful and surprisingly sophisticated.

42

Scalloped limestone weir.

A.		Original construction shows minimal use of metal
anchoring devices with a heavy reliance instead
on grouted joints and mortar beds to hold both
horizontal and vertical limestone units in place.
Of the few dowel holes exposed, there is no
evidence that dowels were ever installed, either
in horizontal or vertical units. Grout placed in
wall cavities/air space appears solid and intact

Dowel holes but no evidence they were used.

All visible design elements have been field measured
and documented. Trenches, as documented on page
44, were dug in both the upper and lower basins to
better understand construction methods, dimensions
and profiles and the general condition of each
basin. Current soil backfill makes it impossible to
examine all surfaces or to determine water-tightness.
Investigations have revealed:

Cross-section B: upper basin limestone.

The basic built components of the fountain comprise
of cast-in-place concrete basin walls and pool
bottoms, with the submerged portions of the pool
lining/waterproofing composed of a 5/8 to 7/8 inch
plaster wall coat, asphaltum joints where pool bottom
and wall meet, and the exposed concrete core clad
with carved limestone caps and face panels.

Inspection & Evaluation
MECHANICAL EQUIPMENT & PIPING
Equipment typical to fountains: pumps, filtration,
strainers, controls, lighting, electrical gear, or water
quality treatment equipment were not found in the
subterranean space beneath the raised memorial
platform. No evidence was found that any of this
basic mechanical equipment, fundamental to the
operation of a public fountain, was ever installed.
Observations did reveal:
The exact nature of the original system is vague
but it appears that the basic water supply system
consists of a single feed line split into three
individual lines, presumably feeding the original
water display at the upper basin
No automatic water make-up, rudimentary
for any fountain, is evident, nor are backflow
preventers which would now constitute a code
violation.

Basement access in south tower via ships ladder.

All piping, valves, and drain lines are galvanized
metal and appear to be original. All show
evidence of corrosion and while difficult to replace
beneath the current fountain pool basins, would
be simple to replace within the subterranean
vault beneath the memorial platform. Soil backfill
make it impossible to locate original drains in
either basin.
Access to the feed lines and shut off valves for the
fountain display, on the east wall of the subterranean
vault, is awkward requiring negotiation down a
damaged ship ladder and through a raised opening
in the concrete foundation. No direct access to vault
from the overhead paved platform currently exists. In
addition the following were noted:

Subterranean Vault.

The vault dimensionally mirrors the outline of
the raised memorial platform, with a general
floor to ceiling clearance of 6 to 8 feet.
Basic drainage of the vault is accomplished by
the sandy backfill floor material.
The rudimentary electrical lighting system is
nonfunctional.
Ventilation is currently accommodated with
natural airflow moving between the subterranean
vault and the two currently open-air towers that
frame the memorial colonnade.

CONCLUSIONS:
In general, the basins, and their core and facing
materials are in remarkably good condition and should
be protected and reused in any future restoration.

Basins & copings:
A.		 The cast-in-place fountain basin appears to be in
good condition and should be reused unless other
factors are revealed in future investigations. Its
ability to hold water is unknown and should be
tested once basins are fully excavated.
B.		 The plaster coating in fountain basins is
unique and in good condition and should be
repaired during fountain restoration.
C.		Limestone caps and facing material appear to
be in good condition and can be reused.
D.		 The original fountain system can’t be fully
understood without full excavation of basins.

Mechanical systems:
E.		 The original fountain system and its effects were
simplistic and inadequate even for the day and
will require major work to meet today’s codes and
standards. State of the art mechanical and pumping
equipment and electrical service will be required to
reactivate this fountain or some derivation of it.
F.		 Access to the South Tower Basement and the
Subterranean Vault via a ship’s ladder and 34 inch
x 34 inch floor opening, is unsafe and too small to
accommodate contemporary fountain mechanical
equipment. Significant modification of the access
way and of safety rail is required.
G. While the Subterranean Vault offers a viable
location for proposed mechanical equipment and
allows ideal distances between basin and pumps,
the primary shortcoming of its use is the confining
size of the access way from the basement, a 30
inch x 48 inch opening and the 4 foot difference
in floor grades of vault and the South Tower
Basement. These issues would suggest the South
tower as a better alternative for the new fountain
pump room for initial installation and long-term
maintenance.

48

ACTIONS & STRATEGIES
BUILDING
A. Immediate:
Based on the findings of the inspection and evaluation
of the structure as a whole, there are several repair
items that the design team will recommend that
Indy Parks undertake to prevent further deterioration
of the structure. These items as outlined below if
completed in the near future will greatly reduce the
potential for further deterioration that will increase
the cost of a restoration or conservation effort.
1. Replace the roof membrane – Install a new 60
mil. EPDM membrane roof system including new
flashing, and an aluminum roof hatch. This is the
number one repair item that can be completed
that will prevent further water infiltration and
damaged that would be caused by the water.
2. Install new roof drainage system that is tied to
the storm sewer. The roof drains and piping
should be installed at the time a new roofing
membrane is installed.
Provide backflow
prevention at connection to sewer.
3. Address open head joints at stone upper cornice
and parapet walls at roof perimeter to minimize
water infiltration. These joints should be filled
with an elastomeric sealant over a backer rod.
Some stones may require resetting during
the more comprehensive masonry restoration
project.

49

4.	Establish a program of twice-yearly inspections
of the roof, drainage system and parapet
stone joints and address deficiencies during
or immediately after the inspection. (Remove
debris from roof and drains, seal joints that
have opened up, replace damaged or weathered
sealant.
5. Remove loose stone block and stone detail
elements. Label and store at a secure location
or within an on site storage container. Retained
stones in good condition will be reused in the
masonry restoration. Every piece of stone that
is saved by prevention of theft or breakage is one
less piece of stone that will require replacement
during the restoration process.
6. The memorial should be inspected on a regular
basis to ensure that additional stone pieces are
not being damaged and are not detaching from
the memorial due to natural forces or vandalism.
If stones are found to be detached from the base
or memorial, they should be documented and
stored as noted above.
7. Seal all openings (windows and doors) to
prevent vermin, insects and people from
entering the structure and causing additional
damage. Securely fasten painted plywood to
cover all openings and secure existing doorways
to prevent access to the towers.
8. Install temporary security lighting. This may
be accomplished by installing temporary wood
poles with simple cobra style fixture heads at
the north and south ends of the memorial. One
pole already exists the south end of the memorial.
Illuminating the structure may prevent unwanted
access and prevent further vandalism or theft of
stolen elements from the memorial.
9. Continue to limit access to the memorial –
maintain and fortify fencing to prevent access to
the platform to limit opportunities for vandalism
and theft. This may be accomplished by the
installation of a taller fence that is structurally
sound. The addition of a barbed wire top may
also limit the ability to scale the fence to gain
entry.

50

B. Phase One Construction:
The conservation of the memorial will be an intensive
project that will require significant demolition
of existing fabric to repair structural defects. The
conservation of the memorial will also require the
fabrication of many replacement elements to replicate
items that are missing or damaged and unable to be
reused. The conservation project will include:
1. Repairs to the existing foundation walls and
piers in the subterranean vault to include:
a. 	Epoxy injection of concrete that has suffered
repairable cracking.
b. Patch repair of spalled or water damaged 		
areas of the walls and piers, both within
the subterranean vault and along the outside
of the foundation walls.
c. Removal and replacement of concrete that is
damaged beyond repair.
d. Cleaning of exposed and corroded rebar,
coating with galvanized paint, and providing
cover to that rebar by overlay of patching
material or by applying concrete by means
of shot-crete.
e. Removal of all limestone at the foundation
base. These stones shall be reset on the
foundation ledge using stainless steel anchors
and an appropriate mortar at bed and head
joints. New stones shall be provided for
those that are missing or severely damaged.
2. Repairs to the concrete platform floor and
rail system shall include the following items:
a. Removal of the existing concrete deck
and concrete beams from the outside wall
to approximately the outside face of the
memorial structure piers. Replace with a new
structural deck system including galvanized
steel beams, galvanized metal deck, a
structural concrete slab, waterproofing
membrane, and a concrete topping slab.
Slope topping slab to drains.
b. Remove limestone blocks at memorial
floor, inspect and repair the structural
slab, install a waterproofing membrane and
reset stone at base of memorial structure
utilizing new stainless steel anchors.

Actions & Strategies

c. Provide new platform drainage system to
supplement existing stone scuppers. New
spot or trench drains to minimize water
flowing over stone joints at memorial
perimeter.
d. Reset all balustrade elements. Provide
replacement pieces for items that are severely
damaged or missing.

4. Repairs or Replacement of Plaster Ceiling Shall
include:
a. Provide new hanger wires for entire ceiling
structure. Wires should attempt to be
installed from within ceiling void and securely
attached to sound structural members.
b.	Visually inspect all miscellaneous steel
support framing for severe corrosion. Treat
corrosion or replace members as required.
c. Complete material tests of existing plaster
to identify compatible patching materials.
d. Prepare existing plaster and provide skim
coat of compatible cement plaster to entire
ceiling over appropriate bonding agents.
e. Provide breathable paint finish to plaster
to allow for moisture transfer out of skim
coated historic plaster.

3. Repairs to the memorial structure wall system
shall include the following:
a. 100% re-pointing of stone joints on the
memorial portion of the structure. This
process will include the removal of existing
mortar at all joints to a minimum depth
of 1 inch. New appropriate mortar shall
be applied into each joint and tooled per
specifications. Stones that have shifted
should be removed and reset during this
pointing process.
b. 100% repointing of exposed brick masonry
at two towers of structure.
c. Remove and replace brick masonry within
the two towers where water damage
has occurred that is beyond repair or repointing.
d. Repair of damaged stone via dutchman patch
or with stone repair patching compounds or
as a last resort with replacement stone.
e. 100% cleaning of the limestone on the entire
structure utilizing appropriate chemical
cleaner and low pressure water spray to
provide an even stone color over the entire
memorial and fountain bowls.
f. Remove all of the existing concrete floors
within the two towers at each end of the
memorial and replace these with new floor
systems made up of steel beams and metal
grating to allow air and light to circulate
within the towers.
g. Replace the access ladders to the various
floor levels within each tower.
h.	Enlarge the opening and install a weathertight and secure roof access hatch at the
south tower.
i. Clean out the debris in the subterranean
vault, level out the grade, and place a 6
inch layer of pea gravel over a vapor barrier
throughout the entire area.

5. Repair or replacement at all window and door
openings shall include:
a. All windows shall be mechanically cleaned
via a blasting process with extra care taken
to avoid damage to the adjacent stone.
Metal shall be repaired as required.
b. All window frames shall be repainted with an
appropriate metal coating system including
a minimum of one primer coat and two top
coats of finish.
c. Window sash shall be reglazed with a
break resistant glazing system such as
laminated glass or Lexan to limit potential
for breakage.
d. New doors and frames may be fabricated and
installed to match the original in detailing
and configuration. Vandal proof hardware
shall be utilized wherever possible. An
alternate vision is discussed within Actions
& Strategies: Site & Fountain.
e. Metal bar grates shall be blasted to
remove corrosion and shall be treated with
appropriate paint finish systems. Clean the
steel where the grate is anchored to the
memorial masonry and coat with galvanized
paint. Repair damaged masonry around
these anchor points.

6. Replace outdated mechanical and electrical
systems.
a. Provide new water supply line to the
memorial from an existing meter pit to the
south tower. The new water service will
facilitate water supply to the fountain as
well as potential water supply for building
and landscape maintenance in the immediate
area of the Memorial.
b. Provide mechanical ventilation of the
subterranean vault by the installation of an
exhaust fan at one tower roof and a fresh
air intake at the other. Air will be permitted
to circulate through the enclosed spaces
of the memorial. A poly vapor barrier will
be installed at the subterranean vault floor
to prevent moisture infiltration from being
drawn from the vault.
c. Provide new 200 amp electrical service to
the memorial with code compliant panel
and disconnects. Electrical power can then
be distributed through out the memorial via
the basement to provide lighting and power
for maintenance as well as to operate the
ventilation and fountain equipment.
d. The addition of feature lighting to highlight
elements of the memorial and to make it
more user friendly. New recessed fixtures
set within the platform slab will provide
up-lighting at the east and west elevations
highlighting the columns and tower facades.
Additional lighting within the towers
will allow for a glow to emanate from the
windows at night.

ACTIONS & STRATEGIES
SITE & FOUNTAIN
SITE
A.	Immediate:

3. Remove deteriorated and broken limestone
pavers from the NE stair of the memorial, raise
grade and temporarily replace with concrete
pavement.

1.

4. Construct a universally accessible walkway to
the west face of the memorial at the concrete
platform level, also provide wheelchair access
into the colonnade from the platform (ADA
Option One).

There are a few immediate steps required before
beginning Phase One design and construction
documents. Indy Parks should consider:
Improving better security to prevent further
vandalism by increasing the strength of the perimeter
chainlink fence. Consider installing barbed or razor
wire across the top of the fence.

2. Mounting temporary floodlights on nearby streetlights
or wood poles to illuminate the memorial until
restoration efforts can commence.

B.	Phase One Construction:

Due to the limited scope of Phase One Site Construction,
defined by Indy Parks as a zone 20 feet beyond the
memorial, there are no opportunities to correct any
major site deficiencies. As a result the memorial will
continue to suffer a marginal existence within Riverside
Park. Actions are limited to the following:
1. Restore the original grade across the eastern face
of the memorial, fully exposing the outer fountain
basin limestone face. Temporarily re-grade the
surrounding area to drain away from the memorial.
Consider a generously sized porous and accessible
surface to promote pedestrian interaction with the
east fountain.
2. Remove deteriorated and broken limestone
pavers and pour a temporary concrete sidewalk
to the memorial’s SE stair from the existing
asphalt path along the approach drive between
White River Parkway and Riverside Drive.

5. Construct and integrate twin ADA ramps into
the new memorial platform deck adjacent and
perpendicular to both the SE and NE stairs,
hiding the ramp behind the original east
face of the limestone wall and balustrade of
the memorial’s platform (ADA Option Two).
6. Provide protected, ADA accessible, parallel street
parking along the approach drive adjacent to the
memorial for easier, direct public access.
7. Install site amenities such as trash receptacles
on site approaches to the memorial.
8. Carefully remove all solid limestone steps from
their concrete foundations, protect and store
on-site in a secure manner. Inspect and repair
damage to the concrete foundation as necessary.
Waterproof both the concrete and hidden
surfaces of the cleaned and restored limestone
steps before resetting and properly securing
them to the foundation. Install adequate weeps
and sealant joints to ensure a watertight system.
Due to the historic character, handrails may not
be required.

9. Install works of commissioned public art
connected to the roots of Riverside Park and
Thomas Taggart that compliment the fine classical
architecture of the memorial colonnade and
celebrates the progressive legacy of Taggart and
his colleagues and supporters. These public works
of art should enhance the memorial as a cultural
destination, and attract and engage people in
the simple act of storytelling.
Within
the
colonnade this would involve replacing both
deteriorated and damaged exterior metal clad
doors with new cast bronze doors incorporating
raised and sculpted bas-relief figures illustrating
two separate themes. We suggest the following
themes:

In capturing this past, these sculpted doors
will speak to future generations visiting the
memorial the hopes and dreams of people
who lived before and whose labors gave us the
beautiful, broad green respite that is Riverside
Park. This collective effort embracing art and
renovation will embody the principles of cultural
development championed by the Mayor and the
growing cultural institutions of our community.

a. North Door: would be the depiction of
scenes from the activities of those unsung
men and women who where responsible
for the agricultural settlement along
the White River, both native american
and later western immigrants; and,
b. South Door: would be the expression
of images that dramatize the visionary
entrepreneurial and the progressive political
life of Thomas Taggart which helped shape
the history of both Indianapolis and Indiana.

These cast bronze fountain nozzles, from the De Pew fountain in
University Park, Indianapolis, serve as good example of the size and
character of the fish and effect of the proposed upgraded fountain
display noted in item 6 (this page).

1. Maintain existing pool bottom: 703.71.
2. Replace original 3/4” diameter nozzles with a
new display.
3. Clean and reinstall scalloped limestone weir,
limestone caps and facing.
4. Illuminate scalloped weir.
5. Raise pool bottom to meet code and facilitate
re-plumbing.

Actions & Strategies
FOUNTAIN
A.	Immediate (prior to construction documents):

B.	Phase one construction:

There are some immediate steps which must be taken prior
to completing design and construction documents. At a
minimum the following should occur:

Once this further inspection and evaluation is complete,
design a new fountain system incorporating existing upper
and lower basins, limestone facing and cap materials. It
makes little sense to renovate the remnants of the original
hydraulic system. It is our recommendation that an entirely
new system should be installed that included the following
actions:

1. Remove all plant material and excavate backfill.
Hand dig final foot to protect plaster pool
waterproofing.
2. Thoroughly inspect basin walls and bottom.
Identify and locate all feed and drain lines
from existing pool bottoms. Complete the
documentation of the original pool piping
system.
3. Inspect all mortar joints of facing material and
evaluate condition.
4. Test whether the pools are waterproof and leaktight prior to construction documentation to
determine course of action and supplemental
waterproof membrane type.

1. Remove, clean and protect all limestone cap
units. Drill and reset with stainless steel dowels.
Finished joints should be backer rod and sealed ,
with sealant to match color of limestone.
2.	Unless inspection dictates otherwise, all facing
material shall remain in place and be cleaned.
Mortared and grouted joints are to be inspected,
repaired and/or replaced as required. Face
material shall be re-secured to concrete core
with stainless steel strap anchors using existing
limestone anchorages.

3. Integral to an overall sculptural program
proposed for the memorial are enhancements
to the east fountain. Like the cast bronze doors
discussed earlier, we suggest adding new cast
bronze water features, in this case lending the
memorial an element of whimsy and drama,
including:
a. Twelve (12) Cast bronze fish spouting
1/4 inch streams of water would occupy
the lower basin, celebrating the aquatic
diversity once found in the White River
and Fall Creek. Species like freshwater drum,
black perch, small mouth bass, darters,
quillback carpsucker , long-eared sunfish,
blacknose dace, log perch, walleye, buffalo
fish and longnose gar could be represented
in pairings similar to the illustrated example
found in the DePew fountain at University
Park.
b. Adding to the whimsy of the fish, a more
dramatic feature is suggested for the
upper basin where a horizontal sculptural
figurative composition would throw a 36
inch wide clear sheet of water 42 inches,
complimenting the rush of water heard
cascading over the scalloped weir.
All the cast bronze water displays would be
individually illuminated by embedded underwater
lights to underscore the new nighttime visibility
of the memorial.
4. Create a new fountain hydraulic and electrical
system designed by a professional fountain
consultant and installed by contractors with a
proven record of successful, running fountain
systems. Install these new skid mounted
systems on a concrete floor slab in the upgraded
basement of the south tower of the memorial
which will satisfy code clearances and be
properly drained and ventilated. We expect the
new hydraulic and electrical gear to occupy half
of the basement floor plan.
5. Install a state-of-the-art water treatment system,
to minimally include: a) a high-rate permanent
media sand filtration system, with automatic
backwashing (cleaning) and flow control (flow
maintenance between backwashing cycles).
We feel the self-cleaning filters will help insure

60

reliable water maintenance, that will be both
sanitary and pleasing to the eye; and, b) an
automated water treatment system to maintain
sanitary water conditions and prevent scale or
metal corrosion. This system should include:
a. Automatic conductivity control to help
prevent mineral deposits from forming on
decorative stone or bronze surfaces, and in
time, from clogging pipes and valves.
b. Automatic pH control which helps optimize
chemical use.
c. A chemical metering pump to allow for the
introduction of organic “poly-quat” and/
or cleatred copper biocides to maintain
sanitary water conditions without the smell
of chlorine.
d. A properly sized ozonator that injects ozone
gas into the system. Ozone is an oxidizer
routinely used with organic biocides to
provide effective sanitation modeled on
commercial grade fountains.
6. Provide solenoid actuated electric valves utilized
for automatic water addition in each display,
routine water level maintenance and for filling
following pool draining. A backflow preventer
must be supplied, per code, in association with
the automatic water level control system.
7. We recommend that the visually discrete water
display elements be designed such that they
share hydraulic and electrical systems to reduce
construction and material costs.
8. Pool wall and floor fittings should be installed
such that filtered and treated water is adequately
circulated throughout the display elements
eliminating any dead circulation spots that could
foster local or systemic algae blooms.
9.	Gravity overflow fittings should be installed so
that rain does not cause the fountain to overflow
the lower basin.
10. Provide all new piping for both feed, display,
discharge and drain lines. Within the lower basin
install piping and electrical conduit on top of the
current pool floor and beneath what will be a new
concrete pool floor with embedded underwater
lights and an applied pool waterproofing.

Actions & Strategies

11. A programmable logic controller (PLC) should be
provided with the electrical panels and control
systems to operate and monitor hydraulic and
electrical functions.
12.	Underwater lighting must be provided
to highlight the new aesthetic sculptural
components and water cascades found within
the upgrade fountain display system. Cost
permitting, low voltage, LED fixtures should be
used because of their long lamp life and color
shifting technology.
13. Install daylight florescent tube lighting in south
tower basement pump room to provide sufficient
light for Indy Parks fountain staff to work by
during scheduled inspection and maintenance
visits.
14. Provide sump pumps with emergency batteryoperated backups to prevent flooding and
unwanted damage to the fountain electrical
equipment and systems.

ACTIONS & STRATEGIES
MAINTENANCE
A large investment of public and private monies
will be required to complete the conservation of
the memorial. With a planned inspection and
maintenance program, the restored memorial can
expect to survive and thrive for many more years
with minimal expense.

D. Twice Yearly Tasks

A. Daily Tasks:

1. Inspect roof membrane. Identify issues or
defects that may fall under warranty.
2. Clear roof drains of debris.
3. Inspect sealant and mortar joints – identify
potential deterioration and plan for repair or
replacement.

1.	Encourage regular patrols by park rangers, police
and sheriff deputies around the memorial.

E. Yearly Tasks:

B. Weekly Tasks:
1. Complete cursory review of the structure to
identify damage or vandalism that may have
occurred to the memorial or immediate site.
Investigate acts of vandalism and report damage
so repairs can be quickly planned and completed
to prevent further damage or deterioration.
2. Trash pick-up from receptacles and adjacent
grounds.

C. Monthly Tasks:
1. Inspection of lighting system – replacement of
burned out lamps.
2. Cleaning of fountain bowls and memorial slabs
utilizing low-pressure water spray.

Jacobs Pannicke Architects, Inc.

Lawson Elser, Inc.

NINebark, Inc.

1. Prepare fountain for operation (Spring)
2. Prepare fountain for winterization. (Fall)
3. Make repairs to deteriorated sealant or mortar
joints that allow for water infiltration at the
deck, walls and cornice.
4.	Examine windows, doors and other metal objects
that may require touch-up painting to maintain
sound topcoat finish.
5. Inspect balustrade – document any damage that
may be apparent either caused by natural forces,
general use or vandalism. Identify repair options
to limit deterioration of rail system.
To accomplish these clearly outlined maintenance
requirements, it is essential that City maintenance
crews are properly and professionally trained to
perform these tasks, and that a clear, long-term
commitment is made to fund annual expenses.
This may best be accomplished by establishing an
endowment that receives regular sponsorship from
the business community and invested neighborhoods
surrounding Riverside Park.

welcoming White River.

ACTIONS & STRATEGIES
GREATER VISION
The question occurs, how did this gateway memorial,
meant to record Thomas Taggart’s public legacy and
inspire future generations, get so pushed aside and
abandoned in less than 50 years? How, after the basic
physical repairs are completed, will people embrace
this monument any more than in past years? Why
would they come or even linger?
George Kessler grasped a basic truth that parks serve
many diverse, outdoor recreational needs. Far more
than accommodating those needs, the heart of
this broad regional park lies in its orchestration of a
dramatic interplay of river, water access, monumental
structures, a pageant of sculpture and the motion of
people moving in and out of the park boundaries.
This was the vision Kessler, and later the business
and political friends of Taggart, brought before the
Park Commissioners, the creation of a unique and
signature entry and destination to Riverside.
Unfortunately, Kessler resigned as landscape
architect to the Park Commission in 1915 and
what followed was a series of unfortunate events.
That grand vision was flood engineered, critical
design elements were deleted, roadway structures
were simplified and worse, improperly located,
monumental gateway architecture was later shoehorned into that awkward site. Under-funding during
construction compromised some structural aspects
of the foundation and the inevitable deterioration
has been accelerated by the effects of long-term
deferred maintenance. The memorial gateway has
fallen in danger of becoming irrelevant. It is no way
to build a legacy.

The future of the Taggart Memorial depends on
becoming the recognized heart and gateway
to Riverside Park, exhilarating in its openness
and accessibility to the river and the surrounding
landscape.
A renaissance reinvigorating the Memorial goes
way beyond repairing stone and mortar, it requires
a bold re-visioning of how vehicles and pedestrians
approach, circulate and access this gateway, whether
from Burdsal Parkway, White River Parkway and Trail,
Riverside Drive, South Grove Golf Course or the ball
fields and pool. Just as important to the increased
awareness and appreciation of the Taggart Memorial
are the views and visual connection people make
with the Memorial from the Municipal Gardens, the
former VA Hospital and Coffin Golf Course across
the White River. This can only be accomplished with
a broad, holistic vision that seriously questions many
past decisions and current conditions surrounding
the Memorial. History cannot be regarded slavishly,
rather it must be regarded as an inspirational
beginning to a greater vision.
Realizing this achievable potential for the Memorial
will require not only adequate construction and
maintenance funding, but the ardent cooperation of
many federal, state, and local governmental agencies
in conjunction with the broad community of citizens
that enjoy the Riverside everyday. Remember our
actions today will determine the fate of a resplendent
Memorial for tomorrow’s generations. With this
greater vision, maybe the Memorial will finally gain
respect and become a beloved landmark whose
charm encourages people to linger and note the
Taggart legacy.

C OST FORECAST
Projecting costs early in the scoping phase is
subject to a certain degree of uncertainty. Yet it is
important that decision-makers have a good sense
of the magnitude of costs before preparing grant
applications, or seeking sponsors from the private
sector, in conjunction with allocating state or local
funds.
The following opinion of probable cost was completed
based on an inspection and evaluation of the
memorial completed by Jacobs Pannicke Architects,
Inc. and our sub-consultants; Lawson Elser, Inc. and
NINebark, Inc.
In providing an opinion of probable cost, it is recognized
that neither the Owner nor the Consultants have
control over the costs of labor, equipment, materials,
or even the Contractor’s methods of determining
process for bidding. This opinion of probable costs
is based on the Consultants reasonable professional
experience and judgment and does not constitute a
warranty, expressed or implied, that the Contractor’s
bids or the negotiated price of the work will not vary
from the Owner’s budget or from any opinion of
probable cost. All costs are in 2005 dollars, which
will inflate in probable cost if the proposed work is
pushed off into the future.

Plant List Introduction
Native plant species are recommended over exotic foreign species because they
are well adapted to local climate conditions. This will result in less replacement and
maintenance, while supporting the local ecology.
The list is intended as a guide for general planting purposes and planning
considerations. Knowledgeable landscape designers and nursery suppliers may
provide additional information for considering specific conditions for successful plant
establishment and accounting for the variable nature of stormwater hydrology. Because
individual plants often have unique growing requirements difficult to convey in a
general listing, it will be necessary to research specific information on the plant species
proposed in order to ensure successful plant establishment.
Chapter 100 of the municipal code of the city of Fort Wayne references the most up
to date prohibited species list. Table 5.3.1 is divided into two sections: the “A” list and
the “B” list. The “A” list exclusively identifies native plants that are best adapted to the
climate in Fort Wayne, perform strongest in stormwater management applications,
and are known to be commercially available. The “B” list identifies plants that are both
native and non-native, have a more limited application in stormwater management and
may have limited availability. The lists are organized by Type and Scientific Name.
Additional information given for each species includes: Common name, Soil Moisture
Tolerances, Soil Type, Salt Tolerance, Sun Exposure, Mature Plant Height, Mature
Plant Width, Bloom Period, Flower Color (image), and Notes to provide guidance for
application and selection. For example, some trees are well suited to landscaped
areas that will receive storm water runoff, while others may not tolerate the additional
moisture.
* Photos have been provided by Earth Source, INC., Missouri Botanical Garden Plant Finder and John Hilty

The following table identifies the range of soil moisture tolerances, indicated by shaded
boxes in the plant list.

Soil Type
This column identifies the range of soil types each plant will tolerate. Where
applicable, more specific soil limitations are provided in the Notes column.
Loam is a rich, fertile soil type (texture) consisting of a balanced mixture of sand, silt
and clay. Typically, loam contains about 40% sand, 40% silt, and 20% clay.
Sand is a component of soil comprised of coarse granules of inert matter. A sandy soil
is porous and allows air to reach a plant’s root zone, however it does not hold much
water or nutrients.
Clay is another component of soil and is comprised of extremely fine particles of a
crystalline material which allow little air or water to pass through. Clay shrinks when it
dries out and expands when it gets wet.

Sun Exposure
The light requirements for each species are listed as ranges between full shade and
full sun. At the bottom of the range – full shade – plants thrive in conditions where
they receive filtered, or dappled, light for the entire day (such as under an oak tree).
In the middle of the range are plants that grow best in part shade, where they are in
full shade for 2-3 hours during midday. Plants that require full sun should be sited
so that they receive 5 or more hours of direct sun during the growing season. Some
plants requiring full sun may still do well in a part shade environment, depending on
the quality and duration of the light the plants receive when they are not in the shade.

This column provides the approximate mature height of plant species in its native
habitat. Native plants can grow much taller if fertilized. Alternatively, the sizes may be
reduced in the urban environment where light, space, and other factors may not be as
readily available as in a forest or field setting. However, by providing as much space
as possible for a plant to grow and by choosing appropriate species for a planting
area, improved – if not optimal – growing conditions can be achieved. For example, a
tree planted in a sidewalk pit measuring 4 feet x 4 feet may only reach half its mature
height, while a tree planted in a 4 foot wide ‘trough’ style planting bed will grow taller
and live longer, because it will have greater access to air and water.
Bloom Period This column indicates the month(s) in which the plant is flowering.

Appendix A: USI Pigeon Creek Greenway Usage Study

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

INTRODUCTION

USI students counted 4,353 Greenway users and administered 282 surveys during the seven-day
period running from Monday, September 24 to Sunday, September 30, 2012. The counts and
surveys were taken at three intercept points along the Pigeon Creek Greenway: The Pagoda
Trailhead, the Shirley James Memorial Gateway Plaza, and the Garvin Park Trailhead. As in
2006, the Riverfront section of the Greenway is the most used segment with over 2,500 users
during the week-long study. Other key findings from the study are listed below.

The Pigeon Creek Greenway Passage is a recreational walking, jogging, and cycling trail located
in Evansville, Indiana. The trail starts at Sunrise Park in downtown Evansville, extending
northwest along the Ohio River. At the Shirley James Memorial Gateway, the Greenway follows
Pigeon Creek north before crossing Fulton Avenue near Cedar Hall Community School. The
Greenway follows the creek south and east to Garvin Park, and then runs northeast before
terminating at the Heidelbach Canoe Launch. At the time this study was conducted, construction
on Phase 4 was under construction; this phase ultimately connected the two “ends” of the
Greenway with a link between Louisiana and Dresden Streets, creating a 6.75 mile stretch of
trail. Future plans include combining the Greenway with new urban bike lanes to create a loop
from the Heidelbach Canoe Launch to downtown Evansville.



From 2006 to 2012, the number of Greenway users increased approximately 51 percent at the
Pagoda and Garvin Park Trailheads. When analyzed separately, the Riverfront section of the
trail experienced a 33 percent increase in usage while Garvin Park experienced a 138 percent
increase.



In 2012, the census counts demonstrated that there was a “gender gap” in Greenway Users at
both the Garvin Park and Shirley James Memorial intercept points. At both locations, only 44
percent of the users were women. This phenomenon did not occur at the Pagoda intercept
point where women made up almost half (approximately 49 percent) of the users. It should
be noted, however, that the “gender gap” has narrowed at the Garvin Park intercept point; in
2006, almost three-quarters (72 percent) of the users at this location were men.



Based on the census counts, the most popular Greenway activity for both “ends” of the trail
was walking (51 percent of users), followed by cycling (23 percent of users) and running (21
percent of users). Data from the user intercept surveys also shows that walking (58 percent of
respondents) was the most popular activity, followed by cycling (28 percent of respondents)
and running (12 percent of respondents). In the middle of the trail, cycling was the most
popular activity (45 percent of users counted at the Shirley James intercept point).



Approximately 70 percent of survey respondents indicated that they used the trail at least
once per week, with 46 percent of survey respondents using the trail three or more times per
week. Once on the trail, 44 percent of survey respondents will use the trail for 60 or more
minutes and 22 percent will use the trail for 50 minutes to an hour.



Overall, approximately 96 percent of survey respondents felt “very safe” or “somewhat safe”
when using the Greenway. More male respondents (68 percent) said they felt “very safe” on
the trail when compared to female respondents (46 percent).



Close to 100 percent of survey respondents stated that they were “very satisfied” or
“somewhat satisfied” with the Greenway.



When asked about improvements to the trail, the common themes included: more safety
features such as better lighting, cameras and increased patrols by policy officers; the addition
of water fountains and public restrooms; less trash and vandalism; extending the trail;
improving maintenance of the trail; making the trail wider; and improving the smell.

Currently, the Greenway includes three sections: the Riverfront Corridor, the Industrial Corridor,
and the Middle Levee Corridor. The Riverfront Corridor extends for 1.5 miles from Sunrise
Park to Casino Aztar. The corridor passes by the Evansville Museum of Art, History and
Science, the Pagoda, the Convention and Visitor Bureau, the Four Freedoms Monument and
Dress Plaza. Trailheads are located at Sunrise and Sunset Parks, the Evansville Museum, and the
Evansville Pagoda. The Industrial Corridor extends 3.5 miles from Casino Aztar to the Middle
Levee Corridor. Located along this corridor are the Shirley James Memorial Gateway Plaza and
the Lamasco Skate Park. In addition, a spur of the trail leads to the Marchand Bridge Overlook
which is located at the mouth of Pigeon Creek. The Middle Levee Corridor extends 1.7 miles
from the Industrial Corridor to the Heidelbach Canoe Launch. The Middle Levee Corridor
includes the Uhlhorn Trailhead. The corridor passes by Kleymeyer Park and passes through
Garvin Park. The Middle Levee Corridor was the first trail constructed by the City of
Evansville.1
In June 2004, the Pigeon Creek Greenway Passage was designated a National Recreation Trail
by the National Parks Service. This award designates the Greenway as a component of a larger
national trail system that stretches across the United States. Portions of the Greenway are also
included as a part of the Upgrade Now campaign’s Walk EVV Map.2

STUDY PURPOSE AND METHODS
Scope. In 2006, the Evansville Parks Department commissioned a study through the
Center for Applied Research at the University of Southern Indiana to quantify the number of
users on the Pigeon Creek Greenway Passage and gain user perspectives through intercept
surveys. The Parks Department asked for a replication study in 2012 to update its data regarding
usage and user perceptions. The 2012 study was conducted in a similar fashion to the 2006 study,
with a two minor modifications: (1) the inclusion of an additional intercept point; and (2)
additional survey questions pertaining to some of the new features on the trail such as signage,
the Shirley James Gateway Memorial, and the Marchand Bridge.
Study Methods. The 2012 Pigeon Creek Greenway Usage Project used a combination of
two methods to obtain quantitative data about the use of trails: manual counts and user intercept
surveys. Teams of two to three trained students were placed at three intercept points along the
Greenway: the Pagoda Trailhead, the Shirley James Gateway Memorial Plaza, and the Garvin
Park Trailhead. [See Map 1] The students received specialized training from the two lead
researchers (Dr. Glenna Bower and Dr. Mary Hallock Morris) and participated in a
professionalization seminar conducted by USI’s Center for Applied Research. The student data
collectors were also required to complete the Collaborative Institution Training Initiative (CITI)
before participating in the project.
The data was collected during a seven-day period running from Monday, September 24 to
Sunday, September 30, 2012. The data was collected using the following methods:

2012 PIGEON CREEK GREENWAY USAGE STUDY

Page 6



Manual Counting Forms were utilized to record the number of trail users at 60 minute
intervals. The counting forms also allowed data collectors to note the user’s activity and
gender. The counts took place from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. in most locations; due to safety
considerations, the counts at the Shirley James Memorial Gateway ended at dusk. A
copy of the counting form can be found in Appendix C.



User Intercept Surveys consisting of 19 questions (and additional follow up questions)
were used to obtain information about the users’ perceptions of the Greenway. The
student data collectors were asked to survey every fifth adult who passed by their
intercept point. If the fifth adult declined to participate, then the data collector asked the
next user to participate. Once a user completed the survey, the count would reset.

Table 1 utilizes the Preliminary Local Climatological Data for the Evansville area to illustrate the effects
of weather conditions during the study period. In 2006, weather conditions may have suppressed the
number of Greenway users; as noted in the report from that year3, four out of the seven coldest days and
three out of four of the windiest days in the month of October occurred during the study period. In 2012,
at the request of the contracting agency, the study was conducted during the last week of September
which was the week prior to the Westside Nut Club Fall Festival. The weather during this time period was
ten to 20 degrees warmer than during the 2006 study. It should be noted that a severe thunderstorm that
came through Evansville on the evening of Wednesday, September 26; however, this did not appear to
have a significant impact on the census counts.

USI students counted 4,353 Greenway users over a seven-day period running from Monday,
September 24, to Sunday, September 30, 2012. User counts were taken at three intercept points
along the Pigeon Creek Greenway: the Pagoda Trailhead (2,504 users), the Shirley James
Memorial Gateway Plaza (958 users), and the Garvin Park Trailhead (891 users).
Comparative Data, 2006 and 2012. In 2006, trail counts were conducted on the
Riverfront and at the Garvin Park trailhead. The total number of Greenway users for these two
locations was 2,254. In 2012, the total number of Greenway users for these two locations was
3,395. The increase in users for these two locations was 1,141 people – an increase of 50.6
percent. The Riverfront trail experienced a 33 percent increase in users (i.e., 620 people) from
2006 to 2012 while the Garvin Park area saw an increase of 138 percent (i.e., 517 users).

In 2012, the census counts ended at 6 p.m. due to a severe storm warning.

Between 2006 and 2012, there was a slight change in the ratio of male to female Greenway
users. In 2006, 43 percent of Greenway users (n = 980) were female; in 2012, this has increased
to 47 percent (n = 1,610). Male users made up 57 percent (n = 1,274) of the Greenway users in
2006; in 2012, male users (n = 1,785) accounted for 53 percent of the total census counts.

In 2006, there was a large “gender gap” among Greenway users at the Garvin Park trailhead.
During this baseline study, 72 percent of the users (n = 269) were male and 28 percent of the
users were female (n = 105). This gap has started to close: in 2012, the ratio of male to female
users at the Garvin Park trailhead was 56 percent to 44 percent. It should be noted that the
disparity between male and female users is not as defined along the Riverfront section of the
Greenway. In 2006, 53 percent of the users were male (n = 1,005) and 47 percent of the users
were female (n = 875). In 2012, the difference was smaller: 51 percent of the users were male
and 49 percent of the users were female. [See Table 3]

Table 4 summarizes the Greenway users’ activities for 2006 and 2012 along the Riverfront and
at the Garvin Park Trailhead. The percentage of walkers decreased from 76 percent in 2006 to
51 percent in 2012 while the percentage of runners and joggers increased from 10 percent in
2006 to 21 percent in 2012. These percentages may be influenced by the fact that Half-Marathon
training runs were being held on the Greenway during the 2012 census counts. Furthermore, the
percentage of cyclists increased from 12 percent in 2006 to 23 percent in 2012. The number of
cyclists should continue to grow as the Greenway is now completed from Sunrise Park in
downtown Evansville to the Heidelbach Trailhead located northeast of Garvin Park.

users during the week and 964 users on the weekend. The highest hourly count occurred from 8 –
9 a.m. on Saturday, September 29 when 355 users were counted at the Pagoda and Garvin Park
Trailheads. Peak usage during the week occurred between noon – 1 p.m.; on the weekends, peak
usage is in the mornings between 8 – 9 a.m.
The Shirley James Gateway, 2012. USI students also conducted census counts at the
Shirley James Gateway Memorial; the census counts for this location are incomplete due to
safety and security concerns. [See Appendix B] During the study period, the students counted
958 Greenway users at this location. As shown in Table 5, there is a “gender gap” in the users
counted at this location which is similar to the one that occurred at the Garvin Park Trailhead.
Fifty-six (56) percent of the users at this location were male and 44 percent were female.

portion of the Greenway. Almost 45 percent of the individuals (n = 426) counted at the Memorial
were cyclists. Walking was the second most popular activity, making up almost 39 percent of the
census count, followed by running at approximately 13 percent.
Although the census count for the Shirley James intercept site is not as complete as the counts
for the Pagoda and Garvin Park sites, we can state that the traffic through the Gateway is higher
on the weekends than during the week. Although the peak hour of traffic was on Thursday from
6-7 p.m. (159 users), this was due to a training run for the Half-Marathon. The second, third, and
fourth highest hours of usage all occurred during the weekend: Sunday from 4-5 p.m. (50 users),
Sunday from 2-3 p.m. (45 users), and Saturday from 10-11 a.m. (40 users). The lowest counts
occurred during from 7-8 a.m. (mean = 5.25 users) and from 9-10 a.m. (mean = 6.4 users).

THE USER INTERCEPT SURVEY
USI students collected 282 surveys from Greenway users over a seven-day period running from
Monday, September 24, to Sunday, September 30, 2012. The surveys were administered at three
locations along the Greenway: the Pagoda Trailhead, the Shirley James Gateway Plaza, and the
Garvin Park Trailhead.
Demographics. Of the respondents who indicated their gender on the survey (n = 265),
151 (57 percent) were male and 114 (43 percent) were female. The racial composition of the
sample was 91.9 percent Caucasian, 6.3 percent African-American, and 1.1 percent
Latino/Latina. Less than 1 percent of the respondents indicated that they were Native American
(1 respondent) or of Indian descent (1 respondent). The ages of the survey’s respondents ranged
from 13 to 87 years old with a mean of 46.8 years and a median age of 49 years.

The majority of survey respondents (95.2 percent) have earned at least a high school diploma.
Close to half of respondents (49.6 percent) hold a bachelor’s or graduate degree. Almost twothirds of the respondents (63.7 percent) were employed at the time the survey was administered.
Another 23 percent indicated that they were retired and 4.8 percent indicated that they were
currently students. The median family income for the survey respondents was between $50,000
and $59,999 for the 2011 calendar year.

Trail Usage. Eighty-four (84) percent of the survey respondents had used the Greenway
before, with only 45 individuals (16 percent) indicating that this was their first time using the
trail. Of the respondents, only five people indicated that they would not be using the trail again.
More than half of the respondents (55 percent) used the trail alone, with 34 percent using the trail
in pairs and 11 percent using the trail in groups of three or more people.

Chart 2. Respondents’ Originating Location

Most respondents (56.1 percent) will spend an hour or less on the Greenway during a single visit:
1.4 percent of respondents spend 10 to 20 minutes on the trail; 10.1 percent spend 21 to 30
minutes; 12.9 percent spend 31 to 40 minutes; 9.4 percent spend 41 to 50 minutes; and 22.3
percent spend 51 to 60 minutes. Interestingly, 43.9 percent of respondents report that they spend
more than an hour on the Greenway during a single visit; this was the mode for our dataset.
Chart 4. Time Spend on Greenway during a Single Visit

Close to 70 percent of survey respondents use the trail at least once per week, with 46.2 percent
of individuals using the trail three or more times per week. Another 15.1 percent of respondents
use the trail two to three times per month, with 15.5 percent of respondents indicating that they
use the Greenway once a month or less.
Chart 3. How Often Respondents Use the Greenway
The survey respondents were given the opportunity to list the types of activities they usually
participated in when using the Greenway. Walking was the activity most often cited by the
respondents (71.6 percent), followed by cycling (37.9 percent) and jogging/running (20.9
percent). Seven respondents listed other activities such as skateboarding and roller blading.

Survey respondents were then asked to select the activity that they did most often when on the
Greenway. Again, walking was selected as the most popular activity (57.4 percent), followed by
cycling (28.1 percent), and jogging/running (12.3 percent). Only 2.1 percent of the respondents
selected some other activity. It should be noted that cyclists may be underrepresented in this
sample as the majority of survey respondents were traveling by foot on the Greenway.
Chart 5. Activity Done Most Often on Greenway

When asked, 50.4 percent of respondents indicated that they had been to the Marchand Bridge
overlook and 42.5 percent had been to the Shirley James Memorial.
Those individuals who indicated that they had been to the landmarks were asked to list what they
liked about the landmark and what could be improved about the landmark. Individuals who had
been to the Marchand Bridge stated: (1) they enjoyed the view; (2) they liked the history signs;
(3) they liked the color of the bridge; and (4) they found it relaxing. They asked for the following
improvements: (1) more benches; (2) better lighting; (3) trash pickups along the river; (4)
improving the smell in the area; and (5) more security patrols, with a particular focus on
removing drug dealers. Individuals who had been to the Shirley James Memorial stated: (1)
they liked the history; and (2) that they found the architecture/artwork to be aesthetically
pleasing. They also liked the fact that the memorial replaced a former scrap yard. The
respondents suggested the following improvements: (1) installing public restrooms and a water
fountain; (2) adding more picnic tables; (3) adding more plants and flowers; (4) better lighting;
and (5) more police patrols to improve safety in the area. Respondents also stated more generally
that the landscaping needs to be maintained at the site.

Survey respondents were also asked about the signage along the Greenway Passage, with 94.1
percent of individuals indicating that they were “very satisfied” (62.3 percent) or “somewhat
satisfied” (31.9 percent) with the signs. In an open-ended follow up question, respondents were
given the opportunity to elaborate on why they were not satisfied with the signage. Their
comments provided three useful suggestions: (1) add mile markers to the trail; (2) add directional
signs to the trail; and (3) make the signs easier to read. Some people noted that the Upgrade signs
should be translated from steps to miles.

Safety Issues. Overall, 95.7 percent of survey respondents stated that they felt “very safe”
(59.2 percent) or “somewhat safe” (36.5 percent) when using the Greenway. Only 12 people
answered “not very safe” or “not safe at all.” When analyzing the data, the researchers found
difference between male and female respondents on the issue of safety. Female respondents were
less likely than male respondents to state that they felt “very safe” when using the Greenway,
compared to 67.8 percent of male respondents.

In an open-ended follow-up question, survey respondents who stated that they felt unsafe when
using the trail were asked to describe the reasons for their concern. Respondents who answered
the survey at the Shirley James Gateway listed three reasons: (1) the presence of homeless
people under the bridges; (2) people using drugs in the area; and (3) some uncertainly about
safety in some of the more remote areas of the Greenway. Individuals who answered the survey
in Garvin Park also listed three reasons: (1) the presence of “unsafe people” and crime in the
area; (2) the lack of a police presence in the area; and (3) the lack of other people on the trail. It
should be noted that safety issues did not seem to be a concern for respondents who answered the
survey at the Pagoda trailhead.
Overall Satisfaction Levels. Close to 100 percent of the survey’s respondents (98.9
percent) indicated that they were “very satisfied” (73.7 percent) or “somewhat satisfied” (25.2
percent) with the Pigeon Creek Greenway Passage. Only three people (1.1 percent) responded
that they were “not very satisfied” with the trail and no one indicated that they were “not
satisfied at all.”


Chart 9. Respondents’ Satisfaction Levels

the Garvin Park Trailhead included: (1) a need to repair the asphalt on the trail and (2) better
landscaping at the trailhead.6
Survey respondents were also asked to list what changes or improvements they would like to see
along the entire Greenway. Common themes included: (1) more safety features such as better
lighting, cameras, and increased patrols by police officers; (2) the addition of water fountains and
public restrooms along the Greenway; (3) less trash and vandalism along the trail; (4) finishing
and/or extending the trail; (5) improving maintenance of the trail; (6) making the trail wider by
adding a lane for cyclists; and (7) improving the smell. Additional comments included: adding
bicycle rental stations; having entertainment (i.e., music, bands) on the Greenway, and having
more animals such as ducks to feed.

Finally, survey respondents were asked where the next “link” of the Greenway should be built.
The responses can be summarized into three categories: (1) east towards Angel Mounds, Marina
Pointe, and Newburgh; (2) west towards the Burdette Park/USI; and (3) north towards the
Stringtown Road area. Additional respondents stated that the connection between Lamasco and
Garvin Park needed to be completed and that the Greenway should loop around the City of
Evansville.

Survey respondents were given the opportunity to discuss issues that affected their satisfaction
levels. Prevalent concerns among respondents who answered the survey at the Pagoda
Trailhead and/or the Shirley James Gateway included: (1) the need for bathrooms, trash cans,
and water fountains; (2) the need to keep motorized vehicles off the Greenway; (3) the length of
the trail; and (4) animal excrement along the trail. There was also some concern that the bicycles
went “too fast” on the trail. Prevalent concerns among respondents who answered the survey at

One individual listed several concerns: (1) the need for water fountains; (2) bigger playgrounds; (3) dogs
using the bathroom on the trail; and (4) the need to finish construction of the trail.

RECOMMENDATIONS

Appendices

Throughout the Pigeon Creek Greenway Usage Study of the Pagoda Trailhead, the Shirley James
Memorial Gateway Plaza, and the Garvin Park Trailhead, users provided valuable insight on
ways to enhance and improve on three inceptor areas. It is recommended,

x

To have additional safety features added to the trail including improved lighting, cameras
and increased police patrols. Safety issues were of most concern in the Shirley James
Memorial area due to the presence of “unsafe people,” which may include the homeless,
and crime in the area.

x

To install public restrooms and water fountains along all parts of the Pigeon Creek
Greenway.

x

To be less trash and vandalism along the Pigeon Creek Greenway. It is recommended the
Pigeon Creek Greenway passage to add additional trash receptacles on the trail and to
have a plan to pick-up trash on a consistent basis (including along the Ohio River). In
addition, there needs to be a plan to fix items that have been vandalized on the trail in a
timely manner.

x

To develop and implement a maintenance plan to repair the Pigeon Creek Greenway
Passage. There are several areas of the trail at Garvin Park that are in need of repair.

x

To provide more picnic tables, benches, and landscaping to many areas of the Pigeon
Creek Greenway passage.

x

To minimize the smell of the Pigeon Creek Greenway Passage.

x

To finish the construction of the Pigeon Creek Greenway Passage between Lamasco Park
and Garvin Park.

x

To extend the Pigeon Creek Greenway passage with individuals identifying (1) east
towards Angel Mounds, Marina Pointe, and Newburg; (2) west towards the Burdette
Park/USI; and (3) north towards the Stringtown Road area.

Executive Summary
This report documents the outcomes of an Opportunity and Innovation Workshop held by
the City of Indianapolis Office of Sustainability in conjunction with Rocky Mountain
Institute® (RMI) on June 9-10th of 2009. The intent of the workshop was to analyze the
potential retrofit of the Indianapolis City-County Building (CCB), including clarification of
an overarching goal. More than thirty regional professionals with a variety of expertise
attended the workshop. In addition to documenting the outcomes of the workshop, this
report includes recommendations for next steps and priorities.
The building was constructed in 1962, an era when energy was perceived as abundant and
glazing technology was in its infancy. Despite that, the Indianapolis/Marion County
Building Authority has operated the building as efficiently as possible - reducing energy
use to 80% of the national average for a building of this age and size. This remains,
however, 63% higher than the average energy use of a LEED certified office building.
The following table shows the current status of energy and water use intensity, potential
reduction identified during the workshop, and annual cost savings if those reductions are
realized. This report outlines recommendations and strategies for achieving these
reductions.

**While elimination of steam may be possible, a further cost-benefit analysis is
required to determine optimal level of steam reduction.
With this level of potential annual savings, a building retrofit budget can be established
based on the desired payback period. Many municipalities and universities allow 10-15
year payback periods, with some reaching for 20 years. This long-term approach for
public buildings is critical to the success of the project, and can allow for a total project
budget of $6.7M-$13.5M, plus federal and state funding for municipal energy efficiency
projects and future capital funding already slated for mechanical system upgrades.
Many potential strategies can contribute to these savings, and the workshop group
identified some during a brainstorming exercise called the Dashboard. A compilation of
the three breakout groups’ dashboards can be found in the appendix of this report for
consideration during Master Planning. The possibilities are comprehensive and largely
realistic.
In order to map a path to the most impactful retrofit work, the participants of the workshop
identified priorities for implementation as outlined on the following page.

Opportunities and Innovation in Indianapolis: The Greening of the City-County Building

Introduction
On June 9-10, 2009 the Indianapolis Office of Sustainability brought together more than
30 regional professionals for an Opportunity and Innovation Workshop led by Rocky
Mountain Institute® to analyze the potential retrofit of the Indianapolis City-County
Building. In the fashion of Greening of the White House1, an intensive working session
ensued that resulted in goals, strategies, and clear next steps. Early on in the workshop it
was established that the goal for the retrofit was not simply to renovate the building to
become more resource efficient or to manage a certain amount of stormwater. Although
these are valuable goals in and of themselves, there emerged an overarching goal of the
retrofit: to make Indianapolis a national forerunner in sustainability.
In order to produce robust
energy and resource efficiency, a
good
business
case,
and
ultimately the goal of the
participants, it is vital to use a
whole systems design process.
In
whole
systems
design,
decisions are based on a variety
of factors ranging from benefits
(e.g., energy reduction, cost
reduction,
LEED
points,
aesthetics, comfort), to upstream
and downstream impacts on
other building systems and
infrastructure (e.g., more efficient
server equipment reduce need
for chiller capacity), to the

goals.

This report provides the framework for developing and implementing a CCB
Comprehensive Master Plan for a whole systems design process. In addition to describing
the various work groups required to produce this plan, the report also denotes which
aspects can be funded immediately, which can be implemented with existing funds, and
which elements will require capital funding. A Core team will be primarily responsible for
coordinating and implementing the CCB Master Plan. The Core team includes: Kären
Haley and Allyson Pumphrey; Ron Reinking (Facility operation); and support staff.

Opportunities and Innovation in Indianapolis: The Greening of the City-County Building

With regard to green buildings, a city government can put its city on a path of
sustainability in three major ways:
• Regulate or incentivize green building through codes and/or incentives.
• Directly increase the number of green buildings in a city by renovating the
ones it owns and occupies. The impact of this strategy is of course limited to
the number of public buildings in the city.
• Raise awareness of the benefits of green building. In many communities the
public sector has constructed the first local green building, providing tenants
and developers their first close-up exposure to green buildings.
Clearly, a combination of all three is needed to achieve big impact.
The participants recognized the third strategy as being the major opportunity in the CCB
retrofit. They were convinced of the potential impact of a green building everyone can
access, which would be the first green public building in Indianapolis. They also believed
that demonstrating a good business case with a local green building such as the CCB sends
a powerful message and demonstrates fiscal responsibility within the local government.
Their strategy is in line with that of the Greening of the White House. In former President
Bill Clinton’s Earth Day Address of 1993, he stated his intention “to make the White House
a model for other federal agencies, for state and local governments, for business, and for
families in their homes.” It is also similar to that of the owner of the recently designed-forretrofit Empire State Building (ESB), Tony Malkin, who stated:
“The goal with ESB has been to define intelligent choices which will either save
money, spend the same money more efficiently, or spend additional sums for
which there is reasonable payback through savings. Addressing these investments
correctly will create a competitive advantage for ownership through lower costs
and better work environment for tenants. Succeeding in these efforts will make a
replicable model for others to follow.”

Workshop Insights
The following items detail the major outcomes of the charrette and RMI’s
recommendations for approaching the CCB retrofit project.

Vision for the Indianapolis City-County Building
The building will be a flagship to demonstrate the business case and personnel benefits of
a green building retrofit, thereby catalyzing building retrofits around the city to help make
Indianapolis one of the most sustainable cities in the nation.
Objectives in addition to creating this vision:
‐ Prove the business case for resource efficiency
‐ Be fiscally and environmentally accountable to taxpayers
‐ The CCB becomes a source of pride
‐ Occupants are empowered to help make the building and operations radically
resource efficient

Implementation Strategy
RMI recommends that the City, in conjunction with facility operation administrators,
implement the following tasks with available funds in the fourth quarter of 2009. Potential
further funding is addressed in the Major Opportunities section of this report.
The Core Team will be primarily responsible for coordinating and implementing the CCB
Master Plan. The Core team includes:
The Indianapolis Office of Sustainability: Kären Haley and Allyson Pumphrey
Building Authority: Ron Reinking and key Facility Operations Staff
Key Personnel from Office of Finance and Management

Representatives from the Indianapolis/Marion County Building Authority discuss
building features with workshop participants during the comprehensive workshop.

1. ESTABLISH WORK GROUPS TO CREATE A CCB MASTER PLAN
Responsibility: Core Team
Intent: Commit to greening the CCB and understand the steps involved in this process.
Deliverable: A document to identify integrated work groups on 1) Energy, Water, &
Transportation; 2) Indoor Air Quality, Recycling, & Occupant Satisfaction; 3) Financing; 4)
Outreach; and 5) LEED EB O&M / Energy Star. For each work group, the staff and financial
resources allocated should be specified.
Description: A CCB Master Plan was identified during the workshop as key to the success
of this project. RMI recommends that different work groups create the master plan over the
next several months. Some groups will end before others. For instance, the Energy, Water,
& Transportation work group will need five to seven months to complete, while Indoor Air
Quality, Recycling, & Occupant Satisfaction could take only a few weeks or less. As
indicated in Table 2, these work groups should be funded as soon as possible. Key
elements, outcomes, and estimated timelines for these work groups are provided in
Sustainability Work groups.
2. CREATE COMPREHENSIVE CCB MASTER PLAN
Responsibility: Core Team
Intent: Create long-term, phased plan for the CCB to include energy retrofit and associated
opportunity for resource efficiencies and space allocation.
Deliverable: A living document that is update-able by members of work groups. Specifies
status of implementation for each aspect of plan.
Description: This would be the central document that identifies goals, work plans,
available funding, and implementation status. The work groups identified above would
contribute to the Master Plan.

* Note that if the City were to sign a project development agreement (PDA) with an energy service company
(ESCO) toward considering an energy service performance contract (ESPC), the cost of the IGA would
essentially be rolled into the ESPC, if signed. In effect, the IGA cost would be shifted to implementation.

3. EARLY IMPLEMENTATION OF MASTER PLAN
Responsibility: Core Team
Intent: Leverage available funds to maximize visibility and overall success of project.
Deliverable: A phased timeline to denote what aspects of the Master Plan shall be
implemented before all categories of the master plan are completed.
Description: This task was created to account for the fact that the Energy, Water, &
Transportation work group cannot be completed until months after the other work groups
have contributed their portion to the CCB Master Plan and that more immediate
implementation of these portions would positively contribute to the momentum, visibility,
and overall success of the project.
• Financing
• Outreach
• Air Quality, Recycling, & Occupant Behavior
• LEED EB O&M / Energy Star Analysis
• Green Cleaning

Major Barriers
The identification of barriers to achieving a vision typically calls out opportunities for
success. The workshop participants identified the following major barriers. The work
groups should address these while developing the CCB Master Plan. More than one work
group can and should address the same barrier.
Financing is to be determined
The CCB retrofit presents the city-county with the opportunity to save money over an
extended amount of time, in addition to meeting the overall goal of broader impact in
Indianapolis. Like any investment, this requires an upfront cost to develop and implement
the CCB Master Plan. The exact source of funding for this project is yet to be determined.
Lack of continuity
The implementation of the CCB Master Plan may span across two or more city
administrations. When administrations transfer, existing projects and plans are oftentimes
derailed.
City and County departments are siloed
Like most large organizations, there exist sub-groups in the city-county administration that
are oftentimes unaware of what the other is doing. It is possible for one group to create an
agenda that conflicts with the agenda of another.
Building must remain occupied
It is far easier and usually least expensive when a building can be empty for a major
retrofit. In the case of the CCB, it is not possible to relocate all the occupants. The retrofit
will need to occur with minimal occupant distraction.

Opportunities and Innovation in Indianapolis: The Greening of the City-County Building

Major Opportunities
Workshop participants identified the following major opportunities after discussing the
barriers above. Note that not all barriers are addressed by the opportunities listed in this
section and will need to be addressed by the work groups.
Several types of financing are available
Workshop participants proposed several financing opportunities. While no single source
could likely fund the entire project, a combination of opportunities would provide a
significant source of funding. They include:

Contracts
• Energy Services Performance Contract
o Contracted with an Energy Services Company
• Bonds
• Sale/Leaseback
o Buyer purchases building, city leases building back over a certain amount of
time. Ironclad provision that buyer must sell back.
o If a private entity can benefit from more incentives or grants, then this option
may be more cost-effective than a standard loan. Energy efficiency incentives
and historic preservation tax credits could figure significantly into this equation.

Grants and incentives
• Foundation and non-profit sources
• American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA)
• Indiana Office of Energy Development
o Alternative Power and Energy Program
o Feasibility Study program
o Competitive funding
• Guaranteed Energy Savings Program

Partnerships and programs
• Sponsorship programs (e.g., sponsor a green cleaning workshop, buy a brick, etc.)
• Loyalty programs (e.g., sustainable purchasing plan)
• Partnership with University
o Unpaid (or low cost) student internships
Whole-systems, life cycle cost analysis
There is a major opportunity for the Core Team and members of the design team to
demonstrate the best approach to assessing the cost and benefits of the project alternatives
– whole-systems life cycle cost analysis. The traditional approach is to assess one measure
(e.g., renovating the chiller or installing high performance windows) at a time. This is
typically done by estimating the resource savings and cost of a single measure. Some
measures are shown to be more cost-effective (i.e., cost per amount of resource savings)
than others. As the low hanging fruit is used up, only the more “expensive” measures are
left. As indicated in Figure 1 below, eventually a cost-effectiveness limit is reached.

Page 12 of 52

Opportunities and Innovation in Indianapolis: The Greening of the City-County Building

Figure 1. Whole-systems life cycle approach to cost and benefit analysis.
The major problem with this approach is that the interconnections between measures are
not accounted for.2 For instance, installing high performance windows and other energyefficient equipment will reduce peak power demand, even so much that a chiller due for
renovation is no longer needed in the building. The resultant savings can help pay for the
added cost of the windows and other energy-efficient equipment, which can then also
contribute to a more productive workplace with lower personnel costs, as also illustrated
in Figure 1. These exponential benefits are lost if we are too focused on individual
measures.
As an alternative, RMI recommends the CCB team assesses measures not one-by-one, but
in bundles to better consider the interdependency of certain measures. The resource
savings and net present value (i.e., life cycle cost) of each bundle of measures should be
estimated. The team should also consider other value of the bundles, such as increased
office productivity and how well the bundle would support the vision of the CCB project.
RMI has provided an “Integrated Design Process Checklist” in the Appendix to aid the
team in this process, in order to optimize capital and operational cost savings and achieve
the overarching vision for the CCB as a “flagship” building.
Outreach to provide momentum for “Greening of the City-County Building”
It is important to get the entire city of Indianapolis excited about this project as well as the
occupants. For this reason, RMI recommends an entire work group for outreach and

education. Specific opportunities in this regard are presented in the Sustainability Work
Group section of this report, Outreach subsection.
Integrate with clean-tech transportation infrastructure
An RMI-led program, Project Get Ready, has partnered with the Indiana Energy Systems
Network, created by Governor Daniels, which has assembled a world-class team to
commence a demonstration program that will accelerate the market introduction and
penetration of advanced electric drive vehicles (AEDVs) and related technologies in the
Indianapolis area.3 RMI recommends that the Energy, Water, & Transportation work group
explore opportunities with Indiana Energy Systems Network to demonstrate these
technologies at the CCB. In addition, this work group should explore other creative ways
to encourage alternative transportation for commuting occupants and visitors.

Workshop Results
A major portion of the workshop was spent brainstorming specific goals and strategies for
the CCB retrofit via a “dashboard” matrix. The results from sessions on different categories
are highlighted below. The compiled dashboards can be viewed in the appendix of this
report.
The dashboards reveal there are clearly
immediate measures that can begin to
create energy savings with little cost to
the City, such as outreach and
education on the greening of the CCB,
to start an occupant awareness
campaign, and implementing a
comprehensive recycling / green
purchasing policy. Occupant behavior
was identified as a key component of
CCB energy savings efforts.
The most urgent, impactful solutions
discussed during the breakout sessions
were:
a)
Create
long-term
comprehensive master plan for the
building addressing energy and
resource conservation. b) Establish
baselines (e.g., occupant satisfaction
and comfort, GHG emissions, energy
and water, waste, recycling, etc.). c)
Breakout group dashboard under development
Create a “model” open office and
restroom to demonstrate good daylighting, layout, energy and water efficiency in a
desirable workspace.
Discussions on water centered not on how to decrease use, but rather what to do with the
225GPM that is pumped from the lowest level of the parking garage 24/7. This is an
enormous quantity of water to simply send into the storm sewer without using it for
something. As shown in the water dashboard summary, there are a number of
opportunities for reducing potable and well water use and replacing it with pumped water.
The following are highlights of the results of our brainstorming sessions with the three
breakout groups at the workshop:
(Disclaimer: Ideas/Visions featured in this section are from workshop participants. They are
tools for encouraging workshop participants to think long term and out of the box. RMI
recommendations are provided in “Recommended Priorities” for each focus area and in
The Work Group section.)

Page 15 of 52

Opportunities and Innovation in Indianapolis: The Greening of the City-County Building

Energy
Comparison
A helpful way to approach the issue of setting goals with
regard to energy is by referring to the DOE’s Commercial
Building Energy Consumption Surveys (CBECS), which
provide “average” building energy characteristics. According
to Target Finder, a tool provided by the DOE, a building of
similar size, type, climate, and occupancy rate to the CCB
has an energy use intensity of 125 thousand Btu (kBtu) per
sq. ft. The CCB currently uses 5% less energy than this
“average” building4. This is because of the fairly energy
efficient, albeit closely monitored, operation of its dual duct HVAC system - notoriously
energy intensive and has since become a rare design. For a more specific comparison, the
CCB uses 20% less energy than buildings of this size and era.
Despite the CCB already being energy efficient relative to other buildings of that era, there
remains a lot of opportunity to increase efficiency. For example, the Empire State Building,
which operates in the top 30% of buildings its size and type, was able to be retrofitted to
save 38% energy, sending it into the top 10% of buildings (an Energy Star Rating of 90).
For the CCB to reach the top 5% (an Energy Star Rating of at least 95), its energy use would
need to decrease by 50%, or roughly 57 kBtu per sq. ft.5 If the CCB is to become a flagship
green building, an aggressive goal such as this is almost required.
Vision
• Reduce energy use >40% + additional on-site renewable energy (e.g.,
photovoltaics) for total 60-80% energy reduction
• Save $700k - $950k annual energy cost for this building
• Can the building generate more energy than it consumes?
• Utilize nearby bio-based methane energy source - landfill
• Generate 15% on-site renewable energy
• Establish electric vehicle plug-in demonstration on site
Potential Strategies
• Perform ongoing retro-commissioning
• Install occupancy sensors for lighting on private offices, meeting rooms, and
other smaller spaces
• Install LED / bioluminescent exterior lighting
• Seal ductwork
• Reconfigure HVAC for core waste heat recovery – reduce steam
• Decentralize lighting controls – allow occupant control

In fact, according to facility operators, the CCB uses 65-70% less steam than it did as originally
designed to operate.
5 The decrease in energy consumption is based on “source” rather than “site” energy, which explains
why the target energy use intensity is 57 kBtu per sq. ft. and not 50% of 125. For definitions of
source and site energy, please visit the DOE’s Energy Star website.

Water
Comparison
The CCB uses 19.5 gal/sq. ft./yr, and the target range for an
office building falls between 9 and 15 gal/sq. ft./yr. This puts
the CCB at approximately 30% over the mid range for water
consumption in an office building, excluding chiller water.
With no significant water fixture upgrades since construction,
this building is due for fixture replacement. While both chiller
and irrigation currently run off well water, that is potentially
potable and subject to conservation measures due to the loss of aquifer resources.

30% Reduction in potable water use
Zero stormwater discharge
Potable water gets used twice before leaving bldg
Eliminate well water use

Potential Strategies
• Waterless urinals
• Low-flow / dual flush toilets
• Low-flow faucets – hydropower automatics
• Use ground water for heat recovery and flushing toilets
• Re-use dewatering (sump) water
• 225 GPM ground water sump pump to chiller / toilets / irrigation / fountain
• Bioswales – natural stormwater management as landscape feature

•
•

Longer payback for water efficiency
Bad impressions of waterless urinals due to lack of maintenance training
State codes that prohibit use of greywater in toilets
Greywater to toilets hard to retrofit
Sizing/designing bioswale for cumulative water in urban setting

Potential Solutions to Barriers
• Green roof as a plaza (parking underneath)
• Low-flow urinals / toilets
• Replace faucets
• Install rain sensors on the irrigation system
• Convene a downtown building-owners meeting to address urban scale water
table pumping uses.
Recommended Priorities
• Create a Master Plan
• Install cost effective water conserving plumbing fixtures such as low flow
toilets, motion-sensor sinks, etc.

Materials
Comparison
There is currently no municipal policy for
sustainable construction practices during
remodeling projects within the CCB or for
green purchasing or green cleaning. Many
cities participating in the Mayors Climate
Protection Agreement have adopted green
purchasing policies and are requiring LEED
certification for all new buildings and major
renovations, introducing sustainable construction methods by doing so.

Waste
Comparison
The CCB does provide basic recycling services for paper,
cardboard, bottles, and cans, with central locations for the
bins. In comparison, many offices and public buildings have
recycling bins at every desk and in all public waste
receptacle locations. The rule of thumb is to locate both
recycling and landfill at every waste location, with a trend
toward larger recycling containers than landfill.

Occupant / Visitor Behavior
Comparison
Regional attitudes toward environment,
energy efficiency, and conservation vary
greatly throughout the country. Indiana
Business Journal, working with Walker
Information Inc., an Indianapolis firm
specializing in surveying employee
sentiment, conducted a poll this year to
determine
reader
attitudes
about
environmental issues.6 Many readers said
they’re also recycling more, cutting their
use of electricity, bicycling to work,
driving hybrid cars, drinking from
refillable water bottles rather than throwaway plastic, planting their own gardens, or doing
something else to lessen their carbon footprint. The survey shows that many IBJ readers
say they’ve made changes to their lives to be “greener”:
– 77 % said they now pay bills online rather than through the mail.
– 74 % have switched to fluorescent light bulbs and 60 % to reusable shopping bags.
– 41 % strongly agreed that the city should pursue a mass transit system of bus, light
rail, and other options on a broad scale. Of these respondents, 36 % supported
paying more in gas taxes to fund the program.
– Approximately 33% agree recycling should be mandatory, though not as many are
willing to pay extra.
The survey findings seem to confirm what the city is working towards.

Sustainability Work Groups
As specified in Workshop Outcomes, several work groups should occur simultaneously in
order to develop the CCB Master Plan. This section of the report will specify the estimated
time and other key elements of these work groups.

Figure 1. Estimated work group timeline. This represent RMI’s best estimates based on experience with
similar projects. This timeline should be reviewed by the Core team and modified as it sees fit.

Finance
Suggested work group members: Core team, finance consultant
Perhaps the most critical work stream is the one to assess and obtain financing for
proposed projects and programs. As listed in the Major Opportunities section, the core
team can explore a variety of alternative financing options. It is important to realize that
there will likely be more than one solution, and a combination of grants and other funding
opportunities (such as partnership with the local university for intern positions) could offset
a portion of the total capital cost of the project.
The Finance work stream should create a work plan that includes a list of all possible
contacts and possibilities. As the plan is implemented, this list may grow as new
possibilities are uncovered. The core team should reach out to finance experts (for-profit or
pro bono consulting) for help with this work. The preliminary assessment should happen
immediately, while the Phase I assessment should be informed by the results of that phase
of the Energy, Water, & Transportation work stream to provide a better sense for the capital
cost of the project.

Page 26 of 52

Opportunities and Innovation in Indianapolis: The Greening of the City-County Building

Outreach and Education (O&E)
Suggested work group members: Core team, Marketing consultant
The Outreach work group should create a plan to engage taxpayers and city-county
administration, explain the retrofit project, and create public enthusiasm. This plan should
include close interaction with the other work groups in order to maximize the impact of
their efforts in the greater Indianapolis community. For instance, if the Green Cleaning or
Air Quality, Recycling, & Occupant Satisfaction work group plans to conduct a workshop,
the Outreach work group should plan a way to do it in conjunction with the local chapters
of the United States Green Building Council, International Facility Management
Association and others.7 This would generate additional publicity and goodwill for the
project.
After implementation of the retrofit, the verified results (produced by the other work
groups) should be turned into a case study for local businesses and others.
Communication
Communicating the anticipated and measured benefits of the retrofit will influence the
ability of the project to get financed and the extent of the project’s impact in Indianapolis
and the greater region. In addition, an objective of the charrette participants was to make
the retrofit process accountable to taxpayers. Accordingly, this work group should be
responsible for communicating the efforts of the other work groups to the public and
contracting with a marketing consultant to develop a brand for the retrofit project.
Outreach
After resource savings, economic benefit, and other attributes of the project have been
determined by the other work groups, the Outreach and Education work group can begin
their efforts. Activities could include:
• Form a “speakers bureau” consisting of workshop participants who present on the
retrofit project at town hall meetings and other events in Indiana;
• Develop a slideshow presentation for the speakers bureau;
• Write a newsletter to keep public updated on implementation progress; and
• Create a brochure that can be distributed within the CCB and other venues.

Air Quality, Recycling, & Occupant Comfort (AQ, R, & OS)
Suggested work group members: Core team, Air Quality consultant, Recycling consultant
The Air Quality, Recycling, & Occupant Satisfaction work group will produce a plan to
establish the baseline (e.g., via air testing, a waste audit and occupant surveys), decide on
goals, improve processes, and quantify the level of improvement. Elements of this work
group can be divided as follows.

7

As suggested by Stephen Ashkin, Ashkin Group, LLC. (personal communication)

Page 27 of 52

Opportunities and Innovation in Indianapolis: The Greening of the City-County Building

Air Quality
RMI recommends an air quality assessment be conducted to measure various types of
particulates and CO2 in separate areas of the building. This should be used both as a
baseline and as a catalyst for immediate measures if necessary. Efforts to improve air
quality should begin with immediate Green Cleaning implementation and continue
throughout the course of the entire project.
Recycling
The Indiana Recycling Coalition should be a key partner for the work group.8 The element
has two main parts. The first part regards the diversion of construction waste. The second
is on the management of solid waste generated during the operation of the facility. An
excellent resource for conducting a waste audit and solid waste management is the LEED
EB O&M (Existing Buildings Operations & Maintenance) Reference Guide, available
through the USGBC.
Occupant Comfort
As part of presenting the results of the retrofit in terms of financial and resource efficiency
benefit, it would be compelling to tell a story of improvement in occupant satisfaction.
This element should include immediate occupant surveys regarding visual and thermal
comfort to establish a baseline. Baselines should also be established based on absenteeism
and work productivity. After the retrofit has been implemented, the same items should be
measured again to see improvement.

Efficiency: Energy, Water, & Transportation (E, W, &T)
Suggested work group members: Core team, various consultants
The E, W, & T work group will ultimately produce a package of measures for the retrofit of
the CCB for water and energy efficiency, including not just the building but also the citycounty automobile fleet. The package may include anything from utilization of sump
pump water to the installation of plug-in stations for electric vehicles that give and draw
power from the CCB. RMI recommends package selection based on two main criteria:
resource efficiency and life cycle cost.
One member of the Core team needs to champion the cause of a profitable, whole-system,
radical efficiency retrofit. This person should monitor the progress of the work group every
two weeks. Throughout this process it is vital for building operations staff to provide input
as the work group develops recommendations. Monthly milestones should be established.
One or more presentations should be given to the public, the mayor, and other notables
during the project development process.
The key stages of this work group are Pre-Programming, Inventory & Programming,
Schematic Design, and Design Development & Final Recommendations.

Figure 2. Estimate of E, W, & T Work Group Timeline. This represents RMI’s best estimate based on
experience with projects of similar type.

Pre-Programming
Key elements of Pre-Programming are described below.
1) Determine existing capital plan. Identify any and all planned facility projects in the CCB.
Answer the following questions:
• What type of project?
• When will it be implemented?
• Is it already funded? If so, how?
The intent of this element is to capture the replacement cycle of building systems, reveal
other opportunities to coordinate with planned projects, and help establish the
comparative baseline. This information is required to optimize a whole systems building
retrofit explained in Major Opportunities. The Core team should determine and document
the existing capital plan.
2) Team selection and project charter. Includes selection of consulting team members and
contracts. This task should also be completed by the Core Team.
• Energy contract could be with an engineering consulting firm or it could be an
energy services performance contract (ESPC) with an energy service company
(ESCO). The benefit of the former would be that the Core Team keeps its options
open with regard to choosing a contractor for implementation. The benefits with

Page 29 of 52

•

the latter are that a certain amount of energy savings is guaranteed and the cost of
the audit and analysis is wrapped into the project implementation.
o RMI strongly recommends the ESPC ESCO option since the proposed design
recommendation has a better chance of implementation and there is a
guarantee on the energy cost savings – if the design does not meet the
targets, the ESCO writes a check for that difference to the city-county. Extra
savings accrue to the city-county.
ESCO Peer Review consulting team to enhance the ESPC outcomes - members
should include project manager, technical consultant and reviewer, envelope and
glazing expert, MEP (mechanical, electrical, and plumbing) expert, energy modeler,
economic modeler, lighting expert, water and stormwater expert, ecosystem
services expert, and transportation (specifically, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles)
expert.

3) Project launch. This event marks the official start of the implementation of the decidedupon retrofit design.
Phases I, II, and III
Workshops and deliverables. A team workshop should be held early on to determine goals
and work plan. The details regarding other workshops and deliverables are largely
dependent upon team selection, the team workshop, and what is learned from the building
audit. Items could include an estimate of “theoretical minimum” energy or water use of the
building, a baseline building report, and final recommendations. The final
recommendations would be included in the CCB Master Plan regarding energy, water, and
transportation. This plan would detail design and maintenance (e.g., scheduled
commissioning of HVAC equipment) measures.
Project Execution
This stage may include measures that continue for several years or are not implemented for
years later (e.g., in order to align with the replacement cycle of existing equipment). As
indicated in the timeline above, an engineering contract for ongoing commissioning
services should extend until at least 2025.

LEED / Energy Star
Suggested work group members: Core Team, Office of Sustainability, support staff
The workshop participants generally agree that seeking high certification under LEED
(Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) and/or Energy Start would provide
motivation and help the project create the desired impact on Indianapolis and the greater
region. For an occupied retrofit project, it is appropriate to seek LEED EB O&M (Existing
Building Operation & Maintenance) certification and/or Energy Star. This work group is
responsible for registering the project with the USGBC (United States Green Building
Council). Upon initial review of the checklist during the workshop, participants
determined that it would be possible to achieve LEED Platinum with a stronger possibility
of LEED Gold. The LEED checklist is provided in the appendix.

Page 30 of 52

Opportunities and Innovation in Indianapolis: The Greening of the City-County Building

The implementation phase of this work group would begin after the project is registered.
During implementation, members of the LEED / Energy Star work group are responsible to
take over the preliminary LEED EB O&M checklist that was filled out at the workshop (and
is located in the Appendix). This work group will need to interact and coordinate routinely
with the other work groups to verify that certain credits will be awarded. We strongly
recommend that Energy Star Portfolio Manager be utilized for this and all buildings under
the management of the Building Authority.

Conclusion
What does it mean for Indianapolis to be a forerunner in sustainability? How will the story
take shape? In what way can the retrofit of the CCB catalyze this transformation? These
are the questions more than thirty regional professionals addressed at the workshop. It was
clear that biggest impact could be created through a combination of strategies, including
the requirement of green design practices in each of the city- and county-owned buildings
and the establishment of regulations or incentives and guidance for green design in
Indianapolis. Workshop participants focused on what was most realistic and within their
areas of expertise: to retrofit the CCB and inspire others to do the same in the Indianapolis
region. This report documents the major outcomes of this workshop and provides next
steps for the Core Team.
The goal of the CCB retrofit is to create broad impact across the Indianapolis region.
Participants concluded that demonstrating a good business case and exhibiting the
occupant benefits of green design could accomplish this. This report outlined the major
work group categories and personnel required to prepare for this approach.
This report provides the framework for a CCB Comprehensive Master Plan and denotes
which aspects might be funded immediately, which might be implemented with available
funds, and which elements require additional capital funding.
As documented in the Major Results section of this report, there is a clear opportunity to
retrofit the CCB for radical resource efficiency and improved occupant comfort. Unlike
what is expected by the traditional cost-benefit analyst, as described in Major
Opportunities, greater efficiency does not always bring about greater cost. By pursuing
aggressive efficiency gains, we can actually reduce capital as well as operating cost of the
CCB retrofit, producing an attractive net present value of the investment. However, the
opportunity with the CCB retrofit lies well beyond that of the individual building. The
success of the CCB retrofit will likely help convince businesses in the Indianapolis region
that robust resource efficiency is vital to a successful business model.9

There is strong logic that links radical resource efficiency to a competitive advantage for businesses. The traditional
worldview (that dates back to the Industrial Revolution) is that services and materials from nature are abundant and cheap,
and that labor is the limiting factor to economic growth. We are now beginning to realize that there is an abundance of
people, resources are dwindling, and the use of fossil fuels is changing the Earth’s climate. Accordingly, the timelier
worldview is that labor is abundant and nature presents the limiting factor. The book Natural Capitalism presents core
principles for businesses to adapt to this contemporary world (a “second industrial revolution”) and thereby gain an
advantage over competitors. See the Appendix for more information. Natural Capitalism is freely available at
www.natcap.org.

Appendix 3: Integrated Design Process Checklist
Integrated Design Process Checklist
The integrated design process allows for the introduction of more variables and “what-if’s”
than a conventional project development process. Accordingly, design decisions can
become very complex.
Decisions are based on a variety of factors ranging from benefits (energy reduction, cost
reduction, LEED points, aesthetics, comfort), to upstream and downstream impacts on
other building systems and infrastructure, to the degree to which certain measures achieve
overall project goals. The checklist below can help the design team wade through this
process for the CCB project.

Step 1. Service/Need Definition
 What is the service needed for the space and who or what is prescribing this need?
 Are these appropriate needs and/or demands for the space?
 What are the specifications that have been assigned to this need? What are the

variables that could be changed?
 What could be done to increase the flexibility of these specifications?
 Would the needs for the space be different if it were located elsewhere in the building?

Step 2. Reduce Needs through Passive/Whole-Systems Measures
It is possible for a passive system to replace an active system?
What would it take to eliminate an active system?
What passive measures would reduce the size/use of an active system?
What other systems are directly impacted by this system? How can negative impacts be
further reduced?
 What other systems directly impact this system? What opportunities exist to reduce
those impacts? Or to benefit from them?





Step 3. System Design: Multiple Benefits from Single Expenditures
 What is the best layout, placement, or location for this system?
 Have rules of thumb about the design of this system been questioned?
 If multiple people designed the system components, has one person thought about the

whole picture?
 What are the boundaries/limits of this system? Would the design change if the

boundaries (or zoning) changed? What are the optimal boundaries for this system?
 Is each individual component optimized and is the system as a whole optimized? Can
you make one component “worse” or “better” to make multiple other components and
thus the whole system better?
 How many functions does this system/component serve? Could it be adapted to serve
more than one purpose (and eliminate the need for another system)?
 Is the system flexible? Can it change as building needs change?

Step 4. Efficient Technology

Page 34 of 52

Opportunities and Innovation in Indianapolis: The Greening of the City-County Building

 Is this the most efficient technology available? What would the system look like if a





more or less efficient product were used? What is the cost/benefit of doing so?
Will a more efficient technology be available in the next 1, 2 or 5 years?
Can the system be adapted or modified when new technologies become available?
Does this technology use an appropriate energy supply source?
Could this technology use a renewable technology supply?

Step 5. Controls and Demand Response
 Does this system/equipment need to be on all the time?
 Can this system be shut off or turned down for some of the time in response to varying

operating parameters or factors it may be dependent on?
 Can this system be shut off or turned down to reduce operating costs by way of

demand charges or peak utility charges?

Step 5. Use of Waste Streams






What waste is created by this system?
Can this waste be used in the building as a feedstock for another process?
Is there a local service that can recycle or reuse this waste?
Would a different system/design approach reduce waste?
What is the lifespan of this product? How can this product/system be replaced in 5, 10,
or 20 years?

Step 6. Appropriate Metrics
 What metrics are being used to analyze this system?
 Do these metrics include all value and costs? Are all the life-cycle costs and benefits





captured?
What is the purpose of this system? Is there a reason to spend more or less on this
system? Are there exceptions for this system?
Is this application replicable within the building? In other buildings?
What are the risks of implementing this system?

Opportunities and Innovation in Indianapolis: The Greening of the City-County Building

Appendix 5: An Introduction to Natural Capitalism
The book Natural Capitalism (1999), co-authored by RMI Chief Scientist, Amory
Lovins, describes the opportunities that are arising with the birth of the green
economy, which differs from conventional business systems in philosophy, goals,
and fundamental processes. In the next century, as the human population doubles
and the resources available to each person drop by one-half to three-fourths, a
remarkable transformation of commerce and industry can occur. Through this
transformation, society will be able to create a vital economy that uses radically
less material and energy. Such an economy can free up resources, reduce taxes on
personal income, increase per-capita spending on social ills (while simultaneously
reducing those ills), and restore the damaged environment. Done properly, these
necessary changes can promote economic efficiency, ecological conservation, and
social equity.
Natural Capitalism (free at www.natcap.org) introduces four central strategies that
enable companies and communities to operate by behaving as if all forms of
capital were valued.
Radical Resource Productivity
Radically increased resource productivity is the cornerstone of natural capitalism
because using resources more effectively has three significant benefits: it slows
resource depletion at one end of the value chain; it reduces pollution at the other
end, and provides a basis to increase employment with meaningful jobs. The result
can be lower costs for business and society, which no longer has to pay for the
chief causes of ecosystem and social disruption. Much environmental and social
harm is an artifact of the uneconomically wasteful use of human and natural
resources, but strategies for radical resource productivity can avoid degradation of
the biosphere, make it more profitable to employ people, and thus safeguard
against the loss of vital living systems and social cohesion.
One path to radical resource productivity is “end-use/least-cost thinking.” RMI
Chief Scientist and Natural Capitalism co-author, Amory Lovins coined the phrase
to guide decision-making in the energy industry, though it applies to a wide range
of situations. People don’t want electricity or oil or coal, he reasoned. What they
want are the services energy provides: illumination, cold beer, comfortable living
rooms, hot showers, and so on. How can we provide these services, he asked, with
the least overall cost? Lovins concluded that building central power plants to power
baseboard heaters in drafty houses was not a least-cost solution to keeping people
comfortable. For far less financial and environmental cost, one could simply
insulate the houses properly. His ideas prompted some in the electric utility
industry to implement “demand-side management,” energy service programs that
seek to meet customers’ needs more cost-effectively through energy savings instead
of providing more power at a high cost. Though this approach may sound like

Page 40 of 52

Opportunities and Innovation in Indianapolis: The Greening of the City-County Building

common sense, it is actually a fairly novel way of making decisions.
(www.rmi.org/sitepages/pid61.php)
Biomimicry
Natural systems create no waste. Everything that is no longer useful to one
organism becomes food (energy) for another. Similarly, much industrial waste is a
resource out of place, a nutrient seeking another industry where it can be of use.
Reducing the wasteful throughput of materials—indeed, eliminating the very idea
of waste—can be accomplished by redesigning industrial and business system
along biological lines, enabling the constant reuse of materials in continuous
closed cycles and often the elimination of toxicity. (www.biomimicry.net)
Industrial symbiosis (or waste matching) is an innovative form of industrial
collaboration that redefines waste and by-products as inputs for other industrial
operations. It “engages traditionally separate industries in a collective approach to
competitive advantage involving physical exchange of materials, energy, and/or byproducts” (Chertow). In a city, it can offer development opportunities regardless of
prospects for future industrial expansion, creating more wealth within an existing
mix of industries. See Cuyahoga Valley Initiative: A Model of Regeneration at
www.rmi.org/sitepages/pid177.php.
Service and Flow Economy
A fundamental change in the relationship between producer and consumer is
underway. It’s a shift from an economy of goods and purchases to one of service
and flow, which changes the incentives regarding reuse of materials. For example,
nearly all offices now lease copier services rather than buy copy machines as they
once did. Thus, it’s in the interest of the copy-machine company to design the
machine to be recyclable instead of designing it so that all the parts of an old
machine are discarded.
In essence, an economy that is based on a flow of economic services can better
protect the ecosystem services upon which it depends. This requires a new
perception of value. It requires shifting from perceiving the acquisition of goods as
a measure of affluence to an understanding that the continuous receipt of quality,
utility, and performance promotes well-being. A “service-and-flow economy” offers
incentives to put into practice the first two innovations of natural capitalism by
restructuring the economy to focus on relationships that better meet customers’
changing needs and to reward automatically both resource productivity and
closed-loop cycles.
Investing In Natural Capital
Sustaining, restoring, and expanding stocks of natural capital will support the
biosphere in producing more abundant ecosystem services and natural resources.
This statement is based on the understanding that natural systems not only provide

Page 41 of 52

Opportunities and Innovation in Indianapolis: The Greening of the City-County Building

products (e.g., wood from a forest), they provide—at no cost—many services that
humans cannot do without. (e.g., flood control by a forest’s root system). A
community or company located near a river downstream of a mountain forest will
eventually feel the effects if that forest’s products are harvested without regard for
its services. As history has repeatedly demonstrated, those effects can be
catastrophic.
Businesses must restore, sustain, and expand the planet’s ecosystems so that they
can produce their resources and services even more abundantly. If businesses do
not do so proactively, the cost of reinvesting in natural capital will increase, stocks
will be depleted, and ecological problems will multiply. This will lead to societal
pressures through regulation and costly and inefficient governmental actions. To
avoid this scenario, reduce risk, and avert a reputation of environmental
irresponsibility, a business must work to ensure that there will be sufficient
ecosystem services in the future. This concept is the fundamental reason that many
companies are reducing carbon emissions and buying carbon offsets even when
they are not required by regulations to do so. Additionally, with growing consumer
awareness, environmental stewardship offers a significant market advantage.

"Understanding and acknowledging the incredible economic impact of the nonprofit
arts and culture, we must always remember their fundamental value. They foster
beauty, creativity, originality, and vitality. The arts inspire us, sooth us, provoke us,
involve us, and connect us. But they also create jobs and contribute to the economy."

The Arts Mean Business
By Robert L. Lynch, President and CEO, Americans for the Arts
America’s artists and arts organizations live and work in every community from coast-to-coast—
fueling creativity, beautifying our cities, and improving our quality of life. In my travels across the
country, business and government leaders often talk to me about the challenges of funding the arts
amid shrinking resources and alongside other pressing needs. They worry about jobs and the
economy. Is their region a magnet for attracting and retaining a skilled and innovative
workforce? How well are they competing in the high-stakes race to attract new businesses? The
findings from Arts & Economic Prosperity IV send a clear and welcome message: leaders who care
about community and economic vitality can feel good about choosing to invest in the arts.
Arts & Economic Prosperity IV is our fourth study of
the nonprofit arts and culture industry’s impact on the
economy. The most comprehensive study of its kind
ever conducted, it features customized findings on 182
study regions representing all 50 states and the District
of Columbia as well as estimates of economic impact
nationally. Despite the economic headwinds that our
country faced in 2010, the results are impressive.
Nationally, the industry generated $135.2 billion
dollars of economic activity—$61.1 billion by the
nation’s nonprofit arts and culture organizations in
addition to $74.1 billion in event-related expenditures
by their audiences. This economic activity supports 4.1
million full-time jobs. Our industry also generates
$22.3 billion in revenue to local, state, and federal
governments every year—a yield well beyond their
collective $4 billion in arts allocations.
Arts and culture organizations are resilient and
entrepreneurial businesses. They employ people locally,
purchase goods and services from within the community,
and market and promote their regions. Arts organizations
are rooted locally; these are jobs that cannot be shipped
overseas. Like most industries, the Great Recession left a
measurable financial impact on the arts—erasing the
gains made during the pre-recession years, and leaving
2010 expenditures three percent behind their 2005 levels.
The biggest effect of the recession was on attendance
and audience spending. Inevitably, as people lost jobs
and worried about losing their houses, arts attendance—
like attendance to sports events and leisure travel—
waned as well. Yet, even in a down economy, some
communities saw an increase in their arts spending and
employment. As the economy rebounds, the arts are well
poised for growth. They are already producing new and
exciting work—performances and exhibitions and
festivals that entertain, inspire, and attract audiences.

Arts & Economic Prosperity IV | Americans for the Arts

Arts & Economic Prosperity IV shows that arts and
culture organizations leverage additional event-related
spending by their audiences that pumps revenue into
the local economy. When patrons attend an arts event
they may pay for parking, eat dinner at a restaurant,
shop in local retail stores, and have dessert on the way
home. Based on the 151,802 audience-intercept
surveys conducted for this study, the typical arts
attendee spends $24.60 per person, per event, beyond
the cost of admission.
Communities that draw cultural tourists experience an
additional boost of economic activity. Tourism industry
research has repeatedly demonstrated that arts tourists
stay longer and spend more than the average
traveler. Arts & Economic Prosperity IV reflects those
findings: 32 percent of attendees live outside the
county in which the arts event took place, and their
event-related spending is more than twice that of their
local counterparts (nonlocal: $39.96 vs. local: $17.42).
The message is clear: a vibrant arts community not
only keeps residents and their discretionary spending
close to home, it also attracts visitors who spend
money and help local businesses thrive.
Arts & Economic Prosperity IV demonstrates that
America’s arts industry is not only resilient in times of
economic uncertainty, but is also a key component to
our nation’s economic recovery and future prosperity.
Business and elected leaders need not feel that a choice
must be made between arts funding and economic
prosperity. This study proves that they can choose
both. Nationally, as well as locally, the arts mean
business.

Where Culture Meets Commerce
By Mark Kruzan, Mayor, City of Bloomington
I’m proud to say that we at the City of Bloomington have emphatically and strategically included
arts and cultural policies and programming among our high priority economic development efforts.
A local government will be most effective in promoting sustainable economic growth by keeping a
city livable; that is, making it one of the best places in the country to live, work and visit. Our
unique arts and cultural environment is a key aspect of that livability.
We’ve helped put more arts in the downtown and worked to build more audiences for our existing
attractions, all through the efforts of our Bloomington Entertainment and Arts District (BEAD). In
the process we’ve shifted the paradigm for how arts can function within city government. Our
vision of administering BEAD’s efforts through the City’s Department of Economic and
Sustainable Development is resonating powerfully with communities throughout the country. We’re
thrilled that we’ve been contacted often to share our activities with cities that want to try to adapt
what we’re doing in their own communities.
It hasn’t always been easy to change the perception of the role that the creative community plays in
supporting overall economic vitality, but today the awareness of the significance of that role is
widespread in Bloomington. We offer the results of Arts & Economic Prosperity IV as proof that
not only does arts and cultural activity have a civilizing, enlightening and humanizing impact, but it
also has a measurable and meaningful economic impact in Bloomington.

"As all budgets—local and national, public and private—continue to
reel from the effects of the economic downturn, some may perceive
the arts as an unaffordable luxury reserved for only the most
prosperous times. Fortunately, this rigorous report offers evidence
that the nonprofit arts industry provides not just cultural benefits to
our communities, but also makes significant positive economic
contributions to the nation’s financial well being regardless of the
overall state of the economy. This certainly is something to applaud."
— Jonathan Spector
President & CEO

The Economic Impact of the
Nonprofit Arts and Culture Industry
in the City of Bloomington, IN
Arts & Economic Prosperity IV provides compelling new evidence that the nonprofit
arts and culture are a significant industry in the City of Bloomington—one that
generates $72.3 million in total economic activity. This spending—$52.3 million by
nonprofit arts and culture organizations and an additional $20 million in event-related
spending by their audiences—supports 3,430 full-time equivalent jobs, generates
$63.6 million in household income to local residents, and delivers $6.3 million in
local and state government revenue. This economic impact study sends a strong
signal that when we support the arts, we not only enhance our quality of life, but we
also invest in the City of Bloomington’s economic well-being.
The City of Bloomington is one of 182 study regions
that participated in Arts & Economic Prosperity IV, the
most comprehensive study of its kind ever conducted.
It documents the economic impact of the nonprofit arts
and culture sector in 139 cities and counties, 31 multicity or multi-county regions, 10 states, and two
individual arts districts—representing all 50 U.S. states
and the District of Columbia. The diverse study regions
range in population (1,600 to four million) and type
(rural to large urban). Project economists customized
input-output analysis models to calculate specific and
reliable findings for each study region. This study
focuses solely on the economic impact of nonprofit arts
and culture organizations and event-related spending
by their audiences. Spending by individual artists and
the for-profit arts and culture sector (e.g., Broadway or
the motion picture industry) are excluded from this
study. For the purpose of this study, the geographic
area included in this analysis is defined as the City of
Bloomington.

Arts & Economic Prosperity IV | Americans for the Arts

Defining Economic Impact
This proprietary study uses four economic measures to
define economic impact: full-time equivalent jobs, resident
household income, and local and state government
revenues.
(1) Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) Jobs describes the total
amount of labor employed. Economists measure FTE jobs,
not the total number of employees, because it is a more
accurate measure that accounts for part-time employment.
(2) Resident Household Income (often called Personal
Income) includes salaries, wages, and entrepreneurial
income paid to local residents. It is the money residents earn
and use to pay for food, mortgages, and other living
expenses.
Revenue to (3) Local and (4) State Government includes
revenue from local and state taxes (e.g., income, property,
sales, and lodging) as well as funds from license fees, utility
fees, filing fees, and other similar sources.

Economic Impact of the ENTIRE Nonprofit Arts and Culture Industry
(Combined Spending by Both Organizations and Their Audiences)
in the City of Bloomington
During fiscal year 2010, aggregate nonprofit sector spending by both the City of Bloomington’s nonprofit arts and
culture organizations and their audiences totaled $72.3 million. The table below demonstrates the total economic
impact of this spending.

Direct and Indirect Economic Impact: How a Dollar is Re-spent in the Economy
Arts & Economic Prosperity IV uses a sophisticated economic analysis called input-output analysis to measure economic
impact. It is a system of mathematical equations that combines statistical methods and economic theory. Input-output analysis
enables economists to track how many times a dollar is “re-spent” within the local economy, and the economic impact
generated by each round of spending. How can a dollar be re-spent? Consider the following example:
A theater company in the City of Bloomington purchases several gallons of paint from a local hardware store for $200.
The hardware store then uses a portion of the $200 to pay the sales clerk; the sales clerk re-spends some of the money at a
grocery store; the grocery store uses some to pay its cashier; the cashier spends some on rent; and so on ...
Thus, the initial expenditure by the theater company was followed by four additional rounds of local spending (by the hardware
store, the sales clerk, the grocery store, and the cashier).






The economic impact of the theater company’s initial $200 expenditure is the direct economic impact.
The economic impacts of the subsequent rounds of local spending are the indirect impacts.
Eventually, the $200 dollars will “leak out” of the local economy (i.e., be spent non-locally) and cease to have a local
economic impact. In this example, if the theater company purchased the paint from a non-local hardware store there
would be no local economic impact. Since the hardware store is located in Monroe County, the dollars remain within the
local economy and create at least one more round of local spending by the hardware company.
The total impact is the sum of the direct impact plus all indirect impacts. This report provides the total impact.

A dollar “ripples” very different through each community, which is why a customized input-output model was created for the
City of Bloomington.

"Mayors understand the connection between the arts industry and city
revenues. Arts activity creates thousands of direct and indirect jobs
and generates billions in government and business revenues. The arts
also make our cities destinations for tourists, help attract and retain
businesses, and play an important role in the economic revitalization
of cities and the vibrancy of our neighborhoods."
— Philadelphia Mayor Michael A. Nutter
President, The United States Conference of Mayors 2012–2013

"Many businesses support the arts across the country because they
intuitively understand that the arts matter, so it is great to get the
facts and a clearer understanding of the links between the arts and
economic prosperity."

Economic Impact of Spending by Nonprofit Arts and Culture ORGANIZATIONS
in the City of Bloomington
Nonprofit arts and culture organizations are active contributors to their business community. They are employers,
producers, and consumers. They are members of the Chamber of Commerce as well as key partners in the
marketing and promotion of their cities, regions, and states. Spending by nonprofit arts and culture organizations
totaled $52.3 million in the City of Bloomington during fiscal year 2010. This spending is far-reaching:
organizations pay employees, purchase supplies, contract for services, and acquire assets within their community.
These actions, in turn, support jobs, create household income, and generate revenue to the local and state
governments.
The City of Bloomington’s nonprofit arts and culture organizations provide rewarding employment for more than
just administrators, artists, curators, choreographers, and musicians. They also employ financial staff, facility
managers, and salespeople. In addition, the spending by these organizations directly supports a wide array of other
occupations spanning many industries (e.g., printing, event planning, legal, construction, and accounting).
Data were collected from 40 eligible nonprofit arts and culture organizations in the City of Bloomington. Each
provided detailed budget information about more than 40 expenditure categories for fiscal year 2010 (e.g., labor,
payments to local and nonlocal artists, operations, administration, programming, facilities, and capital
expenditures/asset acquisition). The following tables demonstrates the total economic impacts of their aggregate
spending.

An Economic Impact Beyond Dollars: Volunteerism
While arts volunteers may not have an economic impact as defined in this study, they clearly have an enormous
impact by helping the City of Bloomington’s nonprofit arts and culture organizations function as a viable industry.
Arts & Economic Prosperity IV reveals a significant contribution to nonprofit arts and culture organizations as a
result of volunteerism. During 2010, a total of 3,995 volunteers donated a total of 142,837 hours to the City of
Bloomington’s participating nonprofit arts and culture organizations. This represents a donation of time with an
estimated aggregate value of $3,050,998 (Independent Sector estimates the dollar value of the average 2010
volunteer hour to be $21.36).
The 40 participating organizations reported an average of 35.8 volunteers who volunteered an average of 99.9
hours, for a total of 3,571 hours per organization.

The Value of In-Kind Contributions to Arts Organizations
The participating organizations were asked about the sources and value of their in-kind support. In-kind
contributions are non-cash donations such as materials (e.g., office supplies from a local retailer), facilities (e.g.,
rent), and services (e.g., printing costs from a local printer). The 40 participating nonprofit arts and culture
organizations in the City of Bloomington reported that they received in-kind contributions with an aggregate value
of $6,052,770 during fiscal year 2010. These contributions were received from a variety of sources including
corporations, individuals, local and state arts agencies, and government.

"At Aetna, we encourage our employees to be active volunteers. It’s good
for the employee, good for the community, and a source of corporate
pride. The research also makes clear that employees who are engaged in
the community are more engaged at the workplace—and that is good for
business. Arts organizations are part of the fabric of a healthy community,
so we are delighted to provide incentives to our workers to be regular arts
volunteers."

Economic Impact of Spending by Nonprofit Arts and Culture AUDIENCES
in the City of Bloomington
The nonprofit arts and culture industry, unlike most industries, leverages a significant amount of event-related
spending by its audiences. For example, when patrons attend a cultural event, they may pay to park their car,
purchase dinner at a restaurant, shop in nearby stores, eat dessert after the show, and pay a babysitter upon their
return home. Attendees from out of town may spend the night in a hotel. This spending generates related
commerce for local businesses such as restaurants, parking garages, retail stores, and hotels.
To measure the impact of nonprofit arts and culture audiences in the City of Bloomington, data were collected
from 1,370 event attendees during 2011. Researchers used an audience-intercept methodology, a standard
technique in which patrons complete a written survey about their event-related spending while attending the event.
In the City of Bloomington, arts attendees spend an average of $20.82 per person, per event as a direct result of
their attendance to the event. Local businesses that cater to arts and culture audiences reap the rewards of this
economic activity.
The 40 participating nonprofit arts and culture organizations reported that the aggregate attendance to their events
was 959,168 during 2010. These attendees spent an estimated total of $20 million, excluding the cost of event
admission. The following table demonstrate the total impacts of this spending.

* Why exclude the cost of admission? The admissions paid by attendees are excluded from the analysis because those dollars are
captured in the operating budgets of the participating nonprofit arts and culture organizations and, in turn, are spent by the
organization. This methodology avoids “double-counting” those dollars in the study analysis.

Cultural Tourists Spend More
The 1,370 audience survey respondents were asked to provide the ZIP code of their primary residence, enabling
researchers to determine which attendees were local residents (live within Monroe County) and which were nonresidents (live outside Monroe County). In the City of Bloomington, researchers estimate that 70.3 percent of the
959,168 nonprofit arts attendees were residents; 29.7 percent were non-residents.
Non-resident attendees spend an average of 216 percent more per person than local attendees ($40.11 vs. $12.68)
as a result of their attendance to cultural events. As would be expected from a traveler, higher spending was
typically found in the categories of lodging, meals, and transportation. When a community attracts cultural
tourists, it harnesses significant economic rewards.

Cultural Events Attract New Dollars and Retain Local Dollars
The City of Bloomington’s nonprofit arts and culture sector provides attractions that draw visitors to the
community. In fact, 53.1 percent of all non-resident survey respondents reported that the primary reason for their
trip was “specifically to attend this arts/cultural event.”
In addition, 15.7 percent of the City of Bloomington’s non-resident survey respondents reported that they will
spend at least one night away from home in the City of Bloomington as a direct result of attending the cultural
event. Non-resident attendees who stay overnight in paid lodging spend an average of $156.69 per person as a
result of their attendance—significantly more than the overall per person average for all non-resident attendees to
events in the City of Bloomington $40.11.
Finally, the audience survey respondents were asked, “If this event were not happening, would you have traveled
to another community to attend a similar cultural experience?”



29.7 percent of the City of Bloomington’s resident cultural attendees report that they would have traveled
to a different community in order to attend a similar cultural experience.
40.7 percent of the City of Bloomington’s non-resident cultural attendees report the same.

These figures demonstrate the economic impact of the nonprofit arts and culture in the purest sense. If a
community does not provide a variety of artistic and cultural experiences, it will fail to attract the new dollars of
cultural tourists. It will also lose the discretionary spending of its local residents who will travel elsewhere to
experience the arts.

"As a banker, I have visited businesses in almost every city and town in
Oklahoma. There is a visible difference in places with a vibrant arts
community. I see people looking for places to park, stores staying open late,
and restaurants packed with diners … the business day is extended and the
cash registers are ringing."

Chairman & CEO, NBanC
Past President, American Bankers Association

Cultural Attendees are Artists!

54.6 percent of the City of Bloomington’s arts attendees report that they actively participate in the
creation of the arts (e.g., sing in a choir, act in a community play, paint or draw, play an instrument).

Conclusion
The nonprofit arts and culture are a $72.3 million industry in the City of
Bloomington—one that supports 3,430 full-time equivalent jobs and generates $6.3
million in local and state government revenue. Nonprofit arts and culture
organizations, which spend $52.3 million annually, leverage a remarkable $20
million in additional spending by arts and culture audiences—spending that pumps
vital revenue into local restaurants, hotels, retail stores, parking garages, and other
businesses. By demonstrating that investing in the arts and culture yields economic
benefits, Arts & Economic Prosperity IV lays to rest a common misconception: that
communities support the arts and culture at the expense of local economic
development. In fact, they are investing in an industry that supports jobs, generates
government revenue, and is a cornerstone of tourism. This report shows conclusively
that the arts mean business!

"Disney has a rich legacy in animation, film and storytelling, so
naturally we consider the arts to be an essential part of our business, as
well as an essential element of our communities. We have seen how the
arts not only enrich American life, but also support millions of jobs
across the country, generate billions of dollars in economic impact, and
help drive the family-vacation industry. By investing in the arts, we
plant seeds for the future and make our communities better places to
live."

our top 10 employers, we see how the arts contribute to the
renaissance of downtown areas, enhance our educational system,
and attract new businesses and residents to the state."

The Arts & Economic Prosperity IV Calculator
To make it easier to compare the economic impacts of different organizations within the City of Bloomington, the
project researchers calculated the economic impact per $100,000 of direct spending by nonprofit arts and culture
organizations and their audiences.

Economic Impact Per $100,000 of Direct Spending by ORGANIZATIONS
For every $100,000 in direct spending by a nonprofit arts and culture organization in the City of Bloomington,
there was the following total economic impact.

An Example of How to Use the Organizational Spending Calculator Table (above):
An administrator from a nonprofit arts and culture organization that has total expenditures of $250,000 wants to
determine the organization’s total economic impact on full-time equivalent (FTE) employment in the City of
Bloomington. The administrator would:
1. Determine the amount spent by the nonprofit arts and culture organization;
2. Divide the total expenditure by 100,000; and
3. Multiply that figure by the FTE employment ratio per $100,000 for the City of Bloomington.
Thus, $250,000 divided by 100,000 equals 2.5; 2.5 times 5.31 (from the top row of data on Table 1 above) equals
a total of 13.3 full-time equivalent jobs supported (both directly and indirectly) within the City of Bloomington by
that nonprofit arts and culture organization. Using the same procedure, the estimate can be calculated for resident
household income and local and state government revenue.

Economic Impact Per $100,000 of Direct Spending by AUDIENCES
The economic impact of event-related spending by arts audiences can also be derived for individual or groups of
nonprofit arts and culture organizations and events in the City of Bloomington.
The first step is to determine the total estimated event-related spending by arts and culture event attendees
(excluding the cost of admission). To derive this figure, multiply the average per person event-related expenditure
in the City of Bloomington by the total event attendance. The ratios of economic impact per $100,000 in direct
spending can then be used to determine the total economic impact of the total estimated audience spending.

An Example of How to Use the Audience Spending Calculator Tables (on the preceding page):
An administrator wants to determine the total economic impact of the 25,000 total attendees to his/her
organization’s nonprofit arts and culture events on full-time equivalent (FTE) employment in the City of
Bloomington. The administrator would:
1. Determine the total estimated audience spending by multiplying the average per person expenditure for
the City of Bloomington by the total attendance to nonprofit arts and culture events;
2. Divide the resulting total estimated audience spending by 100,000; and
3. Multiply that figure by the FTE employment ratio per $100,000 for the City of Bloomington.
Thus, 25,000 times $20.82 (from the bottom row of data on Table 2 on the preceding page) equals $520,500;
$520,500 divided by 100,000 equals 5.21; 5.21 times 3.26 (from the top row of data on Table 3 on the preceding
page) equals a total of 17.0 full-time equivalent jobs supported (both directly and indirectly) within the City of
Bloomington by that nonprofit arts and culture organization. Using the same procedure, the estimate can be
calculated for resident household income and local and state government revenue.

Making Comparisons with Similar Study Regions
For the purpose of this research project, the geographic region being studied is defined as the City of
Bloomington, IN. According to the most recent data available from the U.S. Census Bureau, the population of the
City of Bloomington was estimated to be 71,819 during 2010. For comparison purposes, more than 300 pages of
detailed data tables containing the study results for all 182 participating study regions are located in Appendix B
of the National Statistical Report. The data tables are stratified by population, making it easy to compare the
findings for the City of Bloomington to the findings for similarly populated study regions (as well as any other
participating study regions that are considered valid comparison cohorts).

About This Study
The Arts & Economic Prosperity IV study was conducted by Americans for the Arts
to document the economic impact of the nonprofit arts and culture industry in 182
communities and regions (139 cities and counties, 31 multi-city or multi-county
regions, and 10 states, and two individual arts districts)—representing all 50 U.S.
states and the District of Columbia.
The diverse communities range in population
(1,600 to four million) and type (rural to urban).
The study focuses solely on nonprofit arts and
culture organizations and their audiences. Public
arts councils and public presenting
facilities/institutions are included as are select
programs embedded within another organization
(that have their own budget and play a substantial
role in the cultural life of the community). The
study excludes spending by individual artists and
the for-profit arts and entertainment sector (e.g.,
Broadway or the motion picture industry). Detailed
expenditure data were collected from 9,731 arts and
culture organizations and 151,802 of their
attendees. The project economists, from the
Georgia Institute of Technology, customized inputoutput analysis models for each study region to
provide specific and reliable economic impact data
about their nonprofit arts and culture industry,
specifically full-time equivalent jobs, household
income, and local and state government revenue.

The 182 Local, Regional, and
Statewide Study Partners
Americans for the Arts published a Call for
Participants in 2010 seeking communities interested
in participating in the Arts & Economic Prosperity
IV study. Of the more than 200 potential partners
that expressed interest, 182 agreed to participate
and complete four participation criteria: (1) identify
and code the universe of nonprofit arts and culture
organizations in their study region; (2) assist

Arts & Economic Prosperity IV | Americans for the Arts

researchers with the collection of detailed financial
and attendance data from those organizations; (3)
conduct audience-intercept surveys at cultural events;
and (4) pay a modest cost-sharing fee (no community
was refused participation for an inability to pay).
The City of Bloomington Department of Economic
and Sustainable Development responded to the
2010 Call for Participants, and agreed to complete
the required participation criteria.

Surveys of Nonprofit Arts and
Culture ORGANIZATIONS
Each of the 182 study regions attempted to identify
its comprehensive universe of nonprofit arts and
culture organizations using the Urban Institute’s
National Taxonomy of Exempt Entity (NTEE)
coding system as a guideline. The NTEE system—
developed by the National Center for Charitable
Statistics at the Urban Institute—is a definitive
classification system for nonprofit organizations
recognized as tax exempt by the Internal Revenue
Code. This system divides the entire universe of
nonprofit organizations into 10 Major categories,
including “Arts, Culture, and Humanities.” The
Urban Institute reports that 113,000 nonprofit arts
and culture organizations were registered with the
IRS in 2010, up from 94,450 in 2005.
The following NTEE “Arts, Culture, and
Humanities” subcategories were included in this
study:

Nationally, detailed information was collected from
9,721 eligible organizations about their fiscal year
2010 expenditures in more than 40 expenditure
categories (e.g., labor, local and non-local artists,
operations, materials, facilities, and asset acquisition)
as well as about their event attendance, in-kind
contributions, and volunteerism. Responding
organizations had budgets ranging from a low of $0
to a high of $239.7 million. Response rates for the
182 communities averaged 43.2 percent and ranged
from 5.3 percent to 100 percent. It is important to
note that each study region’s results are based solely
on the actual survey data collected. No estimates
have been made to account for non-respondents.
Therefore, the less-than-100 percent response rates
suggest an understatement of the economic impact
findings in most of the individual study regions.

In addition to the organization types above, the
study partners were encouraged to include other

18

types of eligible organizations if they play a
substantial role in the cultural life of the community
or if their primary purpose is to promote participation
in, appreciation for, and understanding of the visual,
performing, folk, and media arts. These include
government-owned or government-operated cultural
facilities and institutions, municipal arts agencies and
councils, private community arts organizations,
unincorporated arts groups, living collections (such
as zoos, aquariums, and botanical gardens),
university presenters, and arts programs that are
embedded under the umbrella of a non-arts
organization or facility (such as a community center
or church). In short, if it displays the characteristics
of a nonprofit arts and culture organization, it is
included. For-profit businesses and individual artists
were excluded from this study.

In the City of Bloomington, 40 of the
approximately 68 total eligible nonprofit arts and
culture organizations identified by the City of
Bloomington Department of Economic and
Sustainable Development participated in this
study—an overall participation rate of 59 percent.

Arts & Economic Prosperity IV | Americans for the Arts

Surveys of Nonprofit Arts and
Culture AUDIENCES
Audience-intercept surveying, a common and
accepted research method, was conducted in all 182
of the study regions to measure event-related
spending by nonprofit arts and culture audiences.
Patrons were asked to complete a short survey
while attending an event. Nationally, a total of
151,802 valid and usable attendees completed the
survey for an average of 834 surveys per study
region. The randomly selected respondents
provided itemized expenditure data on attendancerelated activities such as meals, souvenirs,
transportation, and lodging. Data were collected
throughout 2011 (to guard against seasonal spikes
or drop-offs in attendance) as well as at a broad
range of both paid and free events (a night at the
opera will typically yield more spending then a
weekend children’s theater production or a free
community music festival, for example). The
survey respondents provided information about the
entire party with whom they were attending the
event. With an overall average travel party size of
2.69 people, these data actually represent the
spending patterns of more than 408,000 attendees.
In the City of Bloomington, a total of 1,370 valid
and usable audience-intercept surveys were
collected from attendees to arts and culture
performances, events, and exhibits during 2011.

Economic Analysis
A common theory of community growth is that an
area must export goods and services if it is to
prosper economically. This theory is called
economic-base theory, and it depends on dividing
the economy into two sectors: the export sector and
the local sector. Exporters, such as automobile
manufacturers, hotels, and department stores, obtain
income from customers outside of the community.
This “export income” then enters the local economy
in the form of salaries, purchases of materials,

Arts & Economic Prosperity IV | Americans for the Arts

dividends, and so forth, and becomes income to local
residents. Much of it is re-spent locally; some,
however, is spent for goods imported from outside of
the community. The dollars re-spent locally have an
economic impact as they continue to circulate
through the local economy. This theory applies to arts
organizations as well as to other producers.

Studying Economic Impact Using
Input-Output Analysis
To derive the most reliable economic impact data,
input-output analysis is used to measure the impact of
expenditures by nonprofit arts and culture
organizations and their audiences. This is a highly
regarded type of economic analysis that has been the
basis for two Nobel Prizes. The models are systems
of mathematical equations that combine statistical
methods and economic theory in an area of study
called econometrics. They trace how many times a
dollar is re-spent within the local economy before it
leaks out, and it quantifies the economic impact of
each round of spending. This form of economic
analysis is well suited for this study because it can be
customized specifically to each study region.
To complete the analysis for the City of
Bloomington, project economists customized an
input-output model based on the local dollar flow
between 533 finely detailed industries within the
economy of Monroe County. This was accomplished
by using detailed data on employment, incomes, and
government revenues provided by the U.S.
Department of Commerce (County Business Patterns,
the Regional Economic Information System, and the
Survey of State and Local Finance), local tax data
(sales taxes, property taxes, and miscellaneous local
option taxes), as well as the survey data from the
responding nonprofit arts and culture organizations
and their audiences.

19

The Input-Output Process
The input-output model is based on a table of 533
finely detailed industries showing local sales and
purchases. The local and state economy of each
community is researched so the table can be
customized for each community. The basic
purchase patterns for local industries are derived
from a similar table for the U.S. economy for 2007
(the latest detailed data available from the U.S.
Department of Commerce). The table is first
reduced to reflect the unique size and industry mix
of the local economy, based on data from County
Business Patterns and the Regional Economic
Information System of the U.S. Department of
Commerce. It is then adjusted so that only
transactions with local businesses are recorded in
the inter-industry part of the table. This technique
compares supply and demand and estimates the
additional imports or exports required to make total
supply equal total demand. The resulting table
shows the detailed sales and purchase patterns of
the local industries. The 533-industry table is then
aggregated to reflect the general activities of 32
industries plus local households, creating a total of
33 industries. To trace changes in the economy,
each column is converted to show the direct
requirements per dollar of gross output for each
sector. This direct-requirements table represents the
“recipe” for producing the output of each industry.
The economic impact figures for Arts & Economic
Prosperity IV were computed using what is called
an “iterative” procedure. This process uses the sum
of a power series to approximate the solution to the
economic model. This is what the process looks like
in matrix algebra:
T = IX + AX + A2X + A3X + ... + AnX.
T is the solution, a column vector of changes in
each industry’s outputs caused by the changes
represented in the column vector X. A is the 33 by
33 direct-requirements matrix. This equation is used

20

to trace the direct expenditures attributable to
nonprofit arts organizations and their audiences. A
multiplier effect table is produced that displays the
results of this equation. The total column is T. The
initial expenditure to be traced is IX (I is the identity
matrix, which is operationally equivalent to the
number 1 in ordinary algebra). Round 1 is AX, the
result of multiplying the matrix A by the vector X
(the outputs required of each supplier to produce the
goods and services purchased in the initial change
under study). Round 2 is A2X, which is the result of
multiplying the matrix A by Round 1 (it answers the
same question applied to Round 1: “What are the
outputs required of each supplier to produce the
goods and services purchased in Round 1 of this
chain of events?”). Each of columns 1 through 12 in
the multiplier effects table represents one of the
elements in the continuing but diminishing chain of
expenditures on the right side of the equation. Their
sum, T, represents the total production required in the
local economy in response to arts activities.
Calculation of the total impact of the nonprofit arts
on the outputs of other industries (T) can now be
converted to impacts on the final incomes to local
residents by multiplying the outputs produced by the
ratios of household income to output and
employment to output. Thus, the employment impact
of changes in outputs due to arts expenditures is
calculated by multiplying elements in the column of
total outputs by the ratio of employment to output for
the 32 industries in the region. Changes in household
incomes, local government revenues, and state
government revenues due to nonprofit arts
expenditures are similarly transformed. The same
process is also used to show the direct impact on
incomes and revenues associated with the column of
direct local expenditures.

used to complete the national study is available at

Frequently Used Terms
This section provides a glossary of economic impact terminology.
Cultural Tourism
Travel directed toward experiencing the arts, heritage, and special character of a place.

Direct Economic Impact
A measure of the economic effect of the initial expenditure within a community. For example, when the
symphony pays its players, each musician’s salary, the associated government taxes, and full-time equivalent
employment status represent the direct economic impact.

Direct Expenditures
The first round of expenditures in the economic cycle. A paycheck from the symphony to the violin player and a
ballet company’s purchase of dance shoes are examples of direct expenditures.

Econometrics
The process of using statistical methods and economic theory to develop a system of mathematical equations that
measures the flow of dollars between local industries. The input-output model developed for this study is an
example of an econometric model.

Econometrician
An economist who designs, builds, and maintains econometric models.

Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) Jobs
A term that describes the total amount of labor employed. Economists measure FTE jobs—not the total number of
employees—because it is a more accurate measure of total employment. It is a manager’s discretion to hire one
full-time employee, two half-time employees, four quarter-time employees, etc. Almost always, more people are
affected than are reflected in the number of FTE jobs reported due to the abundance of part-time employment,
especially in the nonprofit arts and culture industry.

Indirect Economic Impact
Each time a dollar changes hands, there is a measurable economic impact. When people and businesses receive
money, they re-spend much of that money locally. Indirect impact measures the effect of this re-spending on jobs,
household income, and revenue to local and state government. It is often referred to as secondary spending or the
dollars “rippling” through a community. When funds are eventually spent non-locally, they are considered to have
“leaked” out of the community and therefore cease to have a local economic impact. Indirect impact includes the
impact of all rounds of spending (except for the initial expenditure) until the dollars have completely “leaked out”
of the local economy.

Arts & Economic Prosperity IV | Americans for the Arts

21

Input-Output Analysis
A system of mathematical equations that combines statistical methods and economic theory in an area of
economic study called econometrics. Economists use this model (occasionally called an inter-industry model) to
measure how many times a dollar is re-spent in, or “ripples” through, a community before it “leaks out” of the
local economy by being spent non-locally (see Leakage below). The model is based on a matrix that tracks the
dollar flow between 533 finely detailed industries in each community. It allows researchers to determine the
economic impact of local spending by nonprofit arts and culture organizations on jobs, household income, and
government revenue.

Leakage
The money that community members spend outside of the local economy. This non-local spending has no
economic impact within the community. A ballet company purchasing shoes from a non-local manufacturer is an
example of leakage. If the shoe company were local, the expenditure would remain within the community and
create another round of spending by the shoe company.

Multiplier (often called Economic Activity Multiplier)
An estimate of the number of times that a dollar changes hands within the community before it leaks out of the
community (for example, the theater pays the actor, the actor spends money at the grocery store, the grocery store
pays its cashier, and so on). This estimate is quantified as one number by which all expenditures are multiplied.
For example, if the arts are a $10 million industry and a multiplier of three is used, then it is estimated that these
arts organizations have a total economic impact of $30 million. The convenience of a multiplier is that it is one
simple number; its shortcoming, however, is its reliability. Users rarely note that the multiplier is developed by
making gross estimates of the industries within the local economy with no allowance for differences in the
characteristics of those industries, usually resulting in an overestimation of the economic impact. In contrast, the
input-output model employed in Arts & Economic Prosperity IV is a type of economic analysis tailored
specifically to each community and, as such, provides more reliable and specific economic impact results.

Resident Household Income (often called Personal Income)
The salaries, wages, and entrepreneurial income residents earn and use to pay for food, mortgages, and other
living expenses. It is important to note that resident household income is not just salary. When a business receives
money, for example, the owner usually takes a percentage of the profit, resulting in income for the owner.

Revenue to Local and State Government
Local and state government revenue is not derived exclusively from income, property, sales, and other taxes. It
also includes license fees, utility fees, user fees, and filing fees. Local government revenue includes funds to city
and county government, schools, and special districts.

Frequently Asked Questions
This section answers some common questions about this study and the methology
used to complete it.
How were the 182 participating communities and regions selected?
In 2010, Americans for the Arts published a Call for Participants for communities interested in participating in the
Arts & Economic Prosperity IV study. Of the more than 200 participants that expressed interest, 182 agreed to
participate and complete four participation criteria: (1) identify and code the universe of nonprofit arts and culture
organizations in their study region; (2) assist researchers with the collection of detailed financial and attendance
data from those organizations; (3) conduct audience-intercept surveys at cultural events; and (4) pay a modest
cost-sharing fee (no community was refused participation for an inability to pay).

How were the eligible nonprofit arts organizations in each community selected?
Local partners attempted to identify their universe of nonprofit arts and culture organizations using the Urban
Institute’s National Taxonomy of Exempt Entity (NTEE) codes as a guideline. Eligible organizations included
those whose primary purpose is to promote appreciation for and understanding of the visual, performing, folk, and
media arts. Public arts councils, public presenting facilities or institutions, and embedded organizations that have
their own budget also were included if they play a substantial role in the cultural life of the community. For-profit
businesses and individual artists are excluded from this study.

What type of economic analysis was done to determine the study results?
An input-output analysis model was customized for each of the participating communities and regions to
determine the local economic impact their nonprofit arts and culture organizations and arts audiences. Americans
for the Arts, which conducted the research, worked with highly regarded economists to design the input-output
model used for this study.

What other information was collected in addition to the arts surveys?
In addition to detailed expenditure data provided by the surveyed organizations, extensive wage, labor, tax, and
commerce data were collected from local, state, and federal governments for use in the input-output model.

Why doesn’t this study use a multiplier?
When many people hear about an economic impact study, they expect the result to be quantified in what is often
called a multiplier or an economic activity multiplier. The economic activity multiplier is an estimate of the
number of times a dollar changes hands within the community (e.g., a theater pays its actor, the actor spends
money at the grocery store, the grocery store pays the cashier, and so on). It is quantified as one number by which
expenditures are multiplied. The convenience of the multiplier is that it is one simple number. Users rarely note,
however, that the multiplier is developed by making gross estimates of the industries within the local economy
and does not allow for differences in the characteristics of those industries. Using an economic activity multiplier
usually results in an overestimation of the economic impact and therefore lacks reliability.

Why are the admissions expenses excluded from the analysis of audience
spending?
Researchers make the assumption that any admissions dollars paid by event attendees are typically collected as
revenue for the organization that is presenting the event. The organization then spends those dollars. The
admissions paid by audiences are excluded because those dollars are captured in the operating budgets of the
participating nonprofit arts and culture organizations. This methodology avoids “double-counting” those dollars in
the analysis.

How is the economic impact of arts and culture organizations different from
other industries?
Any time money changes hands there is a measurable economic impact. Social service organizations, libraries,
and all entities that spend money have an economic impact. What makes the economic impact of arts and culture
organizations unique is that, unlike most other industries, they induce large amounts of related spending by their
audiences. For example, when patrons attend a performing arts event, they may purchase dinner at a restaurant, eat
dessert after the show, and return home and pay the baby-sitter. All of these expenditures have a positive and
measurable impact on the economy.

Will my local legislators believe these results?
Yes, this study makes a strong argument to legislators, but you may need to provide them with some extra help. It
will be up to the user of this report to educate the public about economic impact studies in general and the results
of this study in particular. The user may need to explain (1) the study methodology used; (2) that economists
created an input-output model for each community and region in the study; and (3) the difference between inputoutput analysis and a multiplier. The good news is that as the number of economic impact studies completed by
arts organizations and other special interest areas increases, so does the sophistication of community leaders
whose influence these studies are meant to affect. Today, most decision makers want to know what methodology
is being used and how and where the data were gathered.
You can be confident that the input-output analysis used in this study is a highly regarded model in the field of
economics (the basis of two Nobel Prizes in economics). However, as in any professional field, there is
disagreement about procedures, jargon, and the best way to determine results. Ask 12 artists to define art and you
may get 12 answers; expect the same of economists. You may meet an economist who believes that these studies
should be done differently (for example, a cost-benefit analysis of the arts).

How can a community not participating in the Arts and Economic Prosperity IV
study apply these results?
Because of the variety of communities studied and the rigor with which the Arts & Economic Prosperity IV study
was conducted, nonprofit arts and culture organizations located in communities that were not part of the study can
estimate their local economic impact. Estimates can be derived by using the Arts & Economic Prosperity IV
Calculator (found at www.AmericansForTheArts.org/EconomicImpact). Additionally, users will find sample
PowerPoint presentations, press releases, Op-Ed, and other strategies for proper application of their estimated
economic impact data.

Background
Introduction
One of the most important aspects of the quality of life in a community is the
establishment of parks and recreation facilities. A parks system provides areas for
leisure and fitness activities for the residents, preserves the natural heritage and
resources of an area, provides a visually appealing environment, and gives the citizens
a source of pride and adds character to a city or town.
The availability of sufficient park land, the cost of acquisition and improvements are
important considerations in developing suburban or urban parks and recreation
systems. The land suitable for park purposes rapidly diminishes as a city develops and
remaining land increases in value. Increases in population require more park space in
order to avoid existing facilities from becoming over-utilized. Park and recreation land
does not usually bring revenue into a city or town; tax revenue must be used to acquire
more land and then used to provide proper equipment and to maintain the facility
developed in a park. However, quality developments carefully planned may promote
increased real estate values and attract people to the community. In addition, the
physical and social developments of all participants is strongly influenced by the
recreational facilities and the programs provided by the system. For these reasons,
Hobart needs a well thought-out and planned park system. Because of the increase in
population and the changing needs of citizens, the parks and recreation system must
adapt to those needs. The Park Board will use this plan as a flexible guide for proper
parks and recreation development and natural resource management in order to
promote an increased quality of life for all the citizens of Hobart.
Purpose
This plan’s purpose is to provide a guide to short-range priorities and long-range
development to the Hobart Park Board for the City of Hobart park system. Set forth in
this plan are objectives, standards, and an assessment of needs in the park system thru
the year 2015. It will also address priority projects for the next five years.
Plan Objectives
--To provide a plan which will anticipate future demands and needs for park and
recreation facilities in Hobart and provide the Hobart Park Board with a flexible guide to
implementing the long-range development plan and the short-range priorities list.
--To develop a plan which will provide park and recreational opportunities to the entire
population of Hobart.

6

--To provide a plan for the appropriate use and management of the natural resources of
Hobart.
--To promote continued cooperation between the School City of Hobart and the Hobart
Park Board in the sharing of facilities and activities.
--To provide a plan that effectively coordinated with existing plans and programs of
Federal, State, Regional, and County Agencies in regards to park and recreation
development.
--To qualify the Hobart Park Board for continued participation in the Land and Water
Conservations Fund Grant Program administered by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources.
Hobart Park Board Priorities
--Replace the Festival Park Community Center which was damaged in the 2008 flood
event.
--Review usage and fees of parks/and or facilities and establish standards uniform for
use.
--Develop Park Foundation, a not-for-profit organization, to help raise funds for parks
and facilities.
--Develop a set of uniformed standards for community members wishing to contribute to
the parks to include memorials such as plaques, benches, and trees.
--Increase public awareness of park programs, events, and facilities offered.
--Establish a concession program in Hillman and Robinson Lake Park.
--Acquire additional park land to meet projected needs according to the conceptual
parks model and recommended standards.
--Research the availability of and apply for grants, which may be used as a funding
source to achieve the priorities included in this plan.
--To become more actively involved in the developer/plan commission negotiations
concerning the dedication of park land and facilities.
--To consolidate unutilized or underutilized park land into fewer, larger, better equipped,
and better maintained facilities.

7

Recreation Program Priorities
--To provide the community with a variety of fitness, life skills, recreational and special
interest programs.
--To continue to assist the Hobart Park Board with qualifying for state and federal grants
that will improve or acquire parks for the City of Hobart.
--To expand and improve the current programs which are offered by the Hobart Parks
and Recreation Department and to provide revenue from these programs for the
department.
--To acquire a professional membership in the Indiana Parks and Recreation
Association (NPRA).
Maintenance Priorities
--To continue to maintain the parks and their facilities to the highest degree of safety
and quality.
--To continue to expand the existing amenities in the parks in Hobart.
--To continue to provide the leadership skills needed for a quality workforce within the
department.
--To continue to work with other city departments, the Recreation Program of the Park
Board, and the Mayor, to improve the quality of life citizens of Hobart.

History of the Hobart Park Board

On April 25, 1923 the Common Council of the City of Hobart passed Ordinance #30
which created a Board of Trustees to control and manage the public parks of the City of
Hobart.
Ordinance #620 was passed by the Common Council of the City of Hobart on August 3,
1960 under the Acts of 1925 as amended and expressed in Burns Statutes 48-5901
through 48-5907 to provide for the acquisition of real property for playgrounds and
recreation centers. This ordinance also provided for a tax levy under Burns Statute 485906, such funds to be deposited in a recreation fund.
On April 3, 1963 the Common Council of the City of Hobart passed Ordinance
#687. This ordinance repealed Ordinance #30, empowered the Mayor to appoint a four
member park board to administer all funds in the recreation fund and created the Parks
and Recreation Department. This was done in accordance with the Acts of the General
Assembly of the State of Indiana of 1955 at Chapter 311.
Ordinance #704 was passed by the Common Council on August 17, 1963 and reestablished the Hobart Park Board after the Indiana General Assembly recodified and
revised the laws governing city government under Indiana Code 36-10-3. Under this
ordinance the Park Board is appointed by the Mayor, the Superintendent of Parks and
Recreation Department is established.
On February 21, 1996 the Hobart City Council passed Ordinance #96-02 creating a
Board of Park Commissioners under Indiana Code 36-10-4 thereby creating a
Department of Public Parks.
The Hobart Parks and Recreation Board administers the acquisition, development and
maintenance of park properties, sponsors a variety of recreation programs and sets
department policy.

History of Hobart, Indiana

Settlers came to the vicinity of Hobart, Indiana in 1837, giving it the distinction of being
one of the oldest settlements in the county. The first industry was established in the
area in 1845 when George Earle built a saw mill. Water was damned on the Deep
River to provide power for the area and Lake George was created. The town was
officially plotted in 1849 by George Earle and named Hobart in honor of his brother, F.
Hobart Earle. The introduction of rail service to Hobart (The Michigan Central Railroad
in 1858 and the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1860) soon attracted further growth to the
region. By 1879, Hobart had four brickyards, four lumberyards, general stores, meat
markets and shoemakers, besides having what was then advertised as the “finest hotel”
in Northwest Indiana.
Today, Hobart is mostly a residential community. This type of land use utilizes
approximately just over one-half of the total occupied area. Street and railroad right of
way occupy over 30% of the developed land. Commercial development demonstrates a
tendency to occupy strips along the thoroughfares and major access routes. Industry
comprises a very small amount of available land in the city, and is found mainly along
railroad rights of ways. Other land use in Hobart is devoted to park and recreation
development. Of this, the various waterfront parks, Festival Park, Lake Front, Robinson
Lake Park, Fred Rose Lakeshore Park and Pavese Park assume the largest
share. Schools and quasi-public areas constitute the rest of the City’s occupied
land. The former are located uniformly within various neighborhoods while the latter are
dispersed mainly throughout the downtown and western sections of town. Among the
larger uses in terms of site area are the cemeteries, Saint Mary Medical Center, the
Hobart Diagnostic Center, the former Charter Medical Center, the YMCA and the
various fraternal societies.

10

Physical and Natural Setting

Hobart, Indiana contains an area of 16,285 acres, and is located in the northeastern
section of Lake County. It is approximately 6 miles south of the extreme southern end
of Lake Michigan, bordered on the north by New Chicago and Lake Station with Gary
and Merrillville to the west and Portage to the east. It is easily accessible, being served
by three major railroads, two interstate highways and a major U.S. thruway (U.S. 30).
From a geological standpoint, the area in the vicinity of Hobart is contained, for the most
part, within the Calumet Lacustrine Plain. This formation is a sandy region surrounding
the southern end of Lake Michigan, marking the former site of Lake Chicago. The plain
of this former lake is subdivided into distinct topographic steps by three ancient beach
lines. Of the three terraces, Hobart is partially located on the last two. The middle
terrace, know as Calumet Beach, forms a belt more than 2 miles wide. The average
elevation along this formation is about 48 feet higher than Lake Michigan. Calumet
Beach is traversed by Ridge Road. This terrace is the highest and oldest of the ancient
beaches, and it marks the northern edge of the soils underlain by glacial till.
With respect to drainage within the city, storm runoff is transported by way of roadside
ditches and open surface drainage patterns that follow the natural topographical
contours of the land. As it now stands, most of Hobart’s urban runoff initially enters into
a channeled flow by way of Lake George and other local water courses.
As to recreation, the climate is generally well suited for most kinds of outdoor
activity. The winters are cold enough to support ice-skating and other such activities
while summers are warm enough to encourage swimming and boating. In short, there
is a wide variety of seasonal change.
According to the Soil Conservation Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture,
Hobart displays the occurrence of two major soil association types. The first soil type is
called Plainfield Watseka Association. It is not considered to be a very suitable soil for
most kinds of construction. When considered as a prospective topsoil source, suitability
is poor, although it does make a good fill. For most types of recreational facilities,
including campsites, playgrounds, and intensive play areas, the soil limitations range
from moderate to severe.
The second and by far the most common soil type found in Hobart is known as the
Alida-Del Ray –Whitaker Association. For the most part, the surroundings are generally
nearly level and somewhat poorly drained. The texture varies from medium to
moderately coarse on a base of stratified glacial outwash and lake sediments. This soil
association is considered very good when used for intensive cropping and also exhibits
possibilities as a good source of topsoil. However, because of the fine texture of the
soil, water will percolate rather slowly through it, impairing drainage and making it

11

vulnerable to periodic flooding depending on the height of the water table. Moderate
limitations are found with respect to recreations sites. When planning for such areas, it
would be advised that special provisions be made for adequate drainage from the site.
Flooding is another such aspect that must be studied, since it presents a potentially
dangerous situation causing property damage and loss of life. In Hobart, the Federal
Insurance Administration has defined a special flood hazard area which covers the flood
plain of the Deep River beginning at the north end of Lake George and extending north
to the corporate limit of Hobart, The flood plain extends between 500 and 1,200 feet
along either side of the river along this distance. During the flood of September, 2008,
(estimated by the Army Corps of Engineers as a 140 year storm event) significant
damage occurred to several of the park facilities located adjacent to Lake George, Deep
River, and other tributaries.
A glimpse of history can be seen in some of Hobart’s parks that still contain original
native plant communities that were around when the pioneers arrived. The best
example is Fred Rose Park, both 8th St. and Lakeshore sides where the unmowed flat
ground and the slopes are high quality oak savanna natural area. Fred Rose has
received good stewardship of nearly annual controlled burns, invasive species control,
and introduction of additional native plant species since 2001. Fred Rose has a number
of rare plant species, including bird’s foot violet and one-flowered broom rape, and two
species on Indiana Department of Natural Resources’ rare and endangered list—veiny
pea and rough rattlesnake-root. Natural areas such as this are literally irreplaceable
and it is important that they be protected and get good stewardship to stay
healthy. Natural areas provide ecological benefits such as clean water, wildlife habitat,
pollinators for food crops, and relaxing places for residents who enjoy nature.
Pavese Park has some oak savanna remnants including wild plum but it has had no
stewardship so its natural area is fading. The tiny Cardinal Court Park’s natural area is
also fading. Robinson Lake Park has some native oak savanna, prairie plants and
wetland under restoration. It is a common misconception that any land left unmowed or
unplowed will become natural area. Such land only returns to something like its native
state if native seed sources are nearby or in the soil, which is uncommon. Purposeful
restoration of native plant communities is possible, and can be quite successful at sites
that already have a nucleus of native plants present.

12

Location and Access

The City of Hobart is located partly in Hobart Township and partly in Ross Township in
the northeast portion of Lake County, Indiana. It shares its western boundary with the
City of Gary and the Town of Merrillville. Hobart shares its eastern limits with the City of
Portage and unincorporated Porter County. To the north are the City of Lake Station
and the Town of New Chicago. Its southern boundary is approximately ½ mile south of
U.S. 30, an east and west major thoroughfare. Interstate 65 (north and south) bisects
the western edge of the city while Interstate 80 and 94 (east and west) and the Indiana
Toll Road (east and west) are located approximately 1 ½ miles north of the city limits.
Both are accessible by way of I-65 or Indiana 51 which bisects the city north and
south. U.S. 6 traverses part of the northern boundary.
The Chicago South Shore and the South Bend Railroad Commuter service is available
approximately 3 miles north of the city limits. Additionally, the N & S Railroad freight rail
lines traverse the city limits of Hobart east and west.
The Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore along Lake Michigan is approximately 5 miles
from the City of Hobart’s northern boundary.

13

Economic Base

As stated in the introduction to this plan, parks and recreational facilities should be
planned and designed to meet the requirements of the community’s present and future
residents. In order to achieve this goal, past and present growth trends must be
identified and analyzed. This can be done if a benchmark is established. The obvious
benchmark is data available from the 1990, 2000, and 2008 Census. Due to changing
assumptions, unpredictable economic trends, and employment fluctuations, population
figures are estimates and in need of constant update. Table 1 (below) is intended to
show the City of Hobart’s population growth from 1940 through 2000.

Education and Income

The 2000 census figures indicate that the educational attainments of Hobart’s
population area are somewhat higher than those of the standard metropolitan statistical
area and very similar to the standard metropolitan statistical area outside the central
cities. The portion of the 25 years and over population which had completed high
school was 78.7%. By 2008 that had climbed to nearly 90%. However, the percentage
of residents with some college or degree dropped. The following information was taken
from the 1990 census in the City of Hobart, Indiana. The data for this particular topic
was not yet available from the 2000 census.

The census data above indicates an increasing population, which is also growing older.
As such, equipment intended for use by children is primarily being replaced by modern
facilities, and in only a few cases is it being expanded. Based on the census data and
surveys demand for adult facilities and programs is increasing. In recent years the Park
Board has responded to this increased demand by investing in the Lakefront
Development with the band shell, walk paths, and Community Center. Investment has
also occurred with softball fields at Hillman Park, boat launch at Pavese Park, and
passive recreation at Veterans Memorial Park. The economic condition of residents
remains middle class in most cases means that residents have the ability to pay for
programming which is requested.

17

Plan Framework

Introduction
The responsibility of providing park and recreation facilities lies with several
jurisdictional levels of government. By its nature and function, each jurisdictional level is
involved in different scales and types of recreation facilities. There is a definite need to
coordinate these levels of responsibility to insure that a full range of opportunities are
available and that needless duplication doe not occur. Toward this end, the
Northwestern Indiana Regional Planning Commission (NIRPC) and the Lake County
Parks and Recreation Department jointly developed a conceptual model of
responsibilities for park acreage and facility development. This model addresses
federal, state, county and municipal level responsibilities as a total delivery system. It
has also been incorporated in the adopted Regional Comprehensive Plan of NIRPC and
the adopted plan Lake County Park and Open Space Plan. It is recommended that this
model serve as a guide to local municipal park departments to best coordinate their
park development responsibilities with other agencies.
Conceptual Park Responsibilities Model
To assist in achieving objectives and provide a direction for the park and recreation
program, it is useful to work within an overall park and recreation framework. Table 5
provides an illustration of the levels of responsibility for the federal, state, county and
municipal jurisdictions.
Table 5 is adopted from a conceptual parks model developed by the Northwestern
Indiana Regional Planning Commission and utilized by the Lake County Park and
Recreation Board and an increasing number of cities and towns in Lake and Porter
Counties. The model reflects the fact that municipal park boards have traditionally been
geared to providing activity dominated by recreational facilities for local use. Municipal
level parks include community, neighborhood, and sub-neighborhood
parks. Neighborhood and sub-neighborhood parks are generally small and intensively
developed with active recreational facilities. Municipal community parks are usually
larger sized with specialized facilities, such as community centers, swimming pools, etc.,
and draw from a community wide service areas.

Standards

Given the overall conceptual parks model, a set of standards must be developed in
order to evaluate estimates of needed additional park land and recreational
facilities. Table 6 contains acreage standards for the federal, state, county and
municipal levels of responsibility. As this table indicates, the municipal responsibility of
10 acres per 1,000 populations is divided into eight acres for community parks and two
acres for neighborhood and sub-neighborhoods parks. It should be noted that the
recommended standards are a flexible planning tool and should not be interpreted as an
absolute statement. They provide a comparative “yardstick” which should be used in
conjunction with information reflecting a local demands and needs.
The recommended standards for recreational facilities are shown on Table 7. As
indicated, the principal community parks needs are in the area of active recreational
facilities. In the City of Hobart there is a particularly strong demand for updated
basketball courts, soccer fields, and baseball and softball diamonds. Additional
assessments as to Hobart’s acreage and facility needs and its capabilities and
opportunities in meeting these needs will be discussed later in this plan.

Hobart’s Needs Analysis
The City of Hobart is deficient not so much in park acreage, but rather in neighborhood
recreation facilities. With a population 29,059, the parks are deficient of softball fields,
tennis courts, basketball courts, playgrounds and other facilities. In addition, several
existing facilities such as picnic shelters and playground equipment is old and in need of
replacement. This is due to budgetary restrictions and the lack of a concerted effort to
require developers to install significant facilities in addition to donating land to the
city. The Planning Department in collaboration with the Park Department should initiate
a recreational needs assessment for each new development which would strain the
current facilities. This assessment should be made a part of the staff report
recommending conditions to the Plan Commission. As of 2008 the park department
was deficient approximately 15 acres of park land.
There is also an issue of low participation in programs offered by the park department
becomes apparent. As of 2001, very few programs were offered to the community, but
not from the lack of effort. In the City of Hobart established associations such as Hobart
Little League, Hobart Soccer League, Hobart Girls Softball, Hobart Youth Basketball
and Pop Warner Football offer many of the more popular sports. So in turn the park
department has offered sports that are not affiliated with these groups such as tennis
and aerobics.
The department also does not have adequate facilities to offer sports programs and
even life skill activities. The department must look to outside groups to house these
events such as the library, schools and even building facilities in the future that belong
to the department. Another problem is that the park department is small in regards to
staffing. This creates problems when trying to run programs for a significant amount of
people.
In December of 2000, the Hobart Park Board decided to split the superintendent’s
position and create two new positions, Maintenance Director and Recreation Program
Director. Due to significant budget difficulties, the Recreation Program Director position
was eliminated in 2008.
With a full time Recreation Program Director, the department had someone who could
solely concentrate on planning and executing new and existing programs. This position
was also responsible for applying for grants. This was seen as a way for the
department to acquire more park land and update the aging equipment. The full time
Maintenance Director was supposed to be able to concentrate on maintaining the parks
and other associated duties. This includes, but not limited to, repairing, replacing, and
maintaining playground equipment and picnic tables, trash removal and gardening. The

22

reversion to having one person in charge of both has stunted the growth of the Hobart
park facilities and programming.
Description of Community Facilities and Needs
A current and accurate inventory of recreation open space and facilities is necessary for
the development of a realistic park and recreation plan. By analyzing current acreage
and facilities and by studying growth trends the future needs and deficiencies can be
estimated. Inventory in the table below is the existing park land owned and operated by
the Hobart Park Commission categorized in terms of Community, Neighborhood and
Sub-Neighborhood parks. Additionally, public school open space is included in this
inventory as these acres and facilities must be partially taken into account when
planning for current and future park needs.

Population Forecasts

Using the park and recreation standards set forth in this plan, a comparison of the
inventory of park land can be made and recreation deficiencies identified.
Table 9 contains the actual 2000 population, and forecasts for the City of Hobart for
2008, 2010 and 2020. They were developed within the framework of the population and
employment forecasts recently formulated for Northwestern Indiana by NIRPC, and the
American Factfinder Population Estimates provided by the Census Bureau. These
estimates are significantly lower than originally projected using Geometric Progression,
for 2010-34,097 and 2020-41,677. As a result, the level of park land deficiency is
reduced.

Acreage and Facilities

The determination of park acreage and facility needs and deficiencies is based on the
conceptual parks model and recommended standards, the current inventory data and
estimated existing population forecasts.
Table 10 illustrates the existing acreage needs and forecasted needs for the years 2008,
2010 and 2020 based upon the current and forecasted population and the municipal
park acreage standard of 10 acres per 1,000 populations.
Comparing these needs to the current inventory yields estimates of the number of
additional needed acres (or acres deficient) for 2008, 2010 and 2020.

Accessibility and Universal Design

Many of the parks in the City of Hobart are quite old and do not provide opportunities for
those who have physical disabilities. In recent years an effort to enhance the parks in
the city has included the implementation of accessibility and universal design. As is
indicated in the list of 5-year improvements, the Hobart Park Board is planning to
aggressively update several parks under their jurisdiction. When enhancing these parks,
new handicap accessible playground units would be installed, handicap restrooms
updated where applicable and any other modifications completed where needed.
In order to achieve this goal the park board must take in account budgetary limitations,
and the availability of grant funds. With over 20 parks in the system and many of them
containing old equipment this will take time and will be costly. It is recommended that a
partnership be forged between the Building and Park Departments in order to ensure
that improvements are ADA compliant. The Hobart Park Board does in fact intend to
conform to the accessibility and universal design guidelines and will continue with these
efforts until all parks comply. To that end, a self-inspection was conducted in 2010.
The summary results are as follows:
Amber Creek – an ADA compliant picnic shelter and playground built in 2010.
Arbor Lane – an ADA compliant playground is in place; compliant picnic shelter
scheduled for 2012.
Barrington Ridge - ADA compliant picnic shelter and playground in place.
Brookview – ADA compliant picnic shelter and playground scheduled for 2011.
City Ball Park – restrooms, picnic shelter, and playground are ADA compliant.
Emily Silich – not ADA compliant playground, but relatively new; replacement beyond 5
year study period.
Englehart - ADA compliant playground scheduled for 2013.
Festival/Community Center – restrooms compliant; ADA compliant playground
scheduled for 2011.
Fred Rose/8th Street - ADA compliant picnic shelter and playground scheduled for 2013.
Fred Rose/Lakeshore - ADA compliant picnic shelter and playground scheduled for
2011.

28

Glenwood - ADA compliant picnic shelter and playground scheduled for 2013.
Hillman Heights - an ADA compliant playground and picnic shelter is in place.
Hillman Softball - ADA compliant bathrooms are in place; new shelter scheduled beyond
5-year plan.
Hobart Pool – extensive renovation in 2007; ADA compliant.
Jerry Pavese - ADA compliant playground, restrooms, and shelter is in place.
Lakefront – ADA compliant walkway in place.
McAfee - ADA compliant playground scheduled for 2012; new shelter scheduled beyond
5-year plan.
Pennsy - ADA compliant playground scheduled for 2012; new shelter scheduled beyond
5-year plan.
Rugby Field – not ADA compliant; bathrooms, new shelter scheduled beyond 5-year
plan.
Robinson Lake – not ADA compliant; install new restrooms and playground in 2012,
parking and concessions in 2014, and shelter in 2015.
Ted Hansen - an ADA compliant picnic shelter and playground in place.
Veterans - ADA compliant restrooms, picnic shelter, and playground in place.

Park and Facility Descriptions

CITY BALL PARK
Located at 400 E. 8th Street this park totals approximately 3.6 acres in a residential
area. It contains a baseball diamond, with concrete block dugouts, a 2 story frame and
block building housing a scorer’s booth, handicapped accessible restrooms and storage
area. It also contains a basketball court, horseshoe pits, a small picnic area, swings
and a modular playground set
This area is maintained by the parks maintenance department except during the middle
school baseball season during which time the School City of Hobart conducts the
maintenance. Improvements to the baseball field area and its buildings are shared with
the School City of Hobart and the Parks and Recreation Department. Since the
previous master plan was adopted, new fencing and backstops have been added. In
addition, a new high school was constructed and the middle school was moved to the
former high school location.
FRED ROSE PARK 8TH STREET
This park totals approximately 20 acres and is located at 200 W. 8th Street adjacent to
Hobart Middle School in a residential neighborhood on the shores of Lake George. It
was connected to Fred Rose Park Lakeshore via a suspension bridge which was
removed due to the age and unsafe conditions of the bridge. This park contains 5
lighted tennis courts, 3 lighted basketball courts, a parking lot, large picnic area, one
small shelter and one large shelter and various playground equipment sets. The side
slopes to the lake have historic silt loam oak savanna, typical of the area before the
European settlers arrived.
Fred Rose Park 8th Street is also the headquarters for the park maintenance department,
which is housed in a 3-bay garage and a pole barn for equipment storage. All
maintenance is handled by the Parks & Recreation Department with the exception of
the tennis courts, which is shared with the School City of Hobart.
FRED ROSE LAKESHORE
This park is located on the shores of Lake George at 200 Lake Shore Drive. This park
is approximately 20 acres and was connected to Fred Rose Park 8th Street by a
suspension bridge. This bridge was removed due to age of the bridge and unsafe
conditions. It is adjacent to a residential area and contains a large shelter with ten
tables and a small shelter. The larger shelter is old and is in need of replacement.
There is also a walk trail and a modular playground set. This park is used primarily for

30

picnicking and walking. The side slopes to the lake have historic silt loam oak savanna,
typical of the area before the European settlers arrived. There are also old restroom
facilities in the park
JERRY PAVESE PARK
This park is located at 500 S. Lake Park Avenue on the north shore of Lake George and
is approximately 6 acres. It contains 2 tennis courts, combination storage and restroom
building, shuffleboard court, horseshoe pits, playground equipment including a modular
set, a boat ramp, basketball courts, a six table shelter and a log cabin that is owned and
run by various scouting agencies in the area. The restrooms and the shelter are
handicapped accessible and picnic tables are place throughout the park in the summer.
The Hobart Parks & Recreation Department received a Land and Water Conservation
Fund grant from Indiana Department of Natural Resources to acquire approximately 6.4
acres of wooded land west of the existing portion of Pavese Park. A pedestrian bridge
will link the two parcels and lead to a walking trail to be built going around and through
the parks.
There have been significant improvements since the previous masterplan. A new boat
dock, a boat ramp, a new playground area, new restrooms and expanded parking is
now in place and has a high rate of usage.
HILLMAN PARK
This park is 40 acres and is located at 2555 W. Old Ridge Road. It contains three
softball fields (2 lighted), a basketball court, handicapped accessible restrooms,
horseshoe pits, volleyball goal, a storage building, playground equipment and two large
picnic shelters. Numerous other picnic tables are placed throughout the parks. There is
approximately 23 acres of property in the rear of this facility owned by the School City of
Hobart, which remains undeveloped. Improvements since the previous masterplan
include paving the access drives, rebuilt picnic shelters, drainage improvements, and
new handicapped accessible walk path. Anticipated short-term improvements include
drainage, fencing, and new dugouts for the north field.
This park is mainly used for the softball leagues that are offered through the Parks &
Recreation Department. The summer league is in June and July and usually consists of
32-42 teams. The fall league is in September and October and averages about 24-32
teams.
ROBINSON LAKE PARK
This 30 acre park is located on the west side of Hobart at 52nd and Liverpool
Road. Robinson is unique because it contains a 17-acre lake. The lake is stocked with
fish and is open to the public for fishing. No gas motors are allowed on the lake and no

31

boat ramp is available. Canoes and other non-motorized boats are allowed. Due to
funding difficulties the supervised swim and boating activities were suspended in 2008.
Since that time the Park Board has funded new playground equipment and generally
improved appearance, including a painted mural provided by the Friends of Robinson
Lake on the wall of the old restroom building and increased attention to mowing and
erosion control.
Robinson Lake is in the epicenter of 355 acres of DNR property. The property will be
commencing wetland remediation in 2011 forward. The Planning Department is in the
process of securing a grant that will study and formalize a plan for this sub-area of the
city, with Robinson Lake being the focus.
This facility is used by a large number of people during the summer. At the time of the
last masterplan, the park had two large shelters, many picnic tables, two sand volleyball
courts, playground equipment, walking trails, horseshoe pits, and paddleboat
rental. There were also handicapped accessible restrooms and a block building for
storage and lifeguard office. More than other parks, Robinson has deteriorated to a
marginal facility with outdated playground equipment, washroom facilities which have
fallen into disrepair, and a walk trail with erosion and tripping hazards. This park more
than others holds a great deal of potential because of the size and water feature not
found in other parks. It will also serve as a trailhead for the Oak Savanna trail. In
addition, there is approximately up to 50 acres of wooded property to the north of
Robinson Lake which should be considered for acquisition.
FESTIVAL PARK
By far the most widely used park in the system, this 14-acre site is located at 111 E. Old
Ridge Road on Lake George and close to the Hobart downtown area. The park
contains a parking lot, fountain, and playground equipment, Revelli Bandshell and the
Community Center. The band shell is used during the summer for a concert series
sponsored by the City Improvement Committee and for many weddings.
During the September 2008 flood the Hobart Community Center was damaged beyond
repair. Until May 2010, it was closed waiting for funding so that a new building could
replace it. In May, 2010, the City broke ground on a new $950,000, 4,800 square foot
facility with a 150 capacity banquet room, 25 capacity conference/classroom
combination, 2 offices, kitchen, beverage station, and large outdoor patio area. The
building opened in October, 2010.
The previous Community Center contained the main office for the Parks and Recreation
Department. Various functions were also held there. In the morning, during the week it
is used as a senior center. Currently a separate organization offers nutritional lunches
and recreation opportunity. Two nights a week an aerobic class was offered through
the Park Department. Groups and private parties also rented out this facility for a
variety of functions.

32

The previous building, however, was old and had many limitations which kept it from
being an attractive, energy efficient, highly desirable venue for a wedding reception,
graduation party, showers, business meetings, etc. The new Community Center will
greatly expand the revenue potential of the site and will offer the residents of Hobart an
exciting new opportunity to enjoy the lakefront like never before.
LAKEFRONT PARK
Lakefront Park is approximately 2 acres. It is located in downtown Hobart along Lake
George. In 1996 Lakefront Park underwent major construction. It was developed with
city funds, park bonds, LWCF grant, and INDOT funds and with Hobart Industrial
Economic Development Corporation donations.
It now consists of a fishing pier, clock tower, a walking path, landscaping, park benches
and decorative lighting. It is a very popular place for area residents to fish, walk, run,
walk their pet, and enjoy outdoor concerts or a quiet passive time.
Phase III, which is located behind City Hall a 414 Main Street, was completed after the
previous master plan. It continues the metamorphosis which has occurred along what
used to be an underdeveloped, ill-maintained eye sore into an appealing popular
recreational feature. Aesthetic improvements were the focus of this last phase, which
included another fishing and boat dock, parking lot beautification and landscaping, and
decorative wall bank stabilization. The lake front development has dramatically
increased life and activity into the downtown area, and has given the City a powerful
sense of identity. The area from the dam to the Old Ridge Road Bridge is scheduled for
similar access, recreational, and aesthetic improvements.
RIVERFRONT PARK
This park is 14 acres and contains a rugby field and a walking trail around the field. It is
located across from Festival Park and is close to the downtown area. It is bordered by
Deep River on the east side which flows for fishing access. The park is flanked by two
gravel parking lots. The western parking lot contains a storage building, a separate
office building, and a recycling drop-off area. This park has been home to the
Northwest Indiana Exiles Men’s rugby club for several years. The team has worked in
addition to the city to help maintain the field and the lighting.
DOUGHBOY MONUMENT
This ¼ acre site is located at 7th and Main Streets in Hobart. It was erected in 1925 as
a memorial to Hobart residents who lost their lives in World War I. Since that time
memorial plaques have been place on the monument in memory of those who lost their
lives in World War II, Korea and Vietnam. In the spring of 2001 a major restoration of
the doughboy took place. The original base was copied in its exact shape and on
identical yet smaller base was made for the new 50’ flagpole in front of the

33

doughboy. The grassy area, upon which the doughboy base and flagpole previously set,
was removed and a concrete curb was constructed in the shape of a cross. In the
center of this curbed area are brick pavers; engraved bricks are available to veterans
only at a cost of $25.00 per brick. The doughboy statue itself was removed to a secure
location during the construction. It was sandblasted, all the holes and pits were silver
soldered and it was painted with automotive paint and clear coated, as were the
plaques.
THIRD STREET PARKWAY
This 2-acre site contains three park islands on Third Street between Ash Street and
Lake Park Avenue. It is one of the main roadways to the downtown Hobart
area. Planning and Economic Development Departments have secured additional
funding through Transportation Enhancement Funds to increase downtown
streetscapes. Several flowering decorative trees were added which provide color from
early spring through late fall. This area is maintained only as a greenbelt with some
shrubbery and flowers planted at each end of each island. There are no active
recreational uses on this parkway. It is maintained by the Park Department.
CARDINAL COURT
This one acre site is located southwest of Cardinal Court on Lake George adjacent to
the abandoned E.J. & E Railroad right-of-way. This site is undeveloped because of the
terrain and limited accessibility. It is located in a cul de sac and appears as a residential
lot which was not developed. There is not enough available property on this lot for a
single family home. It is unlikely that this property would ever be utilized by the Park
Department, and as such the Park Board should consider selling this parcel. The
proceeds could enhance existing parks which are in need of new playground equipment
and picnic shelters.
DEEP RIVER ACCESS
Two sites totaling ½ acre each along Deep River in the southern part of the city in Deep
River Estates subdivision along 61st Avenue. These sites cannot be developed as the
majority of the property lies within a flood plain.
ENGLEHART PARK
This is a park at 4101 Howard Street in a remote location in the back of a subdivision. It
is approximately one acre, and is bordered on the east by a cemetery, on the south by
open space and on the north and west by residential homes. It contains a backstop,
playgrounds equipment and picnic tables. This park appears to be utilized very
sparingly and based on the results of the survey, consideration should be made to sell
this property as excess.

34

PENNSY PARK
Located in a populated neighborhood at 925 Lillian Street, this 2.2 acre site is widely
used. It contains a basketball court, playground equipment, a small shelter and a tennis
court. It also contains a small softball practice field with a backstop. In the summer
picnic tables are placed in the park. The playground equipment is in poor shape and
should be replaced and significantly enlarged as soon as possible. The park also
contains the old Pennsylvania Rail Road station, which was built in 1914. The City
assumed ownership of the building in 2004. In recent years the Chamber of Commerce
has had exclusive use of the building. Thought should be given to dedicating the
building to potential expanded recreational programs offered by the park department.
MCAFEE PARK
This 2.6-acre facility is located in the middle of a large subdivision on Hobart’s east side
at 2630 Drexel Drive. It is used to practice softball and contains playground equipment,
a basketball court and picnic tables in the summer. Parking is available only on the
streets outside the park. A significant amount of open space is available for additional
activities and recreational equipment.
BROOKVIEW PARK
Located on the southwest side of Hobart at 1715 Minnesota Street is a 1.5-acre park
site. It is in a subdivision and contains a two-table shelter, playground equipment,
swings and a basketball court. The playground equipment and swings are old design
and should be replaced.
GLENWOOD PARK
This facility is located at 15th Place and Swift Street in Glenwood subdivision in the
southwest corner of the city. Although it contains approximately 6.8-acres only 1 acre is
developed for park use. The undeveloped area is heavily wooded and has unsuitable
terrain for park development. The developed portion contains playground equipment,
basketball court, and is supplied with picnic tables in the summer. Access to this park is
limited to a narrow path between two houses, but it appears that the park is used by
neighborhood residents. The swings are old and should be replaced.
MERRILLVILLE HEIGHTS
This park is 3-acres. It did contain limited playground equipment, however, that has
been removed. The park like so many others has limited access and is not used often.
Unfortunately developers were allowed to dedicate property for park use, which was
remote and not buildable. With so much of the park in wetlands, an ecological
education center could be a more appropriate use for the property.

35

VETERAN’S MEMORIAL PARK
This park is approximately 39 acres and is located at 5899 East 73rd Avenue. Veteran’s
Park is impressive and modern, and contains handicap accessible restrooms, storage
area, a soccer field and 2 picnic shelters. There is also a veteran memorial as you
enter this park. There is sufficient property to expand and add new features to the park.
Access to the park is excellent and parking is more than adequate for the existing
features. The results of the survey may result in recommendation about these new
features.
ARBOR LANE PARK
This park is located at Hillcrest and Barberry in the Arbor Lane subdivision. This park
has a modular playground unit and swings. As stated earlier, this is a glaring example
of the City not requiring sufficient investment on the part of the developer to not only
dedicate property, but also install appropriate equipment in a new park intended to
provide recreational facilities to a large subdivision, which is somewhat remote from
other park facilities.
BARRINGTON PARK
This park is approximately 1.5-acres and is located in the Barrington Ridge
subdivision. This park has a modular playground unit, swings, and a picnic shelter. It is
significantly smaller than it should be for the size of the development. The comments in
the Arbor Lane Park paragraph apply here as well.
HILLMAN HEIGHTS
This park is 4-acres and is located on North Hansen Boulevard in Hillman Heights'
subdivision. This park has a modular playground unit, horseshoe pit, swings and a
picnic table. A basketball court and picnic shelter has been added since the previous
master plan was adopted.
TED HANSEN MEMORIAL PARK
This one acre park is located on Liverpool Road between Old Ridge Road and 38th
Avenue. This park has a modular playground unit, horseshoe pit, swings and a picnic
table. It provides adequate neighborhood park facilities to a neighborhood which is
somewhat remote from other park facilities.
SILICH PARK
This new 1.2 acre park was named after a popular City Councilperson who was a strong
supporter of expanded park facilities. The park is located east of Wisconsin Street
adjacent to an apartment complex and the YMCA property. It contains a picnic shelter,
tennis courts, modular playground equipment, and a basketball court. Located near a
36

high density multifamily development, it provides necessary open space and recreation
opportunities in close proximity.
AMBER CREEK
Amber Creek is an 80 lot subdivision located northeast of the intersection of Colorado
Street and 61st Avenue. Until July, 2010 the subdivision did not include recreational
facilities, however, a 2 acre tract was deeded to the City as open space, when the
subdivision was approved. It is adjacent to a storm water retention area central to the
subdivision and directly accessible from a public thoroughfare. In July, 2010 playground
equipment, swings, and picnic shelter was installed. This recently developed park
property will serve the immediate recreational needs of the residents of Amber Creek.
The development of this park was a high priority for the Hobart Park Board for 2010.
HOBART POOL
The Hobart Pool was built in 1962 and owned and operated by a private association
which sold memberships and rented pool facilities for special events. In 2004 the
association ran into financial difficulties and was unable to open the pool the next
season. In 2005 the Hobart Industrial Economic Development Corporation purchased
the pool and deeded it to the City. During the 2005 season the pool attracted 6,000
visitors in the 46 days it was open. In 2006 the pool was visited by 6,200 persons.
After the 2006 season the pool was closed to make repairs. The City spent $123,000
and reopened the pool in July, 2007. During that abbreviated 26 day season there were
3,746 visitors. Attendance since has climbed to 6,684 in 2008, 8,038 in 2009, and
11,067 in 2010. The acquisition of the pool offers an important summer time
recreational opportunity. The usage of the pool is expected to grow, but no major
improvements are expected during the 5-year study period.

Current Programs

Softball League
The Softball Director oversees this program which runs in the summer and again in the
fall. All games are played at Hillman Park.
In the summer, the Softball Director is on site to handle any problems that may
arise. Their duties include scheduling umpires, field maintenance, and equipment
inventory. The summer league is played in June and July with about 32-42 teams
playing a 14 game schedule with a single elimination tournament. In the summer of
2010, 40 teams participated in the league in five separate divisions.
In the fall, the league is run in September and October with about 24-32 teams playing a
10 game schedule with a double elimination tournament. In the fall of 2010, 32 teams
participated in 4 separate divisions.
Aerobics
This program is held on Tuesdays and Thursdays at the Hobart Middle School. The
classes are taught by an instructor and last for an hour. There are usually 6-10
participants each class.
Swimming
In 2005 the Hobart Pool was purchased from a private membership group and
extensive renovation took place until the facility reopened in July, 2007. Since its
availability, it offers a unique opportunity to provide recreational swimming in addition to
lessons. Attendance has grown from 3,746 in 2007 to over 11,000 in 2010.
Bus Trips
The Parks and Recreation Department offers various bus trips throughout the year. In
the spring and fall there is a trip to Shipshewana and the flea market. The trip usually
attracts an average of 50 participants. The department also offers monthly bus trips to
casinos in Lake County. The trip usually attracts an average of 100 participants.

Trail System in Hobart

Results from our most recent survey and the popularity that bike trails have gained in
recent years have given more proof that a local bike trail is needed in Hobart. Lake and
Porter Counties have established an extensive trail system in recent years. Lake
County has completed construction on Phase I of this project. The project provides
continuous trails from Oak Ridge Prairie County Park in Griffith to Wisconsin Street and
from Indiana Highways 51 and 130 to the Porter County Line. Phase II of this project
was also completed providing the continuation of the trail from Wisconsin Street to east
of Main Street, where the path returns to an on-road system.
The City of Hobart is working with Lake County Parks to provide linkage between Main
Street and the Indiana Highways 51 and 130 intersection. Currently, Hobart is in the
planning process for the remainder of this linkage and the city does intend on
constructing the link thru the City of Hobart.
Once the Hobart’s portion of the Oak Savannah Trail has been complete attention will
shift to other trails that go through Hobart and connect to other regional or national
trails. The town of Merrillville has recently acquired funding to complete their length of
the abandoned C&O railroad corridor to Hobart at Mississippi Street. It will be Hobart’s
responsibility to acquire funding and continue the trail heading east and terminate at our
municipal boundary. This will be a challenge because the corridor heading east has
been disrupted by the development of the shopping center. An alternate path will need
to be created towards Colorado Street and Crossing US 30 and eventually linking back
with the preserved abandoned rail corridor. The City of Hobart will need to coordinate
with land owners, government agencies, and potential users to identify the best solution
to this issue.
Hobart also intends to construct trails throughout the city that will eventually link to the
Oak-Savannah Trail. These are tentative plans and are detailed in the map labeled,
“Hobart Trail System.”
In 2007 NIRPC published their Greenways and Blueways Plan, which included a map
that indicates water trails in the three county region. The map identifies two proposed
water trails, Turkey Creek and Deep River, as systems that utilize Lake George as a
critical link in their networks. Specifically, Lakeview Park has been listed in the plan to
be a potential trailhead for the Deep River system which offers a launching point both
canoeist and kayaks alike.

43

Potential Funding Sources

Limited budgets, escalating land values, increased maintenance costs, soaring
construction costs have all contributed to the difficulty of parks and recreation
departments to develop comprehensive park systems. Alternative sources of funding
and resources are necessary for parks and recreation department to meet their growing
needs and demands. The Hobart Parks and Recreation Department should actively
pursue alternative funding sources in order to insure adequate parks, recreation
facilities and programs. Several funding sources include:
CMAQ, TE, DNR
The Northwestern Indiana Regional Planning Agency administers multiple funding
sources including Congestion Management/Air Quality, and Transportation
Enhancement Programs. These funds can be applied toward pedestrian/bike trails, and
other improvements which reduce vehicular traffic congestion and air pollution, and/or
encourage the use of alternative modes of transportation, and link residents and places
of business to other destinations of choice. The Indiana Department of Natural
Resources also grants funding directly to municipalities for similar projects. In addition,
the DNR provides funding for the purchase and restoration of environmentally sensitive
properties which merit preservation and protection.
Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF)
This fund is a 50% matching grant from the federal government that is administered
through the state. This grant assists park and recreation departments in acquiring and
developing outdoor recreation facilities for the community.
Tax Abatement
This is 1% of a house value up to $1000. Each homeowner must pay this before an
occupancy permit is issued. After the permit is issued homeowners can then quality for
6-year abatement. This money is put into a special fund for park improvement. This
fund is non-reverting.
General Obligation Bonds
The Parks and Recreation Board can levy bonds for acquisition and/or development of
facilities. Total bonding capacity is limited to two percent of the assessed valuation of
taxable property in the city.

44

Donations
Donations can be in the form of land, money, materials, or services. To be an effective
option an efficient, publicized guideline for the acceptance of such gifts should
exist. Currently the Hobart Parks and Recreation Department has a donation fund in
use. This fund is used exclusively for park acquisition and development.
National Endowment for the Arts
This program channels funds through both federal and state levels. Though not
necessarily large, the grants available are quite helpful in initiating recreational
programs and suppo0rting them for several years so that they have an opportunity to
become establishes.
Private Financing
Private foundations make grants available for agencies wishing to attempt certain
projects. Researching these foundation’s goals preferred project emphasis and project
development is extremely time consuming. This source of funding does merit
consideration because of the large amount of fund potentially available.
Service Clubs
The City of Hobart continues to have a great many service organizations, many of which
donate funds, materials from time to time to the Hobart Parks and Recreation
Department. Some of these organizations specify what the donations are to be used for
but many do not. The clubs that do not regularly donate to the parks and recreation
department could be a source for additional revenue.
Internal Revenue
The park department generates revenue from a few programs to cover daily operating
expenses associated with the activity being provided.

45

Public Meetings/Public Participation

The public meetings were held during the regular Park Board Meetings. These
meetings were posted as announcements in the Post-Tribune and Times.
In attendance were all newspapers and approximately a half dozen citizens of
Hobart. Among the suggestions from the community were expansion of bus trips and
an ice skating rink.
In order to achieve a well thought out and informed parks and recreation plan it is
necessary to gain as much public input as possible. To achieve our goal of determining
the needs and desires of Hobart, a variety of methods were used to gain this
input. These are outlined below:
Questionnaires
A survey form was developed in order to determine which parks were utilized at what
rate, which recreational activities were enjoyed by survey participants, which programs
and facilities were lacking and what improvements were recommended. The Mayor’s
office was instrumental in arranging for the survey form to be mailed along with utility
bills in June, 2010. A copy of the survey form is included in the appendices.
Public Meeting
Several public meetings were held asking for input to the plan. Two area newspapers,
The Times and Post-Tribune were advised of their date, time and location.
Park Commission
At the regular monthly meetings of the Hobart Park Commission comments and input in
reference to this plan were asked from those in attendance at these meeting. The
Commission itself made its own recommendations and suggestions.

46

Survey Results

Survey forms were sent to nearly 7,200 households, with 793 returned. Over half of the
participants have lived in Hobart for more than 20 years. Only 24 renters responded.
Over half (420) have households of 2 or fewer. Only 84 responders have families with 4
or more. Most of those surveyed indicated that they have attended several City parks,
with Festival Park (500) being the most popular. The next 9 include: Hobart Pool (224),
Robinson Lake (210), Community Center (203), Fred Rose and Pavese at (185) each,
City Ball Park (178), Fred Rose-8th Street (147), Hillman (133), and Veterans (133).
Englehart Park reported no visits among those submitting a survey.
Biking (329), swimming (290), fishing (276), hiking (259), boating (161), and golf (143)
was listed as the most popular recreational activities enjoyed by survey participants. A
total of 33 activities had at least some response. The most popular response to the
need for new facilities was a dog park (38), additional restroom s (28), and playgrounds,
boat rental, and teen center all with (10) responses. Only 183 suggestions were made
concerning additional facilities being needed. 41 different programs were suggested to
be added with only 5 receiving more than 10 responses; running club (35), nature walks
(21), summer kids program (21), aerobics (14), and art and crafts for kids (14).
129 surveys indicated an excellent maintenance effort, with 427 indicating good, 91 fair
and only 21 poor. The age group most in need of additional activities ranged from 143
responses for ages 18-65 to 77 for over 65.

costs and benefits

“This carefully documented study
conclusively demonstrates the financial,
environmental, and other benefits of
using green technologies in schools. In fact,
failure to invest in green technologies is not financially responsible for school
systems; the study uses conservative accounting practices to show that
investments in green technologies significantly reduce the life-cycle cost of
operating school buildings. And the public benefits of green schools are even
larger than those that work directly to the financial advantage of schools. These
include reductions in water pollution, improved environmental quality, and
increased productivity of learning in an improved school environment.”
— Henry Kelly, President, Federation of American Scientists

”This important study persuasively demonstrates that it costs little more to
build high performance, healthy schools and that there are enormous financial,
educational and social benefits to students, schools and society at large.”
— Edward J. McElroy, President, American Federation of Teachers, AFL-CIO

Executive Summary
Some 55 million students spend their days in schools that are too often unhealthy and
that restrict their ability to learn. A recent and rapidly growing trend is to design schools
with the specific intent of providing healthy, comfortable and productive learning
environments. These green, high performance schools generally cost more to build,
which has been considered a major obstacle at a time of limited school budgets and
an expanding student population. A 2005 survey by Turner Construction Company of
665 senior executives found that executives are discouraged from undertaking green
construction because of concerns about cost, and a lack of awareness and available
information on the financial benefits of green buildings. 2

This report is intended to answer this fundamental question: how much
more do green schools cost, and is greening schools cost effective?

Greening school design
provides an extraordinarily
cost-effective way to
enhance student learning.

Conventional schools are typically designed just to meet building codes — that are
often incomplete. Design of schools to meet minimum code performance tends to
minimize initial capital costs but delivers schools that are not designed specifically
to provide comfortable, productive, and healthy work environments for students
and faculty. Few states regulate indoor air quality in schools or provide for minimum
ventilation standards. Not surprisingly, a large number of studies have found that schools
across the country are unhealthy — increasing illness and absenteeism and bringing
down test scores.
This report documents the financial costs and benefits of green schools compared to
conventional schools. This national review of 30 green schools demonstrates that green
schools cost less than 2% more than conventional schools - or about $3 per square
foot ($3/ft2) - but provide financial benefits that are 20 times as large. Greening school
design provides an extraordinarily cost-effective way to enhance student learning,
reduce health and operational costs and, ultimately, increase school quality and
competitiveness.
The financial savings are about $70 per ft2, 20 times as high as the cost of going green.
(Table A) Only a portion of these savings accrue directly to the school. Lower energy
and water costs, improved teacher retention, and lowered health costs save green
schools directly about $12/ft2, about four times the additional cost of going green. For
an average conventional school, building green would save enough money to pay for an
additional full-time teacher. Financial savings to the broader community are significantly
larger, and include reduced cost of public infrastructure, lower air and water pollution,
and a better educated and compensated workforce.
Green schools provide a range of additional benefits that are not quantified in this
report, including reduced teacher sick days, reduced operations and maintenance
costs, reduced insured and uninsured risks, improved power quality and reliability,
increased state competitiveness, reduced social inequity, and educational enrichment.
There is insufficient data to quantify these additional benefits, but they are substantial
and, if calculated, would substantially increase the recognized financial benefits of
greening schools.
Building healthy high performance school buildings is now far more fiscally prudent and
lower risk than building conventional, inefficient and unhealthy school buildings.

Methodology and Assumptions
net present value
Conventional schools usually have lower design and construction costs and higher
operational costs, whereas green schools usually have higher design and construction
costs and lower operational costs. To evaluate the current value of a future stream of



financial benefits and costs, we use net present value (NPV) analysis, with 2006
as our base year. NPV represents the present value of an investment’s discounted
future financial benefits minus any initial investment. A positive number indicates a
good investment.

term
This report assumes a 20 year term for benefits in new buildings. A lower, 15 year term
for energy efficiency savings in retrofitted existing buildings would be appropriate.
A longer term is assumed for a new building because green design affects more
permanent features — such as orientation, wall construction, and amount of insulation
— which tend to last for the life of building, typically at least 50 years.

inflation
This analysis assumes an inflation rate of 2% per year, in line with most conventional
inflation projections. Unless otherwise indicated, this report makes a conventional
assumption that most costs as well as benefits rise at the rate of inflation. The things
that are not assumed to rise at the rate of inflation are energy, emissions value, water,
waste water and health costs — which are assumed to rise faster than inflation. The rate
increases for these are discussed in the relevant sections.

discount rate
To arrive at present value and net present value estimates, projected future costs and
benefits must be discounted to provide a fair value in today’s dollars. Present value
calculations are made on the basis of a relatively conservative 7% discount rate (i.e., 5%
real interest rate plus an assumed 2% inflation). 3 This is higher than the rate at which
states, the federal government, and many corporations borrow money.4

definition of green schools
All green school designs are to a substantial extent based on the US Green Building
Council’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), which is the national
consensus green building standard. An application of LEED for schools was developed
for California schools, and is called Collaborative for High Performance Schools (CHPS). 5
This standard was then adapted for Massachusetts schools (MA CHPS),6 and in 2003,
Washington State released its own Washington Sustainable School (WSS) Protocol
for High Performance Facilities,7 also based on a variant of CHPS and LEED. The green
schools we analyzed were based on either LEED, MA CHPS, or WSS.

Average national school construction cost is $150/ft2. 8
The “green premium” is the initial extra cost to build a green building compared to a
conventional building. Typically this cost premium is a result of more expensive (and
sustainably-sourced) materials, more efficient mechanical systems, and better design,
modeling and integration, and other high performance features. Many school architects
use a state or school district’s pre-determined budget as their metric for appropriate
school cost. Some green schools are built on the same budget as conventional schools.
The report data are drawn from 30 green schools built in 10 states during the period
2001 to 2006. The data on costs as well as savings compared to a conventional design
were generally supplied by the schools’ architects. Some of the costs analyzed in the
report are based on actual building performance, while some new school costs are
estimates based on architectural modeling and engineering estimates. We generally
relied on the costs reported by architects based on their actual and modeled green
and conventional versions of the same building. For a breakout of all schools analyzed,
see Table B.



Four of the green schools (in Georgia, Massachusetts and Oregon) cost no more than
conventional design, while several schools cost substantially more. Six schools cost
at least 3% more than conventional design while one – the Punahou School in Hawaii
– costs 6.3% more. Typically green schools cost 1% to 2% more, with an average cost
premium of 1.7%, or about $3/ft2.

Some green schools are
built on the same budget as
conventional schools.

Increased cost of green design is typically partially offset by savings elsewhere, for
example in reduced cost of HVAC systems or in reduced code compliance costs.
Similarly, increased water retention through the use of a green roof or greywater system
can avoid the capital cost of a water retention system normally required to comply
with water codes. The model green school developed by the architectural firm OWP/P
for the Chicago market includes a green roof that allows the building to avoid a water
retention system, providing savings sufficient to reduce the school cost premium to 1%.10
A recent evaluation of the impact of LEED adoption, developed for the Portland Energy
Office, found that regional life cycle savings from adopting 15 individual green building
technologies was over 8 times as large as the direct first cost of these measures.11
Achieving full cost savings requires early integrated design.

Benefits of High Performance Schools
Energy Cost Savings in Green Schools
Green schools use an average of 33% less energy than conventionally designed schools
(See Table B). Typical energy performance enhancements include more efficient lighting,
greater use of daylighting and sensors, more efficient heating and cooling systems and
better insulated walls and roofs.
Reduced energy consumption in green schools has two distinct financial benefits: (1)
direct reduction in school energy costs, and (2) indirect secondary impact from reduced
overall market demand and resulting lower energy prices market-wide. Direct savings
are in the form of lower bills to the school. Indirect savings result from the impact that
reduced demand has in lowering the market price of energy. This indirect impact shows
up in minute changes in price across entire markets. For an individual school, this price
impact is not measurable, but state-wide or nationally, the price impact of reduced
energy consumption in schools could be substantial.

Average school energy use in 2005/2006 was $1.15/ft2, of which electricity was
63% and natural gas 34%. For the 30 green schools reviewed in this report, the
average energy reduction compared with conventional design is 33%, indicating an
average savings of $0.38/ft2 per year in green schools.12 Average electricity prices are
$0.09 kWh in 2006 and rose an average 6% per year over the last three years.13 The
average gas price rose 14% annually over the same period. Future prices are of course
unknowable, but finite energy resources combined with rapid projected international
demand growth suggests rising prices. This report projects recent rapid growth in
average energy prices to slow to 5% per year, or 3% above inflation, over the next
20 years.
Over a 20 year period, and assuming 7% discount of future benefits of lower energy
prices, the result is a present value of $6/ft2 for energy savings in green schools. In
green building upgrades of existing schools, the present value benefit of reduced energy
use over a 15 year period at a 7% discount rate is $5/ft2. Note that the costs and
benefits numbers in this report have all been rounded to the nearest whole dollar
amount. Uncertainties about the data, including future price escalation, make greater
precision misleading.

Market-wide energy cost savings represent an important additional benefit often not
included in energy efficiency financial analyses. The financial benefit of lowered energy
prices is substantial and provides an additional reason for public entities such as states
or cities to promote or require energy efficiency programs.

Market-wide energy
cost savings represent
an important benefit
often not included in
energy efficiency
financial analyses.

The price impact from efficiency-driven reductions in demand can be significant. A
2005 report from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found that a 1% reduction in
national natural gas demand can lead to a long-term average wellhead price reductions
of 0.8% to 2%.14 A 2004 Platts Research & Consulting review of nine separate studies
determines that a 1% drop in gas demand could drive a 0.75% to 2.5% reduction in
long-term wellhead prices. 15 In other words, these studies indicate direct reduction
in consumption (and savings in energy costs from increased efficiency) could drive a
reduction in long-term prices equal to 100% to 200% of the direct energy savings. A
2004 Massachusetts state report found that the indirect savings from lower overall
energy prices due to lower energy demand from use of energy efficiency and renewables
amounted to 90% of the direct savings.16 To be conservative, we assume that the
indirect price impact is 50% over 20 years from a broad shift to green, energy efficient
school design. Thus, the impact of indirect energy cost reduction for new and retrofitted
schools has a present value of $3/ft2 over 20 years.
The total direct and indirect energy cost savings from a new green school compared
with a conventional school is $9/ft2. Total direct and indirect energy cost savings from
a green as compared to a conventional upgrade of an existing school would be $7/ft2.
Note that these numbers have all been rounded to the nearest whole dollar amount, as
noted above.

Emissions Reduction Benefits of Green Schools
Residential, commercial and industrial buildings use about 45% of the nation’s energy,
including about 75% of the nation’s electricity. Air pollution, from burning fossil fuels
to heat buildings (natural gas and oil) and to generate electricity for these buildings
(by burning coal, natural gas and oil) imposes enormous health, environmental, and
property damage costs. Demonstrated health costs nationally include tens of thousands
of additional deaths per year and tens of millions of respiratory incidents and ailments.17
Reduced electricity and gas use in buildings means lower emissions of pollutants (due to
avoided burning of fossil fuels) that are damaging to human health, to the environment,
and to property. As noted above, green schools on average use one third less energy
than conventional schools.18
As a rough estimate, a green school could lead to the following annual emission
reductions per school:
• 1,200 pounds of nitrogen oxides (NOx) – a principal component of smog.
• 1,300 pounds of sulfur dioxide (SO2) – a principal cause of acid rain.
• 585,000 pounds of carbon dioxide (CO2) – the principal greenhouse gas and the
principal product of combustion.
• 150 pounds of coarse particulate matter (PM10) – a principal cause of respiratory
illness and an important contributor to smog.

Over 20 years the present value of emissions reductions per square foot is $0.53/ft2
from a green school.19
This grossly underestimates actual emissions costs, particularly for CO2, the primary gas
causing global warming and resulting in increased severity of hurricanes, increased heat
related deaths, sea-level rise, accelerating environmental degradation - such as erosion
and desertification, and accelerating species extinction. A 2005 study by Harvard
Medical School, Swiss Re and the United Nations Development Program summarizes a



broad range of large economic costs that continued climate change and global warming,
driven primarily by burning fossil fuels, will increasingly impose. 20
Virtually all of the world’s climate change scientists have concluded that human caused
emissions – principally from burning fossil fuels — are causing global warming. 21 In
2004, Science published a review of over 900 scientific studies on global warming
published in refereed scientific journals over the prior decade and concluded that there
is a consensus among climate scientists that serious human induced global warming is
happening. 22 In April 2005, James Hansen, Director of NASA’s Goddard Institute for
Space Studies, stated that “There can no longer be genuine doubt that human-made
gases are the dominant cause of global warming.”23
The USA is responsible for about one quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions. The
building sector (including residential, commercial and industrial buildings) is responsible
for over 40% of US CO2 emissions — more than any other entire economy in the world
except China.
The large health, environmental and property damages associated with pollution from
burning fossil fuels are only very partially reflected in the price of emissions. As the
health, financial and social costs of global warming in particular continue to mount,
cutting greenhouse gasses through energy efficiency and greater use of renewable
energy in buildings will become an increasingly valued benefit of greening buildings. 24

Water & Wastewater Benefits of Green Schools
The 30 green schools evaluated achieved an average water use reduction of 32%. This
reduction has direct savings for the building as well as substantial societal benefits from
lower pollution and reduced infrastructure costs to deliver water and to transport and
treat wastewater.
When there is heavy and extended rainfall, wastewater systems commonly overflow,
causing water pollution and illness, river contamination and beach closings. The benefits
of some green building water strategies - such as rainwater catchment and green roofs are recognized by some municipalities. For example, in Dedham, MA, the school design
team, through providing rainwater storage capacity on site, saved the town the cost of
enlarging an off site stormwater detention facility. The city valued this infrastructure
improvement at $400,000. 25

The building sector is
responsible for over 40%
of US CO2 emissions - more
than any entire economy in
the world except China.

A recent EPA report concludes that the expected gap between future revenues (based
on historical price increases) and infrastructure needs for potable water and wastewater
treatment will be approximately $148 billion over the next twenty years. 26 EPA found
that nationally there is a gross under-investment in water delivery and treatment
systems, indicating that current water utility rates will have to rise more steeply to
secure the funds needed for required infrastructure upgrades.
An empirical study in Canada estimated that the price charged for fresh water was
only one-third to one-half the long-run marginal supply cost, and the prices charged for
sewage were approximately one-fifth the long run cost of sewage treatment. 27
Prices typically reflect average rather than marginal costs. Because water and
wastewater costs are generally rising, prices tend to substantially understate actual
marginal cost of additional water and wastewater capacity borne by utilities and society
at large. Based on discussions with school and green building experts, we can assume
conservatively that water and wastewater costs for schools average 5% of the cost of
energy, or about $0.06/ft2. Assuming an average rate of cost increase of 5% per year for
water and wastewater, this provides an NPV estimate of $0.84/ft2, or roughly one dollar,
over 20 years. This almost certainly underestimates the financial benefits of reduced
water and sewer cost associated with green design. Nor does it reflect the large savings
from reduced water runoff from green schools and the cost savings from reduced water
pollution and increased groundwater recharging.

New LEED program for K-12 Schools
Lindsay Baker, USGBC staff

In December 2006, USGBC is launching LEED for Schools, a market-specific application of LEED that recognizes the unique nature
and educational aspects of the design and construction of K-12 schools. The rating system is based on LEED for New Construction,
and addresses issues such as classroom acoustics, master planning, mold prevention, and joint use of facilities. The program
launch (no pilot period will take place) is supported by a full set of tools tailored to schools: a reference guide, workshop, and LEED
Online with credit templates. In doing so, USGBC hopes to help school districts across the country better understand the business
case for building green and to help them to implement their green building goals through a third-party certification program that
is supported by educational offerings and a nationwide network of LEED Accredited Professionals, USGBC chapters and members.
School districts can implement LEED without the additional cost of establishing in-house certification programs.
For more information on the LEED for Schools program, go to www.usgbc.org/leed.

Health and Learning Benefits of Green Schools
According to the US General Accounting Office, 14 million students (over a quarter of all
students) attend schools considered below standard or dangerous and almost two-thirds
of schools have building features such as air conditioning that are in need of extensive
repair or replacement. This statistic does not include schools with less obvious but
important health related problems such as inadequate ventilation. A recently published
document by the American Federation of Teachers notes that the General Accounting
Office found that the air is unfit to breathe in nearly 15 thousand schools. 28
Poor health and study conditions in schools are of particular concern for a number of
reasons, including:
• There are some 60 million students, faculty and staff in schools.
• The large majority of schools are built not to optimize health and comfort, but rather
to achieve a minimum required level of design performance at lowest cost.
• Few states regulate indoor air quality in schools or provide for minimum ventilation
standards.
• Almost no schools are designed with the specific objective of creating healthy and
productive study and learning environments.

There is a large body of
research linking health and
productivity with specific
building design attributes.

• Chronic shortage of funds in schools means that schools typically suffer from
inadequate maintenance, and experience degradation of basic systems such as
ventilation, air quality and lighting quality, as well as poor control over pollutants (e.g.,
from cleaning materials).
• Students and faculty typically spend 85% to 90% of their time indoors (mostly at
home and at school), and the concentration of pollutants indoors is typically higher
than outdoors, sometimes by as much as 10 or even 100 times. 29
• Children are growing, their organs are developing, and they breathe more air relative
to their body size than adults, and as a result sustain greater health problems and
risks than adults from toxics and pollutants common in schools. 30
The costs of poor indoor environmental and air quality in schools, including higher
absenteeism and increased respiratory ailments, have generally been “hidden” in sick
days, lower teacher and staff productivity, lower student motivation, slower learning,
lower tests scores, increased medical costs, and lowered lifelong achievement
and earnings.
There is a large body of research linking health and productivity with specific building
design operation attributes (e.g., indoor air quality and control over work environment,
including lighting levels, air flow, humidity, and temperature).



However, many reviews of the effects of classroom healthiness on students look only
at school-specific studies. This unnecessarily limits the relevant data available to
understand and quantify benefits of high performance, healthy design in schools. The
tasks done by “knowledge workers” (including most non-factory white collar workers)
– such as reading comprehension, synthesis of information, writing, calculations,
and communications – are very similar to the work students do. Large-scale studies
correlating green or high performance features with increased productivity and
performance in many non-academic institutions are therefore relevant to schools.
Two studies of over 11,000 workers in 107 European buildings analyzed the health effect
of worker-controlled temperature and ventilation. These studies found significantly
reduced illness symptoms, reduced absenteeism and increased productivity relative to
workers in a group whose workspace lacked these features. 31
One of the leading national centers of expertise on the topic is the Center for Building
Performance at Carnegie Mellon University. The Center’s Building Investment Decision
Support (BIDS) program has reviewed over 1,500 studies that relate technical
characteristics of buildings, such as lighting, ventilation and thermal control, to tenant
responses, such as productivity or health. 32

17 separate studies all found
positive health impacts from
improved indoor air-quality,
ranging from 13.5% up to
87% improvement.

Collectively, these studies demonstrate that better building design correlates with
increases in tenant/worker well-being and productivity. The BIDS data set includes a
number of controlled laboratory studies where speed and accuracy at specific tasks,
such as typing, addition, proof reading, paragraph completion, reading comprehension,
and creative thinking, were found to improve in high performance building ventilation,
thermal control, and lighting control environments. 33

Good lighting “improves
test scores, reduces offtask behavior, and plays
a significant role in the
achievement of students.”

indoor air quality
The Carnegie Mellon building performance program identified 17 substantial studies that
document the relationship between improved air quality and health. The health impacts
include asthma, flu, sick building syndrome, respiratory problems, and headaches.
These 17 separate studies all found positive health impacts (i.e. reduction in reported
prevalence of symptoms) ranging from 13.5% up to 87% improvement, with average
improvement of 41% (Figure B).

temperature control
Teachers believe that temperature comfort affects both teaching quality and student
achievement. 34 Research indicates that the best teachers emphasized that their ability
to control temperature in classrooms is very important to student performance. 35
A review of 14 studies by Carnegie Mellon on the impact of improved temperature
control on productivity found a positive correlation for all studies, with productivity
improvements ranging from 0.2% up to 15%, and with an average (mean) of 3.6%
(Figure C).

high performance lighting
Green school design typically emphasizes providing views and managing daylight
– specifically increasing daylight while eliminating glare. These two design features
have both been correlated with improvements in performance on tests of office workers.
In a study of 200 utility workers, workers with the best views performed 10% -25%
better on tests. Workers in offices without glare outperformed workers in offices with
glare by 15% or more. 36 The consensus findings in a review of 17 studies from the
mid 1930s to 1997 found that good lighting “improves test scores, reduces off-task
behavior, and plays a significant role in the achievement of students.”37 Another
synthesis of 53 generally more recent studies also found that more daylighting fosters
higher student achievement. 38

Carnegie Mellon summarized findings from 11 studies documenting the impact of high
performance lighting fixtures on productivity. Their analysis found that productivity
gains ranged between 0.7% and 26.1% with an average (median) of 3.2%. (Figure D).
The high performance lighting attributes include efficient lighting and use of indirect
lighting fixtures, features that are normal in high performance green buildings.

improved learning and test scores
In fall 2005 Turner Construction released a survey of 665 executives at organizations
involved in the building sector. Of those involved with green schools, over 70%
reported that green schools reduced student absenteeism and improved student
performance. 39 (Figure E).
A large number of school specific studies indicate a significant positive impact.
For example:
• An analysis of two school districts in Illinois found that student attendance rose by
5% after incorporating cost-effective indoor air quality improvements.40
• A study of Chicago and Washington, DC schools found that better school facilities
can add 3 to 4 percentage points to a school’s standardized test scores, even after
controlling for demographic factors.41
• A recent study of the cost and benefits of green schools for Washington State
estimated a 15% reduction in absenteeism and a 5% increase in student test scores.42
Three of the green schools analyzed for this report demonstrate similar significant
improvements in performance:

Third Creek Elementary School

• Students moving into the Ash Creek Intermediate School in Oregon (See Table B)
experienced a 15% reduction in absenteeism.43
• Students moving from a conventional school to the new green Clearview Elementary
School, a 2002 LEED Gold building in Pennsylvania (See Table B and photo on page
14), experienced substantial improvements in health and test scores. A PhD thesis
on the school found a 19% increase in average Student Oral Reading Fluency Scores
(DIBELS) when compared to the prior, conventional school.44
• The Third Creek Elementary School in Statesville, North Carolina (See Table B and
front cover photo) is the country’s first LEED gold K-12 school. Completed in 2002, the
800 student school replaced two older schools. Documented student test scores
before and after the move provide compelling evidence that learning and test scores
improve in greener, healthier buildings.
According to Terry Holliday, the Superintendent of the Iredell Statesville Schools (which
includes Third Creek Elementary School),

“Third Creek Elementary School replaced ADR and Wayside Elementary
Schools, schools that were two of the district’s lowest performing school
in regards to test scores and teacher retention/absence. This same group
of students and teachers improved from less than 60% of students on
grade level in reading and math to 80% of students on grade level in
reading and math since moving into the new Third Creek Elementary
School. Third Creek had the most gains in academic performance of
any of the 32 schools in the school system. We feel that the sustainable
approach to this project has had very positive results.”45
CHPS, LEED and other green school certifications include a range of material, design and
operation measures that directly improve human health and productivity. In addition
to achieving the related air and comfort quality prerequisites, the 30 green schools

performance of healthier, more comfortable study and learning environments, a 3-5%
improvement in learning ability and test scores in green schools appears reasonable
and conservative. It makes sense that a school specifically designed to be healthy,
and characterized by more daylighting, less toxic materials, improved ventilation and
acoustics, better light quality and improved air quality would provide a better study and
learning environment.

Greening school design
is extraordinarily costeffective compared with
other available measures
to enhance student
performance.

Financial Impact of Improved Health and Learning in Green Schools
future earnings
Faster learning and higher test scores are significantly and positively associated with
higher lifetime earnings.46 A 2005 review of the financial benefits of education in an
International Monetary Fund (IMF) publication concludes:
[Recent] studies, which are based on different, nationally representative data sets
that follow students after they leave the education system and enter the labor force,
provide remarkably similar estimates: one standard deviation increase (moving from the
average of the distribution to the 84th percentile) in mathematics performance at the end
of high school translates into 12 percent higher annual earnings — an earnings gain that
can be expected across the entire working life of the individual. And there are reasons to
believe that these estimates provide a lower bound on the effect of higher educational
achievement.47

An increase in test scores from 50% to 84% is associated with a 12% increase in
annual earnings. As discussed earlier, a smaller improvement in test scores can be
conservatively expected from high performance schools compared with conventional
schools – in the range of 3% to 5%. Based on the IMF analysis cited above, a 3-5%
improvement in learning and test scores is equivalent to a 1.4% lifetime annual earnings
increase.
With average annual salary of about $38,000 per year, this improvement in learning
and test scores implies an earnings increase of $532 per year for each graduate from a
green school. We are assuming, conservatively, that the earnings benefits last only 20
years, even though studies indicate they last for the employment lifetime of about 40
years. Assuming that earnings rise only at the rate of inflation, the present value is about
$6,800 per student, or about $49 per ft2. (At a marginal combined federal state and
local taxes rate of 40% this indicates an NPV over 20 years of additional tax revenue
of $2,700 per student, or $20/ft2. If one-third of students move to other states, statespecific employee earnings benefits decline to an estimated 20 year financial benefit of
about $33/ft2.)
Increases in earning represent the single largest financial benefit from building healthier,
more productive learning environments. Greening school design is extraordinarily costeffective compared with other available measures to enhance student performance.

financial benefits of asthma reduction
Asthma is a widespread and worsening disease among school children.48 The American
Lung Association has found that American school children miss more than 14 million
school days a year because of asthma exacerbated by poor indoor air quality.49
Nationally, about one in ten of all school children suffer from asthma.
An American Lung Association 2005 Fact Sheet on Asthma and Children notes that:
• Asthma is the most common chronic disorder in childhood, currently affecting an
estimated 6.2 million children under 18 years; of which 4 million suffered from an
asthma attack or episode in 2003. 50
• Asthma is the third leading cause of hospitalization among children under the age of
15, and it disproportionately affects children.
• The annual direct health care cost of asthma is approximately $11.5 billion, with
additional indirect costs (e.g. lost productivity) of another $4.6 billion. 51
It costs nearly three times more to provide health care for a child with asthma than a
child without asthma. 52 In 2006 dollars this amount is equal to $1,650 per child. 53 Note
that most of these health costs are not borne by the schools but rather by the students
and their families.
A recent review by Carnegie Mellon of five separate studies evaluating the impact of
improved indoor air quality on asthma found an average reduction of 38.5% in asthma in
buildings with improved air quality. 54
We assume the impact of a shift from an unhealthy, conventional school to a healthy
school results in a reduction in asthma incidence of 25%. In an average sized new school
of 900 students, a 25% reduction in asthma incidence in a healthy school translates
into 20 fewer children a year with asthma, with an associated annual cost savings of
$33,000. 55 Over 20 years, and assuming costs of medical treatment continue to rise
at the recent historical rate of 5% per year, 56 at a 7% discount rate this translates into
a benefit of over $3/ft2. A small portion of this benefit would accrue directly to the
school in the form of reduced need for nurse care and staff time, while the rest would
benefit families and the larger community through reduced health-care needs. This
calculation underestimates the asthma reduction benefits since it does not reflect
health improvements in school faculty and staff, which are only partially captured in the
analysis on faculty retention impact below.

A recent review of five
separate studies found an
average asthma reduction
of 38.5% in buildings with
improved air-quality.

13

colds and flu reduction
Improved ventilation and air quality reduces a range of respiratory illnesses, including
common colds and influenza. A review by Carnegie Mellon of two studies evaluating
the impact of improved indoor air quality on colds and flu found an average reduction of
51% in buildings with improved air quality. 57 A major review of the literature by Lawrence
Berkeley National Laboratory estimates that better ventilation and indoor air quality
would reduce these illnesses by 9-20% in the general population, result in 16-37 million
fewer cases of the cold and influenza and provide annual savings of $6-14 billion. 58 The
average impact of $10 billion, adjusted to 2006 dollars is $13 billion, 59 or about $45 per
person per year.
We assume for this study that the impact on children is the same as on adults. This
may be a conservative assumption (i.e., it underestimates benefits of green schools for
students) because children are more susceptible to the transmission of flu and colds.
Adults typically earn much more than children, so the direct cost of a child’s illness is
far less than for an adult. However, a child sick from school commonly either obligates
a parent to stay home from work or pay for childcare to attend the sick child, and is
economically disruptive. These secondary costs of children’s illness are large. Better
ventilation and indoor air quality in high performance schools can therefore be estimated
to cut costs per pupil from reduced cold and influenza by approximately $45 per
student per year. Over 20 years, and assuming costs of illness continue to rise at the
recent historical rate of 5% per year, the present value of reduced incidence of influenza
and colds in green schools is over $5/ft2. As noted above for asthma, a small portion of
this benefit would accrue directly to the school.

teacher retention
Teachers commonly express concern about school facilities and highlight the issues that
green design addresses – lighting quality, temperature control, indoor air quality, etc.
Average salary and benefits for public school teachers can be conservatively estimated
at $65,000.60 A recent report on the impact of green schools in Washington State
estimated a 5% reduction in teacher turnover.61 Cost of turnover is variously estimated
to be 25% up to 200% of annual salary plus benefits (this includes costs of termination,
hiring, loss of learning, etc).62 If we assume a 3% reduction in teacher turnover and
the relatively conservative estimate that the cost of teacher loss is 40% of salary
and benefits - about $25,000, then a 3% increase in teacher retention (at an average
estimated 2,300 ft2 of school space per teacher) translates into a financial savings of
about $4/ft2 over a 20 year period from increased teacher retention.

Employment Impacts of Green Schools
One of the reasons for the adoption of green construction requirements by cities and
states is to increase employment. For example, employment benefits are one of the
reasons that the New York City Council passed legislation in September 2005 requiring
that significant new construction be built green.63

A coalition of labor movements, public entities, NGOs and businesses, called the
Apollo Alliance, is advocating an ambitious national clean investment program. An
Apollo Alliance analysis models a $300 billion national investment over a decade in
high performance green buildings, rebuilding public infrastructure, increasing energy
efficiency and investing in industries of the future (such as clean technologies), and
concludes that this would create 3.3 million jobs.64 A 2004 report by Black & Veatch on
the impact of establishing a minimum energy consumption target for Pennsylvania of
10% from renewables over 20 years would, compared to business as usual, generate a
net increase of $10.1 billion in economic output, increase earnings in state by $2.8 billion
and result in 20,000 more jobs.65

Green buildings typically involve greater initial costs to achieve important green
objectives such as improved energy efficiency, increased use of renewable energy
(on site and off site), and diversion of waste from landfills for reuse or recycling.
These changes create local and US jobs and offset wasteful consumption of energy
(some of it imported from anti-democratic nations) and improve productivity and the
US trade deficit. Each of these aspects of green design – efficiency, renewable energy
and waste diversion — involves increased employment compared with conventional
non-green buildings.

energy efficiency
The typical green school uses one-third less energy than conventional schools.
This reduction is a result of a combination of things, including better design, more
energy efficiency equipment, and installation of energy efficiency measures such as
increased insulation.
A 2004 Massachusetts report found that every $10 million in additional energy
efficiency investments contributes about 160 short-term jobs and 30 long-term or
permanent jobs. Assuming about $200,000 in additional energy efficiency related
investments in a green school relative to a conventional school, investment in energy
efficiency creates three short- term jobs through additional work and half of a long-term
job per school.66

Only 2.5 jobs are created for
every 1,000 tons of waste
disposed, while 4.7 jobs are
created for 1,000 tons of
waste diverted.

The average income for a permanent job created can be conservatively estimated as
$38,000,67 indicating a long-term annual increase in salary in-state for each green
school of $19,000 (half of one fulltime job created from increased energy efficiency).
On a 20 year discounted basis, and assuming salaries grow at inflation, this is
$250,000 of direct in-state salary created, equal to $2/ft2 for a typical 125,000 ft2
school. This calculation does not include the positive net employment impact of shortterm jobs created.

15

increased use of renewable energy
Green buildings generally use more renewable energy, both on site and off site, than
conventional buildings, primarily from purchase of green power and renewable energy
credits. Use of renewable energy generally displaces less labor intensive and more
polluting energy sources such as imported heating oil, gas, and coal burned in power
plants to make electricity.
A shift to more renewable energy would also increase employment. Compared with
a business as usual energy growth mix, expanding renewable energy use to 20%
nationally by 2020 would create roughly 100,000 net new jobs nationally. The
majority of these jobs would be in manufacturing and construction, and would be
relatively well paid and broadly distributed (all states would experience positive
employment growth) and would particularly benefit sectors of the economy suffering
relatively high unemployment.68
It is beyond the scope of this report to estimate the positive employment benefit from
increased use of renewable energy in green schools. This increase in employment is
expected to be significant, so not calculating it underestimates the financial benefits of
requiring that schools be green.

waste diversion
A third way that green schools increase employment is by diverting waste from landfills
to more labor intensive activities such as separation and recycling.
A recent UC Berkeley study found that total economic impacts from diversion are nearly
twice as large as the impacts from sending these materials to dumps. One ton of waste
diverted to reuse/recycling generates about twice the employment impact of a ton of
waste disposed in a landfill. Only 2.5 jobs are created for every 1,000 tons of waste
disposed, while 4.7 jobs are created for waste diverted as recyclables (See Figure F).69

75% of senior executives
believe that being green
improves a school’s
ability to attract and
retain teachers.

A comprehensive Massachusetts study on the environmental benefits of recycling
calculated that the total benefits per ton were $151-$331.70 As noted above, the UC
Berkeley study found that diversion was about two times as labor intensive as disposal.
This report does not calculate the employment benefits of increased diversion in green
schools, but they appear substantial.

conclusion on employment impacts
Clearly green schools create more jobs than conventional schools. Most energy used
in schools comes from burning fossil fuels, some of which is imported from countries
that fund terrorism. Thus, the shift to more energy efficiency, which includes in-state
manufacturing, system design and installation labor for insulation, renewable energy
systems, better windows, etc., would have significant positive employment, economic
and security impacts. This report calculates only one of these — long-term employment
impact of increased energy efficiency – and it is found to provide $2/ft2 of benefits.

Additional Non-Quantified Benefits
Green schools provide a range of additional benefits compared with conventional
schools. Some of these are discussed below.

reduced teacher sick days
Improved air, comfort and health in green school buildings positively affect teachers.
As discussed above, improved lighting, ventilation and indoor environmental quality
significantly improve measured health and productivity benefits for workers in buildings.
As indicated in Figure E, three quarters of senior executives interviewed for the 2005
Turner Construction survey believe that being green improves the school’s ability to
attract and retain teachers. A PhD thesis on the Clearview Elementary School (See Table
B), a 2002 LEED gold building in Pennsylvania, found that teachers experience 1.41 fewer
missed working days, a 12% decrease from previous traditional school.71 If teachers

16

experience a 7% decrease in sick days in green schools — one day a year less because
of healthy air and a better work environment — the reduced cost of substitute teachers
provides a present value of about $2/ft2.Conservatively, this benefit is not included in
this report.

heat island reduction measures

Research has shown that it
costs less to recycle most
construction and demolition
waste than to dispose of it.

Non-reflective building surfaces absorb more sunlight, increasing temperature within
buildings, as well as on exterior surfaces. In cities this effect creates urban “heat islands”
and an associated need for increased air conditioning. Non reflective (typically dark)
roofs can be substituted with reflective roofs or green, planted roofs — collectively
known as “cool roofs” — and significantly reduce city or local temperature as light/heat
is reflected back into space rather than absorbed and radiated locally. By reducing
ambient urban temperatures, heat island reduction directly contributes to reduced ozone
creation, in turn reducing the large human health costs associated with smog. In addition
to positive energy and heat island impacts, cool roofs also experience less expansion
and contraction than non-reflective roofs, which contributes to a significant extension of
the roof life. Typically, highly reflective roofs last 20% longer than conventional roofs.72
Green roofs (with plants in soil on an impermeable membrane) are expected to last 3050 years or longer.
Lowered ambient air temperature cuts smog formation, improves comfort and health
and cuts the cost of air conditioning. The financial benefits of this aspect of greening
schools are substantial but are not quantified here.

lower operations and maintenance (o&m) costs
A major recent study of costs and benefits of green buildings for 40 state agencies
found that the operations and maintenance (O&M) benefits of greening California public
buildings provide savings worth $8/ft2 over a 20 year period.73 Green schools, like other
green buildings, incorporate design elements such as commissioning and more durable
materials that reduce O&M costs. For example, the Canby School in Oregon, designed
by Boora Architects, (see Table B) at a level equivalent to LEED Gold, features exterior
surfaces of brick and metal with a baked finish that require virtually no maintenance/
painting, as well as a linoleum floor with lower maintenance than conventional flooring.74
Estimating O&M benefits from green schools is beyond the scope of this study but the
benefits are probably significant.

enhancement of generating system reliability
and improved power quality
The benefits for businesses and competitiveness from improved power quality resulting
from greater energy efficiency can be large. National annual cost of power quality
problems and outages have been estimated by the New York State Energy Research
and Development Authority and the Electric Power Research Institute at over $100
billion.75 Power quality concerns are a significant issue for many businesses, and energy
efficiency and renewable energy provide an important way to reduce power quality and
reliability costs.
The Massachusetts Division of Energy Resources 2004 Annual Report on Energy
Efficiency activities notes that:
By reducing demand, the energy efficiency programs contribute to system reliability
in terms of supply adequacy within a particular area or region… all energy efficiency
measures… help maintain adequate margins of generation supply, and can help deter
brownouts and blackouts….By reducing load and demand on the power distribution
network, the [efficiency] programs decrease the costly likelihood of failures.76
This report does not quantify the power quality and reliability economic benefits of
greening the nation’s schools, but they appear substantial.

and educational settings

construction & demolition waste reduction benefits of green schools
About 25% of the solid waste discarded nationally is construction and demolition (C&D)
waste, adding up to 130 million tons of waste per year.77 Fifty-seven percent of national
C&D waste comes from non-residential building projects,78 deriving from three sources:
79,80

• demolition, which creates about 155 pounds of waste per square foot, and makes up
58% of national non-residential C&D waste;
• construction, which creates about 3.9 pounds of waste per square foot, and makes up
6% of national non-residential C&D waste;
• renovation, which makes up 36% of national non-residential C&D waste.
Research has shown that it actually costs less to recycle most C&D waste than to
dispose of it. A rigorous 1999 study found that for all construction and demolition
wastes (including mixed debris), the cost of recycling is less than the cost of disposal by
at least 35%. 81
C&D diversion rates are typically at least 50-75% in green buildings and have reached
as high as 99% on some projects. 82 The green schools studied in this report have an
average C&D diversion rate of 74%. The financial benefits of increased waste diversion
are not estimated here but appear significant.

insurance and risk related benefits

The financial benefits of
greening schools are about
$70 per ft2, more than 20
times as high as the cost of
going green.

Health related benefits from green schools have significant risk and insurance impacts.
For example, according to the Chief Economist at the Insurance Information Institute,
most insurers reported a tripling of mold-related claims in 2002. By early 2003, more
than 9000 claims related to mold were pending the nation’s courts, though most involve
family homes. 83 Improved ventilation and greater commissioning in green buildings
reduces the likelihood of mold and associated liability problems.
The Kats/California study characterized the potential insurance benefits of green
buildings by mapping risk and insurance related benefits onto the credits of the LEED
system. Each LEED prerequisite and credit was evaluated against seven types of risk:
property loss, general liability, business interruption, vehicular, health & workers

Insurance Benefits of Green Buildings
•Worker Health & Safety. Various benefits, including lower worker’s compensation costs, arise from improved indoor
environmental quality, reduced likelihood of moisture damage, and other factors enhancing workplace safety.
•Property Loss Prevention. A range of green building technologies reduce the likelihood of physical damages and losses
in facilities.
•Liability Loss Prevention. Business interruption risks can be reduced by facilities that derive their energy from on-site
resources and/or have energy-efficiency features. These risks include those resulting from unplanned power outages.
•Natural Disaster Preparedness and Recovery. A subset of energy efficient and renewable energy technologies make
facilities less vulnerable to natural disasters, especially heat catastrophes.

18

comp, life, and environmental liability. Of the 64 LEED points available (not including
innovation credits) 49 (77%) are associated with measures that have potential riskreduction benefits.
Insurance-related benefits of green, high performance design are summarized on page
18 (and reproduced from the Kats/California study). This report does not estimate the
value of the risk and liability reduction benefits of green buildings.

improving equity and addressing spiritual values
Lower income and minority children disproportionately suffer from poor indoor air
quality and related problems in conventional schools. Children in low income families are
30% to 50% more likely to have respiratory problems such as asthma and allergies that
lead to increased absenteeism, and diminished learning and test scores. This increase
in respiratory problems results in large part from exposure to polluted and unhealthy air
and study conditions in schools and at home. Wealthy families can move their children
into better designed and healthier private schools. Less affluent families are less likely to
have that luxury. Greening public schools creates an opportunity to improve the health
and educational settings for all students, regardless of income or background, a process
with clear moral benefits. The financial benefits of a less inequitable educational system
are difficult to calculate but could be substantial in terms of increased diversity in the
work force, community development, increased productivity, etc.
Many people are spiritual and religious, and value environmental richness and
environmental protection as an important spiritual issue. For example, a recent Le
Moyne College/Zogby International Contemporary Catholic Trends Poll found that 87%
of those polled said that protecting the environment is an important issue, with 21%
placing it as “the most important issue” facing America today. 84 For many Americans,
protecting the environment and God’s creatures by cutting energy waste and air and
water pollution is a very important part of their religious and spiritual value system.
While spiritual, religious and moral values are difficult to quantify they are important and
are relevant for school design choices.

educational enrichment as an aspect of greener, healthier facilities
High performance schools provide hands-on educational opportunities that conventional
schools do not. For example, on site renewable energy generation, water conservation
features and other green technologies provide very valuable opportunities for hands-on
learning. Sidwell Friends, a highly regarded Quaker affiliated school in Washington DC,
is making greening a principal objective in its campus renovation and expansion. The
ongoing effort to make the school’s building more environmentally-friendly and healthy
provides a rich source of hands-on educational material for both full time and summer
students. Mike Saxenian, Assistant Head of the School and Chief Financial Officer says
that “students have responded with enthusiasm to the school’s decision to build green,
and faculty are eager to use the new facilities as a laboratory to demonstrate solutions to
environmental problems discussed in class. Trustees, faculty and administrators see the
green building program as an affirmation of the school’s core values.”85

These additional benefits of greening schools — including reduced teacher sick days,
lower operations and maintenance costs, improved electricity quality and reliability,
reduced insurance and risk related costs, and improved educational quality — are all
substantial benefits that are not quantified in this study. These additional benefits, if
calculated, would greatly increase the recognized financial benefits of greening schools
and further strengthen the case that building conventional relatively inefficient and
unhealthy school buildings today is financially imprudent and even irresponsible.

extremely cost-effective,
and represents a fiscally far

note on impact of increased experience with green buildings
There is a learning curve associated with designing and building green schools. For both
public and private owners and developers of green buildings, subsequent green buildings
generally cost less than the first. The trend of declining costs associated with increased
experience in green building construction has been experienced in Pennsylvania, 86 as
well as in Portland and Seattle. Portland’s first three reported completed LEED Silver
buildings incurred cost premiums of 2%, 1% and 0% respectively. 87 Seattle saw the cost
premium of LEED Silver buildings drop from 3-4% to 1-2%. 88
Similarly, a recent survey by the national construction firm, Turner Construction, found
that the recognized benefits of green building in a range of areas, (including health
benefits and productivity) increase significantly as they gain experience with green
buildings (see Figure G).
For example, 78% of executives in organizations not involved with green building
believe that greening a building improves health and well being of occupants, while
88% of executives in organizations with experiences of green buildings hold this view.
Thus, increased experience with green buildings both reduces costs of building green
and increases the recognized benefits of green design. For school districts considering
greening their schools, these trends highlight the large educational and financial benefits
of greening both new and existing schools.

Conclusions
Greening school design is extremely cost-effective. Green schools cost on average
almost 2% more, or $3 more per ft2, than conventional schools. The financial benefits of
greening schools are about $70 per ft2, more than 20 times as high as the cost of going
green. Only a portion of these savings accrue directly to an individual school. Lower
energy and water costs, improved teacher retention, and lowered health costs save
green schools directly about $12/ft2, about four times the additional cost of going green,
and enough to hire an additional full-time teacher.
Analysis of the costs and benefits of 30 green schools and use of conservative and
prudent financial assumptions provides a clear and compelling case that greening
schools today is extremely cost-effective, and represents a fiscally far better design
choice. Building green schools is more fiscally prudent and lower risk than continuing to
build unhealthy, inefficient schools.

“High performance, cost effective schools begin with good
design. As this study details, nowhere is good design
more important than for our schools. Enhanced learning
environments that are also environmentally responsible
continue to be an ongoing focus of AIA awards programs
and government advocacy. But, as the study makes
clear, all schools must also be green. Members of The
American Institute of Architects believe good design
makes a difference. This study underscores the enormous
costs of poor design, and the critical impact that good
design and operation has on the quality of our children’s
education. It deserves widespread consideration if
we are to properly prepare students to address the
environmental challenges of our new century.”

“USGBC is proud to be a sponsor of this important national analysis of the costs
and benefits of greening our nation’s schools. The report’s conclusions provide
confirmation of USGBC’s position that by building green we all profit. For our
nation’s students this is particularly true. Children’s health is disproportionately
affected by indoor pollutants, while light and air quality affects their capacity
to learn and succeed. This report shows that we owe it to our children - and
ourselves - to make all our schools green.”
— S. Richard Fedrizzi, CEO and Founding Chair, U.S. Green Building Council

“This report makes the business case for greening America’s schools, and it
makes a compelling case indeed. But there is also a public health case to be
made. Better indoor air quality, lower levels of chemical emissions, generous
provision of natural daylighting, better humidity control--these and other
features of green schools offer not only environmental and fiscal benefits,
but health benefits as well. These health benefits, in turn, manifest in lower
student and staff absenteeism, lower staff turnover, lower health care costs, and
improved school and job performance. For the more than 50 million students
and the more than 5 million teachers and staff who spend their days in schools,
these benefits are substantial and precious. Health professionals, educators,
parents, and policymakers should carefully consider the conclusions of this
report, and do their part to support environmentally friendly, healthy, and
sustainable schools.”

Substances and Disease Registry, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Senior Editor, Safe and
Healthy School Environments (Oxford University Press, 2006).

“The choices we make in new construction have huge implications for the health
of students, faculty and staff. Unfortunately, too many of America’s 55 million
elementary through high school students attend schools that are unhealthy
and unsound, and inhibit rather than foster learning. This important study
persuasively demonstrates that it costs little more to build high performance,
healthy schools and that there are enormous financial, educational and social
benefits to students, schools and society at large.”

CITY OF EVANSVILLE, INDIANA

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ADMINISTRATION
AMENDED REVOLVING LOAN FUND PLAN

Date of EDA Approval: October 19, 2016

CITY OF EVANSVILLE REVOLVING LOAN FUND PLAN

The EDC is slated to begin drafting a new CEDS in 2017. The current CEDS was completed in 2010 and
since that strategy was written, the EDC, which serves as the regional planning organization, has crafted
the winning Regional Cities strategy for Southwest Indiana, agreed to be a partner in implementing the
economic development portion of the Promise Zone strategy for Evansville and is crafting a statewide
strategy in partnership with the Indiana Department of Workforce Development to assist and retrain
displaced coal mine workers in Indiana. With so many competing strategies and initiatives occurring at
one time, the start date for completing a new CEDS was pushed back a year.
The regional CEDS will be updated in 2017. Several other plans have been developed that reiterate and
update the findings of the 2010 CEDS. Those include the Regional Cities Initiative, Downtown Master
Plan and Promise Zone Application.

PART I:
REVOLVING LOAN FUND STRATEGY

A.

ECONOMIC ADJUSTMENT OVERVIEW

The planning process for Southwest Indiana’s 2010 Comprehensive Economic Development Strategy
(2010 CEDS) was a joint effort between Strategic Development Group, Inc. and the Economic Development
Coalition of Southwest Indiana (EDC). The Southwest Indiana region discussed in the 2010 CEDS report
is comprised of four Indiana counties: Gibson, Posey, Vanderburgh and Warrick. Southwest Indiana is
comprised of 1,516 square miles and has a population density of 200 residents per square mile (2015).
The 2010 CEDS found that Southwest Indiana’s strategic location in the Midwest is ideal for manufacturing
and distribution industries. The region’s medical and biosciences cluster represents a strong growth sector.
The region has solid strengths in bio and life sciences, advanced manufacturing, advanced logistics, health
care, and energy – all growth industries for the foreseeable future. Many people who recently retired or
had planned to retire soon now find themselves in a position of needing to work at least part time.
Meanwhile, young talent seeks to enter the workforce in an environment of corporate downsizing.
Companies express a need for ongoing programs to train and retrain workers to ensure competitiveness in
a quickly changing global marketplace. Southwest Indiana proposes workforce-related programs that are
responsive to regional employer needs and linked to statewide initiatives.
The 2010 CEDS incorporates five major goals:
a. Encourage innovative employers.
b. Support education.
c. Improve the health of the region’s residents.
d. Develop local and regional infrastructure.
e. Build a higher-skilled workforce through life-long-learning.
Collectively, these goals will help move Southwest Indiana toward its vision of the future and will included
innovation that will be a critical factor in business success as the region competes more in the national and
international economy. By identifying the region as a place that welcomes innovation, this goal will help
improve the region’s quality of life and economic success. The action strategy initiatives from this CEDS
process provided incorporation of business innovation as a key concept in every aspect of the region’s
economic development operations and provided the following initiatives:
Initiative One: Assist established employers to increase their innovation.
Initiative Two: Target new business prospects that have significant innovative strategies.
Initiative Three: Offer innovation strategies to small businesses.

2

Evansville’s struggling economy has been the focus of several recent major announcements in an effort
to create jobs and economic activity. First, in December 2015, the State of Indiana awarded Southwest
Indiana $42 million in the Regional Cities Initiative which will help leverage $900 million in total investment
for the area with twelve funded projects. Five of the projects are located in the urban core of Evansville
including a new Urban Housing Development by local business partners, a research building for the IU
Medical Campus in downtown, new living units in the historic 1913 YMCA building with a new fitness
campus in the downtown location, and a major addition to the downtown Signature School, a charter high
school ranked 7th in the nation.
The City of Evansville Department of Metropolitan Development (DMD) also completed a new Downtown
Master Plan in 2016, featuring achievable goals in renovating parts of the urban core into both
entertainment areas and commerce, but also shifting an area called No Co (North of Court Street) into a
light manufacturing “makers” area, which will encompass all types of businesses who “make” things from
motherboards to jewelry.
Evansville was successful in achieving the last Obama Administration Promise Zone designation in the
spring of 2016, which will bring new poverty fighting opportunities over a 10-year period. The Zone area
encompasses roughly 2/5ths of the city’s geography and a population within it of nearly 23,000, 39% of
whom live below the poverty level. The Promise Zone is a designation that increases competitiveness for
funding applications from Evansville to 16 federal agencies in competitive grant situations. Assuming
Congress passes legislation permitting them, the IRS can offer tax credits to new businesses opening in a
Zone, or businesses outside the Zone hiring residents within the Zone. These are opportunities to use our
EDA Revolving Loan Fund to bridge gaps for local businesses.
The City of Evansville EDA Revolving Loan Fund (ERLF) will work, when applicable, with these strategic
goals of the Promise Zone:
 Increase jobs, particularly those with higher wages;
 increase economic development;
 improve education opportunities;
 promote health and access to health care; and
 increase access to quality affordable housing.
1.
A specific example of the economic distress to be addressed by the ERLF includes
Whirlpool Corporation ceasing manufacturing operations in Evansville in 2011, but retaining the engineers
in the design center. Over the next few years, Whirlpool moved that work to Michigan, and its Evansville
design center closed for good in June 2014. This presented an opportunity for China-based appliance
maker, Haier America, to locate its first North American Tech Center in the City of Evansville, Indiana to
tap in to the experienced talent pool that had previously worked at Whirlpool’s refrigeration product design
center. Haier America completely renovated a former Coca Cola plant in the Jacobsville Redevelopment
Area (one of the target areas for EDA loans – see map on Page 21) in an adaptive reuse of an important
historic commercial structure.

2.
Southwest Indiana’s strategic location in the Midwest is ideal for industrial, commercial and
retail businesses. With the addition of the IU Medical School in Downtown Evansville, the region’s medical
and biosciences cluster represents a strong growth sector. The plans and strategies discussed above,
including the Regional Cities Plan, Downtown Master Plan and the Promise Zone strategies were
developed to deal with the economic adjustment problem and economic distress that exists in Evansville.
3.
The specific goals and objectives of the City of Evansville EDA Revolving Loan Fund
(ERLF) Plan are as follows:
a. job creation;
b. business innovation attraction;
c.

large innovative business recruitment;

3

d. small innovation business development and business finance; and
e. provide small and medium-sized employers with revolving loan fund assistance.
The primary objective of the ERLF is to provide funds to address the needs of large and small innovative
business development in Evansville by utilizing the ERLF program to create employment opportunities and
increase local incomes through the development of new, innovative manufacturing, service-related and
other business in the City of Evansville.
In Evansville’s original EDA RLF Plan, the City of Evansville identified the existing Metro Small Business
Assistance Corporation as the administrator of a Revolving Loan Fund under Title IX Sudden and Severe
Economic Dislocation Implementation Grant. Said Corporation was successful in managing the EDA
funded revolving loan fund, along with other City of Evansville/Vanderburgh County revolving loan fund
programs. In September 1995, the agreement with Metro Small Business Assistance Corporation to
administer the EDA Revolving Loan Fund was cancelled and all remaining EDA Revolving Loan Fund
dollars reverted to the City of Evansville to be administered by the City of Evansville Economic Development
Loan Committee, which has since been disbanded.
The ERLF is currently administered by the City of Evansville’s Department of Metropolitan Development
(DMD).
The City of Evansville will refer potential borrowers to start the application process with the Indiana Small
Business Development Center (ISBDC) who will provide expert training, counsel, and networking. ISBDC
will assist potential clients with creating successful business plans in order to help them gain access to the
ERLF program. ISBDC may also refer clients to the resources and expertise of SCORE to maximize the
success of existing and emerging small businesses. SCORE volunteers donate expertise in more than 600
skill areas to aid entrepreneurs by providing counseling, SCORE workshops, face-to-face mentoring and
online advice.
Growth Alliance for Greater Evansville (GAGE), may also provide technical and professional resources to
coordinate the ERLF program with a variety of ongoing economic development initiatives within the City of
Evansville, which include an annual business retention survey of firms located in the City of Evansville and
industry marketing programs
The City of Evansville will contract with a third party financial institution, hereby referred to as Compliance
Partner, to provide loan underwriting services to the City of Evansville. The contract for this service will be
completed upon acceptance and implementation of this ERLF plan and all contractual services will be
competitively bid in accordance with federal procurement procedures.
The City of Evansville may also utilize activities and resources of the Nationally recognized Chamber of
Commerce of Southwest Indiana which is one of the largest regional chambers of commerce in the state
of Indiana with more than 1,800 members, and is widely viewed as a high-impact, visionary organization
serving its members by fostering an innovative business, educational, cultural and governmental
environment that excels in a global marketplace.

B.

BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY

1.
Objectives: There is currently a lack of funds available from traditional capital markets in
the City of Evansville for small businesses, entrepreneurs and non-profit organizations. Due to the volatile
nature of the national economy, the recent recession and recent changes in banking regulations that are
concerned about the quality of credit, financial institutions have become somewhat more conservative in
their lending practices. The combination of these factors has resulted in financial institutions requiring 20

4

to 40 percent owners’ equity for all commercial loans and the desire to only finance those businesses that
can show several years of positive operating history.
Vanderburgh County, excluding the City of Evansville, is eligible to apply for Small Cities Community
Development Block Grant (CDBG) program grants through the State of Indiana Office of Community and
Rural Affairs (OCRA) Economic Development Fund. The OCRA program offers grants based upon job
creation and retention and must meet requirements of employing low-to-moderate income persons.
However, the OCRA program has very limited funding and is difficult for business persons to access due
to its competitive nature and low-to-moderate income (LMI) requirements by the employer. OCRA was
awarded a special appropriation in 2008 under disaster funding following three separate disasters that
calendar year. In this special disaster appropriation, the City of Evansville was able to obtain a three million
dollar grant to assist in the creation of 350 jobs in the City of Evansville with the expansion of Berry Plastics
Corporation. These special disaster appropriations are now entirely obligated by OCRA and no longer
available to the City of Evansville.
Given the above-mentioned problems and gaps in the local capital market and the scarcity of similar funding
sources, the City of Evansville intends to use the ERLF to help fill such gaps and provide a much needed
funding source for small business development. The ERLF will primarily target industrial borrowers, but
could also make certain funds available for commercial and service commercial borrowers.
2.
Targeted Businesses: The target businesses for the ERLF would allow the City of
Evansville to assist companies with technology or innovative solutions in product/service development,
delivery and distribution, and manufacturing processes. Additionally, small- and medium-sized firms that
have the potential, with growth, to garner greater than 50% of their sales from outside of the City of
Evansville are essential to increasing the long-term economic viability and sustainability of the City of
Evansville. The City of Evansville also intends to use the ERLF to provide commercial/retail loans to assist
in the redevelopment of struggling commercial corridors in the community. Companies that help execute
current redevelopment plans in target corridors allow strategic development. In particular, businesses that
startup or expand within the Downtown Redevelopment Area, Jacobsville Redevelopment Area or the Arts
District of the City of Evansville are particularly desirable funding targets. (See map of redevelopment areas
on Page 21.)
3.
Business Needs: At the present time, there exists a need in the City of Evansville for
supplemental small loans averaging $50,000 to $250,000 per borrower. The only other public sector
financing programs that provide direct loans to businesses would be Small Business Administration (SBA)
7A and 504 programs. Additional support for area small businesses through assisted financing would
bolster the local economy and provide support for job growth in the future. Businesses that usually require
less debt financing than the typical large manufacturing establishment can greatly benefit from access to
the ERLF. As a result, there is a need for the continuation of the City of Evansville Revolving Loan Fund
due to the lack of available financial resources from both private and public sector loan and/or grant
programs.
Furthermore, the need for the revolving loan fund is demonstrated by the past activity of the ERLF. All
former loans from the ERLF were subordinated to participating private lenders where several financing
sources have been accessed to create an affordable total financing package. The need for a business loan
fund that will be responsive to, and provide for, subordinated funding for businesses that may not
necessarily be the perfect applicant for traditional financing sources continues to exist.
The existing economic base and current economic conditions in Evansville easily justify the ERLF
objectives of retention and expansion of existing businesses and the development of new businesses. As
a result, there is a need to utilize available economic development tools, such as the ERLF, to help improve
the diversification of the City of Evansville’s economy, and to encourage other types of high employment
businesses. The ERLF program will be used to supplement existing business financing and attract other
public and private financing sources to assist local businesses.

5

4.
Other Programs and Activities: The City of Evansville created the Community
Revitalization Loan Fund with non-federal funds to provide small loans to businesses in targeted
redevelopment areas and cultural districts to assist with revitalization of distressed areas. HOPE of
Evansville, a local non-profit agency, recently re-started lending from an old CDBG-funded revolving loan
fund to provide microloans to borrowers creating low to moderate income jobs.
The University of Evansville’s Access to Capital and Expertise for Emerging Entrepreneurs (ACE3) program
is sponsored, funded, and co-managed by Old National Bank. The ACE3 program offers microloans to
women and minority owned businesses. Students interface with clients, review business plans, and serve
as underwriters for loans.
The University of Southern Indiana (USI) partners with the Growth Alliance for Greater Evansville (GAGE)
on Startup Weekend Evansville, an event where developers, designers, marketers, product managers, and
startup enthusiasts come together to share ideas, form teams, build products, and launch startups. GAGE
also provides incubator space for startup businesses.
Technology Commercialization Academy teams up USI students and challenges them to use recently
developed technology and take it to market. USI and GAGE have partnered with NSWC Crane to transfer
military developed technologies to businesses in southwest Indiana. Students in this program are
passionate about starting their own business and have a unique opportunity to do just that. This academy
helps to cultivate high-tech commercialization in southwest Indiana, train the business leaders of
tomorrow’s workforce and seed start-up companies. This provides the opportunity to home grow our own
talent and build the intellectual capacity of the region.
USI’s Eagle Innovation Accelerator (EIA) supports turning innovative ideas into new business ventures.
Through the EIA, entrepreneurs can receive coaching on business/profit models and validation, prototype
development and crafting pitches to investors, as well as seed funding and other support.

to the lack of available financial resources from both private and public sector loan and/or grant programs.
As stated above, there is substantial demand for seed funding, which may be attributed to Evansville
Startup Weekend, Technology Commercialization Academy and the Eagle Innovation Accelerator
programs.
Furthermore, the need for the revolving loan fund is demonstrated by the past activity of the ERLF. All
former loans from the ERLF were subordinated to participating private lenders where several financing
sources have been accessed to create an affordable total financing package. The need for a business loan
fund that will be responsive to, and provide for, subordinated funding for businesses that may not
necessarily be the perfect applicant for traditional financing sources continues to exist. The continued
funding for the Title IX revolving loan fund will assist the City of Evansville in accomplishing this goal.
The existing economic base and current economic conditions in Evansville easily justify the ERLF
objectives of retention and expansion of existing businesses and the development of new businesses. As
a result, there is a need to utilize available economic development tools, such as the ERLF, to help improve
the diversification of the City of Evansville’s economy, and to encourage other types of high employment

public and private financing sources to assist local businesses.

6

The City of Evansville will continue to evaluate the economic base and employment trends in Vanderburgh
County, and, if changes should occur in the local economy that would justify redefining these targeting
criteria, this section will be amended (using procedures identified herein) to meet changing conditions.
2.
Local Capital Market: There is currently a lack of funds available from traditional capital
markets in the City of Evansville for small businesses, entrepreneurs and non-profit organizations. Due to
the volatile nature of the national economy, the recent recession and recent changes in banking regulations
that are concerned about the quality of credit, financial institutions have become somewhat more

no longer available to the City of Evansville.
Given the above-mentioned problems and gaps in the local capital market and the scarcity of similar funding
sources, the City of Evansville intends to use the ERLF to help fill such gaps and provide a much needed
funding source for small business development. The ERLF will primarily target industrial borrowers, but
could also make certain funds available for commercial and service commercial borrowers.
3.
ERLF Financing Niche: The ERLF serves clients in need of capital who don’t qualify for
traditional bank financing and serves those needing gap financing. Eligible borrowers include industrial,
commercial, and retail businesses. Preference will be given to companies who use technology or innovative
solutions in product development/services, delivery and distribution, or manufacturing processes and
applicants who are small and medium-sized firms that have the potential, to garner greater than 50% of
their sales from outside of the City of Evansville. Preference will also be given to applicants for
commercial/retail loans which help execute redevelopment plans in target corridors; in particular,
businesses that start-up or expand within the designated redevelopment areas – see map on Page 21.
The following types of activities are eligible for ERLF funding: land acquisition; building acquisition; building
construction, including site preparation and demolition; building renovation; machinery and equipment
purchases with a depreciable life of at least seven years; leasehold improvements; and working capital.
The City of Evansville anticipates that the average loan size will be $100,000, with a maximum loan size
not to exceed 25% of the ERLF portfolio’s capital base. Loans are subject to availability of ERLF program
funds.
The minimum interest rate applicable to any ERLF Loan shall be four (4) percentage points below the lesser
of the current money center prime interest rate quoted in the Wall Street Journal, or the maximum interest
rate allowed under Indiana law. In no event shall the interest rate be less than the lower of (i) four (4)
percent or (ii) 75 percent of the prime interest rate listed in the Wall Street Journal. The interest rate
determined at the time of loan approval will be the rate at loan closing and shall be a fixed rate for the entire
term of the loan; provided, however, should the prime interest rate listed in the Wall Street Journal exceed
fourteen (14) percent, the minimum interest rate is not required to be raised above 10 (ten) percent if doing
so compromises the ability of the borrower to implement its financing strategy.
Standard terms for the ERLF loans will be as follows:

7

a. Term of ERLF Loans shall be as follows:
(i)

machinery and equipment – 5 to 17 years;

(ii)

buildings and land – 15 to 20 years; and

(iii)

working capital – 2 to 5 years.

The specific term within the identified range for an individual borrower will be based on the
useful life of the assets, as well as the terms offered by any private sector financial institution
participating in the project. Additionally, in packaging loans with multiple sources of funds, the
source of funds with the largest percentage in the loan package will be the basis for establishing
the term of the entire loan.
b. ERLF loans may be restructured when restructuring will improve the borrower’s ability to repay
the ERLF loan, as long as the business is financially viable as evidenced through a business
credit analysis. The DMD staff and the Compliance Partner will work with owner(s) of the
business to determine the need for restructuring and, if appropriate, the ERLF Loan
Administration Board (LAB) may restructure the ERLF loan to improve cash flow within the
business, subject to the financing policies set forth herein. Restructuring can include deferring
principal and interest payments, adjusting the rate of interest or providing additional working
capital.
The ERLF program includes interest rates and loan maturities that are designed to encourage business
formation and expansion, while simultaneously providing for the recapitalization and growth of the ERLF.
As described earlier in this section, the ERLF program has established a range for ERLF loan terms based
upon the type of loan being provided. Whenever possible, the minimum loan term will be utilized so that the
recapitalization of the ERLF portfolio can proceed at as rapid a rate as possible. In addition, the ERLF
program may provide a 1-year deferral on principal payments and balloon payment loans for businesses
that demonstrate a need for these activities; however, the deferral of principal payments will only be used
when a company’s financial projections demonstrate that a deferral is required to aid the company with the
ability to repay the loan.
The ERLF portfolio will strive to have an average collateral-to-loan amount ratio of 1:1 across the portfolio.
Collateral may include mortgages on land and buildings, liens on machinery and equipment, and liens on
accounts receivable and inventory. In addition, key-person life insurance coverage with a declining balance
equal to the outstanding loan balance, junior liens on all corporate assets, cross-collateralizing of multiple
loans, and personal guarantees may be used where appropriate. This collateral may be subordinated to
private sector financial institutions participating in the ERLF project, if required. The City of Evansville will
be listed as the secured party on all ERLF collateral documents

D.

FINANCING POLICIES

To ensure that the City of Evansville makes eligible ERLF loans consistent with this Plan, the City of
Evansville shall contract with an independent third party to conduct compliance and loan quality review for
each ERLF loan proposal (Compliance Partner). Any fees payable to such Compliance Partner shall
constitute administrative fees under this Plan in compliance with 13 CFR 307.
The following financing policies will be utilized in the ERLF program:
1.
Eligible Lending Area: The City of Evansville ERLF assistance will be withdrawn if the
ERLF financed activity is moved outside of the City of Evansville. Other eligible lending areas may be
added in the future with EDA’s prior written approval.
2.
Eligible Borrowers: Eligible borrowers include industrial, commercial, and retail
businesses. Preference will be given to companies who use technology or innovative solutions in product

8

development/services, delivery and distribution, or manufacturing processes and applicants who are small
and medium-sized firms that have the potential, to garner greater than 50% of their sales from outside of
the City of Evansville. Preference will also be given to applicants for commercial/retail loans which help
execute redevelopment plans in target corridors; in particular, businesses that start-up or expand within the
designated redevelopment areas – see map on Page 21.
3.
Allowable Lending Activities: The following types of activities will be eligible for ERLF
funding: land acquisition; building acquisition; building construction, including site preparation and
demolition; building renovation; machinery and equipment purchases, with a depreciable life of at least
seven years; leasehold improvements; and working capital.
4.
assistance:

Prohibited Lending Activities: The following activities are not eligible for ERLF

a.

Acquiring an equity position in a private business;

b.

Subsidizing interest payments on existing ERLF loans;

c.
Providing for borrower’s required equity contributions under other Federal
Agencies’ loan programs;
d.
Enabling borrowers to acquire an interest in a business either through the
purchase of stock or through the acquisition of assets, unless sufficient justification is
provided in the loan documentation. Sufficient justification may include acquiring a business
to save it from imminent closure or to acquire a business to facilitate a significant expansion
or increase in investment with a significant increase in jobs. The potential economic benefits
must be clearly consistent with the strategic objectives of the ERLF;
e.
Providing ERLF loans to a borrower for the purpose of investing in interestbearing accounts, certificates of deposit or any investment unrelated to the ERLF; or
f.

Refinance existing debt, unless:
(i)
The City of Evansville sufficiently demonstrates in the loan documentation
a “sound economic justification” for the refinancing (e.g., the refinancing will support
additional capital investment intended to increase business activities). For this
purpose, reducing the risk of loss to an existing lender(s) or lowering the cost of
financing to a borrower shall not, without other indicia, constitute a sound economic
justification; or
(ii)
ERLF capital will finance the purchase of the rights of a prior lien holder
during a foreclosure action which is necessary to preclude a significant loss on an
ERLF loan. ERLF capital may be used for this purpose only if there is a high probability
of receiving compensation from the sale of assets sufficient to cover an ERLF’s costs
plus a reasonable portion of the outstanding ERLF loan within a reasonable period of
time, as determined by EDA, following the date of refinancing.

5.
Loan Size: The City of Evansville anticipates that the average loan size will be $100,000,
with a maximum loan size not to exceed 25% of the ERLF capital base to a single borrower. Loans are
subject to availability of ERLF program funds.
6.
Interest Rates: The minimum interest rate applicable to any ERLF Loan shall be four (4)
percentage points below the lesser of the current money center prime interest rate quoted in the Wall Street
Journal, or the maximum interest rate allowed under Indiana law. In no event shall the interest rate be less
than the lower of (i) four (4) percent or (ii) 75 percent of the prime interest rate listed in the Wall Street
Journal. The interest rate determined at the time of loan approval will be the rate at loan closing and shall

9

be a fixed rate for the entire term of the loan; provided, however, should the prime interest rate listed in the
Wall Street Journal exceed fourteen (14) percent, the minimum interest rate is not required to be raised
above 10 (ten) percent if doing so compromises the ability of the borrower to implement its financing
strategy.
7.

Terms: Standard terms for the ERLF loans will be as follows:
a. Term of ERLF Loans shall be as follows:
(i)

machinery and equipment –5 to 17 years;

(ii)

buildings and land – 15 to 20 years; and

(iii)

working capital – 2 to 5 years.

The specific term within the identified range for an individual borrower will be based on the
useful life of the assets, as well as the terms offered by any private sector financial institution
participating in the project. Additionally, in packaging loans with multiple sources of funds, the
source of funds with the largest percentage in the loan package will be the basis for establishing
the term of the entire loan.
b. ERLF loans may be restructured when restructuring will improve the borrower’s
ability to repay the ERLF loan, as long as the business is financially viable as
evidenced through a business credit analysis. The DMD staff and the Compliance
Partner will work with owner(s) of the business to determine the need for
restructuring and, if appropriate, the ERLF LAB may restructure the ERLF loan to
improve cash flow within the business, subject to the financing policies set forth
herein. Restructuring can include deferring principal and interest payments, adjusting
the rate of interest or providing additional working capital.
The ERLF program includes interest rates and loan maturities that are designed to encourage
business formation and expansion, while simultaneously providing for the recapitalization and
growth of the ERLF. As described earlier in this section, the ERLF program has established a
range for ERLF loan terms based upon the type of loan being provided. Whenever possible,
the minimum loan term will be utilized so that the recapitalization of the ERLF portfolio can
proceed at as rapid a rate as possible. In addition, the ERLF program will provide a 1-year
deferral on principal payments and balloon payment loans for businesses that demonstrate a
need for these activities; however, the deferral of principal payments will only be used when a
company’s financial projections demonstrate that a deferral is required.
8.
Fees: The ERLF program will charge a loan application and processing fee to process the
loan application. This fee will be used to pay for administrative costs associated with the ERLF program.
The ERLF program will charge a loan closing fee not to exceed 2 percent on all ERLF loans. The ERLF
reserves the right to waive or reduce this loan closing fee when deemed appropriate. The loan closing fee
will be used to pay for administrative costs associated with the ERLF program in accordance with EDA’s
federal regulations 13 CFR 307.8.

9.
Equity and Collateral: The equity participation required for new businesses will be from
10% to 30% depending on the demand for the product in the market, the competition, the capability of the
management team and the collateral backing the loan.
The equity participation required for a business expansion loan will be 5% to 10%, again, depending on the
above reasons and the current equity to debt ratio.
The goal of the ERLF program will be to have an average collateral-to-loan amount ratio of 1:1 across the
portfolio. Collateral may include mortgages on land and buildings, liens on machinery and equipment, and

10

liens on accounts receivable and inventory. In addition, key-person life insurance coverage with a declining
balance equal to the outstanding loan balance, junior liens on all corporate assets, cross-collateralizing of
multiple loans, and personal guarantees may be used where appropriate. This collateral may be
subordinated to private sector financial institutions participating in the ERLF project, if required. The City of
Evansville will be listed as the secured party on all ERLF collateral documents
10.
Moratoria: The ERLF program retains the option of offering special financing techniques
to those applicants that demonstrate a need as evidenced by the firm’s financial projections. These
techniques include: 1) a deferral of principal payments during the first year of an ERLF loan, when the
applicant business has a projected level of cash that is below the industry average; 2) the subordination of
the ERLF security position to private sector lenders that are participating in the ERLF project; and 3) the
use of balloon payment loans, when a business can provide reasonable assurances of being able to
refinance the balloon payment or otherwise retire the debt.
11.
Start-ups: Preference will be given for loans to commercial or retail applicants which help
further redevelopment in target corridors; in particular, to businesses that start-up or expand within the
designated redevelopment areas – see map on Page 21. Other than this preference, there will be no
policies or procedures that are different for start-up businesses.
12.
Working Capital: The City of Evansville is willing to make working capital loans but intends
that such loans shall not exceed 30% of the entire loan portfolio.
13.
Credit Not Otherwise Available: Loans will only be made to eligible borrowers when
credit is not available from other loan programs on terms and conditions that would permit successful
implementation of the project activities to be financed. A signed bank turn-down letter demonstrating that
credit is not otherwise available on terms and conditions that permit the completion of successful operation
for the activity to be financed will be required.

E.

PORTFOLIO STANDARDS AND TARGETS

The following Standards will be utilized in the ERLF program:
1.
Target Percentages: As described herein, ERLF loans will be made for the acquisition
and renovation of fixed assets and for providing working capital. Working capital loans will not exceed 30
percent of the ERLF portfolio. The working capital limit may be adjusted, if appropriate, depending upon
the quality of the ERLF portfolio and the particular financing needs of the City of Evansville. The City of
Evansville anticipates making ERLF Loans for industrial, commercial and service commercial purposes.
The City of Evansville anticipates that the percentages of such loans shall be sixty percent (60%) industrial,
thirty percent (30%) commercial and ten percent (10%) service commercial.
With respect to the business status of the Borrower, the City of Evansville shall make ERLF loans to
businesses in the start-up phase of operations, as well as for business expansion and retention loans. The
City of Evansville anticipates that the percentages of such loans shall be twenty percent (20%) start-up,
seventy percent (70%) expansion and ten percent (10%) retention.
Depending on the Loan Type, the City of Evansville anticipates that sixty percent (60%) will be fixed asset
loans vs forty percent (40%) working capital loans.

2.
Private Sector Leverage Ratio: A minimum ratio of two private sector dollars for each
ERLF dollar will be required collectively of businesses participating in the ERLF program. All private sector
dollars must be obtained from a non-public source. No public grant funds of any type may be counted
towards leveraged private investment. To be classified as leveraged, private investment must be made
within twelve (12) months of approval of an ERLF loan, as part of the same business development project,
and may include:

11

a.

Capital invested by the borrower or others;

b.

Financing from private entities; or

c.
The non-guaranteed portions and ninety (90) percent of the guaranteed portions
of the U.S. Small Business Administration’s 7(A) loans and 504 debenture loans.
Equity contributions must be documented with a letter from the contributing source that commits to the
injection of the equity upon receipt of an ERLF loan and identifies the exact dollar amount and source of
the funds. The letters must be on the financial institution’s and investor’s letterhead, dated as to the effective
date and length of commitment and contain original signatures. Such letter shall also state that the equity
contributor it is contributing the maximum amount available and that such equity contributor agrees and
acknowledges that the ERLF loan is contingent upon the receipt of equity contributions set forth in such
letter prior to the closing the ERLF loan. Such letter from the equity investor shall also identify the source
and amount of equity contributions and the commitment of funds upon receipt of an ERLF loan.
3.
Job/Cost Ratio: An average of one full-time equivalent (FTE) job will be created and/or
retained for every $30,000 of ERLF investment.
F.

ERLF LOAN SELECTION CRITERIA

The Compliance Partner and ERLF LAB shall use the following criteria to evaluate proposed loans:
1. Is the proposed loan and all activities related thereto consistent with the ERLF Plan?
2. Does the proposed loan application capitalize on existing regional assets?
3. Will the proposed loan support advance innovation, increased productivity in a particular
industry or an emerging sector of the economy?
4. Is the potential borrower part of an existing industry cluster?
5. To what extent will the project leverage private investment that would not otherwise come to
fruition without the ERLF’s investment?
6. Will the proposed loan result in the creation or retention of higher-skilled, higher-wage jobs?
G. PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT PROCESS
1.
The City of Evansville will review the Portfolio Standards and Targets Standards, as noted
in Part 1 Section E of this document, on a continuing basis and, if changes should occur in the local
economy that would justify redefining these standards, this section will be amended (using procedures
identified herein) to meet the changing conditions.

2.
This ERLF plan may be amended to meet changing conditions or the future needs of the
City of Evansville, but at a minimum of every 5 years per EDA’s federal regulations. Although individual
loans will be approved by the ERLF Loan Administration Board (LAB) as stated herein, the City of Evansville
and EDA will retain the responsibility for any amendments to the ERLF Plan. As such, amendments will be
permitted only by written agreement between the EDA and the City of Evansville. This process will be
undertaken by DMD staff using the most recent studies to determine if the needs of the community have
changed.
The ERLF Loan Administration Board shall meet on an as-needed basis to evaluate the performance of the
ERLF program and the loans outstanding thereunder. The ERLF Loan Administration Board members
shall review and discuss, among other things, loan proposals and strategies for handling loans in delinquent
and/or default status.

12

PART II:
REVOLVING LOAN FUND OPERATION PROCEDURES
A.

ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE

1.
Critical Operational Functions: The day-to-day operation of the ERLF program is
performed by DMD. The DMD staff is responsible for monitoring the activities listed in “Other Requirements”
– civil rights, environmental assessment, relocation, flood hazard insurances, access for the handicapped,
and Davis-Bacon wage compliance. However, the ERLF Loan Administration Board has the authority to
approve all loans and make the policy decisions necessary to efficiently administer ERLF loan activities.
Minutes of the meetings approving the loan, sign-in sheet of the participants in the meeting, and all original
loan documents including, but not limited to, mortgages, UCCs, loan agreements, personal guarantees and
all other security agreement are maintained in the appropriate files.
The DMD staff is responsible for marketing the ERLF program in the City of Evansville. The marketing effort
for the ERLF program consists of a variety of activities that are used to provide information on the program
and promote the availability of ERLF loans. These activities include the following:
a.
meetings with local government officials to inform them of the program and to seek
their support;
b.
meetings with representatives of the major financial institutions and commercial
real estate firms to explain the program and to request their assistance in promoting the
program;
c.
program,

press conferences on an annual basis to announce the availability of the ERLF

d.

meetings with representatives of GAGE to promote the availability of the program;

e.
advertisements and news releases placed in the local daily newspaper on a
periodic basis to promote the ERLF program, and to provide local businesses with information
on the availability of ERLF funds;
f.

use of social media to promote the ERLF program; and

g.
partnership with the Regional Center for Southwestern Indiana Small Business
Development Center (ISBDC), the Chamber of Commerce of Southwest Indiana, Growth
Alliance for Greater Evansville (GAGE), Grow Southwest Indiana Workforce, University of
Southern Indiana Education & Entrepreneurial Support Center, and SCORE to promote the
ERLF program.
ERLF loan applications must include data concerning all environmental impacts of the activities to be
financed. The Environmental Review staff at the DMD shall assess the significance of all environmental
impacts of activities to be financed, in compliance with the National Environment Policy Act of 1969 and
other Federal environmental mandates, as required. No activity shall be financed which would result in a
significant adverse environmental impact unless that impact is to be mitigated to the point of insignificance.
In addition, to ensure that the City of Evansville makes eligible ERLF loans consistent with this Plan, the
City of Evansville shall contract with a Compliance Partner. Any fees payable to such Compliance Partner
shall constitute administrative fees under this Plan.
ISBDC will review all initial applications for completeness, then forward the application and all documents
to the Compliance Partner. The Compliance Partner shall review the application and conduct a credit
analysis. The Compliance Partner shall make a formal recommendation to DMD regarding approval or
disapproval of the application. The DMD shall then make a formal recommendation to the ERLF Loan

13

Administration Board (LAB), including any recommendation from the Compliance Partner. The ERLF LAB
shall vote on the application, and if approved, shall instruct the Compliance Partner to prepare all loan
documentation.
A majority of the members of the ERLF LAB may approve or disapprove loan applications, determine
interest rates on loans as well as loan terms, and request the City Finance Director, in writing, to make
disbursements. The ERLF LAB may also establish reasonable loan fees to be paid by the borrower at the
time of closing and costs directly incurred in processing and closing of a loan, i.e., legal, and accounting
services to be paid by the borrower.
Closings of all loans shall be conducted through the cooperation of the ERLF LAB, the DMD, the
Compliance Partner staff and the office of the Attorney for the City of Evansville.
Loan Servicing shall be conducted by the DMD (with the assistance of the attorney for the City of Evansville,
as needed) including, without limitation, monitoring repayment activities, referring troubled loan recipients
to an appropriate advisor for assistance, administering loan collections and handling defaulted loans and
foreclosures. The DMD shall also be responsible for organizational administration, including financial
recordkeeping and ensuring compliance with all EDA requirements.
The ERLF LAB may adopt policies and procedures to implement the objectives of the ERLF so long as
such actions are in accordance with the general and special terms and conditions of the grant agreement
between the City of Evansville and the EDA.
2.
Loan Administration Board: The City of Evansville has formed the ERLF Loan
Administration Board (LAB) comprised of seven board members, four of which are appointed by the Mayor
and one by the Evansville City Council. One Board member shall be the CEO of GAGE and one may be
from the Economic Development Coalition of Southwest Indiana (EDC). The LAB members are selected
on the basis of their area of representation and appointed annually. The ERLF LAB should include the
following areas of representation: 1) banking (two separate financial institutions); 2) legal; 3) accounting; 4)
major employers in the City and 5) commercial/retail. The chairman of the ERLF LAB will be elected on
an annual basis. Each member of the ERLF LAB shall serve a one year term. The entities appointing the
Members of the ERLF LAB shall ensure that the ERLF LAB has minority and/or female representatives.
A majority of the ERLF LAB in attendance at a meeting constitutes a quorum, and shall be required for
official ERLF LAB action. Written records of all meetings shall be prepared and maintained by DMD and in
the DMD offices.
3.
Conflicts of Interest: Conflicts of interest shall be handled as follows: The City of
Evansville will maintain the highest standards of conduct to prevent conflicts of interest in connection with
the award of EDA funds or its use. A conflict of interest generally exists when an Interested Party
participates in a matter that has a direct and predictable effect on the Interested Party's personal or financial
interests. A conflict may also exist where there is an appearance that an Interested Party's objectivity in
performing his or her responsibilities under the Project is impaired. For example, an appearance of
impairment of objectivity may result from an organizational conflict where, because of other activities or
relationships with other persons or entities, an Interested Party is unable to render impartial assistance,
services or advice to the City of Evansville, a participant in the ERLF or to the Federal government.
Additionally, a conflict of interest may result from non-financial gain to an Interested Party, such as benefit
to reputation or prestige in a professional field. An Interested Party shall not receive any direct or indirect
financial or personal benefits in connection with the award of an ERLF Loan or its use for payment or
reimbursement of costs by or to the Recipient. An Interested Party shall also not, directly or indirectly,
solicit or accept any gift, gratuity, favor, entertainment or other benefit having monetary value, for himself
or herself or for another person or entity, from any person or organization which has obtained or seeks to
obtain an ERLF loan from the City of Evansville. Costs incurred in violation of any conflicts of interest rules
contained in this chapter or in violation of any assurances by the City of Evansville may be denied
reimbursement.

14

In addition to the rules set forth in this section: (1) An Interested Party of a recipient of an ERLF Loan shall
not receive, directly or indirectly, any personal or financial benefits resulting from the disbursement of ERLF
loans; (2) a recipient of an ERLF Loan shall also not lend ERLF funds to an Interested Party; and (3) former
LAB members of a recipient of an ERLF Loan and members of his or her immediate family shall not receive
a loan from such ERLF for a period of two (2) years from the date that the LAB member last served on the
LAB.
As used in this Section, “Interested Party” shall mean any officer, employee or member of the board of LAB
or other governing board of the ERLF recipient, including any other parties that advise, approve,
recommend or otherwise participate in the business decisions of the ERLF recipient, such as agents,
advisors, consultants, attorneys, accountants or shareholders. An Interested Party also includes the
Interested Party’s “Immediate Family” (defined as a person’s spouse, parents, grandparents, siblings,
children and grandchildren, but does not include distant relatives, such as cousins, unless the distant
relative lives in the same household as the person) and other persons directly connected to the Interested
Party by law or through a business organization. In addition, “Immediate Family” includes a person’s
“significant other” or partner in a domestic relationship with an “Interested Party.”
ERLF LAB members who are employed by a financial institution that is a part of any given ERLF loan
package will be excluded from voting on all matters relating to that particular project.

of the proposed activity on historic and archeological resources prior to closing of the loan. In cases where
SHPO has recommended actions or has determined an adverse impact, the City of Evansville and ERLF
applicant must work with the SHPO and EDA to address any issues identified before the ERLF Loan is
closed.
In addition, no activity shall be financed which involves unresolved site contamination issues. Loan
applicants shall be responsible for working with the appropriate state environmental agency office to resolve
any outstanding issues prior to any loan being approved for the affected site. Loan applicants are required
to provide information regarding whether or not there was hazardous materials such as EPA listed (see
CFR 400) hazardous substances, leaking underground storage tanks, asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls
(PCB), or other hazardous materials present on or adjacent to affected property that have been improperly
handled or released and/or have the potential of endangering public health. If deemed necessary, loan
applicants may be required to perform or provide evidence of performance of a Phase I Environmental Site
Assessment to identify possible sources of contamination, a Phase II Environmental Site Assessment to

All ERLF loan documents shall include language stating that the ERLF borrower shall protect and hold the
Federal government harmless from and against all liabilities that the Federal government may incur as a
result of providing an ERLF Grant to assist directly or indirectly in site preparation or construction, as well
as the direct or indirect renovation or repair of any facility or site. These protections shall apply to the extent
that the Federal government may become potentially liable as a result of ground water, surface, soil or

Evansville or any ERLF borrower, predecessor or successor in connection with the ERLF project.
Revolving Loan Fund Capital shall be used for the purpose of making ERLF loans that are consistent with

each loan agreement must clearly state the purpose of each loan.
3.
Loan Disbursement: Funds will be disbursed to applicant, together with documentation
outlining procedures for repayment. Such funds shall be disbursed by check. In the event an ERLF loan
is a working capital loan or a construction financing loan, the loan documents evidencing such loan shall
include procedures for and documents required to authorize an additional disbursement of funds. Such

18

procedures and documents shall be determined by the DMD based upon the specific facts related to each
loan. Loan documents will be recorded as needed.
D.

LOAN SERVICING PROCEDURES

1.
Repayment: The standard method of loan payment for all ERLF borrowers shall be
monthly payments of principal and interest. Such method may only be varied upon approval by the ERLF
LAB. All payments by ERLF borrowers must be made to the DMD and deposited by the DMD within two
(2) business days after receipt from the ERLF borrower.
The ERLF program will make every effort to anticipate problems with loans to ERLF borrowers. An
automatic late payment penalty in the amount of $100 for any portion of the monthly payment that is more
than 10 days past due may be applied.
All funds that are repaid to the ERLF program will be re-loaned in accordance with the procedures
established in the ERLF plan. All principal and interest payments and recycled ERLF funds will be
deposited with the City of Evansville, held in a segregated, interest-bearing checking account. One hundred
percent of any and all principal and interest payment will be included in the recapitalization of the ERLF,
unless spent for Administration purposes as allowed by 13 CFR 307.12. The DMD will maintain records
documenting all expenditures in accordance with generally accepted accounting procedures.
2.
Monitoring: The DMD will be responsible for monitoring and servicing loans made as a
part of the ERLF program. To assist the staff in this activity, a financial management system will be
maintained in accordance with the standards prescribed in Uniform Guidance Part 2 200. In addition, the
ERLF loan program will be monitored by the Indiana State Board of Accounts in the City of Evansville’s
organization-wide financial and compliance audit annually.
The special provisions that are included as a part of “Other Requirements” will be monitored by the DMD
staff. The ERLF program will require that each ERLF loan applicant submit the following EDA Forms to
ensure compliance with the civil rights, employment, and non-relocation provisions of the ERLF program:
1) “Assurances of Compliance with Civil Rights and Other Legal Requirements;” 2) “Current and Projected
Employee Data;” and 3) “Employers Certificate of Non-relocation.”
3.
Loan Files: In addition to maintaining a copy of the preceding forms for borrowers, DMD
staff will maintain a loan file for each ERLF recipient. Each file will include at a minimum: a copy of private
lender loan agreement, financial statements, annual insurance certifications, annual site visit reports,
general correspondence, job reports, loan meeting minutes, loan meeting sign-in sheet and loan approval
form. Documents shall be maintained in appropriate fire proof files.
4.
Job Creation: The loan recipient will submit a semi-annual report that includes a
completed “Current and Projected Employee Data” form upon request. The DMD may also make a
minimum of an annual onsite inspection. The DMD will submit a progress and financial report to the ERLF
LAB and the City of Evansville upon request, and comply with EDA’s reporting requirements.
5.
Defaulted Loans: When a loan payment is in arrears, the borrowers’ monthly invoice will
reflect the amount that is in arrears. At 30, 60 and 90 days in arrears, DMD will call the primary contact to
inquire as to why payment has not been received and work with the business to determine if professional
business management assistance is needed for the day-to-day operation of the business.
Loans will be considered delinquent when missing three consecutive payments. When a borrower becomes
delinquent, DMD will schedule a meeting with the owner(s) of the business to discuss the delinquency
problem. If DMD determines that a restructure of the loan is in order for the borrower to continue to do
business, and have the ability to repay the loan, a recommendation will be taken to the ERLF LAB.
Upon receiving said recommendation, the ERLF LAB may, at its discretion, restructure the ERLF loan if the
business demonstrates a need for this activity. This could include offering a lower rate of interest, deferring
principal and interest payments while the firm is generating additional working capital, providing working

19

capital as part of a restructured ERLF loan, or other actions necessary to assist the business in resolving
its financial problems.
As described above, every effort will be made to assist an ERLF client who is experiencing problems in
servicing debt. However, when a firm becomes financially insolvent and is unable to restructure or modify
its loan, or otherwise violates the conditions of the ERLF loan agreement, the ERLF LAB (with the approval
of the City of Evansville) reserves the right to declare the entire amount due and payable under the terms
and conditions described in the documents securing interest in the financed property. The ERLF LAB will
exercise this option in cooperation with superior lien holders. The City of Evansville will not purchase the
security interest of superior lien holders. Loans unable to meet any of the above mentioned considerations
will be considered in default.
6.
Write-Offs: In the event a loan is declared to be in default, the City of Evansville may
initiate foreclosure procedures, or take other appropriate actions as the ERLF LAB and the City of Evansville
see fit to resolve the delinquencies.
The following is a priority list for payments on defaulted ERLF loans. When DMD receives proceeds on a
defaulted ERLF loan that is not subject to liquidation pursuant to §307.20, such proceeds shall be applied
in the following order of priority: first, towards any costs of collection; second, towards outstanding penalties
and fees; third, towards any accrued interest to the extent due and payable; and fourth, toward any
outstanding principal balance.
After all legal options have been explored and legal counsel has notified the DMD and the City
Administration there are no further avenues available, DMD will advise EDA of default via email and report
complying with EDA’s reporting requirements in effect. Any remaining balance shall be written off by the
City of Evansville.
E.

ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES

1.
Accounting: The DMD has established a separate bank account for the ERLF so that
repayments and interest income are clearly identifiable and auditable. The ERLF portfolio and cash related
thereto shall be clearly distinguishable from any other loan program established by the City of Evansville.
The City of Evansville shall ensure that the ERLF is operating in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles (GAAP) as in effect from time to time in the United States and the provisions outlined
in 2 CFR 200 and the Compliance Supplement, as applicable.
The City of Evansville shall comply with applicable federal cost principles found in 2 CFR part 225.
2.
Administrative Costs: As described earlier in this Plan, the ERLF program will assess
fees paid by the borrowers that along with ERLF Income, will be used to defray administrative costs
associated with the ERLF program. In accordance with 13 CFR 307.12(a), ERLF Income may be used to
fund administrative costs, provided: 1) such ERLF Income and administrative costs are incurred in the same
six (6) month reporting period; 2) ERLF Income not used for administrative costs during the six (6) month
reporting period shall be made available for lending activities; and 3) ERLF Income shall not be withdrawn
from the ERLF capital base in a subsequent reporting period for any purpose other than lending without the
prior written consent of EDA. The City of Evansville shall comply with applicable federal cost principles and
audit requirements when charging administrative costs against ERLF Income, including, without limitation,
2 CFR Part 225.
3.

EDA Reporting: The City of Evansville shall comply with EDA federal regulations.

4.
Audits: The City of Evansville acknowledges that all ERLF loan funds are subject to an
annual audit requirement and the full value of the ERLF (outstanding loans and available cash) must be
shown every year on the City of Evansville’s Schedule of Federal Expenditures (SEFA). The City of
Evansville shall ensure that the auditor performs the required federal audit procedures in accordance with
Uniform Guidance 2 CFR Part 200 and the RLF Standard Terms and Conditions.
