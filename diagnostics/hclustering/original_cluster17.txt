CORRESPONDENCES AND AGREEMENTS
CORRESPONDENCE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF PLANNING RE: Marquette Park Lakefront East Phase
IIA‚Äê Contract for Professional Services Program Management and Capital Improvement Projects
Amendment No. 2
C. Green:
TO:
BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS AND SAFETY
FROM: DWAYNE WILLIAMS, DIRECTOR OR PLANNING
RE:
CONTRACT FOR PROFESSIONAL SERVICES FOR MARQUETTE PARK LAKEFRONT
EAST PROJECT CHANGE ORDERS ‚ÄêPHASE II
DATE: AUGUST 3, 2012
I respectfully request that the Board of Public Works and Safety place the referenced and attached
Contract Amendment #2 on the August 8, 2012 agenda for consideration.
As part of this IIA contract, Lead Consultant and its Sub‚Äêconsultants completed construction documents
for certain capital improvements for the Gary Bathing Beach Aquatorium, which were permitted, bid,
awarded, and are substantially constructed. During construction, contractors discovered previously
concealed structural damage to certain building components that needed remediation. In addition, City
officials requested the installation of additional fire detection equipment, room indentification signs,
handrails, doors and scuppers. Remediation of the structural problems and installation of the additional
fire detection and architectural improvements require additional design, engineering and construction
services that are outside of the original Scope of Services. Consequently, Lead Consultant and its Sub‚Äê
Consultants need to re‚Äêdesign and re‚Äêengineer previously completed structural, fire detection and
architectural improvement, and provide additional construction services. As compensation for the
satisfactory completion of the additional professional services, the City will allow Lead Consultant to
reallocate $33,300 of unused reimbursable expense budget to Professional Services fees, reallocate in
NO INCREASE to Lead Consultant‚Äôs contract value.
The additional compensation is reasonable and can be adequately funded by reallocating $33,300 of the
Lead Consultant‚Äôs unused IIA reimbursable expense budget, which at the time of this amendment has a
balance of $33,354.00 that will not be used for any other purpose.
Attached is the agreement.
