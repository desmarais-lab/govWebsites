Education Programs
***** Education Programs *****
The JCAC Greater Jasper Consolidated Schools, Holy Family School, and Precious
Blood School proudly announce the Education Programming for 2016-2017.  For
over 20 years, these partners have worked together to provide professional arts
experiences, both in the schools and at the Jasper Arts Center, for Jasper
students, K-12. We believe in developing an appreciation of the arts at a young
age. Recent studies have shown that individuals with some arts background are
more creative and bring the necessary skills to adapt in a rapidly changing
world market. But...we hope the kids just have fun, too!

Many of our series performers will also be conducting school performances,
master classes, or workshops. Several of our visual artists will also be found
in classrooms. In addition, some guest artists are provided just for our school
programming.
***** Briefly...  *****

Language Arts, Special Needs, Family and Consumer Sciences, Business, Web
Design and Media, American and World History, World Geography, Painting, Jazz

*****_Happiness_this_Holiday_Season_*****
about 5 months ago
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m stronger because of my hard times; wiser because of my
mistakes; happier because of my sad experiences.&rdquo;
Kushandwizdom
The holiday season is upon us.  Virtually every event, activity and workplace
is filled with the gifting, helping others and many measures of kindness as we
celebrate. Similarly for many, this time of year is replete with emotional
triggers for which joy is not present.
          The quotation above symbolizes life&rsquo;s balance.
          First, there is no adult among us who hasn&rsquo;t faced challenges
at some point.  Using those moments as learning experiences is essential and
overcoming obstacles enables us to be compassionate to others facing them.
          Secondly, none of us has gone through life without making a mistake
and we&rsquo;re probably annoyed with a few people who think they
haven&rsquo;t!  One should always attempt to minimize errors and, when they
occur, to gain knowledge which prevents them from being repeated.
          Finally, the most significant negative impact this time of year is
sadness &ndash; often from the loss of loved ones who are not able to share
with us any longer.  Here is where understanding the root of happiness is so
very important.  That is:  Being happy comes from within not from another.
          I extend my prayers for happiness to all citizens of Jasper and our
city employees now and in the future. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!

Mayor Terry Seitz

Brad Eckerle, with Brosmer Land Surveying, on behalf of Whitney A. Gutgsell, requested a
petition to vacate a Public Utility and Drainage Easement on Lots 79 and 80 in Brookstone
Estates III subdivision. The subdivision was platted in 2007. Eckerle stated that new flood
insurance rate maps were implemented in 2014, and were coordinated with DNR. The land
owner is planning on building a house within the lots. Eckerle stated that the lowest living area
of the house will be two feet higher than flood plain, and in compliance with the City ordinance.
There is storm sewer and wastewater on the front of the property. Hollinden stated that the
Wastewater Department has access to the lots and no issues with the vacation.
Michael Kern made a motion to recommend to the Common Council vacation of a Public Utility
and Drainage Easement on Lots 79 and 80 in Brookstone Estates III Subdivision at the request of
Whitney Gutgsell. Wayne Schuetter seconded the motion. Motion approved, 7-0.
AUTOMATED ENERGY AGREEMENT (DVD-16:50)
Jerry Schitter informed the Board that the Electric Department has had a service agreement with
Automated Energy since 2012, for monitoring equipment behind our meters in order to monitor
electric loads at facilities. Schitter asked for the Board’s permission to renew the service
agreement with Automated Energy. Attorney Kabrick has reviewed and approved the
agreement. The monthly utility bills issued to participating customers include a charge to cover
the cost of this service.
Wayne Schuetter made a motion to approve the service agreement with Automated Energy.
Keith Masterson seconded the motion. Motion approved, 7-0.
ELECTRIC PLANNING COMMITTEE REPORT (DVD-19:18)
Wayne Schuetter, Chairman of the Electric Planning Committee, stated the Committee did meet
on September 13, 2016. At the meeting the Committee discussed the adoption of IMPA’s
PURPA plan. Dave McGimpsey, with Bingham Greenebaum Doll LLP explained that IMPA
was requesting that the City of Jasper’s municipal electric utility adopt IMPA’s Public Utility
Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) joint implementation plan for purposes of transferring the
purchase obligation of a qualifying facility (QF) under PURPA to IMPA.
McGimpsey reminded the Committee that Jasper’s existing contract with IMPA is a fullrequirements contract, meaning Jasper must purchase all of its electricity from IMPA. IMPA is
now requesting adoption of their PURPA plan for the remainder of the City’s contract term,
which is until April 1, 2042.
McGimpsey informed the Committee that approximately forty members of IMPA have already
signed the contract to adopt the PURPA plan. These forty members do not have a municipal
electric utility. McGimpsey stated that if Jasper decides to adopt the plan, the City would avoid
dealing with power supply issues and staffing concerns to oversee QF interconnection issues, and
can let IMPA deal with any QF issues. If the plan is adopted, Jasper could also potentially lose

future flexibility in power supply and could miss an opportunity to save money on its purchased
power.
McGimpsey stated that the City could decide not to adopt the IMPA PURPA plan and stay the
course until a QF sought to sell power to Jasper. This would delay the QF decision date and
possibly retain flexibility for the City’s power supply. The City would then have to incur costs
and expenses of dealing with a QF and may incur potential legal costs litigating Sec. 3(a) of the
current IMPA full-requirements contract.
The Committee discussed in detail the advantages and disadvantages of adopting the plan. The
Committee decided to contact IMPA to see if they would consider negotiating a five-year
agreement with an automatic renewal, unless the City would opt out. Wayne Schuetter also
stated that the City will need to begin negotiations with IMPA regarding our full-requirements
contract ten years prior to the end of the contract term. Therefore, signing a lengthy agreement
for the PURPA plan seems unrealistic at this time.
Wayne Schuetter stated that the Committee decided to get more information from IMPA
regarding negotiations of the contract. Therefore, the Committee recommends tabling the
discussion until further information is gathered. Schuetter stated that he hopes to have more
information and a recommendation at the October Utility Service Board meeting. Attorney
Kabrick stated that a phone conference with IMPA is scheduled for tomorrow to discuss these
issues.
Schuetter stated that the Committee also discussed a possible electric rate study. At the meeting,
Bud Hauersperger informed the Committee that the last electric rate study was completed in
2013 and was implemented in 2014. Schuetter stated that the study was a regular rate study and
at that time the tracker was changed from monthly to quarterly. At the present time, the financial
statements seem to be falling behind with revenues and costs. Therefore, Schuetter recommends
a full cost of service study. The last cost of service study was completed in October 2007.
The study will look at separating the fixed cost out on the billing, and possibly increasing that
fixed cost to maintain the system. The tracker would be analyzed again since it seems to be
falling behind. The rate categories, residential, commercial, and industrial, would be studied to
make sure the rates are keeping up. Other electric fees will also be examined.
Schuetter recommended that the power plant be included in the cost of service study. Schuetter
stated that we need to know what the power plant value is, as is, and the value of just the
footprint of the power plant. Schuetter stated that the Committee recommends that a market
analysis from a realtor regarding the Heidorn property and surrounding seven acres, along with
the value of the power plant as a vacant lot, be completed.
Schuetter also stated that the Utility Business Office is looking into accepting credit cards. It is
being discussed about whether or not the utilities will absorb the credit cards fees, or if the
ratepayers would be responsible. The rate study will also look into how the electric utility would
absorb these additional costs from credit cards and how that could affect rates.

The Committee discussed possible Electric Department commitments to future City projects,
such as the Cultural Center and Downtown project. When the rate study is completed, Alex
Emmons requested to know exactly what percent of the rate increase will go towards each
project, so the ratepayers can get a better understanding of why a potential rate increase may be
necessary.
Schuetter also informed the Board that since the last cost of service rate study, Indiana has
enacted legislation that restricts municipal electric utilities’ customer base. As a result of this
legislation, Jasper Municipal Electric Utility is not able to expand its electric service territory.
What this means is that even though the City may grow and expand, we cannot provide electric
service in these areas. Areas may be annexed into the City and only have some or no City utility
services. Therefore, the decisions we make regarding rates affect ratepayers in different ways
depending on what utilities they have with Jasper Municipal Utilities. This will also be factored
into the rate study.
Schuetter stated that the Committee recommends to the Board that a full cost of service study be
done. Schuetter stated that a proposal from HJ Umbaugh and Associates was received for a full
cost of service study for not-to-exceed $75,000.
Roger Seng made a motion to approve the proposal from HJ Umbaugh and Associates for a full
cost of service study for not-to-exceed $75,000, pending legal review. Michael Kern seconded
the motion. Motion approved, 7-0.
Schuetter stated that the City needs to continue looking at grant opportunities from EPA for
demolition of the power plant. Schuetter also said that the City is open to suggestions from the
public on recommendations to repurpose the power plant.

UPDATE ON GREENER ROAD GAS REGULATING STATION (DVD-39:43)
Doersam informed the Board that tomorrow the Gas Department will begin upgrading the
Greener Road gas regulating station. Doersam stated that they are installing fire valves and fire
stoppers due to mandated safety regulations. The upgrade should be complete by Thursday.
TURBIDITY METER (DVD 40:20)
Doersam informed the Board that the turbidity meter at the treatment plant started failing over
the weekend. The turbidity meter reads the turbidity of the raw water coming into the plant from
the river, and is vital to the water treatment process. Doersam explained that the meter is fifteen
years old and is used 24/7. Parts for the current meter are obsolete. Doersam contacted Hach
and it will cost approximately $6,000 to replace the meter. Doersam stated that this needs to be
purchased immediately due to its essential part in the water treatment process. Attorney Kabrick
stated that as long as Hach is a “single source vendor”, no other quotes need to be obtained.
Wayne Schuetter made a motion to approve the purchase of a turbidity meter, for the water
treatment plant, from Hach for not-to-exceed $6,000, pending legal review. Keith Masterson
seconded the motion. Motion approved, 7-0.
