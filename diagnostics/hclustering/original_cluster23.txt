JAMES BRAINARD, MAYOR

April 1,2014
City of Cannel Board of Public Works
One Civic Square
Cannel, IN 46032
Re: Cannel Redevelopment Commission Contracts
Dear Mr. Mayor:
You have asked me whether it is legally sufficient for Brookshire Golf Course to purchase a series
of golf carts by soliciting requests for proposals in lieu of competitive bidding.
It is my legal opinion that Brookshire Golf Course may purchase golf carts from the request for
proposal submitted by Midwest Golf & Turf. Indiana Code § 5-22-9-8 allows municipalities to provide by
rule or policy that (1) it is either not practicable or not advantageous to the governmental body to purchase
specified types of supplies by competitive sealed bidding; and (2) receiving proposals is the preferred
method for purchase of that type of supply. Section Eight (8) of the City's Purchasing Manual provides
the rule and policy required under Indiana Code.

Competitive Bidding for the purchase of new golf carts was not practicable or advantageous to the
City as the number of golf carts needed was not readily apparent under the current golf cart lease.
Receiving proposals is the preferred method for the golf cart purchase, as only three golf cart companies
conduct business within the State of Indiana. All three companies submitted a request for proposal, and
Midwest Golf & Turf provided the most advantageous proposal for the City. Bob Higgins, Director of
Brookshire Golf Course, followed all requirements under the City'S Purchasing Manual, and therefore,
the golf carts may be purchased from Midwest Golf & Turf after acceptance of the submitted request for
proposal from the Board of Public Works.
