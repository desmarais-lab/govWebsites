ADMINISTRATION AND FINANCE COMMITTEE
The Administration and Finance Committee of the City-County Council met on Tuesday,
February 16, 2016. Chair Joseph Simpson called the meeting to order at 5:30 p.m. with
the following members present: Colleen Fanning, La Keisha Jackson, Blake Johnson,
Marilyn Pfisterer, David Ray and Jack Sandlin. Maggie Lewis arrived shortly thereafter.
General Counsel Fred Biesecker, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Bart Brown and Fiscal
Analyst Ryan Kramer represented Council staff.
Chair Simpson asked committee members to introduce themselves and indicate which
portion of the County they represent.
{Clerk’s Note: Councillor Lewis arrived at 5:31 p.m.}
Chair Simpson said that while they do not always request them from mayoral
appointees, several Committee members have asked for bios or resumés. He asked
those without resumés available this evening to forward them to the committee clerk for
distribution.
PROPOSAL NO. 21, 2016 - approves the Mayor's appointment of Thomas Cook as the
Chief Deputy Mayor
Mr. Cook stated that he has an undergraduate and law degree from Indiana University,
and has worked with Mayor Joseph Hogsett prior to this appointment, both in the
Federal Prosecutor’s Office, and as a member of his transition team for mayor. He said
that as Chief Deputy Mayor, his role is somewhat all-encompassing and somewhat like
an air traffic controller. He said that his job duties may be a little unique with this mayor
compared to previous individuals holding the same title, as Mayor Hogsett may have a
different vision for how this position operates. He said that Mayor Hogsett is committed
to breaking down traditional silos and creating a more collaborative environment across
agencies and departments, and with the Council. He said that he will work closely with
the other Deputy Mayors, and while responsibilities have been divided up among those
positions, it is not necessarily how they will operate in a strict sense; as there will be a
lot of overlapping in the areas of economic development, delivery of city services and
community outreach. Mr. Cook stated that his role will be to coordinate all of that
interplay, making sure everyone is talking to each other and focusing on key priorities at
every level of governance. He added that part of his role is to insure that Council
members have an open door on the 25th floor.
Councillor Sandlin asked if that means Mr. Cook will provide his cell phone number to
Councillors. Mr. Cook said that he will definitely provide business cards with contact
information, and e-mails go directly to his personal phone.
Chair Simpson asked for public comment.

Larry Vaughn, citizen, asked how Mr. Cook can say the new mayor wants cooperation,
when his first proposal as mayor is to make this Council irrelevant. Mr. Cook said that
he does not know of any such proposal, and he can say with definity that cooperation
and communication is the goal of the new administration. Mr. Vaughn said that the
mayor took complete control over the public safety budget by getting rid of the director
of public safety and taking the whole budget under his jurisdiction to use however he
sees fit. He said that this act makes the Council irrelevant.
Councillor Lewis moved, seconded by Councillor Jackson, to send Proposal No. 21,
2016 to the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried by a
vote of 8-0.
PROPOSAL NO. 22, 2016 - approves the Mayor's appointment of Jeff Bennett as the
Deputy Mayor for community development
Mr. Bennett said that he has worked with many of the Councillors over the years on
community development efforts in the neighborhoods, and his new role will be to do the
same across the city. He said that he has served for many years working with nonprofits and in public service; starting with the Historic Landmarks Foundation, then as a
neighborhood liaison in the Peterson administration. He has also served as director of
Animal Care and Control for two years, in the Department of Metropolitan
Development’s (DMD) policy and planning division, with a non-profit community
development organization, and as Warren Township Trustee. He said that back in city
government, he will work with the different departments and agencies across the board
to get the most out of dollars invested in the neighborhoods, including philanthropic
organizations and not-for-profits. He said that a specific initiative of the new
administration is to address the problem of vacant and abandoned buildings, exploring
how to use the tools they have now in the most comprehensive way to effect change, as
well as developing new tools as needed. He said that another initiative is to preserve,
maintain and increase affordable housing options. There are not many such options
remaining downtown, and the goal is to leverage the success of downtown to have a
positive impact in the neighborhoods, while not displacing long-term residents. He said
that outside of City Hall, he will also be managing the non-profit relationships (such as
United Way) that are supportive to city efforts, most of which revolve around community
development.
Councillor Pfisterer thanked Mr. Bennett for being willing to rearrange his schedule to
accommodate a 100-year-old gentleman who wants to meet with him regarding
abandoned homes. She asked if Mr. Bennett has anything he can share in more detail
regarding those efforts, as abandoned housing is a serious issue in their
neighborhoods. Mr. Bennett said that they are working with the Center for Community
Progress (CFCP), using them as a sounding board in the next couple of months, to
tackle this problem. He said that in his former role with the city, he worked with the
General Assembly in 2007 regarding land banking, and they began implementing tools
at that time to address these types of issues. A lot has changed, however, in 10 years,

Administration and Finance Committee
February 16, 2016
Page 3

and he needs to get a quick new lay of the land. He said that he is interested in working
with Councillors to identify areas where it would be good to test some of these tools, like
the efforts on the near east side. Councillor Pfisterer said that she imagines the
meeting on March 4, 2016 will help with this effort.
Councillor Jackson said that there was a list of abandoned homes at some point, and
she asked if that list has been revisited. Mr. Bennett said that they are creating a new
list and looking at the definition of what an abandoned house is. They are also looking
at vacancies across the spectrum, and this new list will be available on the website. He
said that neighbors can report vacant or abandoned homes, and the city will investigate
particular locations. Councillor Jackson asked if priority will be given to high crime
areas. Mr. Bennett said that first and foremost, they will look at these types of locations
to see if the existing tools are effective in solving some of the crime problems.
Chair Simpson said that there has been a lot of concern about abandoned housing, and
he asked what the time frame is for this process and how long Councillors and residents
should wait before pressuring the city with input on certain areas, as with the Riverside
area in his district. Mr. Bennett encouraged them to have those conversations now and
provide him with information on areas needing attention. He said that the Riverside
area is on his radar, and they want to get ahead of the issue. He said that the CFCP
work should be done in April, and therefore, they hope to start acting on these concerns
by late April or early May. Chair Simpson asked if Councillors should go ahead and
report areas to Mr. Bennett now. Mr. Bennett replied in the affirmative and said that by
reporting these areas now, they will be ready to roll in May or June.
Mr. Vaughn said that this city wants to continue with projects that start out and are
finished using public money, and then when the 10-year abatement runs out, the
owners sell the business. New owners get the business at a liquidated price, and then
apply for another abatement. He asked who is going to be making decisions regarding
economic development with the new administration. Chair Simpson said that it sounds
like several individuals will play a role in that decision-making.
Mr. Bennett said that they are taking a top-to-bottom look at how the city uses incentive
tools, the two most used now being property tax abatements and tax increment
financing (TIF) districts. He said that this is a new day, and they are taking a look at
how these powerful tools are used and the costs associated with them. They are not
opposed to using these tools, but want to keep the decision-making strategic and
focused.
Councillor Lewis moved, seconded by Councillor Jackson, to send Proposal No. 22,
2016 to the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried by a
vote of 8-0.
PROPOSAL NO. 23, 2016 - approves the Mayor's appointment of Dr. David Hampton
as the Deputy Mayor for neighborhood engagement

Administration and Finance Committee
February 16, 2016
Page 4

Dr. Hampton said that he has an undergraduate degree in criminal justice from the
University of Indianapolis and a masters and doctorate from Christian Theological
Seminary. He said that in his role, he will be overseeing such efforts as minority and
women-owned business development, public safety re-entry issues, poverty and food
insecurity, including the issue of food deserts. He said that he personally lives in a food
desert, at 32nd Street and Pennsylvania Avenue. He attended a Mapleton-Fall Creek
Neighborhood Association meeting, and while many that attended are blessed with
vehicles, they recognize that not everyone has ready access to a fresh market or
healthy foods. This is one issue facing certain communities that needs addressed. He
said that food deserts and poverty are related to crime, and they want to look at the root
causes of crime and come up with ways to address those root causes in order to reduce
crime rates. He said that he is open to serving Councillors and their constituents and
working closely with them to solve these problems. He said that he will also be
overseeing the neighborhood advocates, formerly known as neighborhood liaisons. He
said that they are restructuring this operation a bit, as the liaisons have a more pivotal
role in working with neighborhoods and Councillors. They would like to move these
advocates into neighborhood City Halls at no cost to taxpayers, and are working to
identify some options for doing that. Chief Ernest Malone, Indianapolis Fire Department
(IFD), has had some discussions with them concerning re-use of 10 abandoned
firehouses that could possibly be revamped into neighborhood City Halls, with a closer
connection to constituents. Dr. Hampton said that he will also be working with
international affairs, looking for ways to serve a multi-cultural constituency, with large
growing Burmese and latino populations. He said that the diversity index average
nationwide is 55%, and Indianapolis is at 57%. While it is encouraging to know that
Indianapolis is a cosmopolitan city, the goal is to find ways to improve the lives of all
citizens.
Councillor Pfisterer said that she would like to elevate the vision for Haughville, as a
food desert, with a lack of availability of fresh produce. She said that any focus Dr.
Hampton can bring to this area would be helpful. She said that some residents are
actually renting the BlueIndy cars to go into neighboring Hendricks County to get fresh
produce; and a fresh market option would help keep that spending in Marion County.
She said that with regard to neighborhood activists, she knows that some change in
staffing may occur, but there is a level of anxiety with her constituent, who really like
their district’s liaison, Kelly Carter, and they would like to see her retained as an
advocate if possible. She said that Ms. Carter arranged for space at some local
libraries, and has regular office hours there, which may be another option to consider in
the restructuring, as these would be high-traffic locations. Dr. Hampton stated that
Councillor Pfisterer’s suggestions will be well-noted.
Councillor Jackson said that there is only one chain grocery store in her district, which
does not have the best upkeep, and she is looking forward to working with Dr. Hampton
to make more options available to her constituents.

Administration and Finance Committee

Councillor Fanning stated that she has a growing Burmese population in her district,
and asked if any literacy initiatives will fall under Dr. Hampton’s international affairs
duties. Dr. Hampton said that he just got a phone call today from a hotel chain with 50
jobs to offer, and the Burmese community was cited specifically. He said that there are
some positions with higher customer service responsibilities where literacy would
definitely help. He said that this is definitely something that needs attention, as some of
these residents are illiterate even within their own native language, notwithstanding the
English language.
Councillor Sandlin stated that he is glad to see a fellow University of Indianapolis
alumni, as this university is a great asset to the community. He said that neighborhood
liaisons are the people Councillors and constituents have routinely gone to for answers,
and they are very knowledgeable. He said that Dr. Hampton is inheriting a good staff,
and he hopes they maintain the same quality in any staff changes they might consider.
He said that in addition to considering fire stations, the township trustees’ offices are
spread out and have always made space available for Mayor’s Office staff in the past
when needed. Perry Township has space for their neighborhood liaison, who holds
regular hours at that location. He added that he also has a huge Burmese population in
his district, and they will be celebrating Burmese International Day later this month. He
said that he looks forward to working with Dr. Hampton, and if there is anything he
needs in his district, he should feel free to call him.
Chair Simpson said that part of the root of the problem has been the closure of
community centers. When they stopped receiving funding, as a part of the community
structure, crime began to grow in the neighborhoods because there was no place for
kids or families to turn. He said that a kid who was hungry could get fed, and families
could get help with keeping their utilities on. He said that he is a big advocate of getting
those centers up and running again, so that residents have a place in the neighborhood
that they can call home. He said that he grew up at the Flanner House, he got shots
there, and it was instrumental in his life and upbringing. He said that this is a serious
issue, and getting to the root of the problem, they need to consider funding for these
centers to provide assistance, hope and care. Dr. Hampton agreed and said that this is
a definite passion of his, and they are also resurrecting the Mayor’s Youth Council.
They cannot continue to incarcerate their way out of these issues, but must find other
ways to combat the root causes of crime and provide alternatives.
Mr. Vaughn said that the money for these centers was transferred over to the mayor to
use for charter schools, and that is the reason they were closed down. He said that
charter schools are an existential threat and are undermining this city and increasing
segregation. He said that the General Assembly provides enough money for education,
and the city sticking its hand into this area is a waste of money. He said that Dr.
Hampton has already taken $30,000 in contributions from charter school people, and is
therefore influenced by them. He said that it is a bad idea to appoint him to this
position.

Chair Simpson said that it is a joy to listen to someone who cares so passionately about
people. He said that he appreciates Dr. Hampton, his qualifications, and his willingness
to serve and wishes him much success.
Councillor Lewis moved, seconded by Councillor Fanning, to send Proposal No. 23,
2016 to the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried by a
vote of 8-0.
PROPOSAL NO. 24, 2016 - approves the Mayor's appointment of Angela Smith-Jones
as the Deputy Mayor for economic development
Ms. Smith-Jones stated that she is a native of Indianapolis, and graduated from Miami
of Ohio, and received her law degree from Depauw University in Chicago. She said that
she served previously as the director of legislative affairs and public policy with the
Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce, and therefore, has worked closely with
corporations and other organizations in Indianapolis to help create a healthy business
environment. She said that she will continue to work with such entities in her new
position to focus on economic development initiatives and efforts. She will work closely
with all the Deputy Mayors and is happy to work with any Councillor who reaches out to
her with proposals for their communities.
Councillor Pfisterer said that the Carrier situation is a really big blow to the folks on the
west side, and she stated that if she can be of help in that regard, to let her know. She
said that residents in her area are concerned about the request for proposals (rfp)
process for the 600 acres at the airport that are up for sale for development to go back
on the tax rolls. Ms. Smith-Jones stated that she will keep Councillor Pfisterer apprised
of those efforts.
Councillor Fanning said that in District 2, there has been a lot of development with the
Transit Initiative Fund. She asked if those transit developments fall under Ms. SmithJones’ umbrella or Mr. Bennett’s. Ms. Smith-Jones said that it would fall under both.
Councillor Jackson asked if anything has been prioritized as far as true economic
development strategies for the far eastside. Ms. Smith-Jones said that there is nothing
on her radar at this moment, but she would be happy to sit down with Councillor
Jackson for further discussion.
Councillor Sandlin said that with regard to the airport property coming back on the tax
rolls, he read today in the Indianapolis Business Journal (IBJ) about a proposal for a
new medical facility, specializing in brain trauma for athletes and veterans. He said that
he read that the project would include a $500 million center and bring 3,000 new jobs to
the city. He asked if this is a not-for-profit or for-profit entity, and if it would put property
back on the tax rolls. Ms. Smith-Jones said that she is aware of the discussion about
this center, but is unaware of the specific details of the project at this time. Councillor
Sandlin said that the school corporation in that area protested that they did not collect

Administration and Finance Committee
February 16, 2016
Page 7

the taxes that most other corporations do across the county due to property that
remained off the tax rolls. Last year, during the budget process, the Airport Authority
talked about bringing some of this property back on to make it more productive for the
city. While job creation and income taxes are important, property taxes also benefit the
city greatly. Ms. Smith-Jones said that she is not aware at this point in time if this
project is not-for-profit or if they will be a tax-paying entity.
Chair Simpson said that economic development downtown is good, but he would like for
the communities to see some of that same development. He said that food deserts are
an economic development problem and he would like to see some major changes in
this area. He said that a top priority for him would be 27th Street and Martin Luther King
Drive, where some development would really help. He said that he knows downtown
needs attention, too, especially with the mall going empty; but he asked that Ms. SmithJones keep the neighborhoods and food deserts in mind.
Mr. Vaughn said that he was downtown a couple of Saturdays ago, and those who think
downtown is a sustainable model are deluding themselves. He said that downtown is
just full of greasy spoons and booze joints. Even the apartment complexes coming on
have breweries and distilleries as part of the project, appropriating all their equipment;
and they are just enticing people to come downtown and get drunk. He asked how long
this model can last.
Councillor Lewis moved, seconded by Councillor Pfisterer, to send Proposal No. 24,
2016 to the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried by a
vote of 8-0.
PROPOSAL NO. 25, 2016 - approves the Mayor's appointment of Hope Tribble as the
Director of the Office of Audit and Performance
Ms. Tribble provided her resume and a brief brochure about the Office of Audit and
Performance (OAP) and said that she has been on the job for about six weeks. She
said that OAP used to be the Office of Internal Audit, but it was expanded a few years
ago to add performance. She said that they assist the external auditor with an annual
audit and the preparation of the comprehensive annual finance report (CAFR). They
also perform some smaller audits due to risk assessment or upon request, as needed.
She said that performance is a new responsibility, and they have two Six Sigma Master
black belts on staff to help departments and agencies to improve efficiencies, find cost
savings and improve processes. She said that they also started a fraud hotline last fall,
with the State Legislature passing legislation to allow them to detect fraud across the
enterprise. She said that fraud usually occurs at the rate of 5% in large enterprises,
which is not always detected by an external, or even internal, audit, but can be detected
when people see things out of place. She said that this is her third time working for the
City of Indianapolis, and she worked with many of the Councillors prior to this when she
served as the Chief Financial Officer for the Council Office.

Administration and Finance Committee
February 16, 2016
Page 8

Councillor Jackson asked if these audits are for internal departments and not for fraud
by subcontractors. Ms. Tribble said that they can do internal audits on financials and
accounting, and therefore, can include contracts, as well as performance audits.
Councillor Pfisterer said that there used to be a report issued on a monthly basis by
former Controller David Reynolds, which she thinks Ms. Tribble used to be involved in
when she worked for the Controller. This report showed the budget for each agency,
with expenditures to date, and a percentage of the total budget that had been used to
that point. She said that this report was very useful, and was a simple report that she
used often to track trends, especially in relation to the Guardian Ad Litem Fund. She
asked if they could again generate such a report, with cooperation from the Office of
Finance and Management (OFM). Ms. Tribble said that she did not work for Controller
Reynolds, but believes that report would be a responsibility of OFM and would not come
from OAP. Councillor Pfisterer asked how the fraud tips hotline will be promoted. Ms.
Tribble said that she sat down with members of the staff and found that a lot of people
throughout the enterprise do not know what their office is or what they do. She said that
they have started meeting with department chairs and county officials to let them know
what OAP does and what is available. They are also working on some information to
provide for new employees during orientation. She said that they are also planning to
do some marketing within the enterprise. There was a soft roll-out last fall, but they plan
to kick it up this year. Councillor Pfisterer said that maybe they could include some
information along with paychecks.
Chair Simpson asked how OAP works with the Internal Audit Committee. Ms. Tribble
said that the Audit Committee is an independent committee with seven voting members.
The committee is the main body that knows what is going on with the external audit and
recommends the external auditor, as well as has oversight of OAP. Chair Simpson
asked who handles the RFP for the external auditor. Ms. Tribble said that she believes
that is headed by OFM. Councillor Sandlin confirmed that OFM prepared that RFP.
Aaron Atwell, Budget Deputy, OFM, said that those reports referred to by Councillor
Pfisterer still go out every month. Councillor Pfisterer asked that she be added to the
distribution list, as she is not getting them. Chair Simpson asked Mr. Atwell to get with
the clerk to make sure they all get this report, as many of them are not receiving it.
Councillor Lewis moved, seconded by Councillor Sandlin, to send Proposal No. 25,
2016 to the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried by a
vote of 8-0.
PROPOSAL NO. 26, 2016 - reappoints Jack Sandlin to the City-County Internal Audit
Committee
General Counsel Fred Biesecker said that a technical correction can be made to delete
the word “Internal,” as the actual name of the committee is the Audit Committee.

Administration and Finance Committee
February 16, 2016
Page 9

Councillor Jackson asked how long Councillor Sandlin has been serving on this
committee. Councillor Sandlin said that he has served four years. Councillor Jackson
asked if Councillor Sandlin is the senior member on the committee. Councillor Sandlin
stated that out of the Council appointments, he would be considered the senior
member.
Councillor Lewis said that former Councillor Pamela Hickman served the same four
years, but is no longer a member. She added that both Councillor Sandlin and
Councillor Hickman were great appointments to this committee, represented the Council
well and made sure they got information from those meetings.
Chair Simpson said that according to attendance records, Councillor Sandlin did not
miss any meetings.
Councillor Lewis moved, seconded by Councillor Pfisterer, to send Proposal No. 26,
2016 to the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation (with the technical
amendment). The motion carried by a vote of 8-0.
PROPOSAL NO. 27, 2016 - appoints Leroy Robinson to the City-County Internal Audit
Committee
Councillor Lewis said that she asked Councillor Robinson to replace Councillor Hickman
as the Council appointee to this committee. She said that he does have the flexibility to
serve and is happy to do so. She said that she feels he will do a great job representing
the Council. She said that on Council member appointments, she did not think it was
necessary for Councillors to appear before the committee, but if any members have
questions specifically for Councillor Robinson, they should feel free to reach out to him
personally. She said that community members who are appointed may not be known to
Councillors, but other Council members are already known individuals. She said that
she and Minority Leader Michael McQuillen routinely appoint Councillors to serve on
committees that require a Council appointment. Chair Simpson stated that it is always
good for new appointees to appear; but if no member objects, he is fine with appointing
Councillor Robinson in his absence.
Councillor Lewis moved, seconded by Councillor Sandlin, to send Proposal No. 27,
2016 to the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation (with the technical
amendment). The motion carried by a vote of 8-0.
PROPOSAL NO. 28, 2016 - reappoints Patricia Polis McCrory to the City-County
Internal Audit Committee
Ms. McCrory stated that she is a lifelong resident of Indianapolis and was appointed at
approximately the same time as Councillors Sandlin and Hickman. She said that she is
a graduate of the University of Indianapolis and the IU McKinney School of Law. She

Administration and Finance Committee
February 16, 2016
Page 10

has worked as an attorney, a business person, and for the Peoples Bank and Trust
Company in financial litigation. She said that it is a pleasure to serve on this committee,
and she has enjoyed working with the current external auditor, BKD, to look at financials
and make sure things are being done properly.
Councillor Lewis asked what role Ms. McCrory plays with BKD. Ms. McCrory said that
she does not have a role with BKD, other than in respect to her role on the Audit
Committee. BKD is the external auditor that won the RFP.
Councillor Jackson said that she is impressed with Ms. McCrory’s resumé and it seems
she has lots of expertise to serve well in this capacity. Ms. McCrory said that her
schedule has become even more flexible since she began her own woman-owned
mediation business. Councillor Jackson asked if the Audit Committee meetings are
open to the public. Councillor Sandlin said that they are. Councillor Jackson asked
where and when they meet. Ms. McCrory said that the meetings are publicized, but
happen in different locations in this building, depending on room availability. Ms. Tribble
said that the OAP serves as staff for the committee, which generally meets four times a
year. She said that the January meeting was posptoned; and they will probably meet in
April when the audit starts again, right after the CAFR is done in June/July, and then
again in October after the single audit is complete. Councillor Sandlin said that the next
three meetings are tentatively scheduled for 9:00 a.m. on April 22, July 22, and October
21, 2016.
Chair Simpson said that he is also impressed with Ms. McCrory’s resumé, and she is
the kind of person they like to see serve on a committee of this type. He said that this
means a lot to them as Councillors to make sure that mistakes are not being made,
rules are followed, and to help the Council members understand clearly as the budget is
being prepared. He said that he appreciates Ms. McCrory’s service and her willingness
to continue to serve.
Councillor Lewis moved, seconded by Councillor Jackson, to send Proposal No. 28,
2016 to the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation (with the technical
amendment). The motion carried by a vote of 8-0.
PROPOSAL NO. 29, 2016 - approves a transfer of $465,894.80 in the 2016 Budget of
the Marion County Election Board (County General Fund) to fund the cost of new
equipment associated with the implementation of new voting systems and services
Myla Eldridge, Marion County Clerk, said that this transfer was determined by OFM, and
it makes sense, since they are not leasing the equipment, but purchasing it. Therefore,
they are transferring the money from Character 03 to Character 04 to cover this cost.
Mr. Atwell added that the equipment will be capitalized by the end of the lease term;
therefore, it makes sense to include the funds in the character for capital expenditures.
The money was budgeted in Character 03, because it was being leased, and leases
typically go in Character 03.

Administration and Finance Committee
February 16, 2016
Page 11

Chair Simpson asked how many pieces of equipment will be purchased. Ms. Eldridge
said that there will be 300 of each kind, for a total of 600.
Councillor Jackson asked if the contract has already been signed. Ms. Eldridge
responded in the affirmative. Councillor Jackson asked what vendor was chosen. Ms.
Eldridge responded that Election Systems & Software (ESS) was chosen.
Councillor Lewis said that this conversation started last year, and she asked Ms.
Eldridge to briefly bring new Council members up-to-date on this decision. Ms. Eldridge
said that Marion County had been voting on first generation voting equipment that was
over 12 years old. Technology continues to change, and the old machines’ hardware
was out-of-date and hard to replace or repair. Conversations for an update began
before the prior clerk left office. An RFP was issued, and out of the two submissions,
ESS was chosen as the best bid.
Councillor Pfisterer asked if this expense is absorbed in the budget and the money is
just being moved around within the overall total budget. Ms. Eldridge stated that this is
correct, and they are not asking for any additional funds. Councillor Pfisterer said that
she remembers the voting machines prior to the latest ones, when she was a precinct
committeeman in 1989. They were difficult to maintain, and she is sure these are a
great improvement. Technology has advanced a great deal and she asked how these
are different from the old ones. She also stated that there has been some controversy
with the vendor ESS in the past and asked about that history and the choice to go with
their bid. Ms. Eldridge said that she cannot speak to the history with ESS, as that was
under a previous administration, and she does not know anything about it. She added
that the voting equipment they use now requires that two machines be married together
in order for the process to work. The new machines will eliminate that “marrying”
process, and there are no keys to turn. They simply have to plug the machines in, and
the process becomes so much easier. She said that tabulation, also, will be much
quicker, so results will be available earlier on election night. While it is new equipment,
and there could be some possible hiccups, they believe they will have results much
quicker. Councillor Pfisterer asked if they have back-up batteries in case of a power
failure, as well as a paper trail to back up the electronic results. Ms. Eldridge responded
in the affirmative. She said that they will be reaching out to host training sessions and
workshops in the nine townships so that people will have the opportunity to use and
experience the new voting equipment before the election.
Councillor Jackson stated that Ms. Eldridge has done a great job as Clerk and she was
very impressed with the seamless election that took place. She said that she is a
current precinct chairperson, and it has been a very arduous process on election day to
get the machines all synched up and ready by the time the first voter arrives. She said
that anything that makes the process easier is a plus.

Chair Simpson asked what happens to the old machines. Ms. Eldridge said that they
sold them to ESS, but kept a couple for the museum. Chair Simpson asked if they have
possession of the new machines already. Ms. Eldridge said that they do and they used
them in the micro-vote a couple of weeks ago, for those who were able to participate in
that.
Ms. Eldridge thanked Chair Simpson and Councillor Pfisterer for their support and being
willing to sponsor this proposal.
Councillor Lewis moved, seconded by Councillor Jackson, to send Proposal No. 29,
2016 to the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried by a
vote of 8-0.
There being no further business, and upon motion duly made, the meeting was
adjourned at 6:52 p.m.
Respectfully Submitted,

PUBLIC SAFETY AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE COMMITTEE
The Public Safety and Criminal Justice Committee of the City-County Council met on
Wednesday, August 8, 2007. Chair Mary Moriarty Adams called the meeting to order at
5:34 p.m. with the following members present: Vernon Brown, Sherron Franklin, Lynn
McWhirter, William Oliver, and Cherrish Pryor. Absent was Councillor Mike Speedy.
Councillor Lincoln Plowman arrived shortly thereafter.
PROPOSAL NO. 346, 2007 - appoints Dan Young to the Marion County Community
Corrections Advisory Board
Chair Moriarty Adams asked to postpone Proposal No. 346, 2007 to the next scheduled
meeting, as Mr. Young is out of town.
Councillor Brown moved, seconded by Councillor McWhirter, to “Postpone” Proposal
No. 346, 2007 until August 15, 2007. The motion carried by a vote of 7-0.
[Clerk’s note: Councillor Plowman arrived at 5:35 p.m.]
PROPOSAL NO. 332, 2007 - amends the Code to add fees for registrations and address
changes of sex or violent offenders
John Sheaves, attorney with Locke Reynolds, said they are requesting a $50.00
registration fee per calendar year and a five dollar fee for each address change. The
purpose of the fees are to defray the cost associated with the administration of the
registry. He said the fees are to be collected in the manner required by statute.
Bob Worth, Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department (IMPD), said the fees will
offset the cost of checking on offenders. He said they currently follow up with 1,600
offenders; however, there is a new law effective July 1, 2007 adding violent offenders,
which will increase those they are required to monitor.
Mr. Sheaves said part of the law requires officers to deliver notices and do personal
visits. With the addition of violent offenders as of the effective date of the new law, there
will be a need to do additional visits more often, and they are hoping these new fees will
be a way to defray some of those expenses.
Councillor McWhirter asked how an offender will pay if they have no income. Mr.
Sheaves said part of the requirement of being released is that the offender has to register
and as a part of the registration the offender must pay the fee. He said if they have to
decide whether an offender pays or is registered; they would much rather know where the
offenders reside. Mr. Sheaves said there is nothing in the statute that states what happens
if an offender cannot pay; however, part of the condition of being released is paying the
fee.

Public Safety and Criminal Justice Committee
August 8, 2007
Page 2
Councillor Brown asked if the county currently has a fee. Mr. Sheaves replied in the
negative. Councillor Brown asked what happens if an offender is unable to pay the fee.
Mr. Sheaves said he does not anticipate the statute will require those who cannot pay to
be re-incarcerated. He said at some point, they will have to pay the fee for expenses
associated with registration. Councillor Brown asked what cost is associated with the sex
offender registry. Mr. Worth said on the county side (Sheriff budget) the cost is
$259,000 a year, and on the city side the cost is $150,000 a year. Councillor Brown
asked where the fees are going that are collected. Mr. Worth said 90% of the fees go to
the County Sex Offender (CSO) Fund and 10% has to be transferred to the state for the
administration of the fund (the website). Mr. Sheaves said the Council may appropriate
from the CSO fund to clear the costs associated with the registry.
Councillor Pryor asked how much money they anticipate raising with both the fees. Mr.
Worth said currently he does not know the number of address changes; however, there
are approximately 1,600 offenders being checked on, and with the addition of violent
offenders, it will raise the number to approximately 3,000 offenders.
Chair Moriarty Adams asked if the money they receive from family members and other
sources while incarcerated could be used to pay any fees due prior to their release. Mr.
Sheaves said he sees no reason why that would be prohibited by the statute.
Councillor Oliver asked if this is a lifetime tracking system. Mr. Sheaves said there is a
duration of ten years; however, depending on the kind of crime committed they could be
tracked for a lifetime. Councillor Oliver asked for examples of violent offenders that
would need to be registered. Mr. Worth said some examples would be murder, voluntary
manslaughter, A and B felonies, and sexual trafficking.
Councillor Pryor asked who will collect the fees. Mr. Sheaves said the money will be
collected by the local law enforcement authority and will be deposited into the Sex and
Violent Offender fund established by the legislative body. Councillor Pryor asked if
local government established the fund. Mr. Sheaves said the fund needs to be
established, and the City-County Council would then appropriate the money from the
fund to the agency or organization involved in the administration of the sex and violent
offender registry.
Councillor Brown asked if 90% of the fees will go to IMPD’s budget. Mr. Clifford said
the money will go to the County General Fund. Mr. Sheaves said his understanding is
that 90% of the money will be deposited into the established fund. Councillor Brown
asked if IMPD and the Sheriff will have access to the established fund. Mr. Sheaves said
IMPD or the Sheriff would have to come before the Council for an appropriation out of
that fund. Councillor Brown asked if the fees will deter offenders from registering. Mr.

Public Safety and Criminal Justice Committee
August 8, 2007
Page 3
Sheaves said he is not sure how it will affect offenders from registering; however, it is
important to know where they reside.
Councillor Plowman said he believes this is a good idea and that offenders will find a
way to pay $50 rather than risk going back to jail.
Councillor Franklin said she is concerned that offenders will not register because they do
not have the money to pay. Therefore, they risk not knowing where the offenders are
located.
Diana Martinez, citizen, said she believes a fee can be accommodated by applying the
fees when they are first incarcerated instead of at the back-end.
Councillor Oliver moved, seconded by Councillor Pryor, to send Proposal No. 332, 2007
to the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried by a vote of 70.
BUDGET HEARING
Robert Clifford, City Controller made opening remarks and gave an overview of the
proposed 2008 budget (Exhibit A, attached). Some key points are as follows:
•

Goals for 2008 budget are to reduce property taxes, prioritize spending for public
safety in crime prevention and initiatives, fund pre-1977 police and fire pensions,
minimize cash flow problems caused by re-assessment, etc.

•

Challenges in the budget are last year’s shortfalls, requests exceeding revenues (i.e.
Information Service Agency (ISA) request for a $12 million increase), state
mandates, etc.

•

Property tax levy reductions in the amount of $50.4 million: County Cumulative
Fund reduced by $600,000, Child Services Debt budget is relatively flat in 2008
and levy can be decreased, Tax Increment Finances (TIFs) are healthy and do not
need to collect all the money, seven million dollar reduction in the Redevelopment
Debt, etc.

•

Property tax levy is frozen due to the increase in County Option Income Tax
(COIT) being passed.

Public Safety and Criminal Justice Committee
August 8, 2007
Page 4
•

The City property tax levy has actually declined over the past eight years and the
Council has already made improvements with property tax dollars with the
consolidation of Warren and Washington Township Fire Departments.

•

The City’s portion of the property tax rate is less than 25% and will continue to
decrease.

•

County represents nine percent of the total levy in the county, and that nine percent
keeps people in jail, sends out warrants, and runs the court and the criminal justice
system.

•

New sources of revenue are COIT (last 10th of a percent), Local Option Income Tax
(LOIT), Public Safety Tax (PST), United Settlement (used to reduce the tax levy for
redevelopment), and excess COIT held by the state (should receive by January
2008)

•

$20 million of the $35 million in COIT notes have to be paid back in 2008.

•

There is no borrowing currently required to fund the 2008 budget.

Councillor Franklin asked if the renter of the United Hub is paying taxes. Mr. Clifford said
the state and city invested $500 million to attract United to the airport, and as part of that
agreement, callbacks were established so that if a certain amount of jobs were not filled,
United would have to pay the city and state back.
Chair Moriarty Adams asked if new cases for IMPD will be on a specific vehicle proposal.
Mr. Clifford said they are making great strides in beginning vehicle replacements for
IMPD, Indianapolis Fire Department (IFD), and city vehicles. He said they would like the
Council to appropriate money to Fleet Services. Fleet Services would provide the vehicles
and charge them back as rent to agencies, and that money will be used to continue to
replace vehicles. Chair Moriarty Adams asked if civilian employees that are non-union
will receive some type of a raise. Mr. Clifford said they have projected that salary ranges
for each grade will increase by three percent; however, they have not factored raises into
the budget, and there is no guarantee they will be able to give raises.
Councillor McWhirter asked for clarification if no raises apply to everyone. Mr. Clifford
said he has no clear answer at this time.
Marion County Justice Agency (MCJA)

Public Safety and Criminal Justice Committee
August 8, 2007
Page 5
Jerry McCory, Director of MCJA, and Steve Dyson, Fiscal Deputy, gave an update on
MCJA and a presentation on MCJA’s 2008 budget (Exhibit B, attached). Key points of
the presentation are as follows:
•

In the Research Division, enhanced juvenile data has been done to allow juvenile
detention decisions to be based on analysis of data.

•

Coordinated the Fugitive Safe Surrender Program, resulting in 536 fugitives
surrendering.

•

Added two new officers to the Failure-to-appear (FTA) Warrant Unit and cleared
1,916 warrants through June 2007.

•

Transcription has been reduced from 4-8 weeks to 2 weeks, which results in faster
discovery and shortens the average jail stay.

•

Current level of transcriptionists is ten.

•

In the 2008 budget, MCJA has requested two grant writers and a program
coordinator.

•

Major changes for 2008 are: the inclusion of five million dollars in local grant
funding for public safety initiatives and re-organization of certain positions and
responsibilities directed by the Criminal Justice Planning Council (CJPC).

Councillor Brown asked if enhanced juvenile data is going to continue. Mr. McCory
replied in the affirmative and said this research must continue as part of the Annie E.
Casey program, as well as to decrease juvenile detention capacity.
Councillor McWhirter asked what positions were eliminated from the Full-Time
Equivalents (FTEs). Mr. Dyson said they eliminated two transcriptionists from the 16
positions and added two grant positions. Councillor McWhirter asked how much of the
five million dollars put into MCJA’s budget will be needed for administration. Mr.
McCory said there will be no administration fee; all the money will go on to the street
and assist the agencies in applying for grants.
Councillor Oliver asked what positions are in the re-organization request from CJPC.
Mr. McCory said the re-organization is to have positions to monitor the grants on a
regular basis, and with the grant writer positions, they believe more funds will be coming
into the city.

Public Safety and Criminal Justice Committee
August 8, 2007
Page 6
Mr. Clifford asked Mr. McCory to discuss the budget reduction in MCJA’s 2007 budget.
Mr. McCory said they decided not to hire additional approved transcriptionists (deduction
in Character 01 of $294,000), Character 02 reduction was $19,000, Character 03
reduction was $24,000, and Character 04 reduction of $5,000.
Councillor McWhirter asked where this reduction goes and if it still goes to help in the
public safety area. Mr. Clifford said the money is not going anywhere and will be
counted as underspending to offset some of the negative impact by the reassessment and
delay in collection. He said they are trying to avoid borrowing by reducing spending.
Councillor McWhirter asked if the money will still be applied to the six transcriptionists
after the shortfall is resolved. Mr. Clifford said the money will still go towards public
safety, as this is the greatest need. Mr. McCory said not all six of the transcriptionists
funding went back, as some of these positions were converted to grant writers.
Councillor Franklin asked if the Council can make a motion to move funds to other
agencies. Mr. Clifford replied in the affirmative and said there will need to be a Council
majority in order to move funds. Councillor Franklin asked if the 2008 budget should
have already been prepared before the 2007 reassessment. Mr. Clifford said before the
Governor ordered the re-reassessment of the 2006 assessed values, the city anticipated
getting what was levied by the city last year. However, the Governor has ordered
everyone to pay 2006 property taxes, and they are sure the city will not receive $50
million of the $400 million levy the city and county share, which is a factor in the
shortfall. He also stated that all the increases Indianapolis Public Schools (IPS) and state
welfare have will negatively impact the city’s budget, because money will be distributed
on the 2007 levy and not the 2006 levy. Councillor Franklin asked if the city is still
receiving some money from property tax. Mr. Clifford replied in the affirmative.
Councillor Pryor asked how often the five million dollars for grants will be given out.
Mr. McCory said MCJA will be a pass-through agency, and those decisions will not rest
with MCJA, but with a mechanism created by the Council. Councillor Pryor asked what
happens to the five million dollars if it is not all distributed. Mr. McCory said the goal is
to award all of the five million dollars each year. He said the handling of any money left
over will depend on what type of fund is established (i.e. reverting fund or reappropriating funds). Jeff Seidenstein, Budget Manager, Office of Finance and
Management (OFM), said the five million dollars is a part of the County General Fund and
will be appropriated through the MCJA. He said the money is not in a separate fund but is
designated for this program in MCJA’s budget. He said the County Auditor will maintain
the money, and perhaps it will be a subfund of the County General Fund.
Councillor McWhirter asked if the grant fund is a segregated fund in the County General.
Mr. Seidenstein replied in the affirmative. Councillor McWhiter asked if the fund is a
reverting fund or if the unspent funds go back to County General. Mr. Seidenstein said at

Public Safety and Criminal Justice Committee
August 8, 2007
Page 7
this point a fund has not been created and discussion with the Council is needed. He said at
this time, the fund would be considered a regular fund and unspent funds would stay in the
account to be re-appropriated. Councillor McWhirter asked if unspent funds can be
transferred to other agencies. Mr. Seidenstein said unspent money would stay in the fund
that the Auditor will create for public safety purposes. He said he is not sure if the money
has to be used for grants, but the money does have to be used for public safety purposes.
Councillor McWhirter asked if the Council has a say in where the unspent money goes.
Mr. Seidenstein said that the Council majority has authority to designate funding. Mr.
McCory said their intent is to give all five million dollars towards grants and he does not
foresee that being an issue.
Bart Brown, Chief Financial Officer, said the only way to ensure that these funds are not
reverted is to create a non-reverting fund; otherwise, the grant fund is a general fund and
the money can be used for any public safety purposes. Councillor McWhirter asked whose
responsibility it is to make the fund non-reverting. Mr. Brown said it would be a request
from the Auditor and Controller to the Council in an ordinance form. Mr. Clifford said he
is okay with a non-reverting fund, but would like the fund to remain in the public safety
fund. Mr. Seidenstein added that language can be added to state that the five million
dollars can only be used for grants and no other purpose.
Councillor Franklin asked why a mandate stating funds cannot be moved is not established
to ensure pensions are paid. Mr. Clifford said they are hoping to do this with the budget.
He said there is a proposal from the Bond Bank to issue pension bonds to totally fund the
pre-1977 police and fire pensions and can only be used to fund those pensions. Councillor
Franklin asked why this cannot be done for all police and fire pensions to no longer have
this problem in the budget. Mr. Clifford said he cannot override what is already done.
Councillor Franklin asked why this cannot be done when they are asking for new money.
Mr. Brown said once the Council voted to obligate the city to these pension bonds, COIT
money received has to go to fund the pension bonds first. Mr. Clifford said when budgets
became tight, funding for the pensions ended and money was being drawn from the created
pension fund. He said now the money will go directly towards paying pensions and will no
longer be a budget issue.
Pat Andrews, Vice-President of the Marion County Alliance of Neighborhood Associations
(MCANA), asked several budget questions regarding: how many employees are funded in
the budget, if any agency has money taken from their budget and moved to another budget,
if the savings from the hiring freeze in 2007 shows in the 2008 budget, asked if the $50
million short-fall in the levy this year is anticipated to be gain in the 2008 budget, or if it
will be money that is not yet determined how it will be spent. Mr. Clifford said the $50
million is what the city anticipated spending in 2007, which will be a short-fall. The
Mayor’s hiring and spending freeze is intended to decrease that $50 million short-fall. He
said some savings through agency cuts are already embedded in the 2008 budget. Mr.

Public Safety and Criminal Justice Committee
August 8, 2007
Page 8
Brown added that a short-fall this year is not a windfall next year, because a loan has to be
taken out to repay the tax anticipation loan.
Circuit Court
Ted Sosin, Marion Circuit Court Judge, read the division’s 2008 presentation (Exhibit C,
attached).
Councillor McWhirter asked what they are to leaving out in Character 03, as they
requested more than what is in their budget. Sue Patterson, Director of Finances for the
Court Services Agency, said she believes the difference is in the rent collection this year.
Councillor McWhirter asked if they have a dollar figure for additional staff. Judge Sosin
said there is no cost for the Commissioners he is negotiating. He said the Commissioners
are currently employed with the Marion County Superior Court. Councillor McWhirter
asked what the additional funding is the Circuit Court needs that they are not going to
request this year. Judge Sosin said they are in need of an additional hearing room due to
the lack of space they currently maintain.
Councillor Brown asked if the Circuit Court report for requests and priorities are included
in the CJPC Thursday roundtable group. Judge Sosin replied in the negative. Mr. Clifford
said the Circuit Court’s needs can be included in the Thursday group.
Councillor Pryor asked if the Circuit Court Division is understaffed. Judge Sosin said they
are not understaffed; however, they have fewer people working with the court than they
started with four years ago, due to consolidation of part-time jobs.
Chair Moriarty Adams asked how big a hearing room they are looking to obtain. He said
they are not looking for anything big, just some additional space to properly run their court.
Mr. Clifford said the Public Defender is moving from the building, and the use of that
space will be going the courts. Chair Moriarty Adams asked if they could submit a cost for
additional space to the Council. Ms. Patterson said she will provide the Council with a cost
summary of additional space.
Marion Superior Court
Judge Gerald Zore gave the accomplishments and initiatives of the Superior Court, Judge
Tanya Walton-Pratt gave the juvenile overview, and Judge Bob Altice discussed the
caseload, space and requests of the Superior Court (Exhibit D, attached). Key points of
the presentation are as follows:
•

There have been no early releases since August 8, 2006, no more Federal Court
oversight on jail, and they are effectively working together with the Sheriff and
government agencies to reduce and eliminate jail overcrowding.

Public Safety and Criminal Justice Committee
August 8, 2007
Page 9
•

They have increased the collection of fees in the Drug Lab and implemented field
team changes for faster processing of pre-sentence investigations.

•

A Statewide Protective Order Registry is ready to be implemented, which will
allow them to create and distribute protective orders electronically, saving staff
time and increasing protection for victims of domestic violence. Victims will also
be able to fax requests for protective orders from various safe sites, such as the
Julian Center, saving them a trip to the City-County Building (CCB).

•

Superior Court made changes to make the Juvenile Detention Center (JDC) a
safer and more secure facility, and create alternatives to incarceration of children.
They have seen fewer children sent to the Department of Corrections (DOC) by
addressing other needs and effectively triaging kids, which is a new and improved
philosophy of handling cases.

•

The Juvenile Detention Alternatives to Incarceration (JDAI) program was
implemented in 2007, which uses assessment tools and data driven research to
reduce the number of juveniles detained from 30% to 18%.

•

The decrease of juveniles held at the detention center shows that the at risk
assessment tools have been working, and only those children that need to be
detained are being detained.

•

The most exciting improvements of the JDC are in the area of technology
improvements: integrated video cameras, student distress hotline, and radio
frequency identification system.

•

There is some concern with the Superior Court providing appropriate, accessible
and safe settings for the litigants and the public, due to the lack of space and close
proximity between jurors and inmates.

•

Immediate needs of the court are a new facility to have adequate space and courtrooms to conduct the business of the criminal justice system.

•

The addition of 100 police offers will have a major impact on the court’s caseload. For example, if one summons and one arrest a day was issued by 20
officers, working 220 days, the total amount of cases will be 13,200.

•

The Superior Courts are experiencing morale issues due to their salary schedule
being frozen, and they would like to get back on their salary schedule.

Public Safety and Criminal Justice Committee
August 8, 2007

•

Beginning in 2005, the Court began collection efforts on current tickets and
tickets dating back to 1999. The collections have brought in $4.1 million in 2005,
$6.3 million in 2006, a projected $6.7 million for 2007 and a projected $5.6
million in 2008.

•

High profile death penalty cases can run between $500,000 and $1 million. In
2008, they have three death penalty cases scheduled. If all three cases go as
scheduled, they will need to come back for additional appropriations to cover the
expenses, including juror pay, meals and lodging.

Councillor Franklin asked if the county has looked at other criminal justice facilities to
obtain some thought on how the city could properly build an effective facility. Judge
Altice said there are several cities with wonderful criminal justice facilities that the city
could visit and obtain some ideas.
Councillor Franklin asked if they are really attaining new police officers or are just
replacing those that are retiring. Chair Moriarty Adams said they are increasing the
sworn and authorized police officer positions, but they will not all be at the same time.
Councillor Franklin asked if city officials talk with the judges before adding new police
officers. Mr. Clifford said judges are part of the CJPC and they have a say on what is
implemented. He said the hope is to have fewer arrests with the focus on crime
prevention.
Mr. Brown asked if the addition of 100 police officers will more than double the current
arrests. Amitav Thamba, Chief Technology Officer, said anytime something is added, it
is not only the courts that are affected but the Prosecutor’s Office, Public Defender’s
Office, etc.
Councillor Oliver asked if there is a law in place addressing parents who do not pick up
their kids from the detention center or during truancy sweeps. Diana Burleson, UASI
Grant Manager, Emergency Management Division, said that staff goes to schools to
identify families that have truancy problems. The goal is to get to the root of the problem
on why the child is not getting to school. They create family plans and follow-up with
the families within a month. She said that along with the court cases, they have a new
program to try to give families a second chance through the courts to solve the problem.
Ms. Andrews asked how many city funded employees the court obtains and what is the
court’s funded budget request for 2008. Judge Zore said their employees are county and
state employees; however, the majority of their staff are county employees. Ms.
Patterson said the court has 778 county funded positions, which includes employees from
juvenile and adult probation and JDC. Their proposed 2008 budget is $59,367,818, and
the courts are estimated to generate $11 million to offset some of the cost.

Public Safety and Criminal Justice Committee

Marion County Clerk
Beth White, County Clerk, gave a presentation on the 2008 Marion County Clerk’s
budget (Exhibit E, attached). Key points of the presentation are as follows:
•

They are working on revenue enhancements, such as: increasing collections by
providing credit card service for payments, invoicing title companies that use their
services, and increasing efforts to process undistributed receipts of child support
payments.

•

Revenue challenges that the Clerk has no control over shows as a decrease in the
amount of money received from the Incentive Fund.

•

Increase in the amount of $75,461 in Character 01 is due to new courts coming
on-line that need staff.

•

Character 01 challenges consist of underpaid employees resulting in high turnover rates, employees working two jobs, and not being able to afford health
insurance.

•

Significant increase in Character 03 is due to postage. Rate increases were
implemented in May 2007 as well as statutory change to serve notice of estate to
every interested party by certified mail, which cost $6.10 per piece. Estimated
additional cost of $80,000 a year will be added to the postage costs of the office.

•

The Clerk’s office is in need of storage space. Every record in every court is
stored in the Clerk’s office, and they are struggling on how to keep track of all the
paper records.

Chair Moriarty Adams asked how they are handling the additional cost of postage. Ms.
White said they are working with OFM to figure out what can be done to cover postage
costs for the remainder of 2007 and costs in 2008. Mr. Clifford said they do anticipate
having additional appropriations in 2007 to cover short-falls. He added that in the
Clerk’s office budget there were a number of invoices that did not get paid in 2006 and
will be reflected in the 2007 budget. Chair Moriarty Adams asked if they incur late
charges with invoices that are not paid. Ms. White said they do not generally pay late
charges as a city and county.
Councillor McWhirter asked what the increase of $152,000 in salaries is. Ms. White said
the 2007 budget did not reflect the Chief Financial Officer position, four courtroom
clerks that are needed for the new courts, and they have budgeted for another employee
trainer. Ms. McWhirter asked for clarification on the money allotted from the County

Public Safety and Criminal Justice Committee
August 8, 2007
Page 12
Option Income Tax (COIT) to increase salaries in the Clerk’s office. Mr. Clifford said
they did give the Clerk’s budget money to increase employees with minimum pay.
With no further business pending, and upon motion duly made, the Public Safety and
Criminal Justice Committee of the City-County Council was adjourned at 9:00 p.m.

2008 BUDGET PRESENTATION
CIRCUIT COURT AND PATERNITY DIVISION

Madam Chairperson, Members of the Committee:
Thank you for the opportunity to appear on behalf of the Circuit
Court and the Paternity Division
Last year, the Paternity Division served the needs of over 68,000
single working heads of household, 97% of whom were women, and
9,600 families on public assistance. All of these fA~ilies continue to be
dependent upon the Paternity Division, the Child Support Division of the
Prosecutor's office, and the City-County Council for assistance with
paternity related issues.
In the year 2006, the Paternity

Division

and Prosecutor's office

accounted for approximately $91,000,000.00 dollars of child support
collections, which represents a $26,000,000.00 dollar increase over the
previous four years, and we are on track this year to reach
$95,000,000.00

dollars. Our Patemity Division, along with the

Prosecutor's Support Division, not only collects child support on behalf
of custodial parents and their children, but also addresses visitation
issues, provides mediation referrals, and job placement assistance for

parents who have difficulty in fmding full-time employment.
If you look at the $95,000,000.00 dollars in projected collections
for 2007, and compare that money to the combined cost of the Paternity
Division and the Prosecutor's Support Division,

know that you will not

find a more favorable cost/ result ratio existing in local government. This
is especially true if you consider that the county general fund is
reimbursed 66 2/3% for every dollar spent on paternity and child
support issues, and the fact that the child support received by the single
parents we serve, in many cases displaces a higher demand for public
assistance.
As you review my budget, would urge you to consider that my two
Courts are currently spending $10,480.00 less per year than we spent in
2002. (SeeExhibit A) In the last four and a half years, we have
accomplished a $26,000,000.00 dollar increase in child support
Co~.ectionsby working sm~,

and by working all of the time Weare

asking you to spend smart so that we can better meet the needs of ,our
community
Last year I asked this Committee to examine the possibility of
additional space and personnel for the Paternity Division

It was

projected that additional resources would push support collections well
beyond $100,000,000.00 dollars, and provide immediate benefits to
those members of our community who rely upon prompt child support

payments to make the difference between self-sufficiency and the need
for other government help. That money was not available last year and
given the current uncertainty with property tax assessments and rates,

am not asking for these funds this year I do, however, feel that the

2

Committee should be aware of what we have accomplished and how we
could be better
As we all know, public safety is a major concern of the Council, the
Mayor and the community

Current studies recognize a strong

correlation between the single parent home and many of those entangled
in the criminal justice system. I am asking that when you can again be
proactive, that you consider what additional funding would do to
increase the Paternity Court's capacity to:
1 Collect every dollar of child support available for collection; and
2 Strengthen our ability to address issues of custody, visitation,
bringing the non-custodial parent back into the lives of their
children, and for the referral of parents to programs that teach the
art of communication, compromise and negotiation

Of the 270

families referred for counseling so far this year, most have learned
to settle their own disputes and have not returned to the court
with further issues,

While Circuit Court does not require any additional funding, the
Paternity Court is again, or is still, at a point of critical mass. They are
out of space for furniture or files, and with only 2.15 judicial officers we
are beginning to see unacceptable delays in the resolution of issues that
used to get immediate attention, and a decrease in the growth rate of

support collection

3

In an effort to do more with current resources we are exploring the
possibility of entering an agreement with the Superior Court for the
assignment of two of their current Commissioners to assist the Paternity
Court in hearing emergency cases, and to address litigation that requires
extended hearing time.

I hope to report to you that our negotiations

were successful and that we have found a zero cost remedy for our
current problems.

Respectfully Submitted

– GPS Victim Notification Pilot Project – Court & Probation
Department Initiative
• Working with – Prosecutor’s Office, Sheriff’s Department, Victim
Advocacy Groups

• Family Court Project
– Indiana Supreme Court Grant for Family Based Case Consolidation

6

Judge Zore
We are getting ready to implement the Statewide Protective Order
Registry — this is an initiative of the Indiana Supreme Court—
working with the Judicial Technology and Automation Committee
(JTAC) and the Indiana State Police: Six copies of Protective
Orders are now generated manually and this will allow us to create
and distribute electronically saving staff time and increasing
protection for victims of Domestic Violence as the Protective Orders
will go immediately to Law Enforcement, IDACS and the Federal
NCIC. Victims will also be able to fax Requests for Protective
Orders from various safe sites, such as the Julian Center—saving
them a trip down to the CCB.
We are undertaking a Pilot project using GPS for Victim
Notification —Court and Probation Department initiative—
working with the Prosecutor’s Office and the Sheriff’s
Department: GPS tracking units and cell phones will be provided
to Defendants and to Victims, which will automatically alert the
parties when they are in close proximity to one another and
automatically dial 911, if they do not respond to the alerts.
6

2007-08 Initiatives
• Maximize Resources and Revenue using Technology
– Kiosks
• Jury Payments Processing
• Drug Lab Payments
• Probation Reporting

– E-Citation Project
• Electronic Traffic Tickets
• Increase traffic ticket collections

– JAILFAX
• Assist Sheriff’s Department in electronic paperwork and sending

7

Judge Zore
Courts will continue to work on maximizing the use of technology to
increase revenue collections and increase operational efficiencies.
We are also contemplating the use of Kiosks to process Jury
Payments, Drug Lab Payments and Probation Reporting.
Judge Pratt will now discuss our accomplishments in the Court’s
Juvenile Division.

They have 69 of their 76 Judges funded by the State, whereas we have only 48 out

can see we do a large portion of the workload with less Judicial Resources

Chair Malone asked when the membrane is expected to be fixed. Mr. Huge said it will
be done after the Super Bowl.
Councillor Nytes stated that the number that is in the ordinance for the operating fund
budget for the incoming year is $85 million. She asked if that number includes the Super
Bowl. Mr. Huge answered in the affirmative.
Councillor Nytes asked if there are any salary adjustments in the budget. Mr. Huge said
that there is a 2 ½ % adjustment in the budget.
Councillor Nytes asked when they will start to pay the State Loans back. Mr. Huge said
that it is actually interest only for the first nine years, and then there is a bullet maturity
at the end. Councillor Nytes asked if there will be any potential to do a sinking fund for

Municipal Corporations Committee
September 27, 2011
Page 5
those as well. Mr. Huge said that their hope is that once they finish the sinking fund for
the mall investor notes, they may have to increase the funds slightly from the $5.6
million, but still should supply them with enough funds to continue with that path to pay
off those loans.
Councillor Nytes stated that when many activities are held at LOS, the Indianapolis
Colts receive the money. Mr. Huge said that with anything Colts-related, that is correct.
Councillor Nytes asked if the Colts receive any money for something that is not Coltsrelated. Mr. Levengood stated that Councillor Nytes is referring to the $3.5 million
payment they will receive in January 2012, based on the events that happened in 2011.
He said that they will also receive that same amount in January 2013, for events in
2012. Councillor Nytes said that if the City is not receiving anything from the NFL for
their “rent” of the stadium, the city is not in any way required to pay anything to the Colts
to make up for it. Mr. Huge answered in the affirmative.
Councillor Nytes stated that with tax revenue increases, there were certain things that
the NFL negotiated that they do not have to pay taxes on. Mr. Huge said that is correct.
There is no admissions tax on tickets, which is pretty standard. Any NFL employee, staff
or contractor does not pay a hotel or food and beverage tax. Mr. Huge said that the
ICVA helped them figure out the carve-out of those particular people. Ms. Lathrop
stated that the Department of Revenue will be sending out their guidelines and will have
that information by the end of October 2011. Councillor Nytes asked if they have taken
into consideration some estimate of all of those exemptions before they came up with a
number. Mr. Huge answered in the affirmative.
Councillor Cardwell asked if Mr. Huge could walk the committee through the changes in
the PSDA. Mr. Huge said that the new PSDA that was created in 2009 encompasses
the J.W. Marriott, the Westin, the Marriott and the Hyatt. Councillor Cardwell asked if
the ceiling was set at $8 million. Mr. Huge answered in the affirmative, stating that
income tax, sales tax, and COIT is what is captured in the PSDA. Councillor Cardwell
asked if this was the first time the city has hit the ceiling on the PSDA. Mr. Huge
answered in the affirmative.
Councillor Nytes stated that the city is receiving their $8 million; she asked what the
State will be receiving. Councillor Cardwell stated that it will be everything above the $8
million. Mr. Huge said that he can find that information out for Councillor Nytes and get
back with her. Councillor Cardwell asked if that is due to the increased demand of the
space. Mr. Huge said that is part of it, along with adding that whole new campus, and
the estimate may not have been accurate as to what the four hotels was going to
produce. He said that they have seen an increase of their hotel and motel tax from
2010.
Councillor Cardwell asked if Mr. Huge or Mr. Levengood could talk about the future of
the new space at the ICC. He asked if there are any new conventions coming to the city
and if the new space has put this city on a different playing field. Mr. Levengood said

Municipal Corporations Committee
September 27, 2011
Page 6
the new space has taken this city to a level that they have not experienced before. He
said that they are starting to see movement in groups that the city has never had an
opportunity to have here before. He said that in February 2012, there is no space
available to rent. It is completely full. Councillor Cardwell asked if Mr. Levengood could
discuss the existing customers that were on the verge of leaving and now are returning.
Mr. Levengood said that it is easier to keep a customer than to find one. He said that
they have to service them so that they receive the product that they want and their
customers are happy. Mr. Levengood said that as the packages get stronger for
bringing in conventions, they are finding re-occurring business, and bringing in new
business.
Councillor Lewis stated that there will be $4 million given to the city to help offset public
safety. She asked if that will be a wash, because on a previous slide in their
presentation, the NFL was to take care of security and the staffing for that. Mr. Huge
said that the NFL will pay for the actual event security and the armed guards within the
stadium. He said that the actual public safety costs that will be going on in the streets
weeks and months in advance of the Super Bowl, is not something the NFL is going to
pay for. Ms. Lathrop stated that the additional hospitality taxes that will be generated will
be used to make that payment to public safety. Councillor Lewis asked if there were any
other one-time costs that will come back to the city. Mr. Huge said that he is unaware of
any other one-time costs.
Chair Malone asked who is responsible for overseeing the licensing enforcement for the
different items that will be sold under the Super Bowl label. Mr. Levengood stated that
the NFL Properties is an incredibly strong organization, and they are very aware of
those that try to sell a product that are unlicensed; and that is the NFL’s responsibility.
He said that the CIB is not contractually responsible for that but will cooperate in any
way possible. Chair Malone asked if the CIB could explain the restrictions in terms of
advertising within a five-mile radius. Mr. Levengood said that there is a “clean zone” that
Chair Malone is referring to, and he is not the one that can speak on that. He said that
the Host Committee is working on that. He said that he will be glad to get that
information.
Chair Malone stated that there needs to be some type of depository or repository of
information with regard to how much money will be spent and received during the Super
Bowl. Mr. Huge said that they will be tracking those expenses diligently. Councillor
Cardwell said that the Department of Code Enforcement might be the one who will
enforce the clean zone and permits.
Councillor Cardwell asked when various staff members from the CIB went to Dallas; if
the NFL have a private audit company come in to give their projections on whether the
Super Bowl held there was a good financial decision. Mr. Huge said that was not
mentioned to them.

Ms. Stone stated that IAA signed a new five-year lease with the airlines, and they were
able to demonstrate that instead of costs going up over time on a cost per passenger
basis, the airlines would see that costs would go down over time. She said that this is
the second year of the lease, and IAA has been able to demonstrate that the targets
they set in terms of cost for landing fees and terminal rentals will be met actually
charging less.
Ms. Stone continued with the presentation.

2012 Capital Budget Summary
o Total appropriation for 2012 is $36 million

Municipal Corporations Committee
September 27, 2011

•

•

o On-going projects for 2012 are $3.7 million
o Estimated potential carryover from prior year is $5 million
o Additional appropriation for $20 million
2012 Capital Funding
o Federal and State Grants of $9 million
o Transfers and Interest of $14.9 million
o Capital improvement funds of $40 million
2012 Revenue Overview
o Airline revenue for 2012 $46 million
o Non-airline revenues are $91 million
o Other revenue is $45 million

Ms. Stone reviewed their non-airline revenue breakdown for the 2012 budget, with the
most significant revenue stream coming from parking. Retail revenues are estimated at
$19.1 million, and that does include some additional incremental revenues from the
Super Bowl. Ms. Stone said that property revenue is going up to $18.1 million, and the
Indianapolis Maintenance Center (IMC) is projectingat $9.9 million, for a total non-airline
revenue budget of $91.1 million. She said that all non-airline revenue that they are able
to generate helps offset the costs for the airlines that operate there.
Ms. Stone continued with her presentation discussing Other Revenue and System Fund
Expenditures. Some key points are:
•

•

Other Revenue
o State and Local appropriations for 2012 are $26.8 million
o Passenger Facility Charges (PFC) are $16.3 million
o Customer Facility Charges (CFC) are $6 million
System Fund Expenditures
o Personal services for 2012 are $31.1 million
o Supplies and materials are $4.6 million
o Contractual services are $30.8 million
o Debt service and other are $133.1 million

Ms. Stone discussed the Airport’s diversity spending comparison with Minority Business
Enterprise/Women Business Enterprise (MBE/WBE). She said that the goals in relation
to MBE operations spending are 16.3%, and WBE spending is 13.4%. Ms. Stone said
for the capital spending side, MBE spending is $24.2% and WBE is 5.8%.
Councillor Cardwell stated that on slide 12 of IAA’s presentation, it talks about the Debt
Service being 45%, and the difference funded by the airlines is 33%. He asked how that
is compared to other airports. Ms. Stone said that IAA is at a pretty high debt level, and
that is reflected of the infrastructure investment that they have made with the new
terminal. She said that it all depends on the life cycle of the major asset of an airport.
Ms. Stone said that it is high in terms of debt leveraging, but they have a very high
percentage of non-airline revenue. She said that when comparing Indianapolis

Municipal Corporations Committee
September 27, 2011
Page 9
International Airport to other airports, IAA has been able to find ways to generate
revenue that is less dependent on the airlines and the number of passengers that come
through.
Councillor Cardwell asked what capacity the airport is operating at, and what the future
growth opportunities are for Indianapolis. Ms. Stone said that IAA has significant
opportunities for growth, both on the cargo side and the passenger side. She said that
IAA had the foresight as a community, and it speaks to the vision of the leaders of the
community, to buy the land and grow where there are so many communities did not
have that vision on the front end to ensure that the land and the assets were in place to
enable that growth. Ms. Stone said that IAA has made that investment today, and they
are poised and ready and working closely with passenger and cargo carriers. They have
runway capacity, the USPS facility coming back, and gates open and ready. Ms. Stone
said that they are in discussion with current airlines as well as new airlines that are not
operating at IAA, about bringing new service to Indianapolis from new carriers.
Councillor Cardwell asked what the factors are if IAA is driving down costs per
passenger. Ms. Stone said that they are lowering debt, addressing operating costs and
driving non-airline revenues down. She said that all of those play a factor into how they
are lowering the cost per passenger. Information Technology (IT) puts them in a better
position for airlines to consider adding service in Indianapolis.
Mr. Clark said that the silver lining in this down economy is that IAA has a program that
anticipated a pretty robust growth. He said that growth would have been offset by the
ability to generate revenue, but because there is a down turn, it has allowed them to put
some systemic changes in place on how they operate. Mr. Clark said that they are able
to take brand new facilities and figure out how to operate them at a very competitive
rate.
Councillor Cardwell asked where Mr. Clark sees the best opportunity for picking up a
hometown airline again in Indianapolis. Mr. Clark said that they have a hometown airline
with Republic Airlines. He said that they continuously try to work with them. He said
that challenge right now is that some of the airlines have merged, and the landscape
has totally changed. Mr. Clark said that each airline has now developed a slightly
different strategy, and for a smaller market like Indianapolis, they have to wait and see
where that shakes out.
Chair Malone said that as a reminder, IAA’s budget is not dependent on property tax
dollars. Mr. Clark said that is correct.
Councillor Lewis asked how the vendors are doing out at the airport. Mr. Clark said that
they are doing better than they were one year ago. He said that their goal has been to
keep every business out there in business. Mr. Clark said that they have made some
concessions and have worked with each individual company to try and make sure they

can weather the downturn. He said that they have lost a couple of businesses, but they
are still working to keep their current businesses in the terminal.
Chair Malone thanked Mr. Clark and Ms. Stone for their presentation.
There being no further business, and upon motion duly made, the meeting was
adjourned at 6:56 p.m.

Respectfully Submitted,

ADMINISTRATION AND FINANCE COMMITTEE
The Administration and Finance Committee of the City-County Council met on Tuesday,
May 17, 2016. Chair Joseph Simpson called the meeting to order at 5:35 p.m. with the
following members present: Colleen Fanning, La Keisha Jackson, Blake Johnson,
Maggie Lewis, Marilyn Pfisterer, David Ray and Jack Sandlin. General Counsel Fred
Biesecker and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Bart Brown represented Council staff.
Chair Simpson asked committee members to introduce themselves and indicate which
portion of the County they represent.
PROPOSAL NO. 132, 2016 - amends Chapter 192 of the Code regarding compensation
to add Article V regarding travel expenses
Brett Wineinger, Deputy Controller, Office of Finance and Management (OFM), said that
at the last meeting, they reviewed this proposal and an amendment was requested, so
the proposal was postponed until this meeting. He said that there was a question about
removing language to exclude elected officials. He said that an amendment has
therefore been prepared.
Councillor Lewis moved, seconded by Councillor Jackson, to “Amend” Proposal No.
132, 2016 in Sec. 192-502, definitions, to amend the definition for “Traveler,” to read as
follows:
Traveler means a person, whether an employee of the Consolidated City of Indianapolis –
Marion County, or of Marion County, an elected official, or member of any council, commission
or board thereof, who is in travel status. a City-County employee, commission or board
member, a person under contract with the City/County, and all others previously approved, who
is in travel status.

Councillor Sandlin asked why they are deleting this language and if there is a separate
travel policy for elected officials. He asked if the Council does not set the policy, how it
gets set for elected officials. He said that they appropriate money in these budgets for
travel, and therefore, need to make sure travel policies are adhered to. Fred Biesecker,
General Counsel, said that it is a question of the separation of powers. He said that he
does not know if there is a written travel policy for the Council right now, but the thought
behind this amendment is that it should be the Council deciding their own travel policy,
not the City Controller. He said that elected officials includes judges and other
constitutional office holders. He said that they are not saying there is anything wrong
with the substance of this policy, but it is a question of who gets to determine that policy,
just as Congress approves their own governing policies. Councillor Sandlin said that he
understands the point; but in the corporate community, if a corporation has a travel
policy, that policy applies to the chief executive officer and janitor equally, and there is
no different standard. He said that he is not sure that he buys into a discussion on the
separation of powers regarding this issue. He said that he would like to see a travel
policy put into place that includes everyone; and if an elected official has a complaint,
then they should come and make a valid argument as to why they should be excluded.

Administration and Finance Committee

Councillor Pfisterer said that she echoes Councillor Sandlin’s concerns. She said that
the public gets frustrated when the Congress exempts themselves from all the laws they
impose on others. She said that elected officials should also be accountable, and their
spending should be transparent. The public should be able to see who is travelling and
the cost to taxpayers.
Councillor Lewis said that the separation of powers issue is very important. If the Mayor
came to the Council and said that he wanted them to do something; but the Council did
not agree with the action, separation of powers allows them some recourse. She said
that she does not understand a member of the Council not supporting separation of
powers. This amendment cleans up the role of elected officials versus the role of the
executive branch. She said that they could easily look at a separate travel policy for the
Council if that is Councillor Sandlin’s concern. Councillor Sandlin said that he
recognizes the need for separation of powers, but if department directors, the chief of
police and other officials have to operate within the confines of a travel policy, then
elected officials should show the same regard. He said that the Council appropriates
each agency and department’s travel funds, and he does not understand why these
agencies then cannot join in agreement to follow a reasonable policy. The taxpayers
look to the Council to guard their tax dollars and spend them wisely, and this does not
seem unreasonable. Councillor Lewis said that she is not saying this policy is
unreasonable, but that she feels a separate legislative body should be able to set their
own policy. She said that ignoring that separation of powers in any instance creates a
slippery slope, and she cannot support that.
Chair Simpson asked if the Council could look at formulating their own travel policy. Mr.
Biesecker said that they could even adopt the identical policy, but it is a question of who
gets to decide. Chair Simpson said that he would be happy to co-sponsor such a
proposal with Councillor Sandlin. He asked if they could include the judges and other
elected officials. Mr. Biesecker said that he could not speak for what they would want in
their travel policy. Chair Simpson asked Mr. Biesecker to draft a proposal for the
Council’s own travel policy.
The motion to “Amend” Proposal No. 132, 2016 carried by a vote of 6-2, with
Councillors Pfisterer and Sandlin casting the negative votes.
Larry Vaughn, citizen, said that $50,000 is a waste of money, and there is no autonomy
since the Mayor has all the control.
Councillor Lewis moved, seconded by Councillor Jackson, to send Proposal No. 132,
2016 to the full Council with a “Do Pass As Amended” recommendation. The motion
carried by a vote of 7-1, with Councillor Pfisterer casting the negative vote.
PROPOSAL NO. 171, 2016 - approves a transfer of $150,000 in the 2016 Budget of the
Information Services Agency (Information Services Fund) into Character 02 to pay for

Administration and Finance Committee
May 17, 2016
Page 3

higher than anticipated wiring costs associated with network upgrades, funded by
projected cost savings from Character 01
Scott Hohl, Chief Information Officer, Information Services Agency (ISA), said that this
is a transfer to cover wiring expenses. He said that they came before the Committee
the last quarter of last year to give a status report on the network upgrades. Since that
time, they found that in many of the off-site locations, such as parks buildings, Sheriff’s
stations, and Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department (IMPD) district offices, the
wiring was in much worse shape than they expected. He said that this ended up being
a higher-than-anticipated cost; and they first thought they could take the funds from
Character 03, but were told it needed to come out of Character 02, where they did not
have adequate funds. The savings in Character 01, which is being transferred to cover
this cost, is due to a technology officer position that they have not filled, and the Chief
Operating Officer (COO) position not being filled until just recently, and therefore not
having to pay a full year salary for that position.
Chair Simpson asked if they are planning to hire someone to eventually fill the other
open position. Mr. Hohl said that the newly hired COO has many of the skills needed by
a Chief Technology Officer position. They cannot compete with the private sector in
offering a comparable salary for a true technology officer, but fortunately, the new COO
has the experience needed in this area and can fill both roles.
Councillor Pfisterer asked if it is possible to take advantage of new technology to
enhance the wiring project. Mr. Hohl said that this is pretty much the reason for the
project. They are replacing old technology, and the connections currently in these
locations were copper. They are moving to fiber connections, which will provide far
greater speeds, as well as last much longer. Councillor Pfisterer asked if this amount
will cover all the cost. Mr. Hohl said that it will. Councillor Pfisterer asked if they have
considered taking advantage of some internships to help with staffing. Mr. Hohl said
that they actually just posted for interns today and have reached out to all colleges
within Marion County, as well as Indiana University and Purdue University. He said that
they had a group of interns last year that worked out well, and they are reaching out to
tap into those resources again.
Mr. Vaughn said that they just spent $30 million for information networks, but with
Proposal No. 112, 2016, they created three new special taxing districts that will make
what ISA is doing now irrelevent; because they will come in and do the work all over
again, and they will not have to come before the Council for approval.
Councillor Pfisterer moved, seconded by Councillor Jackson, to send Proposal No. 171,
2016 to the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried by a
vote of 8-0.
PROPOSAL NO. 172, 2016 - requires audits of the results of the implementation of
Proposal No. 112, 2016 (General Ordinance No. 13, 2016)

Administration and Finance Committee

Councillor Jackson made the following motion:
Mr. Chairman:
I move to amend Proposal No. 172, 2016, including the digest, by deleting the language that is
stricken-through and adding the underlined language in the highlighted portion, to read as follows:
DIGEST: requires audits operating reports of the results of the implementation of Proposal No.
112, 2016 (General Ordinance No. 13, 2016)
CITY-COUNTY GENERAL ORDINANCE NO. , 2016
PROPOSAL FOR A GENERAL ORDINANCE requiring audits operating reports of the results of the
implementation of Proposal No. 112, 2016.
BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY-COUNTY COUNCIL OF THE
CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS AND OF MARION COUNTY, INDIANA:
SECTION 1. Title I, Chapter 251, of the "Revised Code of the Consolidated City and County" is
hereby amended by the addition of a new Sec. 251-2, to read as follows:
Sec. 251-2. Audits Operating reports of the results of Proposal No. 112, 2016.
The mayor shall provide for an independent evaluation and performance audit prepare annual
operating reports, due before March 1 of the year following the adoption of Proposal No. 112, 2016,
and also for the following year, to determine the amount of any cost savings, operational
efficiencies, or improved service levels that result from Proposal No. 112, 2016. include:
(a) a description of operational changes resulting from Proposal No. 112, 2016;
(b) an organizational chart for the office of public health and safety, with employee names and
titles;
(c) a detailed analysis of actual revenues and expenditures compared to budgeted revenues and
expenditures; and
(d) an evaluation of the extent to which actual operational changes comply with Proposal No. 112,
2016.
The independent evaluations and performance audits annual operating reports must be provided to
the council in an electronic format and must also be posted to the city’s citizen information portal.
SECTION 2. This ordinance shall be in effect from and after its passage by the Council and
compliance with IC 36-3-4-14.

Chair Simpson asked if he could second the motion. Mr. Biesecker responded in the
affirmative. Chair Simpson seconded the motion.
Councillor Sandlin said that he does not understand taking out the language for an
independent evaluation and performance audit to be replaced with simply requiring the
Mayor to prepare an annual report. He said that an operating report would not have to

Administration and Finance Committee
May 17, 2016
Page 5

follow any set of rules and it does not require an independent third party, and he
therefore opposes the amendment.
Councillor Jackson said that they wanted to give the Mayor an opportunity to provide
this information without putting him on the spot. She said that she agrees there is a
difference, but the information required is actually listed out in the amendment. She
said that they wanted to see language added to the original Proposal No. 112, 2016,
approving the reorganization, requiring the administration to present qualifying
documents to gauge the effectiveness of the action, but it was left out of the final
passed version. She said that they simply would like to see enough information to show
that they are on track with efficiencies and cost savings that were projected. She said
that this report could actually even provide some additional information they might not
get in an audit, like the organizational chart with the names of actual employees. She
said that since the Mayor is new to his position, they wanted to give him an opportunity
to provide this information without the formality of an audit, in order to still provide the
taxpayer with some accountability. She said that this is the reason for offering this
amendment.
Councillor Lewis said that she appreciates the desire for transparency, but she believes
what they are trying to do with this proposal and the amendment is something the
Council already has the authority to request.
Chair Simpson said that constituents saw Proposal No. 112, 2016 as a major change in
the way the City does business. He said that this City has had two mergers, and the
public continues to ask about the results of those mergers, and no one can really
quantifiably answer that question as to if a merger really saved money or did what it was
supposed to accomplish. He said that the whole purpose of this proposal is to make
sure it really worked and show taxpayers the results. He said that the amendment
provides for annual reporting that is available to the public with analysis regarding the
reconfiguration, instead of pinning down the Mayor or IMPD with a formal audit. He said
that there is a trust factor involved that the administration will give them what they need,
and if there are questions, the Council can ask them. He said that if constituents ask
how it worked out, they can send them to the website to see for themselves.
Councillor Lewis said that the Council already has the authority to ask for an annual
report and does not need a proposal to do that. As the Chairman of this Committee,
Councillor Simpson can request an accounting at any time. She said that she believes
the original proposal also included some language about an audit.
Chair Simpson said that they requested this language be added, but it was not put in
the final version. Councillor Jackson agreed and said that if that language had been put
in like they had asked, this would not be an issue. She said that this is not an
accusation, but for transparency’s sake, they did ask for it to be included, and it was not.
She said that some members were very clear that they wanted to see an audit report if
the reorganization was approved.

Administration and Finance Committee
May 17, 2016

Bart Brown, Council Chief Financial Officer (CFO), stated that as with any financial
reporting, departments and agencies have to come every year during the budget
process before the Council, and the Council can require as much detail as they want in
that analysis. Most departments also give a history of expenditures, and while this next
budget will be the first one for the new department and they will not see much history;
they will still have to present a budget of how they intend to spend money for the new
department. Those other divisions that were moved to other departments will also still
have to have their budgets approved. Mr. Brown said that any committee can call for an
audit, at the Council’s expense, or he can actually do the audit. Although he is not a
certified public accountant and the audit would be considered “unqualified,” he does
have the ability to perform an audit. He said that they can also provide a wage control
report. He said that there are tools already in place to accomplish what this amendment
seeks to enact.
Chair Simpson said that because they have the authority to ask for it, that is why they
are doing so. He said that this is not about distrust, but Proposal No. 112, 2016 is the
administration’s idea and solution, and they are simply asking them to show the Council
and the public how that idea is working. He said that he does not really want to mix up
this process with that of the normal budget process, with questions about pre-merger
and post-merger calculations, which could become quite confusing.
Councillor Pfisterer said that she understands what they are driving at, and she is in
support of that information being made available. However, they are already going to
be spending three months hearing the budgets for these departments and divisions, and
that seems an ideal time to ask questions. The public, also, can watch videos of those
meetings and access minutes online at any time. She said that the Chair could then
invite them back next March with a progress report. Instead of making this into a law,
she would rather see them accomplish the same objective under the rules they currently
have in place.
Chair Simpson said that he works in this arena every day, and when there is a major
change, there should be some accountability for it. He said that it may seem simple, but
he wants some accountability and he feels budget details are a different matter. He
would like to see the review isolated, because this was a major change, and it could get
very confusing trying to find all the different areas of the budget that were affected by
this change.
Councillor Fanning said that she appreciates the effort to increase transparency, and
she does believe that they need the ability to evaluate every proposal they enact on the
back end in order to have confidence that the decisions they are making are benefitting
constituents. However, her concern is in singling out specific proposals to undergo a
greater evaluation process, when maybe they need to re-evaluate the processes for
everything. She said that she would suppose that this is not going to be the only
significant change this Mayor makes in the next four to eight years, and they would be

Administration and Finance Committee
May 17, 2016
Page 7

having this conversation over and over again with a proposal for every single action.
She said she would prefer they maybe look at the process and create something that
would avoid having to draft an ordinance for every major action.
Chair Simpson said that they tried to add this language in the proposal, but it was taken
out; and the only mechanism available at that point was to come back with a separate
ordinance. He said that Proposal No. 112, 2016 is a lot of money when considering all
the different divisions involved. Mr. Brown said that the proposal involved a $4 million
shift in dollars, which is a lot of money, and they will have to take a hard look at the
budget to see how it is all distributed.
Councillor Johnson said that, while he recognizes joining this review with the budget
process might add some complexity; when there is a change of this magnitude, the
budget process provides the perfect opportunity to have that dialogue. He said that he
believes this proposal was good intentioned, but it is duplicative, because they have the
ability to do all that this proposes now. They simply have to be thorough in their review
and diligent in getting answers.
Councillor Jackson asked how they can define the questions needed to arrive at some
of this informatin. Councillor Johnson said that if the questions they want answered are
those included in this offered amendment, they simply have to ask those questions.
Councillor Jackson asked what recourse they have if these questions are not answered
in the budget process. Councillor Johnson said that the Council then has the authority
not to approve the budgets if they do not get the answers they seek. Councillor
Jackson said that this makes them like Congress, who has to shut down because they
cannot approve a budget. She said that they cannot afford for this City to be shut down
and for services to come to a halt. She said they will be taking budget time on an item
that could have already been worked out. Councillor Johnson said that he believes this
administration will provide them with the information they ask for, as he has seen no
indication thus far that they will not. Councillor Jackson stated that Councillor Johnson
has not yet been through a budget cycle, and it can get very convoluted. She said that
the way this amendment is written, this would provide a report for taxpayers. When the
original proposal was passed, they said that they would ask the Mayor for this
information. They would not be here with this new proposal today if this language had
been included in Proposal No. 112, 2016 as asked.
Councillor Sandlin said that as the amendment is drafted, he would expect to see all
these things in the Mayor’s annual report to the community. If there are specific issues
regarding the re-organization efficiency, the Council has the ability to ask for an
independent review. He said that the Office of Audit and Performance (OAP) does an
excellent job, and as a member of the Audit Committee, he has seen some of their
work, and it is very thorough. He said that he believes a report from the Mayor will
already be provided, and if it is not sufficient, they are within their rights to ask for more.

Administration and Finance Committee
May 17, 2016
Page 8

Chair Simpson said that OAP is performing an audit of IMPD, specifically as they go into
budget, to find efficiencies and use every penny where it is most needed. He said that
the chief is thankful for the audit, as well, to help them identify better ways to spend the
taxpayers’ money.
Mr. Vaughn said that this is like letting the fox guard the henhouse. He said that
eliminating the audit shows the Mayor he can do whatever he wants. He said that all of
the failing cities right now, like Detroit and Baltimore, are run by black Democrats, and
this City is following suit with all black Democrat chairs. He said that they are abdicating
their authority and responsibility and taking all their oversight away, and giving the
Mayor the power to do whatever he wants.
Councillor Sandlin stated that Mr. Vaughn’s comments are out of order. Chair Simpson
agreed and asked Mr. Vaughn to wrap up and keep his comments respectful. He
added that public comment is still important, and it is a part of due process; just as
reports like this one are important to keep the public well-informed.
The motion to “Amend” Proposal No. 172, 2016 failed by a vote of 2-6, with Councillors
Fanning, Johnson, Lewis, Pfisterer, Ray and Sandlin casting the negative votes.
Councillor Jackson moved, seconded by Councillor Simpson, to send Proposal No. 172,
2016 to the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion failed by a vote
of 2-6, with Councillors Fanning, Johnson, Lewis, Pfisterer, Ray and Sandlin casting the
negative votes.
There being no further business, and upon motion duly made, the meeting was
adjourned at 6:22 p.m.

RULES AND PUBLIC POLICY COMMITTEE

The Rules and Public Policy Committee of the City-County Council met on Tuesday,
March 10, 2009. Chairman Robert Lutz called the meeting to order at 5:39 p.m. with the
following members present: Bob Cockrum, Monroe Gray, Barbara Malone, Angela
Mansfield, Marilyn Pfisterer, Lincoln Plowman and Joanne Sanders. General Counsel
Robert Elrod represented Council staff. Councillors Ed Coleman and William Oliver
were also in attendance.
Chairman Lutz asked Councillors to introduce themselves and indicate which area of
the County they represent.
PROPOSAL NO. 142, 2008 - provides for the registration with the city controller of
lobbyists and lobbying activity with respect to the City and County
John Cochran, Special Counsel to the Mayor, stated that this proposal has been
pending for 10 months; and during that time, they have tried to address concerns from
lobbyists and Council members. As a result, the proposal has been through several
draft versions. The proposal is aimed at creating a more transparent government with
regard to lobbying activity. He said that they have consulted with the group that helped
the Governor with his regulations regarding lobbying, and have taken into consideration
the scope of this proposal (how many lobbyists will be affected), the cost, and the
amount of time lobbyists will need to become familiar with these new requirements.
They have determined that the model the state has provided is most appropriate. Many
lobbyists are already familiar with the way that system works; it targets individual
lobbyists, instead of lobbying firms, and has not been shown to be overly burdensome.
Mr. Cochran provided a red-lined version of the proposal that points out specific
changes (attached as Exhibit A). The proposal requires three things of lobbyists: 1)
that they file an annual report (with a filing fee of $100) beginning January 15, 2011, 2)
that they file a registration statement within 15 days of any communication regarding
lobbying activity with an official or agency, and 3) that they update their annual
statement within 15 days of any change in lobbying activities or communications. Mr.
Cochran explained the definitions of “lobbyists” and “lobbying activity” as outlined in the
proposal, and indicated exemptions. He described what is included in the annual
report, as per the proposal, and what is involved with a registration statement.
Councillor Pfisterer referred to page five of the proposal in Sec. 909-102 and asked why
“persons barred from lobbying” was stricken. Mr. Cochran said that this was in
response to questions raised by two different Councillors. Chairman Lutz stated that he
was one of these Councillors. He explained that the way the ordinance was formerly
written, a person who had been released from prison 366 days ago could lobby, but a

Rules and Public Policy Committee
March 10, 2009
Page 2
person who had been released 364 days ago could not. He said that he feels if a
person has been incarcerated and paid their debt to society, they should be allowed to
try to start over, even if they face other obstacles. He said that, particularly in light of
the effort to get ex-offenders back into the mainstream, this did not seem to be helpful
language. Councillor Pfisterer said that she fully supports that reasoning.
Mr. Cochran stated that the enforcement will work like other Code violations, where the
Controller is charged with enforcing, issuing citations, and providing the opportunity for
a hearing. The maximum civil penalty is $250 for the first violation, and any offender
can request a hearing or appeal a citation. Section 2 of the proposal incorporates
changes to the ethics ordinance that would need to be made based on passage of the
proposal. The amendment changes effective dates of filing an annual report to 2011,
and changes the maximum fine to $250, instead of $100.
Chairman Lutz asked what changes will affect the ethics code. Mr. Cochran said that
changes will be needed to include lobbyists as those who have business relationships
that may need to comply with gift requirements and ethics form filing. Chairman Lutz
asked if there are any substantive changes to the ethics code. Mr. Cochran said that
there are not. He added that these items were included in the original ethics ordinance,
but were taken out when the proposals were separated into two ordinances.
Councillor Gray asked how many people this proposal will affect. Mr. Cochran said that
these regulations will capture a fraction of those, probably less than half, that are
captured already by the state requirements. Councillor Gray asked if he is a zoning
lawyer and is representing someone in a zoning case, if he would have to sign up to be
a lobbyist. Mr. Cochran said that in this instance, he would be explicitly exempted from
the definition of a lobbyist, according to this proposal. Councillor Gray said that he
cannot think of much work that goes on at the city level that requires a lobbyist. Mr.
Cochran said that this covers everything else that is not exempted and insures full
transparency. Councillor Gray referred to the fee and asked if the City expects to make
any money off this process. Mr. Cochran said that this fee simply covers the cost of
administering the ordinance and regulation. Councillor Gray asked if Mr. Cochran had
conversations with any Democrat members of the Council regarding this ordinance. Mr.
Cochran said that he has had communication with both Councillors Mansfield and
Sanders regarding the proposal since its introduction. Councillor Gray asked if
Councillors Mansfield and Sanders were contacted regarding these proposed
amendments. Mr. Cochran said that they were not, because this amendment was
prepared over the weekend, and he only spoke with the sponsor of the proposal,
Chairman Lutz, regarding changes he would like to see incorporated. Councillor Gray
said that it seems to be just a “feel-good” proposal and does not really affect anything.
Councillor Plowman stated that he felt the proposal was a tough read in the beginning
as introduced. He added that there are many lobbying scenarios that could take place
with local government, such as with telecommunications, construction downtown,

Rules and Public Policy Committee
March 10, 2009
Page 3
developers bidding on city projects, etc. He said that it is appropriate to tighten up the
rules on these types of activities.
Chairman Lutz said that it would be impossible to really say how many people this
would affect, because they never know what projects or activities will take place. He
said that when the proposal was first introduced, he spoke with Councillors Sanders and
Mansfield. He added that he did not know originally if this was something they even
needed to bother with and if it was just adding another burden on taxpayers. However,
he does believe this adds a layer of transparency and will be beneficial. He said that
the original ordinance proposed that every time a lobbyist had contact with the City, they
had to file a registration and pay a fee. He said that he was opposed to this, as it did
seem to place an undue burden on lobbyists. Chairman Lutz said that because this
amendment did not get distributed earlier, he would not be opposed to postponing the
proposal to the next meeting if members feel they need more time to digest the new
language.
Councillor Sanders said that she feels a postponement would be appropriate. She said
that since the effective date is not until January 1, 2010, it does not seem to be timesensitive, and a postponement would give members more time to read through it.
Councillor Sanders moved, seconded by Councillor Gray, to “Postpone” Proposal No.
142, 2008 until March 31, 2009.
Councillor Cockrum asked if the committee should first amend the proposal and accept
the substitute version, so that when it is heard again, it will be the amended version
before the committee. Chairman Lutz agreed that this would be appropriate. Councillor
Sanders said that she will withdraw her motion to postpone to allow for a motion to
amend first. Councillor Gray also withdrew his second.
Councillor Cockrum moved, seconded by Councillor Plowman, to “Amend” Proposal No.
142, 2008 as per the substitute version offered by Mr. Cochran (Exhibit A). The motion
carried by a vote of 8-0.
Councillor Cockrum said that he would also like to clarify that the effective date is
actually 2011 for annual reports and payment of fees, even though the effective date of
the ordinance is January, 2010. Mr. Cochran confirmed that lobbyists will be required to
start filing registrations in 2010, but their first fees and report filings will not be required
until 2011.
Councillor Pfisterer asked if they cannot then be fined until 2011. Mr. Cochran said that
a lobbyist could still be fined if they do not file a registration statement, but an annual
report does not need to be filed and no annual fee will be assessed until 2011.
Chairman Lutz said that it makes sense to him that the annual report not be required
until 2011, in order to record activity and communications that took place in 2010.

Councillor Pfisterer asked for confirmation that this is not something confined to
Indianapolis or Indiana, but that they are enacting ethics and lobbying regulations all
across the nation. Mr. Cochran confirmed that, although it might not be taking place in
all states or have this exact language, many cities across the country have enacted
ethics ordinances such as this one.
General Counsel Robert Elrod said that the amendments to sections of the ethics
ordinance with regard to definitions might need to go into effect now instead of 2010,
because they conflict with the existing code. Mr. Cochran said that the current ethics
ordinance stays in place until the effective date of this ordinance on January 1, 2010.
Mr. Elrod said that lobbying activity would not be defined then until 2010. Mr. Cochran
said that until this proposal goes into effect to regulate lobbying efforts, lobbying does
not necessarily need to be defined.
Councillor Sanders moved, seconded by Councillor Gray, to “Postpone” Proposal No.
142, 2008 until March 31, 2009.
Councillor Plowman asked if a further delay will affect the time frame of this proposal.
Mr. Cochran said that as long as he can get a commitment to take a vote on this
proposal at the next committee hearing, he is fine with a postponement. He added that
if committee members have any questions or comments regarding the proposal in the
meantime, they should contact him and he would be glad to discuss it with them.
The motion to “Postpone” Proposal No. 142, 2008 until March 31, 2009 carried by a
vote of 8-0.
Councillor Gray asked who is lobbying on behalf of the City at the state level. Mr.
Cochran said that he is one person who is doing so, but he can get Councillors a list, as
this information is also available to the public.
PROPOSAL NO. 63, 2009 - amends the Code with respect to the council rules on
adjournment motions recognizing deceased persons
Councillor Coleman said that he offered this proposal because it seemed some political
gamemanship was being played. He said that the adjournment motions have been read
by the minority leader for 40 years, and he felt that some respect should be given to the
minority leader to continue. He said that while he understands the Code states that this
duty is at the will and pleasure of the president to assign, he felt it was being used as a
political game, instead of adhering to tradition. He said the minority party should be
given the respect they deserve, since it is one of the few things they are able to do in a
meeting.
Chairman Lutz said that he is not sure the impetus behind the change was a political
game and feels that Councillor Coleman referring to it that way is frankly offensive and

Rules and Public Policy Committee
March 10, 2009
Page 5
disrespectful to the president of the Council; and he would appreciate it if Councillor
Coleman would refrain from continuing to make such comments.
Councillor Pfisterer said that assigning this duty to the minority leader has simply been
tradition, but the president has always had the prerogative to call upon whomever he
wishes. She asked if Councillor Coleman has thought this proposal through as to how
future presidents, whoever they may be, would feel about that discretion being taken
away. Councillor Coleman said that he has thought it through and is why he wanted to
offer the proposal, so that this assignment would not bounce back and forth and would,
instead, stay the same.
Chairman Lutz said that this is the reason the Council has a president; to make simple
procedural decisions.
Councillor Plowman moved, seconded by Councillor Pfisterer, to “Table” Proposal No.
63, 2009. The motion failed by a vote of 4-4, with Councillors Malone, Sanders, Gray,
and Mansfield casting the negative votes.
Councillor Sanders said that she appreciates that Councillor Coleman took on this
issue. While the decision to change who reads adjournment motions is not against the
rules, as the rules are very clear that the president has this discretion; she feels it
should have been left as it was, since the minority leader has traditionally performed this
task. She said that she supports the proposal.
Councillor Cockrum said that, as president, he was simply responding to a request
when he made this change, and he was trying to keep the balance as equal as he
could. He added that, personally, he has no strong feelings one way or the other.
Councillor Pfisterer said that it seems there are many more important things to be
spending time on than this issue. She said that the families of those people being
recognized do not have a preference as to who is reading the name of their loved ones,
and she thinks it is important to recognize the authority of the president to assign this
simple task.
Councillor Malone asked for consent to explain her vote on the motion to table the
proposal. Consent was given. Councillor Malone said that she would rather vote the
matter up or down and get it off the table and move on, and that is why she opposed the
motion to table.
Councillor Coleman said that this proposal was not done in malice, and was simply an
attempt at uniformity. He said that if members think this issue is a waste of time, he
apologizes, but he did try to call it up on the Council floor so that it could be dealt with
quickly, but that effort failed. Chairman Lutz said that if the proposal had been heard on
the Council floor, it would have excluded the public from being allowed input, and the
committee is the proper venue for hearing proposals that make changes in the Code.

Rules and Public Policy Committee
March 10, 2009

Councillor Oliver said that he has been on the Council for five years, and under each
former president, it has been the minority leader that was called upon to read
adjournment motions. He said that he simply accepted that this was the way it was, and
when it was changed, that thought process shifted into another arena as to why it was
changed. He said that this change is not fruitful.
Councillor Mansfield moved, seconded by Councillor Gray, to send Proposal No. 63,
2009 to the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion failed by a vote
of 3-5, with Councillors Cockrum, Lutz, Malone, Pfisterer and Plowman casting the
negative votes.
Councillor Mansfield asked for consent to explain her vote. Consent was given.
Councillor Mansfield said that she agrees with some of the comments that this
assignment has been a matter of tradition. However, she knows that the Code gives
this discretion to the president, and it concerns her that the president could completely
shut out the minority party altogether. She said that there is value to having two parties
recognized, and at the local level there should not be as much partisanship, as citizens’
concerns are about streets, sidewalks, safety and a better community.
Chairman Lutz asked for consent to explain his vote. Consent was given. Chairman
Lutz said that he is opposed to the proposal because he feels it is a matter of discretion
for the president, of whichever party he or she may be; and for the rest of the body to
micromanage simple procedures such as this seems inappropriate.
PROPOSAL NO. 87, 2009 - regards the spending of Federal Economic Recovery
Funds
Councillor Sanders said that she offered this proposal because of the economic
downturn, and she felt that this recovery funding should be used to support businesses
and employees who keep the local economy going on a regular basis. She said that
she sees this proposal as a win-win situation to give citizens an opportunity to earn a
living and sustain their families and to allow employers to continue to operate and keep
employees in business. She said that the City also benefits from this proposal, because
if individual residents are earning a decent living, they are paying taxes, which in turn
pay government employee salaries and provides services in the neighborhoods. She
said that she agrees with Councillor Mansfield that local government is about sewage,
streets and the quality of life in communities. Councillor Sanders said that she would
like to see the spending of these dollars done in such a way as to stimulate the local
economy. This proposal simply asks the administration to follow guidelines already
established in the purchasing and bidding process, to insure that they buy locally, first
within the City, the region, the state and then beyond if the goods and services cannot
be found locally. She said that other countries are thinking about enforcing similar
policies. She said that from the perspective of the worker, this region has been hardest
hit by foreclosures, and this proposal will help to keep people in homes, kids in schools,

Rules and Public Policy Committee
March 10, 2009
Page 7
and families intact. Councillor Sanders said that this is a win-win proposal for
employees, employers and local government. The State House passed this resolution
just this afternoon, and Governor Mitch Daniels is trying to ensure that the State spends
as much of the State’s dollars in Indiana. She said that she feels strongly that
Councillors should support this proposal, and they are simply asking purchasing to
abide by guidelines that already exist.
Councillor Sanders moved, seconded by Councillor Mansfield, to send Proposal No. 87,
2009 to the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation.
Councillor Cockrum stated that he agrees with the intent of the proposal, but has a
concern that if the federal government sends the money to local government, they may
put restrictions on how that money is spent. This proposal does not allow any provision
for the Controller to follow federal guidelines. He said that he would like to offer a
friendly amendment and moved to “Amend” Proposal No. 87, 2009 to add the words
“unless precluded by federal directive” to the end of Section 2.
Councillor Pfisterer seconded the motion and said that she is in total agreement,
because there have been strings attached to federal dollars in the past and the City will
not know what they have to work with until the money gets to them. She would hate to
see their hands tied.
Councillor Plowman asked if the Controller has any problems with this proposal.
Chairman Lutz stated that the Controller said that he could live with the proposal, as it
does not really change current practice, but he had concerns about the same issue that
Councillor Cockrum has addressed with his amendment and did not want spending held
up because of restrictions on usage. Councillor Plowman asked then if the amendment
makes the proposal more palatable. Chairman Lutz said that the Controller has
indicated that he would be okay with the proposal with such an amendment. The goal
of the Controller’s Office is to put together a proposal for projects so that they are ready
to move on them when the funds come in. Councillor Plowman said that he agrees
these dollars should be spent locally, or at least American; and therefore, he supports
the proposal as amended.
Councillor Mansfield said that if they are putting in a provision that the policy in place
may not be followed, they probably need to include such waivers in Section 1 of the
proposal, as well. She said that if they are not allowed to follow purchasing policies
because of federal restrictions, they need to make it clear that the restrictions are the
reason they are not following policy. Chairman Lutz asked if Councillor Mansfield wants
them to hold up the expenditure of funds to get a waiver. Councillor Mansfield said that
she does not want expenditure of funds held up, but wants the public to be made aware
that they are not following policy due to a federal directive.
Councillor Cockrum asked if Councillor Mansfield is proposing a further amendment to
his friendly amendment. Councillor Mansfield said that she would like to do so, but

Rules and Public Policy Committee
March 10, 2009
Page 8
does not have anything prepared yet. She said that with lots of people out of work and
under-employed, she wants it to be clear to the public that if they are not able to use
these dollars locally, it is because the federal government told them they cannot. She
said that this way, the public will know to lobby their Senators instead of blaming local
officials whose hands are tied.
Councillor Malone said that she agrees with the overall tenor of the resolution, but
would like the public to understand that the resolution is truly precatory, and basically
indicates that the City will try and comply, but that the reality is that this proposal is not
absolutely binding on purchasing and bidding procedures. She said that she does not
want people to have the expectation that a bid might be granted or denied as a result of
this resolution. The City is still relegated to the state bidding guidelines to be fiscally
responsible, and she does not think a special resolution is binding on the City to the
degree that some people think it might be.
Chairman Lutz said that he is not sure a resolution is binding either, but the Council
cannot change State statute, so it might be the only option they have. Mr. Elrod said
that the language “directs” the Controller to do certain things, so that is a technical
question as to whether that is binding or not. Current restrictions in city ordinances
about buying locally deal with supplies only, and not with contractual services; whereas,
this proposal lumps goods and services together. State statute language regarding
bidding for contractual services defines “locally” as the State of Indiana. The statute
that governs the Council makes no distinction as to the binding nature of legislation that
is referred to as either an ordinance or a resolution; therefore, with regards to
enforceability, he does not think it makes a difference. Mr. Elrod said that, theoretically,
both resolutions and ordinances are to be enforced.
Councillor Sanders said that she is not adverse to the friendly amendment, as she feels
confident that there will not be anything in the federal guidelines that will restrict the City
from spending these dollars locally. She added that she believes there will be language
in that directive that requires them to actually buy American to the best of their ability.
She said that she personally believes that they could purchase all goods and services
locally exclusively and never affect the balance of trade, because that balance is so out
of proportion. She said that she can support the friendly amendment and also
understands Councillor Mansfield’s comments and would entertain a further amendment
to publicize any federal restrictions on funds that cannot be spent locally.
Chairman Lutz said that purchasing items “locally” can also be confusing, because a
Toyota model car can be purchased from a local dealer, but is not made locally. Also, a
pen, which may be manufactured in China, can be purchased from a local store or
business. Councillor Sanders said that if she had her way, everything the City
purchased would have a “Made in the U.S.A.” tag on it, but she knows that is virtually
impossible. However, she knows there are some goods still produced within state
borders, and those businesses should be given preference. Services, for sure, can be
obtained from local individuals and businesses. She said that she believes, to the best

Rules and Public Policy Committee
March 10, 2009
Page 9
of their ability, the City should make a concerted effort with these stimulus dollars to
keep local people working and in their homes and employers in business. They can
help do this by purchasing as local as possible; if not Indianapolis, then hopefully at
least in Indiana.
Councillor Pfisterer said that she does not have a legal degree but wonders if the
definition of “locally” in Section 2 should be changed to say the “purchase made locally”
of products and services, instead of “purchase of local products and services.”
Councillor Mansfield moved to “Amend” Proposal No. 87, 2009 to add a sentence to the
end of Section 2, following Councillor Cockrum’s previously offered amendment, to
read: “If precluded by federal directive, the city county controller shall provide the city
council councillors a list of the purchases of non-local products and services.”
Chairman Lutz asked how “non-local” would be defined in that instance. Councillor
Sanders said that it might be better to just say “a list of products and services” instead
of saying “non-local,” because she believes the federal directive will actually encourage
spending these dollars locally.
Councillor Gray asked if the proposal can be postponed to get amendments right or if it
needs to be acted on this evening. Councillor Sanders said that it needs to be acted on
tonight.
Councillor Cockrum’s motion to “Amend” Proposal No. 87, 2009 to add the words
“unless precluded by federal directive” to the end of Section 2 carried by a vote of 8-0.
Chairman Lutz said that it seems Councillor Mansfield’s proposed amendment would be
burdensome to the Controller’s Office. Councillor Mansfield said that it would pertain
specifically to projects funded by stimulus dollars, and it seems it would be easy to list.
Chairman Lutz said that he is not sure it would be easy to list, and he feels they are
trying to make a very general proposal too specific. Councillor Mansfield said that she
envisions the dollars will be spent the same way other Public Works projects are
awarded and would come through a board, like any other expenditure. Chairman Lutz
said that these dollars could come through the Department of Metropolitan
Development or other agencies, as well, and may not necessarily be Public Works
projects. Councillor Mansfield said that bids are generally awarded pursuant to a
contract, and those contracts routinely list out products and services.
Councillor Cockrum said that it might be more helpful to require a list of restrictions and
directives by the federal government instead of a list of products and services.
Councillor Mansfield said that this would not show the impact. Chairman Lutz asked
how seeing an impact makes a difference if the City is restricted. Councillor Mansfield
said that hopefully, citizens can see how the federal government is impacting the local
economy.

Rules and Public Policy Committee
March 10, 2009
Page 10
Councillor Malone said that there is already a list of contracts let by the City, and it
should not be too hard to note those contracts that are directly receiving recovery fund
monies.
Councillor Pfisterer said that the procurement process is already open to the public and
the City does not yet know what reporting might be required by the federal government
on these stimulus funds. She said that the City may already be required to report this
spending to the federal government.
Chairman Lutz said that part of the problem lies in the fact that the City does not know
what is coming along with these funds. In the past, there have always been strings
attached to funds from the federal government, and until they receive that directive, they
will not fully know how to proceed.
Councillor Sanders suggested that they proceed with the proposal as recently amended
and then amend it in the future, if needed, as additional information is forthcoming.
Chairman Lutz called for public testimony at 6:57 p.m.
Gregory Mason, citizen, stated that he is in favor of the resolution. He added that the
proposal was also submitted to the House of Representatives and passed unanimously
and is now going before the Senate, and before Councils across the nation in an effort
to stimulate the economy. He agreed that local government is in the business of
sidewalks and sewers; yet, instead of buying manhole covers made of steel that is
manufactured here in the State, they buy from China. This does not put a Hoosier or
American back to work or retain their employment.
Brett Voorhies, United Steelworkers Union, stated that they have 15,000 members in
the City of Indianapolis. He thanked the Council for hearing this proposal and said that
it is not a political issue, but an American issue, and it should be a no-brainer that these
dollars should be spent locally.
Cornell Burris, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)
local chapter president, thanked the Council for addressing this issue and said that “Buy
American” was tried in the past and worked; but this nation has gotten away from it
because of a perceived deficit in trade. He urged the Council to pass the proposal to
restore the country and bring back jobs.
Nancy Holle, Central Indiana Labor Council, stated that they have 40,000 union workers
in Marion and surrounding counties. She said that this is about working families having
a home, with the ability to provide food for their family and to feel a part of the
community. She said that the City should spend this money the best way they can and
spend it locally to put people in this community to work.

Rules and Public Policy Committee
March 10, 2009
Page 11
Allison Luthe, Central Indiana Jobs for Justice, stated that this proposal makes a strong
statement to the community and says that this Council supports the City’s workers.
Rennis Henderson, citizen, thanked the Council for supporting this bill and said that
these funds will help to provide local jobs, which will in turn help families. He said that
this is not a political issue, but is about helping people who are hurting economically in
this community.
Liam Roche, resident at 233 East Street, said that he can look out his window and see
construction workers, who are probably subcontracted, laying brick on a project across
the street, yet driving vehicles with Michigan license plates. He said that it is important
to include services in this provision, because there are local workers being laid off while
out-of-state workers doing the same job are brought in to do their work.
Councillor Cockrum said that there was some concern as to why, as president, he
referred this proposal to the Rules and Public Policy Committee, as opposed to hearing
it as a Special Resolution on the Council floor. He said that he sent it to the committee
that establishes public policy, so that there would be an opportunity for public input,
which would not have been allowed on the Council floor.
Councillor Oliver said that he feels good that both parties worked together toward full
support for this measure.
Chairman Lutz said that he supports any proposal that puts more money into the local
economy, just as the Council voted a few weeks ago to return $6 million of County
Option Income Tax (COIT) money back into the community annually. He added that,
hopefully, this measure will add to that support of the local economy.
Councillor Sanders moved, seconded by Councillor Plowman, to send Proposal No. 87,
2009 to the full Council with a “Do Pass As Amended” recommendation. The motion
carried by a vote of 8-0.
There being no further business, and upon motion duly made, the meeting was
adjourned at 7:08 p.m.
Respectfully Submitted,

ADMINISTRATION AND FINANCE COMMITTEE
The Administration and Finance Committee of the City-County Council met on Tuesday,
December 6, 2011. Chairwoman Marilyn Pfisterer called the meeting to order at 5:31
p.m. with the following members present: Bob Cockrum, Susie Day, Jackie Nytes and
Joanne Sanders. Maggie Lewis and Barbara Malone arrived shortly thereafter.
General Counsel Robert Elrod represented Council staff.
Chairwoman Pfisterer asked each committee member to introduce themselves and
indicate which portion of the County they represent. Chairwoman Pfisterer stated that
there are five members of this committee who will not be returning to the Council next
year, and in case there is no business to hold another meeting before the end of the
year, she would like to thank them for their service. She presented Councillors
Cockrum, Day, Malone, Nytes and Sanders with a small token of her appreciation for
their service on the committee and explained the meaning behind the gift.
{Clerk’s Note: Councillor Lewis arrived at 5:33 p.m.}
PROPOSAL NO. 336, 2011 - appropriates $2,000,000 in the 2011 Budget of the Office
of the Mayor (RebuildIndy Subfund of the Consolidated County Fund) to fund charter
school incubator
John Cochran, Counsel to the Mayor, provided an amendment (Exhibit A) to change the
source of funds from the RebuildIndy Fund to the Consolidated County Fund. He said if
there are further questions held over from the last meeting that have not yet been
answered, he would be happy to answer them.
Councillor Sanders asked where the $2 million is coming from in the Consolidated
County Fund. Mr. Cochran said that there will be a discussion tomorrow evening in the
Public Safety Committee regarding a resolution that will designate certain funds as
dormant to be used for outstanding funding issues. He said that another proposal will
be considered in that same committee using $9.9 million of this fund for Sheriff’s
Department shortfalls in payments to support Jail II. Councillor Sanders asked why the
resolution regarding this dormant fund is being heard in Public Safety. Mr. Cochran
said that it is not his decision as to which committee a proposal is referred. Councillor
Sanders said she was wondering if this was part of the $300 million the State found
today and they decided to bless Marion County with a portion. Mr. Cochran said that
this is unfortunately not the case.
Councillor Cockrum moved, seconded by Councillor Day, to “Amend” Proposal No. 336,
2011 as per Exhibit A. The motion carried by a vote of 5-1, with Councillor Sanders
casting the negative vote.
Councillor Day asked where the $2 million is now. She asked if they are putting the cart
before the horse in approving this appropriation without the dormant fund resolution
being passed. Mr. Cochran said that he cannot speak as to why President Ryan

Administration and Finance Committee
December 5, 2011
Page 2
Vaughn sent the dormant fund proposal to the Public Safety Committee for
consideration, but some of the funds provided by that proposal will be used in a
companion resolution to help fund the Sheriff, as well. He added that the final passage
of this fiscal ordinance is contingent on that other resolution passing. If that resolution
does not pass, this proposal would be moot. General Counsel Robert Elrod stated that
there is probably enough surplus in the Consolidated County Fund to fund this
appropriation without that dormant fund proposal passing. He said that he spoke with
Council Chief Financial Officer James Steele, and there is $13 million left over in the
Solid Waste Fund. This would cover the $2 million being spent here and the $9.9
million being spent for the Sheriff. He said that the thought behind the committee
assignment was probably due to the larger amount of money being spent to fund a
public safety agency.
Councillor Sanders asked if it is true that there is $13 million in that fund. Mr. Cochran
said that he believes it is $12 million. Councillor Sanders asked what is planned for the
remaining amount if this proposal and the Sheriff’s funding proposal pass. Mr. Cochran
said that there would be roughly $100,000 left over, and there is no proposed use for
that at this time. Such a proposal would not be brought forward until next year, and they
have spoken with Councillors Pfisterer and Lewis about possibilities for the use of those
additional funds and are committed to finding the best use for those resources.
Councillor Sanders asked how much additional money besides this $12 million is
coming. Mr. Cochran said that the resolution simply transfers the $12 million to the
Consolidated County Fund, which will support these two fiscals with the $100,000
balance. Councillor Sanders asked what else is sitting out there in the sanitary
wastewater fund. Mr. Cochran responded that there is nothing. Councillor Sanders
asked about the additional $40 million projected excess revenue from the water
company sale. Mr. Cochran said that by ordinance, any excess in that regard would
have to go into the RebuildIndy Fund. Councillor Sanders said that she had heard
rumors that some of it would be diverted and not go into that fund. Jeff Spalding, City
Controller, said that it legally has to go into the RebuildIndy Fund. He said that when
this proposal was originally introduced, it was thought that some of that overage could
justifiably be used for some other projects, like the incubator, but that is no longer the
case. Councillor Sanders asked if any excess proceeds from the sale of the water
company will end up in the RebuildIndy Fund, then. Mr. Spalding responded in the
affirmative and said that there is no other place for them to go. Councillor Sanders
asked if the Council will be getting a report on the final financials from that sale. Mr.
Spalding responded in the affirmative and said that they hope to have final numbers
settled by December 31, 2011. He said that they have numbers now that are probably
99.5% correct, but have a few account receivables not yet processed. Councillor
Sanders asked if Mr. Spalding could share those numbers now. Mr. Spalding said that
he has no different numbers to share from what was discussed previously, which would
be that the proceeds would be between $450 and $452 million, as well as the payment
in lieu of taxes (PILOT) bond issuance. Mr. Cochran added that the funds for this
appropriation are not part of the water transaction negotiations. Mr. Spalding said that
this is not part of the water company transaction, but the money is sitting in a fund that

Administration and Finance Committee
December 5, 2011
Page 3
was eliminated as a result of that transaction. This fund became dormant, and the
money is sitting in limbo and is not legally in any fund at this point. The proposal before
the Public Safety Committee puts those monies into a fund where the Council can then
administer them from that location.
{Clerk’s Note: Councillor Malone arrived at 5:45 p.m.}
Councillor Lewis asked if the $9.9 million from these monies is going to the Sheriff’s
Department. Mr. Cochran said that the proposal before Public Safety tomorrow night
actually puts those funds into the budget of the Office of Finance and Management
(OFM). Mr. Spalding clarified that at Chairman Ben Hunter’s request, the proposal is
written as an appropriation to OFM, but the proposal explicitly defines the purpose of
the appropriation so that it must be used to pay outstanding funds to Community
Corrections of America (CCA) for the operation of Jail II. He added that Councillor
Hunter will elaborate further on that proposal at tomorrow night’s meeting, when it will
be considered.
Councillor Day moved, seconded by Councillor Cockrum, to send Proposal No. 336,
2011 to the full Council with a “Do Pass As Amended” recommendation. The motion
carried by a vote of 5-2, with Councillors Nytes and Sanders casting the negative votes.
PROPOSAL NO. 338, 2011 - establishes the Office of Education Innovation and creates
an education tax credit and a charter school incubator program
Councillor Nytes asked if this proposal was not referred to the Rules and Public Policy
Committee. Chairwoman Pfisterer said that the Clerk has informed her that it was
reassigned by the Council President to the Administration and Finance Committee.
Beth Bright, Director of Charter Schools, Office of the Mayor, said that the Office of
Education Innovation was actually created by executive order in the Office of the Mayor
in January, 2010. This proposal simply codifies the ordinance to reflect that change,
and there will be no broad sweeping changes in how that office operates. She added
that they are fully committed to the incubator program in collaboration with The Mind
Trust, so that capacity for education choices can continue to grow to meet the demand.
She said that there are over 2,300 students on waiting lists for charter schools, and this
incubator program will give them a fantastic opportunity to meet that demand.
David Harris, founder and chief executive officer (CEO) of The Mind Trust, said that
since they already made a substantial presentation at the last meeting, he will keep his
comments brief. He said that The Mind Trust was launched in 2006 to bring more talent
into the education system in Indianapolis, giving entrepreneurs more opportunities to
invest in the future workforce of the city. He said that they have already raised
$2,855,000, adding another grant from the Walton Family Foundation since they
reported on contributions at the last meeting. He said that they are excited about what
this will mean for school kids in this community. If approved, the first round of

Administration and Finance Committee
December 5, 2011

applications will be due in February, with the first awards being made in June. He said
that they are grateful to the Mayor for partnering with them in this program.
Chairwoman Pfisterer said that she attended the “Grow What Works” luncheon, where
Jane Pauley gave an impassioned speech, which later resulted in her own investment
into the program. Mr. Harris said that Ms. Pauley, along with her husband Gary
Trudeau, donated $105,000, and said that they added the $5,000 because they wanted
it to be bigger than any other donation they had made, because they believed in the
program that strongly. Chairwoman Pfisterer said that the fact that the room was
packed with people speaks to the support from this community for successful charter
school options.
Councillor Cockrum moved, seconded by Councillor Day, to “Amend” Proposal No. 338,
2011 as per Exhibit B.
Councillor Nytes asked why item (4) under Sec. 202-603 was removed in this
amendment. Mr. Cochran explained that they wanted to keep the proposal moving and
there was not enough detailed fiscal information on the tax credit program at this time,
so they took out all language related to tax credits. Councillor Nytes asked if they are
then eliminating the creation of the tax credit with this proposal, as well as officially
changing the formal name of the office and adding management of the charter school
incubator fund. She specifically asked if this proposal involves no actual appropriaton of
monies. Mr. Cochran confirmed that the appropriation of funds was handled in the
previous proposal, and this proposal does not do that, but does include the other things
Councillor Nytes mentioned.
The motion to “Amend” Proposal No. 338, 2011 carried by a vote of 7-0.
Councillor Nytes stated that she voted against the previous proposal because of local
money being used on this type of education. She said that she is tired of the county
picking up what the state said they would pay for. While the state wants to see
innovation in education implemented at a local level, they do not want to invest any
money into ensuring that this is provided. She said that she is fed up with the state
tying up local dollars and not stepping up and paying for the things they want to see
done. She said that she wishes the incubator program all the best, and she will not
oppose this proposal, because it is not about spending money.
Councillor Day moved, seconded by Councillor Cockrum, to send Proposal No. 338,
2011 to the full Council with a “Do Pass As Amended” recommendation. The motion
carried by a vote of 6-1, with Councillor Sanders casting the negative vote.
Mr. Cochran said that Proposal Nos. 339 and 362, 2011 go hand in hand and he asked
if they could be presented together. Chairwoman Pfisterer said that representatives can
jointly make a presentation and then they will vote on the proposals separately.

PROPOSAL NO. 339, 2011 - amends the Code regarding the sale or lease of Georgia
Street from Capitol Avenue to Pennsylvania Street
PROPOSAL NO. 362, 2011 - determines the need to lease Georgia Street, from Capitol
Avenue to Pennsylvania Street, to Indianapolis Downtown, Inc. for the operation and
maintenance of the street
Mr. Cochran said that Proposal No. 362, 2011 deals with the actual lease of Georgia
Street and Proposal No. 339, 2011 addresses ordinance changes that need to occur to
allow that lease to happen. He said that, as most Councillors are probably aware,
renovations to Georgia Street were recently completed. The city views this area as a
potential venue for special events, as it begins on the west across from the Convention
Center and connects to Conseco Fieldhouse on the east. He said that in viewing the
maintenance for this street in light of its use as a venue for potential events, they looked
at ways to accomplish this most effectively. The Mayor’s Office felt a partnership with
Indianapolis Downtown, Inc. (IDI), an organization that has a background in marketing,
relationships with downtown business owners, and resources to bear, would be ideal.
Mr. Cochran introduced Andy Lutz, chief engineer, Department of Public Works (DPW),
and Nicole Kelsey, Office of Corporation Counsel (OCC), for further comments.
Mr. Lutz said that this project was a two-year endeavor that was actually thought up
when Conseco Fieldhouse was built and the Convention Center was upgraded. He said
that they have had it in mind for a long time, but did not have the funding to do it until
this enhancement grant and RebuildIndy funds became available. He said that the new
street has one traffic lane in each direction, with no curved cross-sections, handicap
accessibility, and no stormwater runoff. He said that they put in an infiltration trench to
promote green infrastructure, so that there was no negative impact on the combined
sewer overflow (CSO). He said that they have designed the street up to their comfort
level within DPW, but they are not a department whose expertise lies in programming
events. He said that they, therefore, asked IDI to come to the table with their expertise
in the downtown area to help them with the overall operation and maintenance, as well
as planning and event utilization. Ms. Kelsey said that the ordinance allows the city to
lease the street for event planning. She referred to the Big 10 tournament that took
place last weekend, which was just a small success that showed them what this event
space could potentially become. The actual lease would be for 18 months, where IDI
would be responsible for operating, maintaining and managing events on the street.
The lease also allows for five one-year renewal terms if both partners so choose, and it
provides the terms of financial liability for each partner.
Chairwoman Pfisterer said that hopefully all Committee members received a copy of the
lease earlier today and have had time to read through it.
Councillor Nytes said that as the sponsor of these proposals, she would like to clarify a
couple of things. She said that one concern she heard expressed was with regard to
the language “sale or lease.” She said that as she understands it, Proposal No. 339,

Administration and Finance Committee
December 5, 2011
Page 6
2011 is simply amending the portion of the Code that provides a vehicle to enact a
lease. She asked Ms. Kelsey to explain why this language was used, and to assure the
public that they are not intending to sell the City Market or Georgia Street. Ms. Kelsey
said that the language “sale or lease” was already in the Code, and it was probably
written 30 years ago. If they took the time to re-write the Code, they would probably
split it into two separate portions, but quite a bit of additional work would be needed to
research such a change. She said that at this time, they simply felt this was the most
appropriate portion of the Code in which to include the lease of Georgia Street, and they
are not contemplating selling either Georgia Street or the City Market. Mr. Cochran
added that there is specific language in the lease to prohibit the sale of Georgia Street.
Councillor Lewis asked how hard it would be to strike the word “sale” from the proposal.
Chairwoman Pfisterer said that she would imagine a re-draft would be more
cumbersome than just striking that word. Mr. Elrod agreed and said that this portion of
the Code probably does need to be revisited. He said that it was written in the mid1970s, when the City Market was first restored. The state statute did not say how to
dispose of property to a not-for-profit, and that statute has been amended so many
times regarding not-for-profit distribution, that the language becomes more and more
confusing. He said that the language was actually added in the Municipal Code to
restrict DPW’s ability to dispose of the property of the City Market without Council
approval. By adding this language, the Council would have to approve any sale or
lease of the property. An argument could be made that without that language, the
Board of Public Works has the option to dispose of the property without Council
approval. Mr. Elrod said that he would then be hesitant to take that language out
because it might inadvertently give that power back to the board. Leaving the language
in there makes it clear that these properties cannot be sold or leased without the
Council’s approval.
Councillor Sanders asked why Georgia Street is referred to as demised property. Ms.
Kelsey said that this is a real estate term. Mr. Elrod added that the term “demised
property” is defined clearly as the property referred to in the lease, and just allows the
lease to refer to it in all subsequent mentions in a more concise term. Councillor Nytes
asked if it is like calling it the “aforementioned” property. Mr. Elrod responded in the
affirmative, and said that it is simply legal language to accomplish the same thing.
Councillor Malone asked if this becomes effective after the SuperBowl. Ms. Kelsey
responded in the affirmative. Councillor Malone asked if the city will retain any authority
to determine the terms of events or the amounts for which the space is leased. Ms.
Kelsey said that the city retains all major strategic policy decisions, but IDI is given the
flexibility for making day-to-day operations and marketing decisions without a long
process getting in the way of effectiveness. She said she believes the lease strikes a
perfect balance in this regard. Councillor Malone asked if there is then no set cost as to
how much each section of the street would be leased for. Ms. Kelsey referred to Exhibit
C, where operation cost percentages are laid out, but added that there is no specific
cost set for any certain event on any one day. Tamara Zahn, president of IDI, said that

Administration and Finance Committee
December 5, 2011
Page 7
they are looking forward to partnering with the city in this effort if the proposal is
approved. She said that they have prepared some proposals for revenue possibilities in
renting the street as an event space and capitalizing on commercial opportunities. The
proposals are based on market rates and working with the Convention Center, Indiana
Convention and Visitors Association (ICVA) and others to determine appropriate costs.
Councillor Malone asked if downtown stakeholders have been queried about this
proposal. Ms. Zahn asked if she is referring to the rates. Councillor Malone asked if
they have been consulted regarding the whole concept. Ms. Zahn said that this is a
very unique venue, as it will remain a city street, but will be very important as an added
attraction in booking Indianapolis as a compelling destination. She said that they are
very aware, though, of ensuring that the space also works for the stakeholders. If the
Convention Center, Conseco Fieldhouse, Harry and Izzy’s, St. Johns Church, and
others along that stretch are not successful, then there may not be enough compelling
reasons for people to come downtown. She said that access to existing businesses is
important, including delivery zones and parking garage entrances and exits. She said
that they will need to be somewhat flexible the first 18 months in renting out different
parts of the venue, and they are committed to testing and experimenting during that
time to see what most benefits all those involved. She said that the stakeholders are
actually encouraged to have someone worrying about the use, cleaning and
maintenance of the street.
Councillor Sanders asked about projections for annual revenue on this space. Ms.
Zahn said that they have made some assumptions, and their goal is to plow any dollars
this space can generate back into the space. She said that they have created a
maintenance schedule and staffing estimates, and one of the things they will be doing in
the next 18 months is building the revenue streams to offset these expenses.
Councillor Sanders said that she travels a lot to other cities that have these types of
venues, and this could potentially be a cash cow, especially if IDI partners with ICVA.
She said that she understands the percentage sharing after the first $1 million, but
asked what happens if it is a groundswell, and who would keep the excess revenue.
Ms. Zahn said that the revenues will be kept in a segregated fund for Georgia Street,
and when all expenses are accounted for, they would continue to reinvest the funds into
the street. She said that everything they are doing is in partnership with the city and
DPW. When they studied other spaces like Bryant Park and Louisville, they found a
correlation between highly used spaces with high operating and maintenance costs.
She said that if the space does become a huge success and is booked more frequently,
it would stand to reason they would have higher operating and maintenance costs, such
as cleaning, repair, security, staffing, programming, signage, etc. She said that their
hope is that it continues as an asset and never becomes a liability. She said that the
recent Big 10 usage of the venue provided an exciting opportunity to see how this space
could work. Ms. Zahn said that it will take some tweaking and experimentation, but she
hopes it will be a success. Councillor Sanders asked who gets the money if at the end
of the five one-year renewals, there is $5 million sitting in that fund. Ms. Zahn said that
she believes for the space to be successful, it will need to be highly designed and welltrafficked, and there will be substantial maintenance costs to go along with that. She

Administration and Finance Committee
December 5, 2011
Page 8
said that this is something the Canal does not have right now, and they are faced with
some huge challenges to maintain and repair a beautiful asset with no available dollars.
She said that spaces downtown get abused with high traffic, and it is their goal that any
dollar generated will get used to maintain the venue at very high standards. Councillor
Sanders asked if their revenue forecasting and projections include what will happen with
any proceeds left over. Ms. Zahn said that they will make any necessary changes in
operating the space through each renewal, and after the initial 18-month period, they
should have a clearer idea. She said that they already learned from the Big 10 event,
and expect to learn quite a bit when the space is used as a village for the SuperBowl.
She said that some of the events, like the SuperBowl, will be city-wide, and some of that
may be negotiated as a part of those bids. Ms. Kelsey said that any excess would
remain in that fund until a decision is made on how to distribute those monies.
Councillor Sanders said that the agreement refers to $1 million from the city, and asked
where that money will come from. Mr. Cochran said that it will most likely come from
RebuildIndy funds. Mr. Lutz added that it would qualify and be eligible for those funds,
because it is classified as capital infrastructure.
Councillor Cockrum said that Monument Circle is currently used for various functions,
some which generate funds, and some which are not-for-profits, such as the closing
ceremonies of the Scarborough Peace Games or the Strawberry Festival. He asked if
these types of events would be accommodated at Georgia Street. Ms. Zahn said that
the venue would be well-equipped to handle those kinds of events, but many of those
already held there will stay at that location because of that venue’s draw. She said that
she believes Georgia Street will have its own events materialize, as many of the
recurring conventions have expressed an interest in using the space already, such as
the drum corps and the Future Farmers of America (FFA). She said that these
conventions want to expand their footprint and bring their customers new experiences.
Councillor Lewis referred to Section 8 of the proposal and asked if public hearings have
taken place. Chairwoman Pfisterer said that this committee hearing would constitute a
public hearing. Ms. Kelsey agreed. Councillor Lewis said that she has had a few emails regarding naming rights and references to another public meeting. She asked for
confirmation that this proposal and lease do not touch any naming rights. Ms. Kelsey
said that the lease includes a provision that the street would not be renamed without
going through all the proper channels and holding the required public hearings.
Councillor Malone asked if the lease requires any enhanced public safety presence, and
who would be responsible for that. Ms. Kelsey said that as a downtown street, the
venue would receive normal public safety presence as any other downtown street.
During special events, if special security is involved, most likely the organizer of the
event would pay for their own security, but the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police
Department (IMPD) would still have their normal street responsibilities. Councillor
Malone asked if IDI will still have their bicycle patrols. Ms. Zahn said that those patrols

Administration and Finance Committee
December 5, 2011
Page 9
will continue to the end of this year, and they are working with IMPD and the
Department of Public Safety (DPS) to continue to keep downtown safe.
Chairwoman Pfisterer asked how it will be noticed when the street is closed to traffic.
Ms. Zahn said that they will address that in similar fashion with tools that IDI routinely
uses for other special events or construction when a downtown street is closed. She
said that they will work with the organizer and engage the media and normal avenues of
communication they currently use.
Councillor Nytes said that she has attended events at the Pan Am Plaza, and she
misses that venue. The structural problems with that location and the experience with
the Canal will hopefully provide the encouragement to ensure sound stewardship of this
venue. She said that she is excited to see this approach being taken. She said that
while she hopes Councillor Sanders is right about the accumulation of funds, she would
encourage those involved to develop a replacement reserve, as sometimes these types
of venues face repairs more costly than annual maintenance. She added that she has
been asked by many about the selection of IDI as the operating partner. She said that
there are perhaps other entities that could have provided this kind of stewardship, such
as the Convention Center, ICVA, Conseco Fieldhouse, etc. She said, however, that she
would argue that all of these entities seem to have their hands full. She said that she
feels this venue is in keeping with the kind of work IDI has done in her time on the
Council, such as with banners, flags, promotion, marketing and special events
management. For that reason, she feels their selection as the best partner for this
project to be very appropriate.
Councillor Nytes moved, seconded by Councillor Day, to send Proposal No. 362, 2011
to the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried by a vote of 61, with Councillor Lewis casting the negative vote.
Councillor Lewis said that the concept sounds good, but she has not had enough time
to do her homework on the issue and needs to go back and review it before she agrees
to support it fully.
Councillor Nytes moved, seconded by Councillor Day, to send Proposal No. 339, 2011
to the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried by a vote of 61, with Councillor Lewis casting the negative vote.
Chairwoman Pfisterer said that it is likely this will be the last meeting of this committee
for the year, and she wished everyone a very Merry Christmas, and again thanked the
committee members for their service this past year.

PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE
The Public Works Committee of the City-County Council met on Thursday, April 21, 2016.
Chairman Zach Adamson called the meeting to order at 5:35 p.m. with the following members
present: Susie Cordi, Monroe Gray, Jeff Miller, William Oliver, and David Ray. Janice McHenry
and Vop Osili arrived shortly thereafter. Bart Brown, Chief Financial Officer, represented
Council staff.
Chair Adamson asked members to introduce themselves and indicate which district they
represent. He then stated that the original agenda that was distributed, showed presentations
from the Department of Public Works (DPW) regarding parking meters, levee excavation and
the Eagle Creek deer remediation. He said that the deer remediation update can be found
online in the Parks Committee archives, but this evening they will not be receiving a
presentation on this issue, but will instead hear an update on the emerald ash borer program.
PROPOSAL NO. 159, 2016 - authorizes the removal of the bus stop at Alabama and Ohio
Streets to allow for additional metered parking (District 11)
Nathan Sheets, project manager, Department of Public Works (DPW), stated that they are
always re-evaluating parking conditions and were told by IndyGo that this bus stop is no longer
in use. Therefore, they recommend the removal of the stop and will work with Park Indy to
install some additional parking meters in this area once the stop is removed. He said that there
is also an existing loading zone on the south side adjacent to this location, and they are
reaching out to existing businesses in this area to see if that loading zone is being used. If not,
they will also recommend some additional metered parking spaces to replace that loading zone.
Chair Adamson said that there are three such zones on that block, and that is the reason for the
re-evaluation. Mr. Sheets said that if that loading zone is no longer necessary, they will need to
first take it before the Board of Public Works, and then it would also come before the Council for
approval.
Chair Adamson said that this is on the corner of Alabama and Ohio, and the only buses
stopping there were coming off of Alabama. They could not make that turn easily enough to
then stop immediately at that location on Ohio, so another stop was added further down, making
this stop no longer necessary. The merchants in that area would therefore like to have that
space made available as metered parking for customers.
Councillor Miller said that in light of the presentation coming up regarding parking meters, he
imagines this action will help by adding more meters to benefit downtown businesses.
Councillor Oliver moved, seconded by Councillor Ray, to send Proposal No. 159, 2016 to the
full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried a by vote of 6-0.
PRESENTATIONS BY THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS
PARKING METERS
Lori Miser, director, Department of Public Works (DPW), provided a handout (attached as
Exhibit A) and stated that Chair Adamson had asked for an update on parking meter revenues,
and they will provide that to the Council at least on an annual basis. She reviewed the handout
with total revenues received for 2015 by quarter for meters and violations, indicating the City’s

Members of the Public Works Committee
April 21, 2016
Page 2
share of the revenue and waived revenue. She explained that waived revenue is revenue that
has been lost due to bagged meters or meters that have been removed. She said that the
waived revenue gets subtracted out, which makes the total City revenue for 2015 just under
$3.5 million. She said that the bottom half of the table shows the uses for 2015, which were for
infrastructure projects in the metered area. She said that these revenues cover the salary for
their one employee dedicated to overseeing the parking meter program for DPW. She said that
the legal services noted were funds used to go against the Indianapolis Power and Light (IPL)
rate case and try to intervene with regard to their LED lights. Unfortunately, they were not
successful in that venture, but IPL is aware of their concerns and has agreed to discuss it
further. They also have another rate case later this year where the City again could choose to
intervene.
Councillor Gray asked if they spent $110,000 in legal fees on that case. Ms. Miser stated that
this is correct, because they did not have the expertise in that area. The person that helped
them was a former chair of the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC), Robert Glennan,
and he was an excellent resource. Councillor Gray asked what law firm he represents. Ms.
Miser said that he is independent.
Ms. Miser continued with her review and stated that the rest of these costs are for various curbs,
sidewalks, traffic signal installation and repair, alley repairs, and resurfacing projects.
Councillor Miller said that the local ordinance is pretty well patterned after State law as to how
they can use these parking meter funds. He asked if the IPL case falls under an approved use
because it is for street lights in the parking meter zones. Janice Mitchell, Chief Financial Officer
(CFO), DPW, said that they know how many street lights are in the parking meter zones, and
this is just a portion of the total spent on that effort. Chair Adamson asked how much was spent
on this legal effort in total. Melody Park, Chief Engineer, DPW, said that they spent
approximately $500,000 total. She said that this included quite a bit of due diligence using
London Witte accountants to review every number in the case filings from IPL. She said that
the IPL rate case did not just include lights in the district, but also included LED signals; so they
had to intervene, because those rates would be increased on all lights and LED signals owned
and operated by the City.
Councillor Gray asked if the $110,000 is in addition to the $500,000. Ms. Park said that the
$110,000 is part of the $500,000. Councillor Miller asked if they did the calculations and found
that 20% of the lights were in parking meter zones. Ms. Park responded in the affirmative.
Councillor Miller said that he thought part of the parking meter funds were used for the New
York and Michigan conversion. He asked if that was in 2014, since these are 2015 numbers
and he does not see it, or if it was spent from somewhere else. Ms. Mitchell stated that it was
spent from somewhere else. Councillor Miller said that part of the ordinance indicates the
budget will include projected spending of parking meter funds, and he asked if they have
numbers for 2016. Ms. Mitchell said that they had not been including specific projects in the
budget numbers, but simply gave revenue projections, indicating it would be spent on capital
projects to be identified. Councillor Miller asked if the projects first go before the Board of Public
Works. Ms. Miser responded in the affirmative. Councillor Miller asked what is being done to
mitigate or bill back those individuals who have the City bag meters for specific events or
projects. Ms. Mitchell said that entities request event permits from the Department of Code
Enforcement (DCE), and they do receive meter-block revenue that goes to DCE and gets
deposited into the parking meter fund. Some of these fees, however, get waived, such as civic-

Members of the Public Works Committee

sponsored events or meters bagged by the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department (IMPD)
for safety issues.
Chair Adamson said that as he recalls, the City has to pay Park Indy back for lost revenue when
these meters are bagged for non-excluded events. Ms. Mitchell said that this is correct, and the
City has 19 days a year per meter without penalty or reimbursement. Chair Adamson asked if
this is system-wide or done on a meter-by-meter basis. Ms. Mitchell said that it is meter-bymeter. Chair Adamson said that they do not then get credit for the meters that are never
bagged in order to bag particular meters more than 19 days. Ms. Mitchell said that this would
be nice; but no, it is per meter.
Chair Adamson said that he received the parking study for Fountain Square and Market East
district, and that report is quite hefty. He asked if this is available online anywhere. Ms. Miser
said that Sherry Siewert from Downtown Indy is in attendance if more information is needed on
that study, or it can be scheduled as a separate update in the future. She said that she does
not believe it is accessible online anywhere yet. Chair Adamson said that it would be helpful for
the public to be able to have access to that document and not just have to rely on meeting
videos online. Sometimes constituents have specific questions they would like Councillors to
ask after seeing the supporting data.
Chair Adamson referred to the final billing for three segments of the cultural trail on Alabama,
Washington and Virginia Avenue, and he asked if this is only for the part of Virginia Avenue that
has parking meters. Ms. Miser responded in the affirmative.
{Clerk’s note: Councillors McHenry and Osili arrived at 5:49}
Councillor Miller said that he loves Georgia Street and would like to see that continue and thrive
as a viable venue, but $483,000 seems excessive. He said he hopes that the maintenance and
repair costs are not that expensive, and asked if this also covers part of the cost for a salary for
the Georgia Street manager. Ms. Miser said that it does include that.
Councillor Miller referred to the second-to-last item, noting an amount reverted to fund balance.
He asked if this means there is only $165,000 sitting in the fund, or if there is more than that.
Ms. Mitchell said that the fund is projected to end at $5.4 million at the end of 2016, and this is
just an amount that was reverted from what they had budgeted but had not spent as expected in
2015. Councillor Miller said that he noticed that they spent more than what they brought in. Ms.
Mitchell said that until last year, they had never actually done any work out of the parking meter
fund, so fund balance was building. She said that they are expecting about $4.4 million in
revenue this year and have budgeted to spend about $3.8 million of that. Councillor Miller said
that he would like to see more of these funds going toward the repair of streets, as constituents
seem to be most concerned about torn up streets in their neighborhoods and on their way to
work or other regular destinations.
Chair Adamson asked if Ms. Miser or Ms. Mitchell could briefly speak to the ongoing issue
regarding the parking meters and the BlueIndy project. Ms. Mitchell said that there was a $6
million escrow payment, and $2.7 million came out of the parking meter fund, and the remainder
came out of the RebuildIndy fund.
Councillor Oliver asked for an explanation regarding lost revenue on bagged meters. Ms.
Mitchell said that the City calculates what the lost revenue would be if they bag a meter, and

Members of the Public Works Committee
April 21, 2016
Page 4
then monthly discussions take place with Park Indy to determine how that affects the revenue
stream sharing.
Councillor Gray said that he is confused about the $2.7 million being used from the parking
meter fund for a private entity, BlueIndy. Ms. Mitchell said that she was not involved in the
discussions surrounding this expenditure, and it was put into their budget by the Office of
Finance and Management (OFM). Councillor Gray asked if the City then paid for the
infrastructure for BlueIndy. Ms. Mitchell said that it covered the charging stations. Chair
Adamson said that this only applies to metered areas. Councillor Gray said that the City is not
getting any money from BlueIndy, so he asked why they would provide the infrastructure. Chair
Adamson said that for what it is worth, he understands there is a component of revenue sharing
included in this program, once all the parties outside of the City have been repaid for their
investment.
Bart Brown, Council CFO, stated that when the last administration explained this program to
them last year, they indicated that the only portion the City is paying for is the work underneath
the stations themselves. This is the wiring underneath the stations, and the City will maintain
that wiring and actually retain ownership of it if BlueIndy should leave and take their charging
stations. Therefore, the City is not technically paying for BlueIndy’s equipment, but is paying for
the infrastructure for them to hook into.
Councillor Miller asked if they could get a spreadsheet like the handout provided with projected
2016 numbers. He said that the ordinance requests that, and so they need to get more in-line
with those requirements, as this is a large amount of money.
Councillor McHenry asked since the City owns the infrastructure, if BlueIndy decided certain
locations were not advantageous to them and removed their stations, if the City could then put
their own charging stations in alongside meters for people with electric vehicles to use. Ms.
Miser responded in the affirmative. Councillor McHenry asked how long this infrastructure will
last. Mr. Brown said that the technology will last up to 20 years, and BlueIndy has estimated 15
years and is asking the City to approve a 15-year contract. He said that technology could
obviously outpace the infrastructure at some point. Councillor McHenry said that with more and
more electric cars, this could be advantageous to the City in the future. However, it sounds as if
the infrastructure would have to be re-done every 20 years, at least, so it might not be that great
of an advantage.
Chair Adamson said that $2.7 went to install that infrastructure in metered areas, but the rest of
those funds went to install it in other areas of the City. He asked if all those infrastructure
components belong to the City. Ms. Miser said that this is correct.
LEVEE EXCAVATION
Ms. Miser stated that they wanted to give the committee a heads-up and explanation of a land
acquisition project that they will be introducing shortly to the Council. She said that this pertains
to the Indy North Levee Project, and they need to purchase a specific sort of earth that does not
exist in very many places in order to construct part of the levee that runs behind the Riviera
Club. She introduced Mike Massone, contract consultant on the project. Mr. Massone provided
a brief presentation on the project located at 4306 Guion Road, just north of 38th Street. He said
that this is one of three sites initially proposed by the corp of engineers; the other two were not
available, as one in Hamilton County was turned into a park, and the other on 86th Street has

Members of the Public Works Committee
April 21, 2016
Page 5
become a natural gas storage site for Citizens Energy Group. Mr. Massone said that this site
has been used earlier, and they extracted about 30,000 cubic yards of both clay and topsoil to
construct Phase 3B1 of this same levee project. They plan to take an additional 40,000 yards of
material from this site for Phase 3B2 of the project. The purchase will be greater than $25,000,
and will therefore require Council approval. They are preparing the necessary documents now
to bring before the Council hopefully next month, as appraisals are in final review right now. He
explained the process of excavation and key trench to prevent water seepage, and showed a
diagram of the project.
Chair Adamson said that the portion where 30,000 cubic yards of earth was used seems to be
longer than this next phase where they are using 40,000 cubic yards, according to the diagram.
Mr. Massone said that he wishes they had extracted all of that clay the first time they went to the
site. They were not ready at that time to build because they did not have enough funding in the
Stormwater Fund. He said that some of this excavation will be used for a vegetation
management phase, which will require some filling on the face of the existing levee structure.
Therefore, they are extracting enough all at one time to do some of that back-filling that is
needed. Vegetation removal is needed along that area, and as trees come out, cavities in the
earth are created, and they want to insure that they have sufficient clay and topsoil to effectively
fill those depressions. This clay has already been approved by the corp of engineers, so they
do not need to go look for another source of clay, and can utilize this clay for that phase as well.
Councillor Gray asked if this is the levee going up behind Butler University. Ms. Miser said that
this is the northern end of it. Councillor Gray asked if the neighborhoods in that area have
finally come together on this project. Ms. Miser said that this piece is needed no matter what
alternative is done. There is still some debate among homeowners, as several will be affected.
Councillor Gray asked if this is the beginning of the project. Ms. Miser said that this is the nextto-last phase. Councillor Gray asked when a final decision will be made on the full project. Ms.
Miser said that this decision was made last December, when Mayor Greg Ballard approved
proceeding with that Westfield wall. Councillor Gray asked if all the legal process has taken
place and all that is left is to do the actual work. Ms. Miser said that this is correct. Councillor
Gray asked then whether the neighborhoods agree or not, it is going to happen. Ms. Miser said
that this is correct, but they continue to work with the Rocky Ripple neighborhood to weigh
options for flood protection there. Councillor Gray said that if they would have done this project
in Crooked Creek and behind the golf course, they would not have had any neighborhood
opposition.
Councillor McHenry said that she remembers when the 30,000 was excavated, and the City
came before the Pike Township Residents Association (PTRA). She asked if they will come
before the PTRA for this phase. Ms. Miser said that they can certainly do that. She said that
the site is in Councillor Maggie Lewis’ district, and she is aware of it and was aware of the
excavation last time, as well; but they can certainly reach out to the PTRA. Councillor McHenry
said that she is sure they would like to have some questions answered before this comes before
the Council. Councillor McHenry said that they used the term “borrowing,” and asked what they
will be using to re-fill the site. Mr. Massone said that borrowing is a common technical term
used when extracting material from a site. He said that the site will be restored with stable
slopes and seeded, in agreement with the landowner. If any fill is excavated along the
construction site of the levee, a determination will be made at that time if it could be returned to
this site as part of another agreement or if it needs to be disposed of in a landfill. When the
previous section was excavated in Phase 3B1, all of that material went to an approved landfill.
Councillor McHenry asked how deep the soil is extracted. Mr. Massone said that it could be

Members of the Public Works Committee
April 21, 2016
Page 6
anywhere from four to ten feet in different areas. Councillor McHenry asked if this area is raised
now, or if this will leave a depression in the terrain. Mr. Massone said that there are some
shallow depression areas right now due to the previous extraction and there is some area
covered by water, but some of the property will most likely be depressed further from six to eight
feet. Councillor McHenry asked what this property is currently used for. Mr. Massone said that
the land is open right now and the landowner is a contractor and excavator and has some
fabrication shops and vehicle on portions of that property. Councillor McHenry asked what the
property is zoned. Mr. Massone said that he does not know for sure, but would assume it is
zoned industrial. Councillor McHenry said that with an eight-foot depression, the property would
probably not sell, as it would be harder to build on. Mr. Massone said that he presumes the
property owner will sell space on this ground to fill it back in.
Chair Adamson said that he sees some houses along surrounding properties, and asked if they
will be creating lake-front property by excavating all this earth. Mr. Massone said that he does
not believe so. In conversations with the landowner, he believes the landowner’s intention is to
fill this property with other soil.
Councillor McHenry asked if the surrounding property owners have been notified of this action.
Mr. Massone said that they have not yet made notification.
EMERALD ASH BORER REPORT
Don Colvin, deputy director, Parks Planning, DPW, gave a brief overview of the City’s Urban
Forestry Program. He said that the program manages woody plant material within City rights-ofway and public land and provides for the safe use of public rights-of-way and public land while
protecting and enhancing the City’s urban forest. He provided the committee with a brief
PowerPoint presentation. Key points of the presentation are as follows:
•
•
•
•

More than 3,700 miles of Right-of-Way in Indianapolis
Over 11,400 acres of park land
378 square miles in Marion County
210,000 street trees

Mr. Colvin introduced Bill Kincius, Urban Forestry manager, DPW, who coordinates the overall
function of the program. He said the program also employs a city arborist/assistant manager
who manages the implementation and performance of forestry program functions; as well as a
dedicated forestry inspector who inspects trees in public spaces, usually in response to a call
from a citizen. Mr. Colvin said that the Urban Forestry program is housed within DPW’s
engineering section, but they do interact a lot with the Department of Code Enforcement (DCE),
Parks Planning and Land Stewardship, the Department of Metropolitan Development (DMD),
and other community groups like Keep Indianapolis Beautiful (KIB), IPL, Downtown Indy, and
Ping Tree Service.
Mr. Kincius continued the presentation and stated that the Emerald Ash Borer (EAB) is an exotic
invasive pest from Asia that came over on shipping crates. The borer insect completely
consumes the living tissue of a tree. He stated that it is found in every county in Indiana and in
several midwestern and eastern states. All nine townships in Marion County have the EAB
present. He stated that in 2013, DPW initiated a comprehensive street tree inventory to gauge
the magnitude of this issue. He stated that they kicked the project off with a grant from the

Members of the Public Works Committee
April 21, 2016
Page 7
State in the northern portion of Warren Township. He stated that they also took advantage of a
$200,000 United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service grant.
Councillor McHenry said that on the map, Eagle Creek Park, the City of Lawrence, and the
Town of Speedway seem to be outside of the green line. She asked if these were not
inventoried. Mr. Kincius said that Lawrence and Speedway are outside of their jurisdiction, as
excluded cities; but this is a street tree inventory, and Eagle Creek Park is included in the park
inventory, which is a different study. Councillor McHenry asked if Speedway, Lawrence and
Beech Grove did their own inventories. Mr. Kincius said that he does not know. He said that
the agreement they have with their vendor indicates that those excluded cities could receive the
same rate and agreement as the City, should they decide to do those studies.
Mr. Kincius continued with his presentation and said that the inventory included a risk
assessment, and this dictates the work that they do. In the past, the department would have to
wait on someone to call them or submit a service request. After a call, they would go out and do
an assessment and then come back and do work based on that assessment. The complete
inventory allows them to understand which trees need attention first and allows them to be more
proactive in addressing this problem. He said that they will provide a complete report available
in the next month or two based on this inventory study.
Councillor Osili asked what kind of preventative measures are possible. Mr. Kincius said that
they can protect a tree by chemically treating it in perpetuity, creating a toxin inside the tree that
does not hurt the tree, but hurts the beetle when it feeds on it. There is really no way to isolate
or eradicate the pest. Councillor Osili asked if it is a pre-treatment, anticipating that this will
happen if not treated. Mr. Kincius responded in the affirmative. Councillor Osili asked what can
be done once there is an infestation. Mr. Kincius said that an entymologist at Purdue University
indicates that they have up to 50% canopy loss on a tree before it can no longer be salvaged.
Beyond 50% decline, the tree has already lost enough resources that it cannot regenerate into
anything and is lost. Councillor Osili asked what an infestation looks like. Mr. Kincius said that
the beetle starts feeding at the tips of the branches and leaves at the top of the tree, so initially,
they will see outer top portions of the tree dying. That usually produces what they call “witches
growth,” where there are spurts of growth at the part of the tree where the death begins. As it
progresses further down, the bark will start to deteriorate and they can see D-shaped exit holes.
Once they see these holes around eye level, the tree is pretty much beyond salvaging.
Councillor Osili asked if the treatment has to then be done in perpetuity. Mr. Kincius said that at
this point, yes; but there are some studies at Purdue that indicate the population of these pests
may eventually go away, and they are researching a type of wasp that is non-harmful to wasps
but can help to control the ash borer population.
Councillor Gray asked about the cost of treating one of these trees. Mr. Kincius said that it
costs about $10 per diameter inch of the trunk to treat a tree. If the trunk is 18 inches in
diameter, it would cost roughly $180 to treat that tree. Ground treatments for smaller trees can
be purchased at local home improvement stores or nurseries but it has to be done often.
However, injected chemical treatments are necessary for a larger tree or a tree that is already
infected.
Chair Adamson stated that as a beekeeper, he is concerned about some of these over-thecounter or home remedies that actually affect the bee population. He said that these treatments
may be cheaper, but they do not work as well, and there may be unintended consequences that
need to be taken into consideration.

Members of the Public Works Committee
April 21, 2016
Page 8

Councillor McHenry asked if the wasps identified by Purdue, while not harmful to humans, are
harmful to other insects, as some caterpillars infected by wasps do not form their chrysallis and
turn into Monarch butterflies. Mr. Kincius said that he is not qualified to answer that but can find
out the information. He said that the release of the wasp was specifically tested to control these
borers, and he does not know how controlled the study was.
Councillor Oliver asked what the impact of the loss of ash trees will have on other species
because of the effect on habitat. Mr. Kincius said that they are losing one in every ten trees,
and he does not know of species specific to ash trees, but he can also get that information from
the entymologist from Purdue. However, they know that it will also affect stormwater reception
and air quality control.
Councillor Osili asked what the cycle of treatment is. Mr. Kincius said that the over-the-counter
treatment is about $30 and is recommended for spring application. It only works on smaller
trees, however, and is not always effective. The injected method is proven 90% effective, and
the recommendation is to repeat the treatment every two or three years. As the borer
population diminishes, that may be extended, but that is the current recommendation.
Chair Adamson asked if the City is expending any resources on innoculation. Mr. Kincius said
that they have a very limited budget and are mostly prioritizing based on the risk assessment,
but they did have a donation from a company that wanted to test their product, which went into
three specific locations: Broad Ripple Park, Holliday Park, and the Kennedy King Memorial.
The ash trees in those managed areas are doing well, and the City has chosen to continue to
protect those with repeat injections. He said that he believes they spent about $15,000 total to
do that and are hoping to protect those to get through this time frame, and possibly be able to
keep these trees healthy to last their natural 80 to 100-year life cycle. Chair Adamson asked
what the true likelihood is that this threat will go away. He said that his understanding is that
treatment has been a waste, and once infected, saving a tree is next to impossible. He said that
considering the current financial situation of the City, he does not want to see funds thrown
away without results. Mr. Kincius said that he does not know for sure. He said that a lot of the
speculation is based on studies by Purdue, including the history of the Dutch Elm Disease from
the 1930s, which was different, as it was fungal and not insect-related. He said that there are
other areas affected earlier that are seeing some signs of decrease in population now, so they
can learn from them. He said that he does not see it as a waste of money, as they are seeing
some ash trees survive and thrive. In some areas, as these trees are removed, there is nothing
there. Chair Adamson said that he just does not want to get into a situation where 10 years
from now, they have spent tons of money, but the trees are all dead anyway and there is no
relief in sight. Mr. Kincius said that as long as they keep up with that regimen, those trees will
survive, short of devastating storms or other natural disasters.
Councillor McHenry said that there are many types of oak and maple trees, but she asked if
there are different types of ash trees and if they are all susceptible to the ash borer. Mr. Kincius
said that there are four types in the City, but green and white ash make up 90% of the City’s
population. The blue ash has shown some ability to withstand the EAB, for reasons that are
unknown, but there is a thought that they may be able to use the blue ash to populate a hybrid
of the ash tree in the future. He said that there are also the pumpkin ash and the black ash, but
they are not very common in this area. Mr. Colvin said that blue ash are mostly in wetland
areas, and not usually something found on individual residential properties. He added that
Purdue has also treated some ash trees in Eagle Creek Park, and the Friends of Holliday Park

Members of the Public Works Committee
April 21, 2016
Page 9
have also treated some specimen ash trees in Holliday Park. Councillor McHenry asked if the
blue ash grow up readily along creek beds and are somewhat brittle. Mr. Colvin said that this is
correct, and pumpkin ash is similar and is much smaller in structure.
Councillor Osili asked what percentage will be lost. Mr. Kincius said that anything that is not
being treated or protected will be lost. He said that there are other groups protecting and
treating trees, such as Eli Lilly along East Street, as well as individuals treating trees on their
properties; but if they are not being addressed, they will be lost. Councillor Osili asked if Purdue
or any other entity is researching creating a hybrid. Mr. Kincius said that he is not sure who is
doing this, but it is being looked at, and he can ask his contacts and get Councillor Osili an
answer. Mr. Colvin said that it was 35 to 40 years after the Dutch Elm Disease before they saw
a new hybrid elm put on the market, because it takes so much research and genetic testing and
cross-testing that it is a very long process to first grow it, test it, and then finally mass-produce it.
He added that if the food source is taken away for any population, that population collapses,
and that is probably what will eventually happen to the EAB.
Mr. Kincius finished his presentation by showing a graph of the forestry need in the City, both
with street trees and park trees. He stated that the park inventory is not as extensive and only
really includes the maintained areas and does not venture into the forest areas to examine each
and every tree. He said that the inventory shows the diameter of the trees, and so they can
estimate costs, based on different risk levels. He provided a graph, showing the overall urban
forestry need (Exhibit B). He listed the work completed to date:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Total of 870 removals to date
$510,000 spent to date
475 Ash trees
390 other trees (more than just ash affected)
170 extreme risk trees
560 high risk trees

Mr. Kincius said that part of the determination of risk is not to just look at the condition of the
tree, but also how large it is and how much the public is exposed to it, as those factors
determine whether or not it could become a public safety hazard. He said that they have been
spending a half a million dollars annually, but now have $1.5 million budgeted to tackle this
problem. He said that the goal is to spend the money in a way to address those problems that
affect more of the general public. Mr. Colvin said that in light of minimal resources City-wide,
they are thankful for the increase in the budget to address this important issue.
With no further business pending, and upon motion duly made, the Public Works Committee of
the City-County Council was adjourned at 6:48 p.m.

ADMINISTRATION AND FINANCE COMMITTEE
The Administration and Finance Committee of the City-County Council met on Tuesday,
July 16, 2013. Chair Angela Mansfield called the meeting to order at 5:32 p.m. with the
following members present: Pamela Hickman, Benjamin Hunter, Jack Sandlin and
Joseph Simpson. Marilyn Pfisterer, Mary Moriarty Adams and Maggie Lewis arrived
shortly thereafter. Hope Tribble, Chief Financial Officer, represented Council staff.
Chair Mansfield asked committee members to introduce themselves and indicate which
portion of the County they represent.
{Clerk’s Note: Councillors Pfisterer and Moriarty Adams arrived at 5:35 p.m.}
PROPOSAL NO. 186, 2013 - authorizes the Board of Commissioners of Marion County
to dispose of certain parcels that have an appraised value of $50,000 or more
Claudia Fuentes, Marion County Treasurer, stated that by virtue of her office, she also
serves as a County Commissioner. Every year, the Board of Commissioners is charged
with disposing of surplus property in tax sales. She said that this proposal is a request
to dispose of 334 properties appraised at a value of $50,000 or above, and is a routine
annual approval process. She presented a brief Powerpoint presentation (attached as
Exhibit A), and explained the tax sale process. She provided an additional handout
(attached as Exhibit B) showing the revenue and expenses of sold parcels and the
amount distributed to units of government based on those sales. Cindy Land,
administrative deputy, Marion County Treasurer’s Office, explained that these net
revenues are after all expenses, which include advertising, appraisals, postage, mowing
of properties, and other adminstrative duties, have been paid from sale proceeds.
{Clerk’s Note: Councillor Lewis arrived at 5:40 p.m.}
Chair Mansfield asked if this is different in any way from the standard approval
requested every year. Ms. Fuentes responded in the negative.
Councillor Pfisterer asked if there has been any attempt to change the appraisal value
amount at the State level to make this process less cumbersome. She said that maybe
raising that threshhold to $75,000 would help speed up the process. Ms. Land said that
the process can be very slow, as sometimes the order from the court comes at an
inopportune time for a hearing before the Council. They do not want to circumvent
anyone’s authority, but they would welcome that change to streamline the process.
Councillor Hickman said that administrative expenses include $40,000 for employee
reimbursement. She asked if this actually pays for staffing of the administration
process. Ms. Land said that they are able to reimburse the General Fund for a portion
of staff salaries spent in administering this process. Councillor Hickman asked if the
process therefore pays for itself. Ms. Land responded in the affirmative.

Administration and Finance Committee

Councillor Sandlin asked how many properties are included in this proposal. Ms.
Fuentes responded that there are 334 properties. Councillor Sandlin said that he has
heard it is a very slow process and asked how it can move forward. Ms. Fuentes said
that some of these properties are from the 2012 tax sale, which took place in October,
and they received the court order for disposal the first week of June, so it took about
eight months. Ms. Land added that there are so many factors that have to, by law, be
included in a judicial sale, that it makes the process lengthy. She said that there is an
auction, and if a parcel does not sell at auction, then there is a period of redemption,
with notices sent, and then notice advising of the court petition, and then the court has
to have time to act on that petition, and there are appeal times also built in. She said
that disposing of anything that does not sell at auction can be a very cumbersome
process.
Councillor Hunter said that in the recitals of this proposal, references are made to
Indiana Code (IC) 36-111-3, regarding authority from the Mayor, which has been
provided by Executive Order 395. However, some of these parcels in District 21 fall
within a historic district, and he asked if the authority mandated by IC 36-111-1 has
been satisfied, as well. Ms. Land said that this has never been an issue that has come
up before, and they follow the same process they have always followed. She said that
they do not typically have any parcels that are specifically historic that are tax-sale
eligible. Councillor Hunter said that some may think this is a technical thing and not
substantive, but he believes it is worth checking into. He said that IC 36-111-1 gives the
Historic Preservation Commision the same authority over parcels in a historic district as
the Mayor has over the other parcels. He said that he believes this should be looked at
by counsel before the full Council votes. Chair Mansfield said that the “Whereas”
statements are not a substantive part of the proposal. Councillor Hunter said that the
reference is not included in the Sections of the proposal, either, and he just wants to
make sure the process meets the requirements of the Code. Chair Mansfield asked if
Councillor Hunter wants to hold up the approval until this is clarified. Councillor Hunter
said that he is fine with passing the proposal out of Committee, but he would like to
make sure they are complying with the law. Ms. Fuentes asked what 21 parcels on the
list are located in a historic district. Councillor Hunter said that there are a few parcels,
and they are located in District 21. Chair Mansfield asked Councillor Hunter to get with
the Council attorney to address his question before the full Council meeting. Councillor
Hunter agreed.
Councillor Moriarty Adams moved, seconded by Councillor Sandlin, to send Proposal
No. 186, 2013 to the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried
by a vote of 8-0.
PROPOSAL NO. 187, 2013 - proposes an ordinance of the Marion County Income Tax
Council, under IC 6-3.5-6-1.5 and IC 6-3.5-6-13, to decrease the local homestead credit
to 4% for calendar year 2014 and to rescind the local homestead credit beginning in
calendar year 2015, and casts the vote of the Council on such ordinance

Co-Chairs of the Local Homestead Credit Review Commission (LHCRC) Beth Henkel
(Local Attorney, former Department of Local Government and Finance Commissioner)
and James Steele (former City Controller and former Chief Financial Officer for the CityCounty Council) made a brief presentation to committee members regarding the work
and recommendation of the LHCRC and provided them with copies of an abbreviated
report from the commission. {Clerk’s Note: A copy of this report is on file in the Council
Office with the original set of these minutes.} They presented a brief Powerpoint
presentation (attached as Exhibit C) detailing the process undertaken by the
commission, including their objectives, their membership, and their meeting schedule.
Mr. Steele said that each of the public meetings included a presentation by the City
Controller regarding the City and County’s fiscal condition. He reviewed the fiscal
condition of the City and County as detailed in Exhibit C. He said that Policy Analytics,
LLC (PALLC), a local fiscal research and analysis firm, provided another presentation at
the meetings to explain the history and purpose of the local homestead credit and the
impact on taxpayers and local taxing units if this credit were to be eliminated. He said
that when the County Option Income Tax (COIT) homestead credit was created, it was
intended to help alleviate the burden of property taxes. This was before any of the 1%,
2% and 3% property tax caps, depending on the type of property, went into effect. He
reviewed the impact of eliminating this credit on taxing units and taxpayers. He said
that at the commission’s final meeting, nine members and one proxy were in
attendance. Of the nine members, five voted to phase out the homestead credit, and
four voted to retain the credit. The proxy also voted to phase out the credit, but General
Counsel Fred Biesecker ruled that the proxy’s vote could not be counted. The rules set
forth for the commission indicate that a recommendation had to be made by six
members of the commission, so the recommendation is somewhat limited because
there was no definitive recommendation by six official members. He reviewed the
seven additional recommendations made by the commission:
1. Continue City/County efficiency measures to reduce spendign
2. Additional funding for Auditor (hire outside help to help identify violations of HSC
claims)
3. Additional funding for Assessor (Eliminating the backlog of appeals would help
other units)
4. Increase LOIT (Local Option Income Tax) levy freeze rate (raise to the maximum
amount allowed by DLGF to provide an additional $14 million in revenue to the
local units of government) This would not help the schools, but it would provide
an additional $500,000 for IndyGo, $900,000 for the Library, and $2.6 million for
Health and Hospital Corporation (HHC).
5. Provide funding for Library and IndyGo (cover net loss in revenue through an offthe-top distribution)
6. Phase in Public Safety COIT rate increase (an increase from current 0.35% to
the maximum allowed of 0.50% would provide an additional $25 million of
revenue for funding the staffing and operations for public safety)
7. Establish Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Assessed Valuation (AV) pass-through
policy. Currently passing through about $1.3 billion of TIF AV back to the base,

Administration and Finance Committee

which reduces tax rates and reduces the circuit breaker impact for all unts of
government that receive property tax. If the same amount is passed in 2014, it
would result in a reduction of circuit breaker loss in the amount of $25.4 million to
all local units, and an $11.9 million reduction in circuit breaker loss for schools.
Mr. Steele relayed the votes on each recommendation as reported in the June 24, 2013
minutes of the commission, and said that the consensus was that the majority of
members were in agreement with these recommendations, with the LOIT levy freeze
rate increase and the Public Safety COIT rate increases suggested for further review.
He said that the Local Option Income Tax (LOIT) was established in order to freeze
property tax levies for a period of three years. That current rate is 0.27%, which only
provides $44 million of revenue. For a three-year levy freeze, there should be $58
million from the LOIT rate to provide relief to local units of government for their
operating budgets. There is, therefore, a $14 million shortfall to the local units of
government that they should have received, but have not because the LOIT rate is too
low. If it were established at the correct rate, the Parks Department would get an
additional $1.1 million of revenue, Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department would
get $1.1 million, the Indianapolis Fire Department would get $1.2 million, the Library
would get $913,000, IndyGo would get $557,000, and Health and Hospital Corporation
would get an additional $2,556,000 in revenue. That is how much revenues are being
shorted because the LOIT rate is not sufficient to pay for the three years of freeze. Mr.
Steele concluded by saying that a majority of members expressed concern about the
loss of revenue for local units of government, as well as increases, albeit slight, in
taxpayer bills during tough economic times.
Chair Mansfield asked if they have a slide that shows the map with the geographical
impacts and the level of impact on each parcel. She said that this map clearly shows
the public who will be impacted, and her district, in Washington Township, shows a
substantial impact. She said that the report indicates the average increase for most
taxpayers will be only about $20, but most of the properties in her district are in the $50
to $70 increase range. She said there are other areas, however, that have almost no
impact. Ms. Henkel stated that the areas that show no impact are primarily areas that
are already capped out at 1%. Mr. Steele added that the areas with the greatest
increase are predominantly areas with the lowest tax rates in the County. Chair
Mansfield said that these areas also did not receive the benefit of the tax caps, yet their
governing units are all hurting because of the caps; so this action does not benefit her
district.
Councillor Sandlin asked Mr. Steele to explain the impact of school referendums on this
credit. Mr. Steele said that several school districts in the County have passed
referendums, mostly on debt service or transportation, but at least two have passed
referendums on operating revenues. He said that these referendum amounts are
outside the freeze. If a property is capped at 1%, and that area’s school corporation
has passed a referendum, the referendum rate is added on at 100% over and above the

Administration and Finance Committee
July 16, 2013
Page 5
1% freeze. To exacerbate the problem, this homestead credit is paying a portion of the
referendum rate by a quirk of State statute, which it was never intended to do.
Councillor Simpson asked what townships will see the most negative impact. Ms.
Henkel said that Washington Township will be hit the hardest, and this is partly because
of low tax rates to begin with, but also exacerbated by the referendum. She said that
she lives in Washington Township, and if this credit elimination were implemented this
year with no phase in, she would pay an extra $28.
Councillor Hickman asked if these areas will also lose the most amount of money in the
area of schools and libraries. Mr. Steele said that this is probably not the case, because
the circuit breaker impact is the lowest where there are already low rates. Councillor
Hickman said that Washington Township does not have that low a rate. Ms. Henkel
said that Washington Township and Lawrence Township have the lowest tax rates in
the County. Ms. Henkel added that Franklin Township has the highest tax rate, and
they were not able to pass their proposed referendum, so most of those folks are
capped out at their maximum. Franklin Township and Indianapolis Public Schools (IPS)
will probably be hit the hardest by this action. Councillor Hickman asked if the
Washington Township School District will not then be the hardest hit. Mr. Steele said
that they will not. Councillor Hickman said that she does not understand why they are
taking money out of this one pot to pay for other things. She asked why they cannot
implement these other recommendations, which could be done easier, instead of
eliminating this homestead credit. Mr. Steele said that the commission was charged
solely with looking at whether or not to eliminate the homestead credit. During the
course of their meetings and discussions, they looked at other options to help mitigate
the lost revenue for taxing units, as requested by those who testified at the meetings.
These other recommendations are just options for the Council to consider in addition to
the phasing out of the homestead credit. He said that some of this loss will be mitigated
by the pass-through of the tax increment financing (TIF) incremental revenue, which the
Controller will speak to in his presentation. He said that even if a district does not have
a TIF, passing through this revenue lowers the County’s tax rate and it shifts out to all
taxing districts. He said that the commission simply was looking at other
recommendations to consider. Ms. Henkel added that an additional revenue of $8.3
million for the City and County will not fully address their $29 million deficit. These are
simply other recommendations that the Council and administration could consider as
add-ons or alternatives to help their financial situation. Councillor Hickman asked if
these are then simply recommendations that “may” happen, while the credit elimination
“will” take place. Mr. Steele said that with this proposal, they are only considering the
elimination of the homestead credit, so whether that occurs is based on the outcome of
this proposal. He said that during the commission’s process, however, they saw some
other things they felt the City, County and Council should consider.
Councillor Moriarty Adams said that she has not made up her mind about how she feels
on this issue and asked how this will affect Warren Township. Mr. Steele said that the
township will lose $1,100 and the schools would lose $272,000. He added that the City

Administration and Finance Committee
July 16, 2013
Page 6
has released TIF pass-through back to the base, which makes many of these school
districts a net winner, especially IPS. Councillor Moriarty Adams asked what will
happen next yea, if this proposal is passed and the credit is gone. She asked where the
City will then go to find revenue for their structural deficit. Mr. Steele said that the
recommendation, as proposed in this resolution, is to phase out that credit, so it will not
be completely gone next year. If it were eliminated in its entirety, the City would receive
an additional $8.3 million in net gain revenue. That amount would carry forward each
year as an ongoing revenue stream for the City and County. Councillor Moriarty Adams
asked if this would then reduce the structural deficit of $55 million by $8.3 million. Mr.
Steele responded in the affirmative. Ms. Henkel added that the Legislature has given
local government very few options. She said that a quarter of homeowners are getting
no benefit from this credit, while others see just a slight benefit. Some taxing units are
getting the benefit of income tax revenue that they would not normally receive. Mr.
Steele said that the property tax reforms changed the game. Most of this revenue no
longer provides property tax relief to homeowners; but instead, it provides circuit
breaker relief to certain taxing units who would otherwise not be eligible for COIT
dollars.
Councillor Hickman said that these funds are already designated for schools and
municipal corporations, but when they go into the General Fund, they can no longer
guarantee those funds would go toward schools, as the Council is no longer in control of
the General Fund due to new legislation. Chair Mansfield said that this is an additional
observation, but not necessarily related to the elimination of this credit.
Councillor Sandlin said that there was a lot of information presented before the
commission through a series of meetings. He said that schools now benefit from this
credit for expenses related to bus replacement, transportation and capital projects only.
If eliminated, the money they will lose will then go to benefit their taxpayers, instead. He
said that no one in government likes to deal with the fact that tax caps are in place,
even if they personally agree that they are a good thing; because governmental units
are struggling for revenues as a result of these caps. He said that the Council has the
ongoing responsibility of looking for things that will reduce their budgets without
reducing essential services, as well as looking at the right mix of taxes to support those
services. These are tough choices, and he is not sure any one thing will fill the hole that
is projected. Reducing spending, however, is still the most important thing; and all
agencies and departments are reducing their budgets, controlling costs, and doing more
with less.
Councillor Simpson thanked Mr. Steele and Ms. Henkel for doing a great job with this
commission and tackling this tough subject. He said that the commission’s process
seems to have been thorough and fair, but there is still a lot of thought needed. The
information provided through the work of the commission, however, makes it easier for
them to understand what they are up against.

Administration and Finance Committee

Councillor Moriarty Adams asked if any of this increased revenue will go to public
safety. Mr. Steele said that it will, but that would be a better question for the Controller
during his presentation.
Councillor Pfisterer said that as a global observation, the homestead credit was
established in the 1980s, before tax caps were in existence, to provide property tax
relief. From a global perspective, the credit is no longer serving the function for which it
was designed. Mr. Steele concurred and said that less than 30% of the credit is actually
used for the function for which it was designed.
Chair Mansfield echoed Councillor Simpson’s appreciation to Ms. Henkel and Mr.
Steele and all the commission members for the time and effort they have spent on this
important issue.
Jason Dudich, City Controller, Office of Finance and Management (OFM), also thanked
Mr. Steele, Ms. Henkel and the commission for their work, and the public for attending
the hearings and providing additional input. He provided a handout (attached as Exhibit
D), and explained that this proposal will work to phase out an antiquated and out-dated
property tax relief program. He reviewed the handout in detail and said that this action
will have a minimal impact on homestead property taxpayers, with the average increase
being $22 per homeowner, and 25% of all taxpayers seeing no impact. He added that
there would be an impact on local units of government, and an additional $12.8 million
of COIT revenue would be distributed among units receiving those revenues. He said
that there is some room for growth in COIT revenue, as only 40% of parcels are
currently at their cap. He said that the City-County portion of this additional revenue
would go directly into the fund that primarily supports public safety and criminal justice
functions of the County. Some local units of government that do not benefit from
income tax revenue will see a negative impact, but these units were never intended to
get COIT revenue. He reviewed the discussed solutions to help mitigate that loss of
revenue for local taxing units. He said that they intend to increase the TIF pass-through
amounts. Currently, $1.4 billion is passed through, and they are proposing to pass
through an additional $3.7 million in 2014. Although areas where there are TIF districts
will benefit the most, this benefit will actually spread out to everyone to help mitigate
revenue loss. They also expect some potential natural growth in income tax revenue.
Due to an error at the State, some revenue was withheld, and they believe the State will
release this income tax distribution and it will begin to grow next year. He said that both
of these factors will help relieve some of the financial pressure on these local units. He
said that once the TIF is passed through, then schools would actually be held harmless
overall, and IPS would actually gain $1.3 million in 2014. Other school corporations
may not see such a huge benefit, but by phasing the credit out, as this resolution
proposes, they will help mitigate some of that impact and help them gradually cope with
the potential loss.
Councillor Hickman asked how a district without a TIF can be held harmless. Mr.
Dudich said that by passing through the TIF increment, all districts in the County will

Administration and Finance Committee
July 16, 2013
Page 8
realize additional property tax revenue. Councillor Hickman asked if they can guarantee
TIF revenue for all school corporations that will lose money. Mr. Dudich said that there
is no guarantee that all schools will be without some loss, but overall, factoring in all
school districts, they will be held harmless. Councillor Hickman asked if he can give the
schools a specific dollar amount so that they have some idea what their budget will be.
Mr. Dudich said that once the pass-through is finalized, all units will receive notification,
and then if this proposal passes, the units will be aware of further impact. Councillor
Hickman said that even though Mr. Dudich says this revenue will go to fund public
safety, the Council does not have total control over the General Fund anymore, and so
they cannot guarantee it goes to fund public safety. Mr. Dudich said that the Council
votes on the budget and makes the final decision about where dollars go and what
expenditures are approved, so they do have the authority to determine that. Councillor
Hickman said that with some changes at the State, the Council no longer has complete
control of this fund, and she does not want the public to get the impression that they do.
Councillor Lewis asked if the TIF increment will be passed through anyway, even if this
proposal does not pass. Mr. Dudich responded in the affirmative, and said that it is a
yearly approval process. He said that the recommended pass-through may have been
a lesser amount if this action were not being considered, but it is the City’s commitment
to increase it to help mitigate the effect of this credit elimination.
Councillor Sandlin said that one of the things that came up in commission discussions
was the benefit of having a TIF pass-through policy, so that there is more consistency
from year to year. He said that he believes this recommendation is an important thing
to look at going forward. Mr. Dudich said that there is a working group that was created
as a result of the recent TIF Study Commission, and they have developed a policy, with
the input of Ms. Tribble, the Metropolitan Development Commission (MDC), the
Department of Metropolitan Development (DMD) and others. He said that the intent is
to use this policy going forward as a guide to the distribution of these monies.
Councillor Moriarty Adams asked how phasing it out is better than eliminating it outright.
Mr. Dudich said that it does not give the City the revenue they need immediately, so an
outright elimination would be more beneficial to them. However, for those who will be
losing dollars, a phase out helps them plan better to absorb that loss gradually. He said
it will still benefit the City with some increase in revenue the first year, but it would be
less than what they would prefer with a flat elimination. He said that he hopes there are
some additional changes at the State level by 2015 that may help mitigate the loss for
local units even further.
Councillor Hickman asked if the State releasing the additional COIT revenue will cause
the pot to grow enough so that this credit elimination is not needed. Mr. Dudich said
that the pot will most likely grow, but it still will not cover the services they provide and
the deficit they face. He said, conversely, the State could choose not to release those
dollars, and they would be in worse shape. He said that there is no one silver bullet to
fix all their problems.

Administration and Finance Committee

Chair Mansfield said that her constituents are more impacted than others throughout the
County. To be honest, she might be more open to this action if she believed the Mayor
had been fiscally responsible during his administration. She said that there have been a
number of instances, however, in looking at a holistic snapshot of his time in office, that
she feels the Mayor has been hemorrhaging money. She said that decisions such as
the sale of the parking meter revenue system, other corporate giveaways, self-serving
raises for Mayoral staff, and the use of RebuildIndy funds for a cricket field attest to this
fact. She said that some of these things would be fine to do if the City had extra money,
but when her district is in dire need of infrastructure for safety reasons, spending money
on a cricket field that most people will never use makes no sense. She said that looking
at all these things and adding them up, she cannot help but think what this money would
equal in terms of full-time police officers. She said that for these reasons, she cannot
support this proposal.
Councillor Simpson said that if this is such a good idea, he questions why the
Republicans did not do it when they were in control of the Council. He said that they
had the opportunity then to eliminate this tax credit, but chose not to. He said that one
of his greatest concerns is for some senior constituents who are on a fixed income,
where this $22 average increase might mean the difference in having food on their table
or medicine to address life and death health problems. He said that taxpayers have to
manage their budget, and he does not know why the City cannot manage theirs. He
said that he believes this issue does need to go to the full Council for discussion and a
vote of the full body. He said that he is not, however, inclined to support it in the end,
because it is basically a tax increase. He said that he appreciates Mr. Dudich’s
presentation in layman’s terms and the work of the commission, but he is still hung up
on the issue, because he also lives in Washington Township, which will be one of the
hardest hit.
Councillor Lewis asked for clarification that the phase-out will bring an extra $4 million in
2014 and $8 million the next year. Mr. Dudich said that the overall increased COIT
revenue from the elimination of the credit over the two-year period would be $12.8
million. The City and County’s share of that would be $8.4 million. If phased out over
two years, as this proposal recommends, the City would receive an increased revenue
stream of $4.2 million in 2014 and then another $4.2 million increase in 2015, for a total
of $8.4 million. The rest of that increase would go out to other units, and the City would
not get the entire $12.8 million increase.
Councillor Pfisterer said that the reason the Republicans did not eliminate this credit
when they were in control of the Council is because the fiscal situation of the City and
County was in better shape at that time, and the property tax caps had not yet fully
kicked in. She said that her district encompasses the Haughville area, which also has
lower taxes, and her constituents will also be impacted greater than the average
taxpayer. However, a great deal of this money will go toward public safety to keep

Administration and Finance Committee
July 16, 2013
Page 10
these taxpayers safe. Also, this credit is antiquated and has outlived its usefulness.
She said that for those reasons, she supports the proposal.
Councillor Moriarty Adams said that she is still up in the air regarding this decision. She
said that she just received her copy of the commission’s report at this evening’s
meeting, and she looks forward to reviewing it to help her make up her mind. She said
that she will vote the proposal out of committee this evening, because, like Councillor
Simpson, she believes there should be a debate on the Council floor for all 29
Councillors to weigh in on this issue. She said that she has some reservations about it
generally, but she will vote to advance it out of committee to the full Council.
Chair Mansfield stated that there is an amendment before the committee for Proposal
No. 187, 2013 (attached as Exhibit E), and she asked Ms. Tribble to explain the
amendment. Ms. Tribble said that this shores up the language in the proposal in order
to cover all bases with the Department of Local Government Finance (DLGF). She said
that the last time the Marion County Income Tax Council (MCITC) passed a resolution,
the credit was created at 8%, but since that time, there have been some changes in the
way the DLGF calculates that rate; and what is actually credited to taxpayers’ bills is
about 3.6%. She said that this shows a reduction from 8% in the recorded history to 4%
as a nominal amount, and recognizes the effective credit at 3.6%. This amendment
also notes the amount designated for the homestead credit as $12.5 million. This
language is for the benefit of any kind of activity by the DLGF after their review of this
ordinance if it is passed.
Councillor Pfisterer referred to the geographical impact map and asked if the elimination
is phased out, if those amounts of impact will then just be cut in half for the first year.
For example, if the effect of the elimination shows a $10 increase, would it be an actual
increase of $5 the first year. Ms. Tribble responded in the affirmative.
Councillor Moriarty Adams moved, seconded by Councillor Simpson, to “Amend”
Proposal No. 187, 2013 as per Exhibit E. The motion carried by a vote of 7-1, with
Councillor Hickman casting the negative vote.
Councillor Moriarty Adams moved, seconded by Councillor Simpson, to send Proposal
No. 187, 2013 to the full Council with a “Do Pass As Amended” recommendation. The
motion carried by a vote of 5-3, with Councillors Hickman, Lewis and Mansfield casting
the negative votes.
There being no further business, and upon motion duly made, the meeting was
adjourned at 7:00 p.m.
Respectfully Submitted,

AM/ag

CITIZEN’S GAS PRESENTATION – John Whitaker, Senior Vice President

PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE
The Public Works Committee of the City-County Council met on Thursday, November
10, 2005. Chairman Lonnell Conley called the meeting to order at 5:03 p.m. with the
following members present: Patrice Abduallah, Ginny Cain, Scott Keller, Dane Mahern
and Mike Speedy. James Bradford, Angela Mansfield and Mary Moriarty Adams were
absent. Councillor Lincoln Plowman was also in attendance.
PROPOSAL NO. 487, 2005 - approves the sale of the Liberty Water Assets
Carlton Curry, director of contracts and operations for the Department of Waterworks,
provided a handout and explained that this proposal will help two communities:
Plainfield and Indianapolis Water. He said that when Indianapolis Waterworks was
formed in 2002, along with the acquisition of water service to approximately 279,000
Marion County residents, assets were also acquired for five smaller utilities operated by
the Indianapolis Water Company (IWC), including the Liberty Water Company. The
Liberty Water assets are located in Hendricks County on the south side of US 40 just
west of Plainfield. The asset is not connected to a core water system and serves about
135 customers solely from two 600-gallon-per-minute wells. The eastern boundary of
this service area borders a part of Plainfield’s water service. To connect this asset to
the core Indianapolis Waterworks system would be costly and difficult, due to having to
cross other counties’ service areas in order to connect. Most connections would require
upwards of $3 million, and another $2 to $2.5 million if another storage tank were
needed due to growth. Even if the connection took place, it would be most likely that
the Liberty Water treatment portion would be shut down due to small well production
capacity, which would cause Indianapolis to lose their investment. Mr. Curry said that
Plainfield Town Manager, Rich Carlucci, is present this evening to testify to the fact that
Plainfield wants this asset as a natural connection and growth for its existing service
district. The sale would be beneficial to bond holders and ratepayers and would not
impact them negatively. He said that the income from the proceeds of the sale could be
used for other capital improvement projects. He said that according to IC 36-1-11-8, the
Council must approve the sale by a resolution, and the board of the Department of
Waterworks authorized the sale at its June meeting. He said that they were not
required to do an appraisal, but they did have one performed, and the sale price agreed
upon is above the appraised value.
Chair Conley asked what would happen to the 135 customers Liberty Water services
due to this sale. Mr. Curry said that they would become customers of Plainfield Water,
and Plainfield would then provide them with service.

Public Works Committee
November 10, 2005
Page 2
Councillor Keller asked what the appraisal and sale prices are. Mr. Curry said that the
assets were appraised at $800,000, and the sale price to Plainfield is $1,050,000. He
said that there are a few other liabilities that will provide further offset. Councillor
Abduallah asked after factoring in all liabilities what the net profit will be. Mr. Curry said
that it will be approximately $700,000.
Councillor Speedy asked for the size of the service area. Mr. Curry said that this is a
hard question to answer. He said that it is estimated starting at the treatment plant,
which is visible from US 40, due west to Belleville, and a few hundred yards to the
south, which is all farm area. Councillor Speedy asked if the area is over 200 acres.
Mr. Curry said that it is probably a little over 200 acres. Councillor Speedy asked how
many customers the treatment plant could service without future expansion. Mr. Curry
said that without expansion, the plant could probably serve about 250 residential
metered customers on an average day; not much more than the customers they
currently serve. Councillor Speedy asked if Plainfield will be keeping the treatment
facility. Mr. Curry said that he suspects they will until they find an alternative way to
serve these customers, but he cannot speak for them. Councillor Speedy asked if the
appraisal took into consideration future growth. Andy Klineman, Office of Corporation
Counsel, stated that they did consider future growth and connecting to the system, as
well as traversing non-Indianapolis Water territory. Councillor Speedy asked if they
explored the value of the company as an entrepreneurial interest. Mr. Klineman said
that the appraiser was asked to err on the side of the highest evaluation and value it as
a set-alone utility that was up and running. Mr. Curry said that the sale price is 25%
above the appraised value, and even factoring in future growth, it is a better deal to sell
the assets.
Councillor Mahern asked about the timing of this sale and why the assets were not sold
earlier. Mr. Curry said that they have been working on this decision for 18 months.
Councillor Abduallah asked if special projects have been identified to use the proceeds
of this sale. Mr. Curry said that at the board meeting next Thursday evening, one
project being proposed relates directly to the water purchased from Plainfield. He said
that this water cannot be mixed with Indianapolis Water because each use different
purifiers which, when mixed, nullify the purification. The purchase of an ammonianator
will allow Indianapolis to mix the water and still keep the water pure in their chloramine
system. He said that he hopes the sale of this asset will help to offset the purchase of
the ammonianator.
Councillor Abduallah asked if the Committee could hear from Mr. Carlucci regarding
Plainfield’s acceptance of this sale. Mr. Carlucci said that they have been discussing
this sale for some time, and they do not plan to close down the treatment plant, but will
connect it to their existing system to help serve the Belleville area. He said that they will
look at upgrading the two 600-gallon-per-minute wells, and feel the Liberty Water
Company will be a valuable asset to them. This is a primarily residential area, and the

Public Works Committee
November 10, 2005
Page 3
Plainfield water system can easily grow that way. The Plainfield Water board has
approved the purchase.
Councillor Abduallah moved, seconded by Councillor Cain, to send Proposal No. 487,
2005 to the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried by a
vote of 7-0.
PROPOSAL NO. 492, 2005 - authorizes speed limit reductions throughout the
Smithfield subdivision (District 25)
Councillor Plowman said that Smithfield is a fairly new subdivision and its streets have
not yet been accepted by the City. He said that he would like the proposal postponed
for ninety days to allow time for the streets to be accepted by the City. He said that one
person is in attendance to speak in favor of the proposal, but until the streets are official,
this proposal will have to wait.
Councillor Mahern moved, seconded by Councillor Keller, to “Postpone” Proposal No.
492, 2005 until February 23, 2005. The motion carried by a vote of 6-0.
PROPOSAL NO. 493, 2005 - authorizes speed limit reductions throughout the Waters
Edge subdivision (District 25)
Councillor Plowman provided Committee members with letters of support for this
proposal. He said that most subdivisions in his area have homes very close to the
street. The law sets speed limits arbitrarily at 30 miles per hour (mph) in a residential
district, but the law also allows for that limit to be reduced by 10 mph. He is asking that
the limit be reduced to 20 mph in this subdivision.
Councillor Speedy asked if this is a new subdivision. Councillor Plowman said that it is
fairly new. Matthew Stevenson, resident, stated that ground was broken three years
ago, but the last house in the subdivision was just finished in the last 60 days.
Councillor Speedy said that he feels developers should build things into their new
subdivisions to slow traffic instead of having to come and ask the Council to lower the
speed limit. He said that he believes it is a design issue and should be addressed as
the subdivision is being planned. He encouraged the Department of Public Works
(DPW) to work with developers throughout the design phase to build these traffic flow
controls into the plans.
Mr. Stevenson said that he is the crime watch coordinator and newly elected
Homeowner Association president for the subdivision, as well as being an officer with
the Indianapolis Police Department. He said that there is a high volume of traffic in this
subdivision because four or five streets are through streets from older subdivisions to
main roads Five Points and Thompson. He said that they experience more than normal
residential traffic. He added that there is only about 16 feet between houses, and front
yards are shorter to allow for larger back yards. The streets are only 25 feet wide with

Public Works Committee
November 10, 2005
Page 4
lots of bends and curves. He said if residents have visitors who park in the street, it
makes the road a one-way venue. He said that there are a lot of children in this
neighborhood and it has become a hazard.
Chair Conley asked if there are driveways available for visitors to park. Mr. Stevenson
said that with only two cars in the driveway, the back bumper of the second car is in the
street. He said that the houses are very close to the street.
Councillor Abduallah asked if any parks were considered to be built into the subdivision.
Mr. Stevenson said that there is a playground, which is at the entrance to the
subdivison. Most of the traffic passes the playground to go in or out to a major street,
and the sidewalk is very close to this three-street intersection. Councillor Abduallah
asked if warning lights are in place. Mr. Stevenson said that even general Indianapolis
Power and Light lighting is not available in that area to even shine a light on the sign
into the subdivision, and they are at a cost disadvantage to wire the area for such lights.
Councillor Keller said that the law allows for reduction in speed limits for the very reason
that there are particular neighborhoods that have characteristics that warrant such. He
said that Mr. Stevenson is both a law enforcement officer and a resident of this area and
he trusts his judgment that a lowering of the speed limit is needed. He said that he
supports the proposal.
Councillor Abduallah asked about enforcement. Mr. Stevenson said that the
neighborhood had contemplated paying for signs and posting them on their own, but
most law enforcement agencies will not enforce if there is not a City-issued speed limit
sign. He said that he and other district patrol officers are willing to do extra patrols, and
the crime watch organization supports the lowered limit. He said that he has spoken
with IPD officers, and they are happy to help the neighborhood with enforcement.
Chair Conley asked if a staff representative from DPW has any comments regarding
this proposal. Nathan Sheets, traffic project manager, said that they have not done an
engineering study on this particular subdivision, but he agrees that it is a design issue
and subdivisions should follow City guidelines. He said that he is not sure the signage
will really slow traffic down, but if the law enforcement is willing to enforce and backs up
this lowering of the speed limit, it is possible. Chair Conley asked how long it would
take for a study to be done. Mr. Sheets said that it would be a one to two-month
process, and the report could come back with the recommendation that 30 mph is
prudent, even though that is not what the neighbors want.
Councillor Plowman said that even building some safeguards into the design of a
subdivision, when it is nice weather and there are 30 children outside playing, 30 mph is
too fast.

Councillor Keller moved, seconded by Councillor Cain, to send Proposal No. 493, 2005
to the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried by a vote of 60.
PROPOSAL NO. 569, 2005 - approves the issuance of one or more series of Sanitary
District Revenue Bonds, and if necessary, one or more series of notes in an aggregate
principal amount not to exceed $160,000,000 and approving and authorizing other
actions in respect thereto
Barbara Lawrence, executive director of the Indianapolis Bond Bank, provided a
handout and reviewed it in detail with Committee members. She said that the proposal
requests approval to issue one or more series of financings in an amount not to exceed
$160 million to fund projects to reduce raw sewage overflows. Financing could be
through Wastewater State Revolving Fund (SRF), Open Market, or Commercial Paper.
This financing would help to bring sewer service to those with septic systems, increase
sewer capacity and improve treatment plants, and reduce raw sewage overflows into
rivers and streams. She said that Councillors have an Exhibit attached to their proposal
with a list of projects, and they will notice that there are $469 million worth of projects
listed. This proposal is only the first phase of the program, and the City anticipates
additional bond issues over the next three years to fund all the projects. She said that
projected expenditures are $80,252,907 for fiscal year 2005, $125,839,393 for 2006,
$126,598,220 for 2007, and $136,735,200 for 2008.
Ms. Lawrence said that SRF is generally much more effective than the other funding
options and is a federal-state loan program to provide lower interest loans to
communities for wastewater and drinking water needs. The advantages of an SRF loan
would be lower interest rates, fixed rates for a 20-year loan, lower issuance costs,
drawing money as needed, and only paying interest on amount outstanding. A few
disadvantages of the SRF program would be that each project must meet eligibility
requirements, upfront reports are needed, and there is a more limited capacity.
Indianapolis has funded numerous programs through SRF over the last six to seven
years, and it has worked well for the City. She said that interest rates in this program
are determined on certain criteria based on three ranges of average monthly user rates
for an equivalent dwelling unit (EDU). Ms. Lawrence said that Indianapolis usually
qualifies for Tier II rates, which currently has interest rates at 3.40%.
Ms. Lawrence said that open market bonds are sold through a traditional financing
institution using underwriters and investment bankers to structure transaction and
market bonds. These are generally used for projects which do not meet eligibility
requirements for SRF funding and projects that require immediacy. These are marketbased rates impacted by many factors and have higher issuance costs. They are
beneficial in that they offer better control with regards to timing. Commercial paper
allows low-cost short-term financing with flexibility. The term of repayment cannot
exceed 270 days, but they can be renewed for another 270 days. She said that
commercial paper is commonly used to fund projects up front with the design or

Public Works Committee
November 10, 2005
Page 6
engineering phases before cost of the projects are known. They are then usually
converted to long-term bonds later when the costs of the project can be better
determined.
Ms. Lawrence said that revenues of the sanitary district are pledged for repayment and
the rate increase just approved will assist in paying this debt service. She said that if
approved by the Council on Monday, they hope to close on SRF funding by the end of
December to take advantage of current interest rates and negotiate any open market
bonds by January or February.
Councillor Speedy said that he supports the proposal. Debt can be either a cruel
master or a useful servant, and he believes this debt is of great use and is well
underwritten and a useful servant. He said that he has taken time to look over the list of
projects, and they do not need to be delayed until after fees are collected.
Councillor Mahern said that he agrees and there are some neighborhoods on this list
that have been waiting for their projects for many years. He said that this effort has
been bi-partisan and well-supported, and affects all districts and townships.
Councillor Abduallah moved, seconded by Councillors Keller and Mahern, to send
Proposal No. 569, 2005 to the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The
motion carried by a vote of 6-0.
PROPOSAL NO. 570, 2005 - transfers and appropriates $1,563,000 in the 2005 Budget
of the Department of Public Works, Fleet Services Division (Consolidated County Fund),
to pay additional costs for motor vehicle fuel due to rising fuel prices, financed by
internal charges and revenues from non-city customers who purchase fuel from Fleet
Services
Michael Williams, Chief Financial Officer for DPW, introduced Ron Stinson, finance
manager for Indianapolis Fleet Services (IFS). Mr. Stinson said that this appropriation
is needed to cover the anticipated costs for fuel through the end of the year. He said
that because of escalating costs, the money for fuel was underbudgeted and the latest
projected shortfall is approximately $1.5 million. He said that the City typically uses 1.1
million gallons of gas per month at $2.75 per gallon. He said that prices spiked after the
hurricanes, and although they have gone down slightly, funds are still needed. He said
that these costs will be recovered through those fleets using the fuel in the chargeback
program.
Councillor Mahern said that he is surprised the fuel budget has lasted this long and that
IFS did not come before the Committee for more money sooner. He said that everyone
has seen the fluctuating gas prices and he knows it is needed, as fuel prices still remain
unstable.

Public Works Committee
November 10, 2005
Page 7
Councillor Speedy asked if this is a net increase or a shift in dollars and if it will cost the
taxpayer more money. Mr. Stinson said that chargebacks will be used to pay this cost
through City and County agencies using the fuel. Mr. Williams said that there will be an
increase in some department and agency budgets, but most are managing to shift
dollars between characters to pay these costs without increasing their overall budget.
Jeff Seidenstein, Deputy Controller, said that some agencies will be able to tighten their
belts in other areas and shift dollars. He said that a proposal will be introduced Monday
evening which will shift money from the Sheriff’s Civil Fees Fund to help pay for fuel
costs outstanding there, as the Sheriff cannot afford to pay fuel costs and is in arrears.
Another proposal to shift money within the Police Department to pay fuel costs will also
be introduced.
Councillor Speedy asked how short the Sheriff’s Department was last year. Mr. Stinson
said that they were $1.6 million short. Mr. Seidenstein said that this forthcoming
proposal will only catch them up through June of this year, and they will still owe for the
second part of the year.
Councillor Abduallah moved, seconded by Councillors Mahern and Cain, to send
Proposal No. 570, 2005 to the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The
motion carried by a vote of 6-0.
Councillor Keller said that he has a planning meeting in his district that he must leave to
attend, but he wanted to recognize Citizen’s Gas before leaving. He said that Citizen’s
Gas has been a good partner with the Southeast Community Organization, and a
documentary the community organization did featured Citizen’s Gas and actually won
an Emmy. He said that he wanted to take a moment to publicly thank Citizen’s Gas for
their increased efforts with regards to employment diversity, specifically Yvonne Perkins
and John Whitaker.
[Clerk’s Note: Councillor Keller left at 6:12 p.m.]
PROPOSAL NO. 571, 2005 - approves an increase of $330,000 in the 2005 Budget of
the Department of Public Works, Policy and Planning Divsion (Non-Lapsing Federal
Grants Fund), to retrofit approximately 140 diesel-powered IndyGo buses with emissionreducing Diesel Oxidation Catalysts and other air pollution related projects, financed by
a $145,000 payment to accomplish a supplemental environmental project provided for
in a Consent Agreement and Final Order between the International Truck and Engine
Corporation and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and to retrofit
approximately 196 vehicles owned by DPW and other governmental entities and
undertake public education and outreach to raise awareness of air quality issues,
financed by a $185,000 grant from the EPA
John Chavez, administrator, Policy and Planning Division, stated that an amendment is
needed to replace the words “to retrofit approximately 140 diesel-powered IndyGo
buses with emission-reducing Diesel Oxidation Catalysts and other air pollution related

Public Works Committee
November 10, 2005
Page 8
projects” with “to implement mutually agreed upon air quality improvement projects.” He
added that there is a “0” missing from one of the numbers and underlining where there
should not be in copies of the amendment. [Clerk’s Note: The “0” omission and
underlining do not appear in the original introduced version of the proposal, only on the
copied amendment form.]
Councillor Cain stated that this seems familiar and asked if they did not just recently
approve the same thing. Mr. Chavez said that DPW has made two similar requests
recently, which have been satisfactorily completed. This is additional money for similar
projects. He said that the reason for the change in the language is that they are still
checking into the benefits of retrofitting these vehicles, and if there proves to be no
benefit, there are other projects that could use this funding. Therefore, they did not
want to lock the appropriation into retrofitting buses if there would be no benefit.
Councillor Mahern said that he is glad to see this amendment in case there proves to be
no real benefit, since there are so many other ways this money could be used that are
proven to be of benefit.
Councillor Speedy asked what the language “mutually agreed upon” means, and who
the parties are that must agree. Mr. Chavez said that the US Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA), the City of Indianapolis Department of Public Works, and whichever
public entity is benefitting from the funds would be those mutually agreeing. Councillor
Speedy asked if anyone benefitting must be a public entity. Mr. Chavez replied in the
affirmative.
Councillor Abduallah moved, seconded by Councillor Cain, to “Amend” the language in
Proposal No. 571, 2005 as per Mr. Chavez’s recommendation. The motion carried by a
vote of 5-0.
Councillor Mahern moved, seconded by Councillor Cain, to send Proposal No. 571,
2005 to the full Council with a “Do Pass As Amended” recommendation. The motion
carried by a vote of 5-0.
CITIZEN’S GAS PRESENTATION – John Whitaker, Senior Vice President
John Whitaker, Senior Vice President of Legal and Corporate Affairs for Citizen’s Gas,
introduced Greg Sawyers, Director of Customer Service. Mr. Whitaker stated that the
Committee is aware of the fluctuating and rising cost of gas over the last year. He said
that unlike service stations, however, utility companies are regulated by the Indiana
Regulatory Commission, and therefore they cannot raise prices indiscriminately to make
a profit. He said that Citizen’s Gas’ projected price increase is 27%, which is still quite a
bit lower than the national (48%) and midwest (55%) average increase. Mr. Sawyers
explained several programs to help customers manage their bills. He said that the
Home Assistance Program helps low income families, and 14,000 customers took

Public Works Committee
November 10, 2005
Page 9
advantage of this program last year. He said that the Governor has increased this
assistance this year, and they hope in turn to help even more.
Councillor Mahern asked what the best number to call is if a person needs asssistance
or needs to sign up for one of these payment programs. Mr. Sawyers suggested they
call 317-924-3311. Councillor Cain asked if this number will direct an individual to a
live person, or if they will be given messages. Mr. Sawyers said that they may have to
press a few buttons based on the nature of their call to get to the right person to help
them, but they will get to speak to a live person. Mr. Whitaker said that there are 50 to
60 people on the phones at the peak of the day.
Mr. Whitaker explained other programs Citizen’s Gas offers, such as the Universal
Service Program, Warm Heart Warm Home, flexible payment arrangements, keeping
customers connected, keeping deposits manageable, and outreach to inactive
accounts.
Chair Conley asked if deposits are pro-rated. Mr. Whitaker said that they will work with
the customer based on their ability to pay, their history of payment, and credit rating.
Mr. Sawyers added that they try to balance all the needs and look at each individual
differently to make it as manageable as possible.
Mr. Whitaker said that Citizen’s Gas currently has 80,000 customers on budget plans,
and they work with senior adults to arrange bills to correspond with dates they receive
pension or social security checks. He said that they now have online payment options
and other Internet tools such as the home energy advisor and bill analyzer. He said that
they try to raise customer awareness through special bill inserts, other proactive
communications, special Hispanic ads on Univision, communicating with regulators and
elected officials, and the Winter Wise Campaign with the yellow post-it note ads. He
said that a program through the Lieutenant Governor’s office works with the Heating
and Cooling trades to provide programmable thermostats to individuals who get their
heaters checked professionally each year. Mr. Whitaker said that Citizen’s Gas has two
liquified gas storage facilities, one in Beech Grove and one on the north side. He said
that by buying in increments and storing gas, they can help to mitigate spikes in cost
and keep the supply pretty stable. He said that even with the hot summer and
Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, they were still able to keep their fixed price purchases
lower than most standard indices and are taking steps to keep prices low and save
money wherever possible.
Councillor Mahern referred to the brochures available to citizens with helpful hints to
lowering gas bills. He said that these might seem like common sense, but people do
not always think of them. He encouraged citizens to call Citizen’s Gas or log onto their
website at www.citizensgas.com to find easy ways to help lower their bills.

Public Works Committee
November 10, 2005
Page 10
Mr. Whitaker said that gas prices have mitigated a bit in the last few months, but natural
gas supplies are still low and probably will not go back up. He said that the mild fall
weather has been a benefit in keeping costs down and saving on supplies.
Councillor Mahern thanked Citizen’s Gas for working hard to get the word out on their
various programs to the community. Chair Conley thanked Citizen’s Gas for their
community spirit and thanked Mr. Whitaker and Mr. Sawyers for taking time to attend
this meeting to provide the Committee and the public with more information.
There being no further business, and upon motion duly made, the meeting was
adjourned at 6:41 p.m.
Respectfully Submitted,

LOCAL HOMESTEAD CREDIT REVIEW COMMISSION
The Local Homestead Credit Review Commission, created by the City-County Council,
met on Monday, June 3, 2013 at the Library Services Center, 2450 N. Meridian Street.
Co-Chair Beth Henkel (Local Attorney, former Department of Local Government and
Finance Commissioner) called the meeting to order at 6:03 p.m. with the following
members present: Co-Chair James Steele (former City Controller and former Chief
Financial Officer for the City-County Council), City-County Councillor Vop Osili, Chris
Pryor (Metropolitan Indianapolis Board of Realtors-MIBOR), City- County Councillor
Jack Sandlin, Dan Sellers (Chief Financial Officer for the Health and Hospital
Corporation), and Jeff Spalding (former City Controller, serving as Controller’s
Designee). City-County Councillor Pamela Hickman (proxy for Councillor Frank
Mascari) and Joseph O’Connor (Marion County Assessor/County Commissioner)
arrived shortly thereafter. City-County Councillor Robert Lutz was absent. General
Counsel Fred Biesecker, Chief Financial Officer Hope Tribble, and Fiscal and Policy
Analyst Ryan Kramer represented Council staff.
Co-Chair Henkel asked commission members to introduce themselves and indicate the
entity they represent on the commission.
Co-Chair Henkel explained how the commission was formed and the process they will
be undertaking. She explained the objectives of the commission and explained the
timeline to finalize recommendations to the City-County Council by June 27, 2013. The
recommendations will be presented in the form of a proposal for the Council to then
consider during their normal committee process, with a decision before the budget
proposal is submitted in mid-August. Co-Chair Henkel stated that there is a two-page
handout that attendees received upon entering the meeting which details the objectives
of the commission, lists its members and meeting dates, and provides a website
address where all information presented this evening is posted, along with some
supplemental information. She said that there is also an application on the website that
allows a taxpayer to enter their parcel number and compare their current property tax
bill to a possible future bill should the HSC be eliminated. This application will show the
taxpayer whether or not there will be any dollar change on their tax bill, should an
elimination take place.
{Clerk’s Note: Councillor Hickman arrived at 6:07 p.m.}
Co-Chair Henkel said that there will be two presentations offered this evening to detail
the City’s current budget situation and explain the homestead credit (HSC). The first
presentation will be offered by the City Controller and will give a brief overview of the
City’s finances and revenue streams. The second presentation will be offered by Policy
Analytics, LLC, a local fiscal research and analysis firm, and will explain the HSC, what
it is, how it was created, and what will happen to individual property tax bills and other
units of government if it is eliminated.
Jason Dudich, City Controller, Office of Finance and Management (OFM), provided a
2013 Fiscal Review of the Consolidated City of Indianapolis and Marion County.

{Clerk’s Note: A copy of this presentation, along with all other presentations and
handouts, can be found on the Council’s Local Homestead Credit Review Commission’s
web page: http://www.indy.gov/eGov/Council/ Committees/Pages/Local-HomesteadCredit-Review-Commission.aspx.} Mr. Dudich stated that the City and County has a
roughly $1 billion budget, and the General Fund makes up approximately 54% of that
total budget at almost $540 million. He said roughly 84% of that total General Fund
operating budget comes from property tax or income tax revenue. The major income
tax revenue is generated by a 1.62% tax rate for Marion County, which is broken into
different pieces: the County Option Income Tax (COIT), the public safety tax, and the
property tax levy freeze. That income tax is allocated through a formula determined by
State law as to how much goes to the City of Indianapolis, Marion County and other
taxing units such as excluded cities. He reviewed the income tax revenue trends, with
some growth from 2008 to 2010, and then a drop from 2011 to 2013. He said that this
drop is related to the economic downturn, as well as a delay in property tax distribution.
He said that the way these taxes are distributed may not match the the current
economic trend, as they lag behind a year to two years in distribution.
{Clerk’s Note: Assessor O’Connor arrived at 6:18 p.m.}
Mr. Dudich stated that the City and County have lost $164 million accumulatively in
revenue over the past few years, and they need to take action to try and maintain the
fiscal stability of the City. He said that while the surrounding counties have increased
their percentage of personal income in comparison with the total State income, Marion
County has remained relatively the same, and actually decreased a bit, in relation to the
overall percentage of personal income for the State of Indiana. They are trying to drive
that percentage up and encourage more citizens to stay in Marion County, so that more
dollars stay in the City. He said that property tax is the other major source of revenue
for the General Fund, which is affected by the fire consolidations, collections and the
circuit breaker, and it has remained relatively steady. He said that it is a daunting
picture that the City and County is realizing, and little to no growth in revenue sources
places a burden on the City to lower expenditures and deplete fund balances. While
they are assuming a slight uptake in revenue in 2014, that is not guaranteed, and will
still not bring them to previous revenue levels. Even with some one-time revenue
sources and reductions in expenditures, they are still faced with a structural deficit of
approximately $62.3 million at the end of 2013, with $26.2 million in cash on hand; and
a $55.5 million deficit projected for the end of 2014, with $29.3 million on hand. These
numbers do not assume the elimination of the homestead credit. He said that currently,
$12.5 million of COIT distribution is set aside off the top for the local homestead credit.
The elimination of the local homestead credit would allow that $12.5 million of COIT to
be put into the formula for tax distribution and would provide almost $8.3 million in
potential on-going revenue to the General Fund without an increase in income taxes.
He said that there will be a minimal impact on property tax for those homeowners who
are below the cap or are part of a referendum. Mr. Dudich concluded that while the
elimination of the homestead credit would not fix all their problems or solve the deficit,

Local Homestead Credit Review Commission
June 3, 2013
Page 3
they need to look at all options available to them and look at the issue holistically with all
the tools they have at their disposal.
Jason O’Neill, Policy Analytics, LLC, provided commission members and citizens with
an overview, history and analysis of the Local Homestead Credit, which is available to
an owner-occupied dwelling or residence. An individual can only claim HSC on one
property, the home which is their primary residence. Mr. O’Neill stated that they are
speaking specifically of the COIT homestead credit, which does not include the Stateadministered homestead deduction or the smaller Local Option Income Tax (LOIT)
homestead credit. He said that HSCs become property tax revenue to be distributed to
all units in the County that levy property taxes, and essentially replace a portion of the
property taxes that residential taxpayers would otherwise pay. Mr. O’Neill said that
eliminating the HSC will shift approximately $12.8 million in COIT revenue into
spendable general revenues for certain civil units. He reviewed the impact of
eliminating the credit on taxing units that experience a net revenue increase, as well as
those that experience circuit breaker losses. He explained that taxpayers already at
their circuit breaker maximum will see no impact, while taxpayers below that maximum
and those subject to a school referendum fund levy will see an increase in varying
degrees. Mr. O’Neill gave some examples of different elimination scenarios. The
property tax increase with an elimination of HSC would be less than $30 annually for
81% of Marion County homeowners. He gave some analyses of taxpayer liability on
different-priced parcels in different townships. He concluded by showing a map with a
County overview of the impact of removing the HSC, and said that the website also
shows a breakdown of that impact by township.
Co-Chair Henkel said that she knows this is a lot of information to digest in one sitting,
as she has heard these presentations four times, now, and is finally beginning to
understand it. She said that this is basically $12.5 million of COIT money that has been
taken out of one tax bucket and put into another bucket of tax money, that of property
taxes. She said that this has been done to provide some relief and reduce some
homestead taxes. To eliminate the homestead credit, the City is proposing that these
COIT dollars not be taken out of the income tax bucket. She said that COIT revenue
goes to fund the City and County, and other excluded and included cities and towns; but
not to schools, and not much to the townships. Whereas, property tax revenue goes to
all those entities, including schools and townships. So, some tax-supported units would
lose revenue with this shift, while others would benefit from such a change. .
Councillor Sandlin asked since the State now funds most of the operating budgets of
schools, what these lost property tax revenues would be going toward in the schools,
where a loss might be felt. Mr. O’Neill said that the property tax reforms in 2008 shifted
the full responsibility for funding school operations to the State, so that these operations
are no longer property tax-supported and are funded out of the State budget. There are
some aspects of school funding, however, that are still funded through property taxes:
debt service, transportation, bus replacement, pension debt, and capital projects.

Local Homestead Credit Review Commission
June 3, 2013
Page 4
Those are therefore the areas where the schools will be hit if there is a reduction in their
property tax revenue.
Councillor Sandlin added that Channel 16 is taping and broadcasting each of these
community meetings, so if attendees are finding everything hard to digest in one sitting,
they can go to the indygov website and watch broadcasts of the meetings to get a better
understanding of all the issues.
Mr. Spalding asked how the advent of tax caps changed how the homestead credit
works. Mr. O’Neill said that before the circuit breaker went into effect, this elimination
would not have had a negative impact on taxing units. Taxpayers would pay that
amount and there would be no revenue reductions for taxing units. Because some
taxpayers are already maxed out with regard to the circuit breaker, there is some
potential for revenue reductions for taxing units. Mr. O’Neill added that before the circuit
breaker went into effect, 100% of the revenue in the HSC was used to reduce property
taxes for homeowners. Again, since some taxpayers are maxed out with regard to the
circuit breaker, that is why some will not see much of a liability reduction, because they
are already at the limit. Mr. Spalding said that the reality is that with the tax caps in
place, this income tax revenue that is distributed like property tax ends up being an
appropriation out to taxing units by continuing to have the credit function as it does.
Co-Chair Henkel asked for public testimony.
Tom Glass, Wayne Township resident, said that his focus is more about how the City
and County are spending his tax dollars, rather than the source of revenue streams. He
said that he believes they are going the wrong way in their spending. Councillor
Hickman asked if Mr. Glass has specific expenditures to which he is referring. Mr.
Glass said that it is the City’s spending in general, and he has nothing specific to share
at this time.
Paul Carpenter-Wilson, budget director for the Indianapolis Public Schools (IPS), said
that the elimination of the homestead credit will further burden township schools and
libraries who are already struggling because of limited revenue sources. He said that
this will also create an increase of taxes for over 75% of homeowners in Marion County.
At the schools, this action will affect capital projects and transportation. Because they
have to pay their debt service out of these funds, there will then be less money to
maintain their buildings and provide safe transportation for students. He said that times
are hard economically for all of Marion County, and the schools and other taxing units
are having to reduce their expenses, because there is no other revenue available to
fund everything they would like to do. He said that the City has had three meetings to
urge cooperation among all taxing units; yet the discussion of eliminating this credit flies
in the face of such cooperation, because it places the burden on some, while easing it
on others. He urged the commission not to support the elimination of the HSC.

Local Homestead Credit Review Commission

Jim Haworth, resident, stated that he has no real specific questions or comments, but
that he agrees with the comments made by Mr. Carpenter-Wilson.
Samuel Murray, resident, said that he opposes the elimination of the HSC, because it is
not clear how it will affect property taxes for those who are lucky enough in these
economic times to still have their homes. He said without more information about how it
will affect them, this elimination would not be fair to homeowners. He said that some of
the terminology used is confusing to him, and he cannot really digest it all in one
meeting to respond appropriately, and he would like more time to become familiar with
the information. He asked what would cause a taxpayer to pay at a rate that is below
the 1%. Co-Chair Henkel said that it is mostly because of the standard deduction and
the supplemental deduction. Co-Chair Steele said that the standard deduction is 60%
of the first $75,000 assessed valuation, which is $45,000. If a house was assessed at
$75,000, they would first subtract the $45,000. Then they would get a supplemental
deduction of 35% of the value between $45,000 and $75,000. Those deductions take
the net assessed value down to such a point that the tax rate times that net assessed
value would be less than 1% of the gross assessed valuation. Co-Chair Henkel said
that this was a very good question, because there is nowhere in Marion County where
the rate is less than 1%; but by factoring in all those deductions, it could very well be.
Mr. Spalding added that because of the nature of that deduction, it ends up taking off a
bigger percentage of the assessed value of lower valued homes than of a higher valued
home.
Mr. Murray asked how the change in parking affects this. Mr. Dudich said that the
parking fee revenue is deposited into a separate dedicated fund for roads, curbs,
sidewalks and other infrastructure, and is not part of this discussion. That revenue
does, however, help to address infrastructure needs that may free up funds for other
uses. Mr. Murray asked if public safety is a recipient of those parking fee revenues. Mr.
Dudich responded in the negative. Councillor Sandlin said that the parking revenue that
comes in goes to pay for streets and sidewalks where parking meters are located. Prior
to the parking meter agreement, the City generated very little cash flow out of parking
because what revenue did come in was used for personnel, maintenance and
administration of those meters. He said that there is now less money spent out of the
General Fund for those costs, thereby freeing up money to go to other things, like public
safety. Co-Chair Steele said that the revenues that are mostly available for public
safety are from property and income taxes, along with some fees they may charge.
Sheila Walkup, resident, said that while $28 to $33 seems insignificant at first glance,
they are not looking at the big picture, because this increase only compounds the
current economic climate for citizens. Everything else is going up, too, like gas prices,
and utilities, and this is just another item that adds to that problem. She said that they
need to look at a way to have churches, universities and other non-profits pay 10%,
instead of having individual homeowners bear all the brunt of taxation.

Mary Hasenst, Meridian Highland Association, said that universities like Indiana
University-Purdue University of Indianapolis (IUPUI) has had a lot of devlelopment, with
billions of dollars invested, as have the hospitals; and she asked why they cannot get
some contribution from them, as they also use public services. She asked if all the
charter schools being added also increases taxes. Co-Chair Henkel said that they
would have to have a change in State law to tax tax-exempt entities like churches and
universities. She said that the Council does not have the power or authority to enact
such taxation. Mr. Spalding said that the charter schools help keep people in
Indianapolis because they provide families with more educational options. This, in turn,
would help increase income tax revenue, because the more working families staying
within the County help contribute to those revenues. He said that this is one way
charters help to build and increase the income tax revenue in Marion County.
Mr. Murray said that there seems to be a trend developing with more of the City’s higher
paid employees living outside of Marion County. Therefore, their income taxes go to
surrounding counties, but this places the burden of taxes and paying for public services
on lower-paid residents in Marion County. He asked why they do not consider an
occupation tax for those working in the County, but living outside county lines. Co-Chair
Henkel said that this is again a matter for the State to decide. Mr. Spalding said that all
local government units are a subdivision of State government, and all taxing structure is
set by the State. The State then gives the local governmental units tools to use to
manage their tax revenue as best they can. Mr. Murray asked if the City can make
recommendations to the State. Mr. Spalding said they can, and that has been done on
a regular basis. Co-Chair Henkel said that some surrounding counties, by adopting the
LOIT available to them, have kept some of these employees from helping to fund
Marion County. She said that all LOIT goes to the County that adopts it, and those
income tax revenues go to the County a person lives in. This is the statutory structure
that has been set up by the State. Councillor Hickman said that it could go in the
opposite direction, and folks could live in Marion County and work in another county.
Mr. Murray said that this does not allow for those who regularly use the County’s
infrastructure and public services to pay into it, and that is not fair for the residents to
bear that full burden. Councillor Hickman said that many people feel as Mr. Murray
does and there has been a lot of discussion on this issue at the State Legislature.
Councillor Sandlin said that at a previous meeting they discussed researching a list of
properties in Marion County that are not on the tax rolls. Co-Chair Henkel said that
Policy Analytics is working on that, but it is hard to get a true picture because most of
these properties are not assessed. Assessor O’Connor said that it is tricky, because
some of the properties are non-taxable, while others are tax-exempt. It is hard to gauge
the full effect, because some of these sport stadiums or hospitals are taking prime real
estate spots that would normally be taxed. He said that he is not advocating for or
against a use tax, but the posture at the General Assembly seems to be going against
that for whatever reason. He said that previous to last year, a State government agency
leasing space in a private landlord building would have been denied an exemption
because the rent money was going to a private landlord. However, last year the State

passed a law that reversed that, and if the lessee is a government entity, they would
qualify for an exemption. Therefore, the posture of the General Assembly seems to be
against this suggestion, but citizen reaction and input could possibly change that.
Dan Henkel, resident, said that many of the comments and questions suggest that
many of these stakeholders are very interested in the general area of finance and
taxation issues. He said that this commission has a real task to keep the focus on this
one specific issue, when there is so much interest, in general, on revenue and tax
issues.
Co-Chair Henkel thanked everyone for their comments and said that this indeed is not
an easy decision, as there are many layers to this issue to consider.
Councillor Hickman said that she found the presentations very helpful, even though she
agrees some words are difficult to understand. She said that the misconception is that
this only affects homeowners, but she wants it to be clear that schools and other units
will also feel some impact.
Mr. Dudich said that there are some things that could be studied to help mitigate the
impact on other local units, and as part of the commission’s recommendation, they
might want to discuss and identify some ways that could be done.
Co-Chair Henkel said that in addition to the last two commission community meetings,
Councillor Marilyn Pfisterer will be hosting one additional meeting on June 18, 2013 at
7:30 p.m. at Ben Davis High School. She said that this would be one more opportunity,
after this series of community meetings, for some additional information, so that it will be
fresh in their minds when they meet to make recommendations on June 24th. She said
that tomorrow evening’s meeting will be at the Fay Biccard Glick Neighborhood Center,
2990 W. 71st Street, at 6:00 p.m. Co-Chair Steele thanked the Library for the use of
their facility this evening.
There being no further business, and upon motion duly made, the meeting was
adjourned at 7:34 p.m.
Respectfully Submitted,
