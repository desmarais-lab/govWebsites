The City of Indianapolis and Marion County
Information Services Agency
Seeks Responses to this Request for Qualifications for Professional Services Regarding
Indy.gov Redesign: Web Content Management Solution Training

Proposals Due: Monday February 20, 2017 at 12:00 Noon EST
1. General Information
1.1. Statement of Purpose
The City of Indianapolis and Marion County through the Information Services Agency, herein
referred to as “ISA”, seeks responses to this Request for Qualifications (RFQ) regarding the
contents herein. ISA is looking for a qualified firm to provide training for the new web content
management solution for the website at Indy.Gov.
1.2. Agency Background
ISA is the enterprise provider of all aspects of Information Technology service, strategy and
solutions for Indianapolis and Marion County governmental units. ISA works with 8,500
customers across 45 departments and agencies at 126 different site locations.
1.3. Overall Project Background
ISA is working to advance a number of strategic initiatives, partnering with City/County
departments and agencies to better provide services to citizens. One of these initiative is to redesign the Indy.gov website. Indy.gov is to undergo a full re-design with an eye to providing a
highly citizen centric experience.
The last overhaul of the web site took place in 2011. Digital technologies have advanced such
that the current site is not conducive to a true modern day end-user experience.
The project will convene up to five vendors to deliver the new Indy.Gov. ISA will engage firms
to participate in the following six key functions of this undertaking:

* Please note that website Design and Development is already provided through our
Application Services vendor, and will not be put out to bid.
Design and development efforts will follow an agile approach. A pilot site is to be live by
5/31/17. This first iteration of the pilot site will enable three selected constituent services.
Subsequent cycles of the pilot site will build upon the number of live services offered. This
approach will gain attention of constituents and drive the growth of traffic to the new version
while phasing out use of the current site. Under this cyclical methodology it is anticipated the
current Indy.gov site will be retired in approximately 18 months. This will accommodate
sufficient ramp-up time to fully develop the capabilities of the pilot site.

1.4. How this RFQ Relates to the Overall Project
This RFQ seeks a qualified vendor to develop a training program to instruct end users on the
new web content management solution implemented as part of the Indy.gov redesign. The
vendor shall create a custom and comprehensive training program to enable end users to be
successful at maintaining agency and department website content. The program should
include instructor led training, as well as self-paced video training and end user
documentation, for both current and future end users.
We expect each firm, whether charged with marketing, design, testing or training to conduct
their own robust measure of project management and report upwards to the overarching
project management vendor.
1.5. Questions
Questions pertaining to this RFQ should be directed to the ISA Contracts Administrator, Ed
Klaunig, by email at Ed.Klaunig@indy.gov by Monday, February 6, 2017 at 12:00 Noon EST.
Questions and answers will be posted online as an addendum to the RFQ at the following web
address:
http://www.indy.gov/eGov/County/ISA/Requests/Pages/ISA%20RFPS%20and%20RFQs.aspx
Depending on the volume and complexity of questions, the addendum will be posted no later
than Friday February 10, 2017 11:59 PM EST.

certifies that it is now and will remain in good standing with such governmental agencies
and that it is now and will maintain its license, permit, registration, authorization, or
certification, as applicable, in force during the term of this Agreement. Failure of Contractor
to comply with this paragraph shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement.
5.04 Confidentiality.
5.04.1 The obligations of this section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and

services as directed pending resolution of such dispute, or if it fails to make
payments to subcontractors employed by it, or if it otherwise violates or fails to
perform any term, covenant or provision of this Agreement, then City may, without
prejudice to any other right or remedy, terminate this Agreement in whole or in
part, in writing, provided that Contractor shall be given (1) not less than ten (10)
calendar days written notice of City’s intent to terminate, and (2) an opportunity for

not in default, the termination shall be deemed to have been made for the

price adjustment shall be Contractor’s sole remedy and recovery.

not forthcoming through failure of any entity to appropriate funds or otherwise, then City

respect to all covenants of this Agreement; except as otherwise provided herein, Contractor

5.23 Debarment and Suspension
5.23.1 Contractor certifies, by entering into this Agreement, that neither it nor its principals
are presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, declared ineligible,
or voluntarily excluded from or ineligible for participation in any Federal assistance
program by any Federal department or agency, or by any department, agency or
political subdivision of the State of Indiana. The term “principal” for purposes of

debarment, declared ineligible, has been included on a list or received notice of

programs by any Federal department or agency, or by any department, agency or

the violation within the thirty (30) day period, City shall terminate the contract for
breach of contract.
If City terminates the contract, Contractor shall, in addition to any other contractual
remedies, be liable to City for actual damages. There is a rebuttable presumption
18

that Contractor did not knowingly employ an unauthorized alien if Contractor
verified the work eligibility status of the employee through the Program.

Contractor may terminate its contract with the subcontractor for such violation.
5.24.4 Pursuant to IC 22-5-1.7 a fully executed affidavit affirming that the business entity
does not knowingly employ an unauthorized alien and confirming Contractors
enrollment in the Program, unless the Program no longer exists, shall be filed with
City prior to the execution of this Agreement. This Agreement shall not be deemed
fully executed until such affidavit is filed with the City.
5.25 Key Persons. The parties agree that the work described in this Agreement to be performed
by Contractor is a personal service, highly professional in nature, and that the identity of the
individual who is to be personally responsible for such work is of prime importance to City.
The parties therefore agree that in the event of the death or disability of Contractor, or, if
Contractor is a firm, partnership, or corporation, in the event of the death, or disability or
termination of employment of anyone understood to be personally responsible for the work
described in this Agreement, City may, without penalty and in its discretion, terminate this
Agreement, and make its own new Agreement with any other party for completion of the
work herein described.
5.26 Ban the Box. Contractor acknowledges Sections 671-102 to 671-108 of the Revised Code
of the Consolidated City of Indianapolis and Marion County and will make available its
policies, practices and standards for the hiring of applicants with prior criminal convictions
upon the City’s request.

5.27 Electronic Signature. Contractor and City agree to signature both in counterparts and by
facsimile.
5.28 Post-Employment Restrictions. Contractor, providing supplies, real property, or services
under this Agreement, certifies to City that no employee, contract employee, or subcontractor of Contractor:
5.28.1 Participated in any way in the solicitation, negotiation, or awarding of this
Agreement while previously employed by an agency of the City of Indianapolis or
Marion County for a period of one (1) year prior to the execution of this Agreement;

19

former agency has consented to the employee’s performance for Contractor in

Consolidated City of Indianapolis and Marion County, regarding the solicitation,
negotiation, awarding, or performance of this Agreement;

agency of the City of Indianapolis or Marion County; and

(1) year of this Agreement and currently has the performance of lobbying activity
(as that term is defined in Section 909-101 of the Revised Code of the
Consolidated City of Indianapolis and Marion County) related to an agency or an
official as a responsibility of his or her employment or contractual relationship with
Contractor.
Violation of this certification shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement and, upon
such a violation, City may terminate this Agreement. In addition, upon a violation of this
certification, City shall report such violation to the Office of Corporation Counsel who may,
at its discretion, debar Contractor from eligibility for future city and/or county purchasing,
bids, contracts, and/or projects.
5.29 Method of Payment. Contractor shall accept invoice payments via City/County check,
City/County Purchasing Card (Master Card) or Automated Clearing House (ACH) at the

this Agreement. Contractor shall not be relieved of liability to City for damages
sustained by virtue of any breach of this Agreement. City may withhold payment due
or that may become due to Contractor as set-off for any damages due City. If City’s
damages exceed the amount of payment due or that may become due, Contractor
shall pay City the excess. City’s right of set-off shall not limit its other remedies
available under this Agreement or as provided by applicable law.

unauthorized alien or retain an employee or contract with a person that Contractor or
its subcontractor subsequently learns is an unauthorized alien. If Contractor violates
this Section 4.21, City shall require Contractor to remedy the violation not later than
thirty (30) days after City notifies Contractor. If Contractor fails to remedy the violation
within the thirty (30) day period, City shall terminate the contract for breach of
contract. If City terminates the contract, Contractor shall, in addition to any other

Contractor that the subcontractor does not knowingly employ or contract with an

Contractor determines that a subcontractor is in violation of this Section 4.21,
Contractor may terminate its contract with the subcontractor for such violation.
4.21.4 Pursuant to IC 22-5-1.7 a fully executed affidavit affirming that the business entity
does not knowingly employ an unauthorized alien and confirming Contractors
enrollment in the Program, unless the Program no longer exists, shall be filed with
City prior to the execution of this Agreement. This Agreement shall not be deemed
fully executed until such affidavit is filed with the City.
4.22

term is defined in Section 909-101 of the Revised Code of the Consolidated City of
Indianapolis and Marion County) related to an agency or an official as a responsibility
of his or her employment or contractual relationship with Contractor.
Violation of this certification shall constitute a material breach of the Agreement and, upon
such a violation, City may terminate this Agreement. In addition, upon a violation of this
certification, City shall report such violation to the Office of Corporation Counsel who may, at
its discretion, debar Contractor from eligibility for future city and/or county purchasing, bids,
contracts, and/or projects.
4.25

Supersession

all prior agreements, written or verbal, between City and Contractor. No statements,
promises or agreements whatsoever, in writing or verbal, in conflict with the terms of the
Agreement have been made by City or Contractor which in any way modify, vary, alter,
enlarge or invalidate any of the provisions and obligations herein stated. This
Agreement may be amended and modified only in writing signed by both City and
Contractor.

RFQ-51ISA-17-01
INFORMATION SERVICES AGENCY
200 East Washington Street, Suite 1942
Indianapolis, IN 46204

The City of Indianapolis and Marion County
Information Services Agency
Seeks Responses to this Request for Qualifications for Professional Services Regarding
Indy.gov Redesign: Testing

Proposals Due: Monday February 20, 2017 at 12:00 Noon EST
1. General Information
1.1. Statement of Purpose
The City of Indianapolis and Marion County through the Information Services Agency, herein
referred to as “ISA”, seeks responses to this Request for Qualifications (RFQ) regarding the
contents herein. ISA is looking for a qualified vendor to provide testing services for our
Website re-design project.
1.2. Agency Background
ISA is the enterprise provider of all aspects of Information Technology service, strategy and
solutions for Indianapolis and Marion County governmental units. ISA works with 8,500
customers across 45 departments and agencies at 126 different site locations.
1.3. Overall Project Background
ISA is working to advance a number of strategic initiatives, partnering with City/County
departments and agencies to better provide services to citizens. One of these initiative is to redesign the Indy.gov website. Indy.gov is to undergo a full re-design with an eye to providing a
highly citizen centric experience.
The last overhaul of the web site took place in 2011. Digital technologies have advanced such
that the current site is not conducive to a true modern day end-user experience.
The project will convene up to five vendors to deliver the new Indy.Gov. ISA will engage firms
to participate in the following six key functions of this undertaking:

* Please note that website Design and Development is already provided through our
Application Services vendor, and will not be put out to bid.
Design and development efforts will follow an agile approach. A pilot site is to be live by
5/31/17. This first iteration of the pilot site will enable three selected constituent services.
Subsequent cycles of the pilot site will build upon the number of live services offered. This
approach will gain attention of constituents and drive the growth of traffic to the new version
while phasing out use of the current site. Under this cyclical methodology it is anticipated the
current Indy.gov site will be retired in approximately 18 months. This will accommodate
sufficient ramp-up time to fully develop the capabilities of the pilot site.

1.4. How this RFQ Relates to the Overall Project
This RFQ seeks a qualified vendor to develop, plan, and execute a comprehensive testing
regiment and feedback loop that will ensure the integrity of the new Indy.Gov Website and
Web Services. This testing will include, at minimum, the testing of the following:
 API viability and adherence
 Integrations
 Load
 Performance
 Compliance
 Accessibility
 Functional
 Usability or User Experience
 Cross browser and browser version compatibility
 Mobile devices (iOS, Windows, and Android phones and tablets)
Selected vendor will be responsible for planning, leading and documenting UAT findings.
Vendor will manage the defect remediation feedback loop to the Dev team via the designated
project manager(s), or established channels, until all discrepancies find proper resolution, and
complete user acceptance is achieved.
We expect each firm, whether charged with marketing, design, testing or training to conduct
their own robust measure of project management and report upwards to the overarching
project management vendor.

SECTION V. GENERAL PROVISIONS
5.01

Independent Contractor. The parties agree that Contractor is an independent contractor
as that term is commonly used and is not an employee of the Consolidated City of
Indianapolis and/or Marion County. As such, Contractor is solely responsible for all taxes
and none shall be withheld from the sums paid to Contractor. Contractor acknowledges
that it is not insured in any manner by City for any loss of any kind whatsoever.
Contractor has no authority, express or implied, to bind or obligate City in any way.

assign or delegate any portion of this Agreement or the services to be performed
hereunder without prior written approval of City. In the event that City approves of
any such subcontracting, assignment or delegation, Contractor shall remain solely
responsible for managing, directing and paying the person or persons to whom
such responsibilities or obligations are sublet, assigned or delegated. City shall
have no obligation whatsoever toward such persons. Contractor shall take sole
responsibility for the quality and quantity of any services rendered by such
persons. Any consent given in accordance with this provision shall not be
construed to relieve Contractor of any responsibility for performing under this
Agreement.

Enterprises in the performance of services under this Agreement; or
Demonstrate a good faith effort to achieve such percentages, in compliance with

certifies that it is now and will remain in good standing with such governmental agencies
and that it is now and will maintain its license, permit, registration, authorization, or
certification, as applicable, in force during the term of this Agreement. Failure of Contractor
to comply with this paragraph shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement.
5.04 Confidentiality.
5.04.1 The obligations of this section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and
shall be applicable to the full extent permissible under statutes governing access
to public records. Contractor understands that the information provided to it or

known by Contractor at the time it was received; (b) is, as of the time of its
disclosure or thereafter becomes, part of the public domain through a source other
than Contractor; (c) is made known to Contractor by a third person who does not
impose any obligation of confidence on Contractor with respect to such

independently developed by Contractor without references to the confidential
information.

by, or on behalf of, City that is required to be kept confidential by City pursuant to

information and will post the Agreement on the City of Indianapolis website as
required by Section 141-105 of the Revised Code of the Consolidated City of
Indianapolis and Marion County. Use by the public of any document or the
information contained therein shall not be considered an act of City.

directly pertinent to performance of services under this Agreement. Contractor shall make
such materials available at its offices at all reasonable times during the Agreement period

Any such event shall be cause for termination of this Agreement as provided
herein.
5.23.4 Contractor shall not subcontract with any party which is debarred or suspended or
is otherwise excluded from or ineligible for participation in any Federal assistance
programs by any Federal department or agency, or by any department, agency or
political subdivision of the State of Indiana.
5.24 Compliance With E-Verify Program. Pursuant to IC 22-5-1.7, Contractor shall enroll in and
verify the work eligibility status of all newly hired employees of Contractor through the EVerify Program (“Program”). Contractor is not required to verify the work eligibility status of
all newly hired employees through the Program if the Program no longer exists.
5.24.1 Contractor and its subcontractors shall not knowingly employ or contract with an
unauthorized alien or retain an employee or contract with a person that Contractor
or its subcontractor subsequently learns is an unauthorized alien. If Contractor
violates this Section 5.24, City shall require Contractor to remedy the violation not
later than thirty (30) days after City notifies Contractor. If Contractor fails to remedy
the violation within the thirty (30) day period, City shall terminate the contract for
breach of contract.
If City terminates the contract, Contractor shall, in addition to any other contractual
remedies, be liable to City for actual damages. There is a rebuttable presumption
21

that Contractor did not knowingly employ an unauthorized alien if Contractor
verified the work eligibility status of the employee through the Program.
5.24.2 If Contractor employs or contracts with an unauthorized alien but City determines
that terminating the contract would be detrimental to the public interest or public
property, City may allow the contract to remain in effect until City procures a new
contractor.
5.24.3 Contractor shall, prior to performing any work, require each subcontractor to certify
to Contractor that the subcontractor does not knowingly employ or contract with an
unauthorized alien and has enrolled in the Program. Contractor shall maintain on
file a certification from each subcontractor throughout the duration of the Project. If
Contractor determines that a subcontractor is in violation of this Section 5.24,
Contractor may terminate its contract with the subcontractor for such violation.
5.24.4 Pursuant to IC 22-5-1.7 a fully executed affidavit affirming that the business entity
does not knowingly employ an unauthorized alien and confirming Contractors
enrollment in the Program, unless the Program no longer exists, shall be filed with
City prior to the execution of this Agreement. This Agreement shall not be deemed
fully executed until such affidavit is filed with the City.
5.25 Key Persons. The parties agree that the work described in this Agreement to be performed
by Contractor is a personal service, highly professional in nature, and that the identity of the
individual who is to be personally responsible for such work is of prime importance to City.
The parties therefore agree that in the event of the death or disability of Contractor, or, if
Contractor is a firm, partnership, or corporation, in the event of the death, or disability or
termination of employment of anyone understood to be personally responsible for the work
described in this Agreement, City may, without penalty and in its discretion, terminate this
Agreement, and make its own new Agreement with any other party for completion of the
work herein described.
5.26 Ban the Box. Contractor acknowledges Sections 671-102 to 671-108 of the Revised Code
of the Consolidated City of Indianapolis and Marion County and will make available its
policies, practices and standards for the hiring of applicants with prior criminal convictions
upon the City’s request.

5.27 Electronic Signature. Contractor and City agree to signature both in counterparts and by
facsimile.
5.28 Post-Employment Restrictions. Contractor, providing supplies, real property, or services
under this Agreement, certifies to City that no employee, contract employee, or subcontractor of Contractor:
5.28.1 Participated in any way in the solicitation, negotiation, or awarding of this
Agreement while previously employed by an agency of the City of Indianapolis or
Marion County for a period of one (1) year prior to the execution of this Agreement;
5.28.2 For a period of one (1) year after such employee ceased supervising the
administration or performance of this Agreement on behalf of an agency of the City
of Indianapolis or Marion County, shall perform any functions on behalf of
Contractor under this Agreement with respect to the City, unless the employee’s
22

former agency has consented to the employee’s performance for Contractor in
writing;
5.28.3 Has violated any provision of Chapter 293 of the Revised Code of the
Consolidated City of Indianapolis and Marion County, regarding the solicitation,
negotiation, awarding, or performance of this Agreement;
5.28.4 Is currently an official or deputy mayor of, or has appointing authority to, any
agency of the City of Indianapolis or Marion County; and
5.28.5 Was previously employed by the City of Indianapolis or Marion County within one
(1) year of this Agreement and currently has the performance of lobbying activity
(as that term is defined in Section 909-101 of the Revised Code of the
Consolidated City of Indianapolis and Marion County) related to an agency or an
official as a responsibility of his or her employment or contractual relationship with
Contractor.
Violation of this certification shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement and, upon
such a violation, City may terminate this Agreement. In addition, upon a violation of this
certification, City shall report such violation to the Office of Corporation Counsel who may,
at its discretion, debar Contractor from eligibility for future city and/or county purchasing,
bids, contracts, and/or projects.
5.29 Method of Payment. Contractor shall accept invoice payments via City/County check,
City/County Purchasing Card (Master Card) or Automated Clearing House (ACH) at the
City’s sole option and discretion. The City will not be responsible for any card fees or other
bank charges incurred by the Contractor.

obligation whatsoever toward such persons. Contractor shall take sole

7

remedy, terminate this Agreement in whole or in part, in writing, provided

written notice of City’s intent to terminate, and (2) an opportunity for
consultation with City prior to termination. In determining the amount of
final payment to be made to Contractor upon such termination for default,

of such other party, in respect to all covenants of this Agreement; except as

5-22-16.5.
5.23.3 Contractor shall provide immediate written notice to City if, at any time
after entering into this Agreement, Contractor learns that its certifications
were erroneous when submitted, or Contractor is debarred, suspended,
proposed for debarment, declared ineligible, has been included on a list
or received notice of intent to include on a list created pursuant to IC 522-16.5, voluntarily excluded from or becomes ineligible for participation
in any Federal assistance program. Any such event shall be cause for
termination of this Agreement as provided herein.
5.23.4 Contractor shall not subcontract with any party which is debarred or
suspended or is otherwise excluded from or ineligible for participation in

v. 2/17

11

or by any department, agency or political subdivision of the State of
Indiana.
5.24 Compliance With E-Verify Program. Pursuant to IC 22-5-1.7, Contractor shall
enroll in and verify the work eligibility status of all newly hired employees of
Contractor through the E-Verify Program (“Program”). Contractor is not required to
verify the work eligibility status of all newly hired employees through the Program if
the Program no longer exists.
5.24.1 Contractor and its subcontractors shall not knowingly employ or contract
with an unauthorized alien or retain an employee or contract with a
person that Contractor or its subcontractor subsequently learns is an
unauthorized alien. If Contractor violates this Section 5.24, City shall
require Contractor to remedy the violation not later than thirty (30) days
after City notifies Contractor. If Contractor fails to remedy the violation
within the thirty (30) day period, City shall terminate the contract for
breach of contract.
If City terminates the contract, Contractor shall, in addition to any other
contractual remedies, be liable to City for actual damages. There is a
rebuttable presumption that Contractor did not knowingly employ an
unauthorized alien if Contractor verified the work eligibility status of the
employee through the Program.
5.24.2 If Contractor employs or contracts with an unauthorized alien but City
determines that terminating the contract would be detrimental to the
public interest or public property, City may allow the contract to remain in
effect until City procures a new contractor.
5.24.3 Contractor shall, prior to performing any work, require each subcontractor
to certify to Contractor that the subcontractor does not knowingly employ
or contract with an unauthorized alien and has enrolled in the Program.
Contractor shall maintain on file a certification from each subcontractor
throughout the duration of the Project. If Contractor determines that a
subcontractor is in violation of this Section 5.24, Contractor may terminate
its contract with the subcontractor for such violation.
5.24.4 Pursuant to IC 22-5-1.7 a fully executed affidavit affirming that the
business entity does not knowingly employ an unauthorized alien and
confirming Contractor’s enrollment in the Program, unless the Program no
longer exists, shall be filed with City prior to the execution of this
Agreement. This Agreement shall not be deemed fully executed until
such affidavit is filed with the City.
5.25 Key Persons. The parties agree that the work described in this Agreement to be
performed by Contractor is a personal service, highly professional in nature, and
that the identity of the individual who is to be personally responsible for such work
is of prime importance to City. The parties therefore agree that in the event of the
death or disability of Contractor, or, if Contractor is a firm, partnership, or
corporation, in the event of the death, or disability or termination of employment of
anyone understood to be personally responsible for the work described in this
Agreement, City may, without penalty and in its discretion, terminate this
v. 2/17

12

Agreement, and make its own new Agreement with any other party for completion
of the work herein described.
5.26 Electronic Signature. Contractor and City agree to signature both in counterparts
and by facsimile.
5.27 Post-Employment Restrictions. Contractor, providing supplies, real property, or
services under this Agreement, certifies to City that no employee, contract
employee, or sub-contractor of Contractor:
5.27.1 Participated in any way in the solicitation, negotiation, or awarding of this
Agreement while previously employed by an agency of the City of
Indianapolis or Marion County for a period of one (1) year prior to the
execution of this Agreement;
5.27.2 For a period of one (1) year after such employee ceased supervising the
administration or performance of this contract or agreement on behalf of
an agency of the City of Indianapolis or Marion County, shall perform any
functions on behalf of Contractor under the contract or agreement with
respect to the City, unless the employee’s former agency has consented
to the employee’s performance for Contractor in writing;
5.27.3 Has violated any provision of Chapter 293 of the Revised Code of the
Consolidated City of Indianapolis and Marion County, regarding the
solicitation, negotiation, awarding, or performance of this Agreement;
5.27.4 Is currently an official or deputy mayor of, or has appointing authority to,
any agency of the City of Indianapolis or Marion County; and
5.27.5 Was previously employed by the City of Indianapolis or Marion County
within one (1) year of this Agreement and currently has the performance
of lobbying activity (as that term is defined in Section 909-101 of the
Revised Code of the Consolidated City of Indianapolis and Marion
County) related to an agency or an official as a responsibility of his or her
employment or contractual relationship with Contractor.
Violation of this certification shall constitute a material breach of the Agreement
and, upon such a violation, City may terminate this Agreement. In addition, upon
a violation of this certification, City shall report such violation to the Office of
Corporation Counsel who may, at its discretion, debar Contractor from eligibility
for future city and/or county purchasing, bids, contracts, and/or projects.
5.28 Method of Payment. Contractor shall accept invoice payments via City/County
check, City/County Purchasing Card (Master Card) or Automated Clearing House
(ACH) at the City’s sole option and discretion. The City will not be responsible for
any card fees or other bank charges incurred by the Contractor.
5.29 Ban the Box. Contractor acknowledges Sections 670-102 to 670-108 of the
Revised Code of the Consolidated City of Indianapolis and Marion County and will

adverse determination. If an adverse decision is rendered against the Contractor
with respect to services provided to the City, the City may terminate this
Agreement, reduce the incentives or subsidies to be provided under this
Agreement, or seek other remedies. Contractor shall provide a sworn statement
on whether the Contractor had any adverse determinations rendered against the
Contractor within the preceding three (3) years.
