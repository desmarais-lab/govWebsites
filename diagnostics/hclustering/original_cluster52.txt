for their protection and the City

agree with the findings from Northcutt and called the State Building Commission The
State reviewed the issue and agreed with Northcutt Councilman Siekman stated he just
wants the City to be of assistance to developers and not cause problems Utility
Superintendent Trey Clifton stated when the State gets involved in the process we lose
local control The Utility Service Board policy states before we can energize service to
any customer the Building Inspector must green tag or approve this service He further
stated we would have to pay someone else to do this if this was not done by the Building
Inspector and possibly be of more cost to the developer or resident Councilman Siekman

of animal waste

After review of the law I believe that Indiana State law is silent on the subject of animal waste unless it
is to be considered generally as Refuse If so the police may choose to ticket as a littering infraction
The

following Code Section

covers

littering

Littering a Class 8 infraction littering as a Class A infraction when certain bodies of water
involved refuse defined littering from a moving vehicle
Sec 2 a A person who recklessly knowingly or intentionally places or leaves refuse on property
another
of
person except in a container provided for refuse commits littering a Class 8 infraction
the
However
offense is a Class A infraction if the refuse is placed or left in on or within one hundred
100 feet of a body of water that is under the jurisdiction of the
1 department of natural resources or
2 United States Army Corps of Engineers
Notwithstanding IC 34
a a judgment of not more than one thousand dollars 1

000 shall be

under
this
section
imposed for
infraction
IC 35
2
3
45

b Refuse includes solid and semisolid wastes dead animals and offal
c Evidence that littering was committed from a moving vehicle other than a public conveyance
constitutes prima facie evidence that it was committed by the operator of that vehicle
The Indiana Codes

provides for fines of up

to

000 for Class
1

B

infractions and

up to

000
5

for Class A

infractions In court infractions do not carry the possibility of prison sentences However guilt in a court
case involving infractions as opposed to violations may be determined by the fact that the infraction
more

likely

than not occurred

I also reviewed the current

of

a

challenge

In

announcing the awarding of these new grants foundation President Marianne
Wiggers stated The foundation continues to be challenged largely due to budget
constraints in being able to respond favorably to less than half of the grant applications
that it receives on a quarterly basis At the same time however RSRF was pleased to
invest at this grants meeting in two creative and financially leveraged multi
year projects
developed by both the Ohio County and Ripley County Community Foundations in
partnership with the regional Ec015 Program These two community foundations she
added have already done and will do impressive work in relation to the Ec015
Economic Opportunities by 2015 Program an innovate initiative focusing on education
and careers in advanced manufacturing heath care and hospitality
tourism in 10
counties in southeastern Indiana which has been substantially funded by Lilly
Endowment Inc in Indianapolis It is a good role for these two foundations both of
which RSRF assisted in creating and developing in the late 1990
s
The

Rising Sun Regional Foundation was created in 1994 by the City of Rising Sun in
conjunction with the development of the Grand Victoria Casino and Resort by the Hyatt
Corporation The foundation began its grantmaking program in early 1997 after the
Grand Victoria Casino opened for business in September 1996 The Grand Victoria
makes monthly contributions to the foundation based on a percentage of its adjusted
gross

revenue

Dear Kevin

meeting on March 23 2011 the Board of Directors of the Rising Sun Regional
Foundation Inc RSRF declined to approve a grant to the Rising Sun Volunteer Fire
out gear
Department toward the purchase of 35 sets of turn

At its

s legal counsel
After very thorough research by RSRF and an opinion by the foundation
it was unanimously determined by the RSRF board that the supposedly mandated
personal equipment requirements for regional volunteer fire departments issued by a
number of

governmental agencies

with

supposed related liability issues

are

somewhat

dubious and unclear and therefore RSRF has chosen not to award grants in the future
for this purpose to any of the volunteer fire departments in its grantmaking region
RSRF further believes that your insurer should be sensitive and knowledgeable as to
what is necessary for insurability even if you are unable to technically meet certain
recommended standards RSRF prefers these mandated requirements be resolved

in

of the designed precast panels on metal framing I have attached

a detail of the
push slab design The concrete would be cast on metal deck and pushed as one complete
our

unit into the water This method of construction will eliminate lead times for the precast and steel
fabrications and barring extreme weather flood conditions would greatly increase our probability of
h substantial completion The change in design will also provide the city with a

We have reviewed the change order from Maxwell Construction for the push slab
option and
have these comments

The credit of 10

larger increase in savings
The credit for deducting the geofabric under water of 5
600 is reasonable

Their detail section of the slab calls for 4

state 5
0 at 12 ew and the letter addressed to you dated November 18 2011 states 5
s both
ways This needs to be clarified by Maxwell and the final design drawings stamped by a
structural PE

We would like to have a written statement from Maxwell
outlining their
if
the
slab is poured but the weather keeps them from pushing it in place and
contingency plan
or if the slab is not able to be pushed into
place for whatever reason

The concept of a push slab makes sense in the fact that it saves time for the project
the work to be done before winter sets in and the fish spawning season occurs We
recommend the chhnge order deduct be approved

Rising

Sun

Foundation
Fact Sheet

When and

why was

the

Rising

Sun

Regional Foundation

created

The

Rising Sun Regional Foundation RSRF was created in 1996 to carry out the
commitment by
City of Rising Sun and Ohio County to share the windfall of the Grand Victoria Casino
riverboat
development with other residents of southeastern Indiana The foundation makes
in the
grants
areas of education historic
preservation scientific recreational economic development or other
public purposes with special emphasis on covering the local share of
any state or federal grant
programs for municipalities counties and schools within its
grantmaking region which presently
encompasses Ohio County Ripley County and City of Aurora
the

The foundation

began

its

making
grant

program in late 1996 after the Grand Victoria Casino

opened for business in September of that year The Grand Victoria makes
monthly contributions
to the foundation based on a
percentage of its Adjusted Gross Revenue
How does RSRF expend its income from the Grand
Victoria Casino
25 of RSRF
s annual gross income is placed in a Permanent Reserve
Fund to build up an
endowment balance for future grant
making purposes As of June 30 2007 the balance was
almost 10 million Currently the Board of Directors is
allowing this fund to grow with monthly
contributions and a reinvestment of its income It is
expected that the fund will someday provide
income for future grant
making by RSRF especially if the revenue from Grand Victoria is reduced
or ends
No more than 10 of RSRF
s annual gross revenues may be expended for the
administration of
the foundation The
s annual gross revenues is to be
remaining balance of RSRF
expended for
direct grant
making purposes in its grant
making region consisting of Ohio County Ripley County
and the City of Aurora

RSRF making
Why does s
grant region include Ripley County
The idea of

sharing outside the boundaries of Ohio County was adopted by the Rising Sun
City
Council the Ohio County Commissioners and the Ohio County Council in
May 1994 to address the
perceived reluctance of the Indiana Gaming Commission IGC to
grant Rising Sun a Certificate of
Suitability for a riverboat casino license because the area of economic
e Ohio
development i
County was not sufficiently large enough to justify a license The intent of the riverboat casino
legislation was to promote tourism and economic development To gain the
license the revenue
sharing plan was developed and the commitment to create a regional foundation was
adopted Many believe this concept of sharing the economic benefit of the riverboat
casino outside Ohio County was crucial in the final
analysis and led to Rising Sun successfully
receiving the nod from the IGC for the Certificate of Suitability
s grant
Why does RSRF
making region include the City

The

of Aurora

City of Aurora was included in RSRF
s grant
making region in its original Articles of
Incorporation that also included Switzerland County and other unincorporated towns in Dearborn
County When the City of Lawrenceburg and Switzerland County became dock sites for their own
riverboat casinos RSRF reduced its
making region in 1999 exclusively to Ohio County
grant
Ripley County and the City of Aurora RSRF continued to include the
City of Aurora in its grant
making region following the example set by Rising Sun City Council and Ohio
County Council who
also continued to include the
City of Aurora in their respective revenue sharing programs

Why do Ohio County
Rising Sun units of government educational institutions and
nonprofit organizations receive less RSRF grants funds than those in
Ripley County
Ohio

County has a population of approximately 5
800 residents with one municipality and one
school system Ripley County
by contrast has a population of approximately 27
700 residents
with seven municipalities and four school
systems plus a half dozen parochial schools Ohio
County has some 140 miles of county highways to maintain Ripley
County has 720 miles The
sheer difference in size of the two counties in
population and other characteristics causes a
greater number of needs to be addressed in Ripley
County and thus a greater number of grant
applications received by RSRF from Ripley County organizations The
population of Rising
Ohio County is approximately 15 of the current
Sun
making region whereas Rising
grant
Ohio County from year 2000 through mid 2007 received
Sun
approximately 37 of the total
money granted even without the inclusion of undetermined benefits from
grants made on a
regional basis The Year 2000 was the first year
the current

reflecting

How do other sources of

Generally

funding impact

making region
grant

RSRF grant decisions

the RSRF Board of Directors
gives

secondary consideration to the applicant
s
alternatives although leveraging of funds is highly encouraged There are a
number of potential RSRF grantees in its
making region that have obvious other revenue
grant
sources For example the
City of Batesville has the Hillenbrand Foundation Versailles has the
Tyson Fund Osgood has the Reynolds Foundation Rising Sun receives direct
riverboat gaming
revenues from the
State Ohio County receives riverboat revenues from the State and from
Rising
Sun and Aurora receives riverboat revenue sharing from the City of
Sun
Lawrenceburg
Rising
and Ohio County While these other
potential resources are certainly not ignored they are
considered within the
financial

resource

context of

an

evaluation process which is intended to determine

a

grant

application on its individual merits The board however recognizes that there are
grant
applicants from time to time that have no alternative resources to look to and makes
grant
decisions accordingly

What is RSRF
s

There is

a

grant awards that

on

the surface appear to be

making history
grant

From late 1996 through mid
2007 RSRF has received a total of almost 30 million in income from
the Grand Victoria Casino Of that
amount the foundation has set aside 25 into its Permanent
Reserve Fund for future
making which now has a market value of nearly 10 million The
grant
foundation has awarded some 840 direct
grants totaling almost 20 million or 67 of its total
income to governmental educational and nonprofit organizations in its
grant making region
This amount of grants was made in
response to approximately 33
7 million in total grant

requests

The foundation calculates that this
million in other government

region or
funding

an

20 million

in grants has assisted in
leveraging some 232
and
foundation
personal contributions to these 840 projects in the
equivalent of approximately 12 in total project
of RSRF
funding for

every 1

grant

Over its

year history the foundation has expended an average of 7 of its total annual
ten
income vs 10 allowed to
implement its comprehensive grants program and for administrative
and related costs
What will s
RSRF future grants program look like
RSRF is

continuously in the process of reviewing its grants program in
ways for the foundation to more effectively serve the residents of its

looking at new and creative
making region
grant
especially in light of a number of initial needs that seem to have
essentially been met and of other
evolving priorities As part of this process RSRF will also challenge and work with
potential grant
applicants to assist them to plan how they too can better serve their
respective constituents by
preparing thoughtful creative and comprehensive grant applications to which the
foundation can
respond

DRAFT
MINUTES OF THE REGULAR COMMON COUNCIL MEETING
OF MAY 1, 2017

Present:

Council President Brian Dickerson
Council Members Dwight Fish, Mary Olson, Richard Shively, Adam Bujalski,
David Henke, Pam Kurpgeweit, Brian Thomas and Brent Curry
(All council members were present.)

Council President Brian Dickerson called the meeting to order at 7:00 p.m. in the Council
Chambers at City Hall, 229 S. Second Street, in Elkhart.
Councilman Adam Bujalski led the assembly in the Pledge of Allegiance.
President Dickerson asked for a moment of silent reflection.
The clerk called the roll.
President Dickerson said the council needs to amend the agenda to add two resolutions:

Minutes for Approval
Memorandum of April 17, 2017 Vibrant Communities Initiative Presentation
Minutes of April 17, 2017 City Council Meeting
Councilman Henke, seconded by Councilwoman Olson, moved to approve the minutes,
and the motion carried unanimously by voice vote.

Presentations and Introductions
Terry Mark, with the Convention & Visitors’ Bureau of Elkhart County, gave the
bureau’s annual presentation to the council regarding the Quilt Gardens Tour. He said this year
is the 10th anniversary of the Quilt Gardens Tour, and it is being celebrated with a display of
sculptures by American artist Seward Johnson that will be placed at the quilt gardens and other
downtown locations all over Elkhart County. Mr. Mark said the highlight of the display will be a
25-foot tall monumental sculpture at Central Park, which will be installed on May 22, and he
invited everyone to come out to watch the installation and see the quilt gardens and Seward
Johnson sculptures. He said the Quilt Gardens have a global reputation with visitors from all
over the world, and this summer visitors will be coming from England, Australia, Japan and
1

Germany. Mr. Mark said studies show that visitors for the Quilt Gardens Tour account for a
minimum of $332 million in direct spending in Elkhart County; and the Quilt Gardens would not
be possible without the Convention & Visitors’ Bureau’s partnerships including the City of
Elkhart.

UNFINISHED BUSINESS
Reports of Council Committees
Councilman Henke, Finance Committee Chairman, reported that the Finance Committee
met just prior to this council meeting regarding Proposed Ordinance 17-O-37, appropriating
$38,500.00 from the General Fund (to repair the Riverwalk fountain), and voted unanimously,
3 to 0, to return the proposed ordinance to the full council with a do pass recommendation.

Ordinances on Second-Third Reading
Proposed Ordinance 17-O-38
AN ORDINANCE DE-APPROPRIATING FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS
($5,000.00) FROM THE AMOUNT APPROPRIATED FROM THE GENERAL
FUND BY ORDINANCE NO. 5530 FOR PERSONNEL SERVICES OF THE
PLANNING DEPARTMENT; AND APPROPRIATING FIVE THOUSAND
DOLLARS ($5,000.00) FROM THE GENERAL FUND FOR PERSONNEL
SERVICES OF THE BUILDING DEPARTMENT
(to train two new code enforcement officers)
The clerk read proposed ordinance 17-O-38 by title only. Councilman Henke, seconded
by Councilman Bujalski moved to pass the proposed ordinance on second reading, and
President Dickerson opened the floor for council discussion.
Councilman Fish asked if the two new code enforcement officers have been hired yet.
Crystal Welsh, Director of Community & Redevelopment, said she has made offers to two
current City employees, and she believes they have both accepted. She explained that if the
council approves this appropriation the new code enforcement officers will have 10 days to work
with the current officers who are retiring. She said training for code enforcement officers over
the past 17 years has left a lot to be desired, and it is her intent to upgrade the professionalism of
that department, and she is asking for this additional money to train the new officers.
Discussion followed about code enforcement in general, training for all code enforcement
officers, and current building and code enforcement procedures and planned changes thereto
with technology upgrades to help streamline the processes.

Councilman Bujalski asked what the starting salaries will be for the new officers. Ms.
Welsh said all code enforcement officers are paid the same, and the new officers will be starting
at $56,000, too. She said both of the new officers have housing experience and experience with
City ordinances and reading and interpreting other State and Federal regulations, and they are the
most prepared for code enforcement the department has ever had; but they need training on the
process. Councilwoman Kurpgeweit said most jobs have a 90-day probationary period, and the
new code enforcement officers should be paid a lower salary until they prove their capabilities.
Councilman Henke said he, too, is disappointed that they will start out at the maximum salary,
which is above that of a starting police officer. He said we have all enforced something, but that
doesn’t make us code enforcement officers. Councilman Curry said Code Enforcement has big
issues, and we do need to step it up a bit; and the City should better inform and educate its
citizens about the different City codes.
Following council discussion, President Dickerson opened the floor for public hearing.
Diana Graham, 903 W. Lusher, said she and her husband live on one of the City’s “main
drags,” and they don’t get away with anything regarding code enforcement. She said we all
could help beautify the city and our surroundings; and she suggested finding nurseries that would
donate flowers and shrubs, and using volunteers and giving summer jobs to underprivileged kids
to clean up the neighborhoods and plant flowers and shrubbery to give the City a better image.
She said when the City looks better, we all look better, and it will make us all better people.
Following public hearing, President Dickerson returned discussion to the council.
Councilwoman Kurpgeweit agreed with Councilman Curry about letting the public know
about the different City ordinances that must be followed, and she suggested putting such
information on the water bills that go out every month.
Following council discussion, President Dickerson called for the vote on the passage of
the proposed ordinance on second reading, and the vote was as follows: Ayes: Fish, Olson,
Shively, Bujalski, Kurpgeweit and Curry. Nays: Henke, Thomas and Dickerson. The clerk read
the proposed ordinance on third reading by title only. Councilwoman Olson, seconded by
Councilman Curry, moved to pass the ordinance on third reading, and the vote was as
follows: Ayes: Fish, Olson, Kurpgeweit and Curry. Nays: Shively, Bujalski, Henke, Thomas and
Dickerson. The motion failed, 4 to 5, and the ordinance was defeated.

The clerk read the proposed ordinance by title only. President Dickerson said Holladay
Corporation is asking to withdraw this proposed ordinance, but Councilman Henke said he
would like to take a complete vote to officially vote it down; and he asked Vlado Vranjes,
Corporation Counsel for the City, if the council can legally vote on the ordinance. Mr. Vranjes
said most times the council moves to pass an ordinance on second reading and votes it up or
down, but the council can instead reject the proposed ordinance if it so chooses. Councilman
Thomas, seconded by Councilwoman Olson, moved to remove the proposed ordinance from
the council’s agenda, and President Dickerson called for the vote on the motion; and the vote
was as follows: Ayes: Thomas and Curry. Nays: Fish, Olson, Shively, Bujalski, Henke,
Kurpgeweit and Dickerson. The motion failed, 2 to 7.
Thereupon, Councilman Henke, seconded by Councilman Bujalski, moved to reject the
proposed ordinance on second reading, and President Dickerson opened the floor for
discussion on the motion. There was no council discussion, and President Dickerson opened the
floor for public comments; and there being none, he returned discussion to the council.
Councilman Curry said this was a big project with too much discussion about it to reject
it without explanation. President Dickerson said that rejection of the proposed ordinance by the
council prevents the petitioner from coming back with the same or similar proposal for one year,
but they could introduce a new ordinance for a significantly-changed proposal.
Following discussion, President Dickerson called for the vote on the motion to reject the
proposed ordinance on second reading, and the vote was as follows: Ayes: Fish, Olson, Shively,
Bujalski, Henke, Kurpgeweit, Thomas, Curry and Dickerson. Nays: None. The motion carried
unanimously, 9 to 0, and the proposed ordinance was rejected.

President Dickerson opened the floor for council discussion.
There was no council discussion, and President Dickerson opened the floor for public
hearing; and there being no comments from the public, he returned discussion to the council.
Councilman Henke asked if there have been any significant changes to the plan or new
information since it was last presented to the council. President Dickerson said the petitioner
requested another drive, and he asked if that could be added without having to go back to
4

Planning; and Mr. Vranjes said it has to go back to the Plan Commission first, but there are no
substantial changes at this time.
Following discussion, President Dickerson called for the vote on the passage of the
proposed ordinance on second reading, and the vote was as follows: Ayes: Fish, Olson, Shively,

The clerk read the proposed ordinance by title only. President Dickerson said the council
needs to table the proposed ordinance until the May 15 council meeting to allow for the statutory
requirements for publication of notice of public hearing. Councilwoman Olson, seconded by

unanimously by voice vote.

Ordinance #5580

DOLLARS ($15,000.00) FROM THE GENERAL FUND

The clerk read proposed ordinance 17-O-42 by title only. Councilwoman Olson,
seconded by Councilman Henke moved to pass the proposed ordinance on second reading,
and President Dickerson opened the floor for council discussion.
Councilman Henke asked if this assistance will include current auditing or if it will just
be day-to-day stuff. Jamie Arce, Interim City Controller, said the agreement is specific to
providing day-to-day stuff and as we bring on a new controller to provide insight into the City’s
processes and where we are at; but he will reach out to Umbaugh and ask about the scope of
what all they will do and about auditing.

5

Following council discussion, President Dickerson opened the floor for public hearing,
and there being no comments from the public, he returned discussion to the council.
Councilman Fish said he sees a time gap opening up, and he asked if the City’s financials
are getting to a critical point. Mayor Timothy Neese said Mr. Arce is doing a good job, but
things are reaching the critical point. He added that he has hired a new City Controller, who will
start work on May 8, but he would have been using Umbaugh & Associates anyway because of
the expertise they bring to us.
Following council discussion, and President Dickerson called for the vote on the passage
of the proposed ordinance on second reading; and the vote was as follows: Ayes: Fish, Olson,
Shively, Bujalski, Henke, Kurpgeweit, Thomas, Curry and Dickerson. Nays: None. The clerk

representative present from Alpha Systems, LLC, and he would like to amend the agenda to do
Proposed Resolutions No. 17-R-08 and 17-R-09 at this time. Thereupon, Councilman Henke,
seconded by Councilman Curry, moved to amend the agenda to do Proposed Resolutions No.
17-R-08 and 17-R-09 at this time, and the motion carried unanimously by voice vote.

Resolution #R-08-17
A RESOLUTION OF THE COMMON COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF ELKHART,
INDIANA, CONFIRMING RESOLUTION NO. R-06-17, WHICH DECLARED A
CERTAIN AREA IN THE CITY OF ELKHART TO BE AN ECONOMIC
REVITALIZATION AREA FOR THE PURPOSE OF GRANTING TAX PHASE-IN
BENEFITS TO ALPHA SYSTEMS, LLC AND DVS, LLC
(property located at 5120 Beck Drive)
The clerk read proposed resolution 17-R-08 by title only. Councilman Fish, seconded by
Councilman Henke, moved to adopt the proposed resolution, and President Dickerson opened
the floor for council discussion. There was no council discussion, and President Dickerson
opened the floor for public comments.
Chris Stager, with Economic Development Corporation of Elkhart County, said the
Economic Development Corporation supports this tax abatement.
Abby Wiles, Assistant Director of Community Economic & Redevelopment, said this is
for 5-year personal property and real property tax abatements. She said with an Economic
Revitalization Area expiration date of December 31, 2019, which is the date the company would
6

need to purchase the equipment into use and make the real property improvements, and this
confirming resolution also spells out the deduction schedule that was shown in the declaratory
resolution; but the council needs to provide guidance on the deduction limit, which she has
spoken with Councilman Henke about. She said some of the council’s past tax abatement
approvals set a maximum deduction limit on personal and real property while others didn’t, and
she would like to know if the council wants to limit the deduction beyond what the company is
committing to on the SB-1’s. President Dickerson said the council has never spoken to that
before, and Mr. Vranjes said it will require a vote by the council.
Following public hearing, President Dickerson returned discussion to the council.
Councilman Fish revised his motion to adopt the proposed resolution to include “no
deduction limit to Alpha Systems LLC’s and DVS, LLC’s abatement to their personal and
real property investments,” and Councilman Henke seconded the revised motion.
Following discussion, President Dickerson called for the vote on the adoption the
resolution with no deduction limit on the personal and real property investment, and the vote was

Dickerson. Nays: None. The motion carried unanimously, 9 to 0, and the resolution was

Ordinance #5581
AN ORDINANCE APPROPRIATING EIGHTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED
FIFTY-SIX DOLLARS ($18,556.00) FROM THE GENERAL FUND
(to replace coils in HVAC units on roof of Elkhart Police Station that were damaged by hail)
The clerk read proposed ordinance 17-O-43 by title only. Councilwoman Olson,
seconded by Councilman Henke, moved to pass the proposed ordinance on second reading,
and President Dickerson opened the floor for council discussion.
Councilman Curry noticed that the bid received was good for 30 days, but it has been
more than that so he hopes that bid is still good and the price doesn’t increase. Police Chief Ed
Windbigler said it is good because they have already fixed the damage with money in the Police
Department’s budget, but that left them with no more money to maintain the building for the rest
of the year, which is why he is requesting this appropriation.
President Dickerson said on occasions when an emergency fix is made, it would be good
to advise the council of the circumstances.
Following council discussion, President Dickerson opened the floor for public hearing.
There were no comments from the public, and President Dickerson returned discussion to the
council; and there being no further council discussion, he called for the vote on the passage of
the proposed ordinance on second reading; and the vote was as follows: Ayes: Fish, Olson,
Shively, Bujalski, Henke, Kurpgeweit, Thomas, Curry and Dickerson. Nays: None. The clerk
read the proposed ordinance on third reading by title only. Councilman Henke, seconded by
Councilman Bujalski, moved to pass the ordinance on third reading, and the vote was as

Dickerson. Nays: None. The motion carried unanimously, 9 to 0, and the ordinance was
passed.

Ordinance #5582
AN ORDINANCE APPROPRIATING FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS
($50,000.00) FROM THE GREAT ELKHART FUND
(for analysis & feasibility study for a new combined public safety complex)
The clerk read proposed ordinance 17-O-44 by title only. Councilwoman Olson,
seconded by Councilman Curry, moved to pass the proposed ordinance on second reading,
and President Dickerson opened the floor for council discussion.
Councilman Thomas asked who will be doing the study. Mayor Neese said it will be
American Structure Point, and the site analysis among other aspects will include crime,
environmental issues, access and population base because it is very critical to find the best
location for Police, Fire, Communications and Emergency Management. He said American
8

Structure Point will literally interview people within the first-responding entities as well as
business owners and residents in the neighborhoods of possible sites.
Councilman Henke said his concern is about cash flow because the City has several big
projects coming up including the River District, CSO and a new fire station, and an economic
slowdown is projects for 2018. He said he would like to look at cash flow and the City’s ability
to fund with cash or use an already open bond, and this needs to be timed out so the money will
be flowing by that time.
Mayor Neese added that this study is just the initial phase of the project, and it does not
guarantee that American Structure Point will get the bid.
President Dickerson said he wants the council to make an informed decision on this, and
he strongly encouraged council members to tour the Police Department and Communications
Center buildings to see firsthand that they are not in a “livable” condition and the departments
have outgrown their facilities.
Following council discussion, President Dickerson opened the floor for public hearing.
Hugh Williams, Elkhart resident, said he is curious to know if other studies or surveys
have been done and, if so, the findings of those studies and surveys.
Following public hearing, President Dickerson returned discussion to the council.
Councilman Henke said he will support this ordinance because more information is
needed about where to locate the facility and how big is needs to be.
Councilwoman Kurpgeweit agreed that bigger and better accommodations are needed,
but putting all the first-responder departments into one huge complex may create a need for a
substation somewhere else. She added that the finances for such a project have to be watched
carefully, especially if an economic slowdown is coming.
President Dickerson said he has found that often times in the law enforcement industry,
police officers walking the streets in the community builds relationships.
Following discussion, and President Dickerson called for the vote on the passage of the
proposed ordinance on second reading; and the vote was as follows: Ayes: Fish, Olson, Shively,
Bujalski, Henke, Kurpgeweit, Thomas, Curry and Dickerson. Nays: None. The clerk read the
proposed ordinance on third reading by title only. Councilman Henke, seconded by Councilman
Bujalski, moved to pass the ordinance on third reading, and the vote was as follows: Ayes:
Fish, Olson, Shively, Bujalski, Henke, Kurpgeweit, Thomas, Curry and Dickerson. Nays: None.
The motion carried unanimously, 9 to 0, and the ordinance was passed.

seconded by Councilman Curry, moved to pass the proposed ordinance on second reading,
and President Dickerson opened the floor for council discussion.
Councilman Henke asked what specifically is being renovated. Dave Pixey, Airport
Manager, said that this appropriation, like that of the Police Department above, is actually the
balance of the funding the council approved last year but was unspent at the end of 2016 and not
carried over to 2017. He said he has already paid for the hangar renovations from a different
fund, and this appropriation will replenish that fund. He said the project is still ongoing, and it
will pay for itself. Mr. Pixey said the hangar is presently being resided, and it will look very,
very nice when completed.
Councilwoman Kurpgeweit said Mr. Pixey has been very diligent with the dollars and has
been very open and transparent, for which she commended him.
Following council discussion, President Dickerson opened the floor for public hearing,
and there being no comments from the public, he returned discussion to the council. There was
no further council discussion, and President Dickerson called for the vote on the passage of the

Resolutions
Proposed Resolution 17-R-11
A RESOLUTION OF THE COMMON COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF ELKHART,
INDIANA, APPROVING THE APPLICATION FOR COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT
BLOCK GRANT FUNDS AND RECOMMENDING SUBMISSION OF THE
APPLICATION BY THE MAYOR FOR APPROVAL
The clerk read proposed resolution 17-R-11 by title only. Councilman Fish, seconded by
Councilman Curry, moved to adopt the proposed resolution, and President Dickerson opened
the floor for council discussion.
Referring to additional documentation presented to the council just before the meeting,
Councilman Thomas said he does not like getting information just prior to the council’s voting
on something.
14

Ms. Wiles said the budget is actually in the annual action plan, but before the meeting
this evening, Ms. Welsh advised her that the council likes to see the 2016 numbers next to the
2017 numbers, which is what she gave the council just before the meeting.
Councilman Henke said he is not a proponent of the Community Development Block
Grant (“CDBG”), and the City’s history has been continued devaluation of assessed valuations
and property tax decline of the very area that most of the CDBG is going to, which continues to
be the most undesirable part of the City and the part the requires the most City services. He
asked if the Department of Development Services tracks the dollars from year to year and if they
ever look to see if recipients have uncorrected code enforcement violations.
Ms. Welsh said in order to apply for owner-occupied renovation money, property owners
cannot have any outstanding code enforcement issues so they either have no violations or the
department is working directly with the owners to remedy code issues, and she does ask for
referrals from the code enforcement officers for eligible owner-occupied properties. She said the
owner-occupied rehab program is designed to stabilize home ownership in the near downtown
areas and to try to maintain a high level of ownership. Ms. Welsh said there is a “home
ownership zone” in south central Elkhart that has close to 70% home ownership as opposed to
other neighborhoods. She said if you look at the 2010 to 2015 Neighborhood Revitalization
Strategy Area map (“NRSA”) and compare it to the 2015 to 2020 map, you will see that a large
section of south central Elkhart fell out of the NRSA, which is proof that the income level in that
neighborhood increased to the point that it is no longer eligible so, yes, the CDBG is make a
huge impact. She said the other project that has been very successful is the public facilities
project where the City hires a crew, in coordination with the Street Department, for on-the-job
training to put sidewalks in lower-income neighborhoods, and those workers have to be income
qualified to take the job, which is a prime example of how CDBG funds should be spent. She
said to be eligible for assistance, most first-time buyers are required to participate in an
educational program so it is critical that the City have a viable and certified housing education
provider on staff, which is the Human Relations Department Manager, Traci Dawson. Ms.
Welsh said she thinks the market has turned around, and home ownership is viable in Elkhart.
Discussion followed regarding the CDBG budget, who and what is paid out of the budget
and projects. President Dickerson asked about the home on State Street that the City has
invested a lot of money in. Ms. Welsh said just over $100,000 of NSP funds have been spent to
renovate 229 State Street, which is why it has been put on the market, and the hope is to rent it to
spur other projects. President Dickerson said he does not believe the City should be in the
business of renovating homes and renting them out.
Councilman Fish asked, for the record, about the percentage of rental home in Elkhart,
and Ms. Welsh said that according to Census information she has it is 49%. Councilman Fish
said that is significantly lower than what Councilman Henke has stated, and he said Councilman
Henke would have a better understanding if he drove through his neighborhood to see what
CDBG and NSP dollars have done. Ms. Welsh said each year in September she provides the
council with a full report under CAPER before sending it to the Federal government.

15

Councilwoman Olson said it appears that the council needs more information before
acting on this resolution, and she asked President Dickerson to place the proposed resolution in
the Finance Committee. Ms. Welsh said the application has to be submitted to HUD prior to
May 15, and in 17 years, the council has never sent the resolution to committee; and if she had
anticipated a problem, she would have brought it to the council earlier.
Following council discussion, President Dickerson placed the proposed resolution in
the Finance Committee.

Vacation Hearings
There were no vacation hearings.

Other New Business
Councilman Bujalski said he has previously asked about how many Street Department
vehicles are out of commission because he is receiving phone calls from residents asking if and
when the City is going to do tree and shrubbery maintenance and he knows that the department is
down to one truck City-wide; and he asked that council members receive that information so
they can stay on top of the situation. Mike Lightner, Buildings & Grounds Department Manager,
Buildings & Grounds does that maintenance, not the Street Department. He said he would have
to call Central Garage to find out what the problem is, but he knows that there was a wrong part
received to fix one of the new diesel motors.
President Dickerson said the council should expect a serious increase in requests for
appropriations from Central Garage because the EPA has mandated a new type of exhaust
system that emits fewer particles than it takes in, and the cost to replace the exhaust on his own
truck was $8,000. He said that is simply part of the cost of doing business.
Councilman Fish said he received several calls from constituents regarding the landfill
fire, and he asked how the fire affected the City. John Faigh, Emergency Management Director,
said he wasn’t notified until 10:00 a.m., and they requested his services for traffic only. He said
the way the situation was handled could have been better. He said Fire Chief Carey, Assistant
Fire Chief Kamp, Hazmat Team Coordinator Chaz Taylor and Assistant Fire Chief Sommer were
notified earlier; and they responded immediately. Mr. Faigh said the EPA was present from the
beginning and took samples throughout the City in the line of the plume, and they were under
standards for any immediate hazards; but they did advise to shelter in place while they continued
to monitor the situation. He said he is taking steps now to insure that the City is not caught off
guard again and will be prepared the next time. He said Mayor Neese did speak with Waste
Management people, but they did not keep the City apprised of matters; but they did say there
were no hazardous materials at the landfill beyond household cleaning products.

16

President Dickerson asked what time the Elkhart Fire Department was contacted, and
Chief Carey said it was after 7:00 a.m. He said after he got the call, the Elkhart Fire Department
provided full assistance including the command center, who kept him and the department in the
look regarding their monitoring of air quality throughout until Friday at Noon when EPA was
satisfied and operations were stopped.
Discussion followed about the cause of the fire, clean air standards and reimbursement to
the City for the services it provided to the County during the landfill fire. Councilman Henke
said since the fire was outside the City’s jurisdiction, he sent a message to the administration to
hammer down on recouping the City’s expenses during the incident. President Dickerson said it
is no secret that Earth Movers failed to cover their trash for a long time, and Chief Carey said if
dirt had been on top of that trash it would have hindered its ability to burn.
Councilman Shively asked for an update on the purchase of a new hazmat vehicle. Chief
Carey said it has not been ordered yet because it has not been finalized for specification, and
there is still the possibility of a Federal grant to cover it. He said on Councilman Henke’s
suggestion, he did visit some local RV manufacturers and learn that one could meet the
standards, but last week he received notification that the company was no longer building those
kinds of vehicles. He said it is a process, and he has been cautioned to take its time and include
third-party inspections during the construction of the hazmat vehicle to get it right this time; and
hopefully we will hear something about the grant soon.
Councilwoman Kurpgeweit reported that last Saturday Lippert Components and over 700
volunteers helped clean five City parks. She said everybody pitched in, and it went well; and
Lippert is now talking about adopting one to three parks to keep clean. She said they are
planning another such event for the end of May and then two more for beautification and
planting. Councilwoman Kurpgeweit said this is a great opportunity for the community to get
together, roll up our sleeves and beautify our City parks.
President Dickerson noted for the record that Councilman Thomas has left the meeting.

Reports of the Mayor, Board of Works, Board of Safety or City Department Heads
There were no reports.

Neighborhood Association Reports
Councilman Curry said the Pierre Moran Neighborhood Association will meet this
Sunday, May 7, at 5:00 p.m., at the Pierre Moran Park Pavilion.

17

Privilege of the Floor
Ms. Graham, on behalf of Shalom Peace Center, spoke about the problems she is having
obtaining a 1-day, $5 million liability insurance policy that is required to hold a public event in
City parks. She said she knows the council can only listen, but she hopes that someone will
check into this and make it fair for everyone across the board. President Dickerson suggested
that Ms. Graham talk to Councilwoman Kurpgeweit, the council’s liaison to the Parks Board,
after the council meeting.

Scheduling of Committee Meetings
There were no committee meetings scheduled.
