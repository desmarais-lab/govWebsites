The contract is in proper legal form and is sufficient to adequately protect the interests of the City of
Gary.
The Law Department did not negotiate said contract and therefore makes no comment on the terms
contained therein. The Law Department does not monitor the performance of the contractor.
Effective as of January 30, 2013. It’s for one year, until January 2014. And the amount is not to exceed
$32,000.00.
I move that we approve the contract contingent upon the QC 40 being provided.
C. Green: Second. It’s been moved and properly second. Are there any comments/ questions?
N. Allen: No, but I do want to make one explanation. I asked a question prior to the meeting or during
the meeting before we got to this- about why QScend Technologies was selected at $32K over Respond
at $28K. And I wanted to point out that they were selected because of services that they offered that
were not offered by the other company; including the ability for employees to use a smart phone
application on their iphone as it relates to service requests. And then also field responder applications
was another application that wasn’t a part of the lower bid. So it wasn’t the most responsive. And what
about the online services?
C. LaBroi: They have that but that’s it.
N. Allen: So they didn’t have the field responder application and the smart phone application
which were two of the things that were important to the IT Department.
C. Green: Any other questions or comments? All those in favor signify by the sound of aye.
2 Ayes
0 Nays

C. Green: Madame Director, do you anything you would like to add?
C. LaBroi: Yes, I want to add the Memorandum of Understanding between the City of Gary and the
Gary Public Transportation Center (GPTC) and this is basically just stating that we are, the City of Gary
are the owners of the building and that GPTC is the Tenant and they help to maintain the facility and this
is also for us to install ADA accessible doors at a 20% match and our portion will be $6858.00.
N. Allen: This Memorandum of Understanding was prepared by the Law Department and has been
signed off on by GPTC and I move that we approve the contract to provide the 20% match so (that) ADA
Compliant doors can be installed at the Transportation Center.
C. Green: Second. It’s been moved and properly second. Are there any comments/ questions? Hearing
none, all those in favor signify by the sound of aye.

APPROVAL OF CONTRACT‐ 3700 LINCOLN STREET
AUGUST 10, 2012

Bids were received by the Board of Public Works and Safety for the rehabilitation of 3700 Lincoln Street.
The bidders and the bid amounts are as detailed in the attached bid tabulation analysis.
While TMC Unique JV was the apparent low bidder, no documentation was presented to support that
there is actually a contractual joint venture relationship between the two contractors. Additionally, TMC
signed off as the bidder on this project and TMC is not a general contractor. Per our bid specifications,
only general contractors may bid on our work.

Accordingly, based upon our review, the following is the lowest, responsible, and responsive bidder for
the property.

JMD Construction, LLC

We are therefore recommending that he bid be awarded to this company and that a contract be

lowest bidder.

RE:
PUBLIC‐ PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT
GARY RAILWAY COMPANY
DATE: JULY 31, 2012
The Law Department has reviewed the attached Public –Private Partnership Agreement between the
Gary Railway Company (Sub‐Grantee) and the City of Gary (Grantee). The contract is for work to be
performed starting on August 1, 2012. Pursuant to the contract, the Sub‐Grantee will be paid the
amount of the actual project cost up to $606,000.00.
The contract is in proper and legal form and is sufficient to adequately protect the interest of the City of
Gary.
The Law Department did not negotiate said contract and therefore makes no comment on the terms
contained therein. The Law Department does not monitor the performance of the contractor.
Attached is the agreement.
Which is basically an agreement where the City of Gary is acting as a sponsor for the Gary Railway
Company to receive funding for a locomotive retrofit for environmental purposes in the City of Gary.
And the amount is $606,000.00. That amount will be paid through the State, through NIRPC. Not
through the City of Gary. The City of Gary is basically a sponsor to acquire the funds on behalf of the
Gary Railway Company.
I move that we approve the Public‐Private Partnership.

PROFESSIONAL SERVICES CONTRACT‐ CLYDE COMPTON
MARCH 26, 2012

The Law Department has reviewed the attached professional services contract between Clyde Compton
and the Gary Fire Commission. The agreement is to be performed between January 1, 2012 and
December 31, 2012.
The agreement is in proper legal form and is sufficient to adequately protect the interests of the City of
Gary.
The Law Department did not negotiate said contract and therefore makes no comment on the terms
contained therein.
The contractor will provide basic legal services to the City at no charge. These services will include
attending all commission meetings and representing the commission during administrative disciplinary
hearings. It will also include any of the miscellaneous work including research and drafting new rules
and regulations.
3. Compensation
…As compensation for satisfactory performance of the services set forth in Article 1 above, City agrees
to pay contractor an amount not to exceed $28,400.00 to be billed at $150/hr for litigation work to
19

include all work necessary to represent the Commission in litigation plus reimbursement for incidental
expenses advanced or incurred on behalf of the Commission as agreed upon between the Contractor
and City…
This contract basically is saying that Mr. Clyde Compton will provide his services to the commission at no
charge for Board work and for disciplinary hearings. And then that the charge will only be for litigation if
needed and that would be at $150/hr. not to exceed $28,400.00. The attachment or Exhibit A is basically
additional language that they wanted to add to the contract regarding verification of work eligibility
status and is just language that they’ve added to all of their contracts for immigration purposes.
Mr. President, I move that the contract and the attachment between the Fire Commission and Clyde
Compton be approved.

This memorandum comes as a request to formally rescind the bid award to ATA Enterprises for the
rehabilitation of Fire Station #5.
Once the contractor began the work, structural defects were discovered that make the continuation of
the work unfeasible. While the contractor stopped work immediately, no formal request to modify the
bid came to the Board. Accordingly, I am now requesting that the Board rescind the bid award to ATA
Enterprises for the rehabilitation of Fire Station No. 5.
If you have questions regarding this matter, do not hesitate to contact me.

Mr. President, there has been some work that was completed on this structure. Therefore, we cannot
rescind the contract but we will request that a modification is done to the contract and that the

IN‐AWC. BORMAN PARK WATER TREATMENT PLANT
DATE: FEBRUARY 24, 2012
Attached hereto is an email from Art Knapp, Project Superintendent of River City Construction,
requesting to close 7th Avenue from Jefferson Street to Madison Street. The duration of the closure is
approximately 3 months‐ March 1st to June 1st.
During the closure, Traffic Control will monitor the activities and will inform the emergency agencies of
impending closure. Traffic will be detoured to the adjacent street. Signage and barricades will be posted.
I respectfully request the Board of Public Works and Safety to approve this request.
Attachments:
1. Email from Art Knapp

3. Street cut permit fee
TO:
SAM SHAPIRA, CIVIL/ TRAFFIC ENGINEER
FROM: ART KNAPP, PROJECT MANAGER
DATE: FEBRUARY 22, 2012
We at River City Construction are requesting an emergency street shutdown. The location of this
request is 7th Avenue between Jefferson Street and Madison Street. We think only the east half of this
city block would need to be barricaded off, which would leave alley access to the south (there is no alley
to the north).
Construction excavation has potentially weakened the soil around three separate power poles. NIPSCO
engineering finds it necessary to brace those poles back to the street.
The street shutdown would be incorporated with our previous submitted plan at a later date.
Mr. President, I move that we approve the road closure on 7th Avenue from Jefferson to Madison Street.

REQUEST TO FILM IN GARY
FEBRUARY 23, 2012

Please be advised the S.E.C. Visuals of Chicago, Illinois is seeking to film portions of a music video for the
band O’Brother and their song entitled “LO” on Sunday, March 4, 2012. If approved by the Board of
Public Works and Safety, filming will take place at the former City Methodist Church located at 6th
Avenue and Washington Street between the hours of 5:00a.m. and 8:00p.m.
Film production will involve a crew of 20 people or less and will not impede traffic or produce any
sound, lighting, or other disturbances to the neighborhood. No street closures or special city services are
required.
Please find attached proof of insurance and a hold harmless agreement protecting the City of Gary from
any risks associated with this project. I respectfully ask that this request to film within the city limits be
placed on the Board of Public Works agenda for Wednesday, February 29, 2012.
Thank you for your consideration.

TO:
BEN CLEMENT
FROM: DAVID MUNCHAK, PRODUCER O’BROTHER LO
DATE: FEBRUARY 21, 2012
This is a letter of intent to inform you of the details of the music video for the band O’Brother and their
song entitled “LO”.
We intend to film on the grounds of the Methodist Church property located at 577 Washington Street
in Gary, IN. Filming will take place on Sunday, March 4, 2012. Our time on the premises would begin at
5am and will continue to no later than 8pm. We will have a crew consisting of approximately 15
individuals but could reach up to 20 people.
Here is the synopsis of the video. The video will follow a trio of neighborhood youths as they spend a
lazy afternoon exploring their town. It is a town with rundown properties, trash on the streets, and
graffiti on the wall. The youths are troublemakers and they spend their day drinking openly from liquor
bottles and later breaking bottles on the street. They smoke cigarettes. They steal an old bike chained

8

up on a bike rack. They mug a man on the street for his wallet and rough him up a bit. The youths have
no respect for the world they live in, but they do take some time to play with the neighborhood dog.
They eventually come across an old church and are fascinated by it. Even though they know their
neighborhood well, it’s as though they discover the church for the first time. They decide to creep in and
explore. They eventually come across an odd‐ looking creature amongst the rubble and debris inside the
church. They are scared and fascinated, but when they approach, the creature spits out a smaller but
horrific‐ looking creature. It is an otherworldly beast but it has odd human features, like human teeth
and a small human arm. The video concludes with the youths reacting to the site of the thing. They are
at once fascinated, confused, scared. Nothing happens to the youths except for them running out of the
church.
We will spend our single day in Gary filming the youths entering and exiting the church and finding the
creature in the rubble and then reacting to it. None of the story elements or destructive actions of the
youths will be filmed on that day. Everything else will already have been filmed in Chicago.
Mr. President, I move that we approve the request to film in Gary, March 4, 2012.

N. Allen:
TO:
FROM:
RE:
DATE:

BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS AND SAFETY
BEN CLEMENT, EX. DIRECTOR
REQUEST TO FILM IN GARY
JULY 20, 2012

Please be advised that Jeremy Vranich and Chicago Rot LLC of Chicago, Illinois are seeking to shoot
portions of a feature – length film entitled “Chicago Rot “at City Methodist Church located at 6th Avenue
and Washington Street. If approved by the Board of Public Works and Safety, filming will take place over
a two day period from Sunday, July 29th until Tuesday, July 31, 2012 between the hours of 6:00am on
the 29th until 6:00 am on the 30th and then from 12:00pm until 6:00am July 31st.
Film production will involve a crew of up to 30 people. Production activity will not impede traffic or
cause any sound or lighting disturbances. No street closures or special city services are required.
Please find attached proof of insurance and a hold harmless agreement protecting the City of Gary from
any risks associated with this project. I respectfully ask that this request to film be placed on the Board
of Works agenda for Wednesday, July 25, 2012.
Enclosed ‐ Chicago Rot Letter of intent: Synopsis, Hold Harmless Agreement, and Insurance.
Synopsis
After years of rotting in Joliet, Les, a wrongfully imprisoned street legend known as the “ghoul”, is
released into a mad search through Chicago’s back alleys for the man who slaughtered his mother and
robbed him of his soul. Aided by supernatural benefactors, he must delve beneath the city into a
modern labyrinth of gutters whose tendrils have grown deep while he was gone.
What unfolds is a desperate tale of brute force tragedy set in the supernatural underworld of Chicago,
where heroes are reduced to horror shows, villains dream of their own demise, and good and evil prove
to be antiquated concepts.
Madame Vice‐ President, I move that we approve the request to film Chicago Rot at City Methodist
Church.
C. Green: Second. It’s been moved and properly second. Are there any comments/ questions? All those

OF REVISED BRIDGE TRANSFER
SEPTEMBER 4, 2013

The Board of Public Works and Safety approved a bridge transfer from the Gary/ Chicago International
Airport on March 27, 2013 to the City and Lake County. That document needs to be rescinded because
revisions needed to be made because a bond had to be secured from the contractor relating to the
bridge and Lake County wanted additional revisions made to the document. The Law Department has
reviewed the revised bridge transfer. The agreement is in proper legal form and is sufficient to

adequately protect the interests of the City of Gary. The Law Department did not negotiate the terms
and therefore makes no comment of the content of those items. The Law Department will not monitor
the performance of the contract.

APPROVAL OF REVISED BRIDGE TRANSFER

I have enclosed for your review a copy of the Bridge Transfer Memorandum Agreement executed by the
Lake County Commissioners. This took substantially longer than I anticipated based on the need to
secure a bond from the contractor relating to the bridge. As you may recall, the City of Gary Board of
Public Works executed an earlier version of this agreement. At this time, I am requesting that this
version be approved by the Gary Board of Public Works and signed by the city. I will bring original
copies with me to the meeting.
On a related matter, I have still not received the signed quit-claim deeds relating to the transfer of the
school board property to the Gary Airport. I have enclosed for you review a copy of my March 7, 2013
letter. I am enclosing copies of the quit-claim deeds. I would appreciate it if this could be finalized as
well.

PERMISSION TO ADVERTISE OF PROVIDER OF MEAL SERVICE FOR
THE AT- RISK AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM

As a result of receiving the CHAMPS grant from Walmart and the National League of Cities, the Youth
Services Bureau is working with the Department of Education (DOE) to expand our Summer Food Service
Program (SFSP) to an all- year feeding program through the DOE Child and Adult Care Program (CACFP).
As part of the CACFP, we will provide meals for students after school from 3:00pm to 6pm at ten sites
across the City. This summer, we served 20,400 meals and this school year, we anticipate serving over
60,000 meals to the children of our great city.
This has created a need to advertise for a provider of Food Management Services Company.
We anticipate spending approximately $125K. All food costs are reimbursed by the DOE monthly.
If you have any comments, questions, or concerns, please contact me at 219.881.5270(O) or
